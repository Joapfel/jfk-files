In summary, it would appear 
that a couo attempt by the generals group is imninent ... and that no positiveaction by 
the USG can prevent a coup atterrpt short of infonning DIEM and NHU ... Although there 
have no requests to date by the generals for materials or financial support, we must 
anticipate that such requests may be forthcoming ••• "
