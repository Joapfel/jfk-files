Analysis of ARRB and DO Memoranda re Treatment 
of CIA Officer Names in JFK Collection 
(Prepared by Gary Breneman, 11- Feb 97) 
1. ARRB Memorandum. The Gunn memorandum sets out the 
criteria required to meet the burden under several 
situations. 
A. For officers who are still alive, Mr. Gunn 
states that the proofs required to postpone release of a 
name are three in number and all three must be met: 
' i. The officer must be living outside of the U.S. 
OR, 
(R)easonably be expected to travel outside of 
the U.S. in the foreseeable future; 
AND, 
ii. The officer is either working ... (presumably 
a current staff officer, contract employee, 
or independent contractor) ... or is retired 
under cover; 
iii. The officer objects to the release of his or 
her true name. 
COMMENTS: Mr. Gunn's criteria are a little confusing 
and may reach beyond the Board's authority.
