2. After designation as Bureau-approved po·bential security informant, fol­
lowing matters should be made clear to him: 
a. His assistance is strictly voluntary and he is to understand there is 
no coercion or intimidation involved. 
b. He is not and cannot consider himself employee or "undercover Agent 11 
of FBI. Seriousness of violating impersonation statutes must be 
impressed upon him.

he should feel he cannot maintain this confidence, he should so 
advise. There should be no doubt left in mind of potential informant 
that his relationship must remain on confidential basis and if he 
violates confidence he will be of no value and by so doing Bureau'$ 
investigative activity may be jeopardized. If he has special 
problem which would require revealing his assistance to his wife or 
other pertinent individual, this should be ascertained and appropriate 
recommendation made to Bureau. 
d. If potential informant is connected in any manner with labor u·nion, 
inform him that Bureau is not interested in employer-employee relation­
ships as such and is only concerned with obtaining information on 
infiltration of unions by subversive elements.
