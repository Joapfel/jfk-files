16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the 
most striking presentation duripg the Friday morning session. 
Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech. 
17. • Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as 
powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The 
obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not 
found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable 
question. 
•. 18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the 
world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as 
amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has 
been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has 
thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has 
brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investig~tions 
which bring no wide response. 
19. A nation which rejects its own history is on the path to a 
totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to 
change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore 
rely upon hypothesis. The history of the last ten years has been 
niade unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. _ They range 
from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any 
particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are 
engaging in a world conspiracy. 
20. The present conference must help us to learn whether 
there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these 
questions. 
21. Speech by Robert P. Smith. Mr. Smith was described as 
the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one 
of the major motive forces in this organization. 
22. Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years 
studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but 
nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in 
the last nine years.
