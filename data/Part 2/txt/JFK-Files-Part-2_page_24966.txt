STATEMENTS OF JOHN N. IRWIN II 
TO FREDERICK D. BARON ON SEPTEMBER 22, 1975 
Throughout 1960 and until the end of the Eisenhower 
Administration, I served as Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for International Security Af{airs. My current business 
address is c/o Patterson, Balknap & Webb, 30 Rockefeller 
Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10020. 
1. On September 22, 1975 in my office I reviewed with 
Mr. Baron the following documents in·an attempt to refresh 
my recollection on discussions that took place at certain 
governmental meetings: the Memorandum for the Record of 
the Special Group meetings of June 30, 1960 and August 
25, 1960; the Memorandum for the Record of the National 
Security Meetings of July 21, 1960, August 18, 1960, and 
September 21, 1960; and the Record of Action of the NSC 
Meetings of July 15, 1960 and September 7, 1960. These 
documents indicate that I attended all of these meetings 
except the NSC meeting of August 18, 1960, which Mr. Hadyn 
Williams of ISA attended. I also reviewed the affidavit 
of c. Douglas Dillon dated May 21, 1975 which refers, inter 
alia, to a meeting at the Pentagon in the summer of 1960. 
2. Even after attempting to refresh my recollection 
by reviewing the above-mentioned documents, I still have no 
direct recoll~ction of the discussions which they memorialize.
