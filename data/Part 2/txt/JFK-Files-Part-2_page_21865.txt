( The cab le tra~fic conforms to Hedgman' s recollection. For 
two months after0o~tlieb'o/ arrival in the Congo, a regular stream 
of messages flowed between the Leopoldville ~hief o~ Station and 
headquarters through the PROP channel. In late September and early 
October the cables concerned the initiation of Hedgman's top priority 
plan -- recruiting the aid of a particular agent thought to have 
sufficient access to Lumumba's entourage to be able to poison 
Lumumba. * In mid-October, Tweedy notified the ~hief of} Station 
that the assassination mission remained "HIGHEST PRIORITY", and 
he suggested sending additional personnel to Leopoldville to in-
. tensify "CONCENTRATION" on this operation (CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy 
to 0hief o;)station, 10/15/60). ,'n', . ' 
These cables were followed by Hedgman's report to Tweedy on 
October 17 that the agent he had picked for the assassination mission
