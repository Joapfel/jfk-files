MEMORANDUM 
To: The Files 
From: Frederick D. Baron 
Date: September 5, 1975 
Re: Interview with Robert Johnson regarding the Lumumba Case. 
I interviewed Robert Johnson by phone this afternoon 
to supplement the earlier interview (June 10, 1975) and 
examination (June 18, 1975) that the Committee conducted 
with him. At the beginning of the conversation I explained 
there were a number of questions raised by his interview 
and examination that needed to be answered on the record. 
Because it was inconvenient for him to make a trip to Washington 
in the near future and because of the limited amount of addi­
tional information he was able to provide, we agreed that I 
would memorialize the important points of our interview in the 
form of an affidavit to which Mr. Johnson would swear. 
The following points are related as faithfully as 
possible in the manner in which Mr. Johnson made them: 
1. I never heard of a CIA plot assassinate LUr.1umba 
with lethal biological substances. 
2. To the best of my recollection, President Eisen­
hower turned toward Allen Dulles when he made 
the statement relating to Lumumba about which I 
have testified. 
3. After the meeting at which I heard the statement 
by President Eisenhower which I described in my 
testimony on June 18, 1975, I must have consulted 
James Lay (Executive Secretary of the NSC) for 
advice on how to treat the President's statement 
in my memorandum of the meeting. Mr. Lay was 
meticulous about including in the record some form 
of reference to every major subject that was dis­
cussed at NSC meetings. So we probably included 
the President's statement in some form, but in 
what form I do not know. In general, these memo­
randa would be as complete as we could make them. 
Nevertheless, on something as sensitive as this, 
we may have decided to handle it with euphemism. 
4. The NSC meeting of Septe:mber 21, 1961 is probably 
not the meeting at which I heard the President's
