There is no other evidenc.e, however, that the CIA actually 
• gained prior knowledge of Lumumba' s plan to depart for Stanleyville .. 
In fact, a cable from Leopoldville on the day after Lumumba's 
escape betrays the station's complete ignorance about the circum-' 
stances of Lumumba's departure (CIA Cable IH Li3484, Leopoldville 
to Director, 11/28/60). 
But the same cable raises at least a question as to whether -
the CIA was involved in the capture of Lumumba enroute by Congolese 
troops: 
[STATION) WORKING WITH [ CONGOLESE GOVERNT_,1ENT] 
TO GET ROADS BLOCKED Alm TROOPS ALERTED 
[BLOCK] POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE. (CIA.Cable, 
11/ 28/ 60.) · 
A cable of December 2 reporting Lumumba's·capture militates 
against CIA involvement, however, because it portrays the Congolese 
-
·forces as the source of the station's information (CIA Cable.IN 10643, 
Leopoldville to Director, 12/3/60). 
The Chief of Station testified that he was "quite certain that 
there was no Agency involver.1.ent in any way" in Lumumba'sdeparture
