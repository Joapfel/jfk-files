JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL. 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
James Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted 
in Chattanooga Federal Court, 3/4/64, of obstruction of 
justice related to their efforts~to tamper with riertain 
members of the jury in a pr~vious trial of Hoffa. These 
convictions were upheld by the u. s._ Supreme Court on 12/12/66. 
In response to a request from Assistant Attorney 
General Fred M. Vinson, Jr., we furnished·a lette~. to the 
Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in which 
the conversations of Hoffa ~nd two other defendants were 
overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoffa, his 
office, and his home were not the direct targets of any 
electronic devices in the development of this case, and the 
Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of 
12/29/66. The instances in which he appeared to have been 
present at· conversations monitored occurred in Detroit, 
Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada. 
In 1961 and 1962 our ·Detroit office overheard 
three conversations of Hoffa. The_se conversations were 
broadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles 
opera·ted by Teamsters Union personnel. in the Detroit area. 
This was accomplished through the use of a tunable 
commercial-type F1'1 radio receiver which was in operation in 
our Detroit.office. No trespass was involved in this 
connection. 
In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa 
appears to have participat~d in four telephone conversations 
with two Las Vegas. hoodlum figures who were being covered by 
electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involved). 
Hoffa's part of these conversations was not overheard. 
Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and 
former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted ~/29/64, in • 
Nashville Federal Court d'f obstruction of justice arising 
from his attempts to influence a potentiril juror in a forth­
coming ti;..ial of Hoffa. In this investigation, a miniature 
recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness· 
during a.. meeting with Osborn. This installation was made 
at the request of the Department and with the prio~ approval 
of the two Federal judges in N~shville. No trespass was 
involved, and the use of this.installation was brought out 
• -·fully during Osborn's trialo His conviction was affirmed by 
the/Supreme Court 12/12/66~ The Department is fully aware of
