ADOLPH COORS, III - VICTIM 
KIDNAPING; EXTORTION 
Intensive investigation is being continued in this case 
with two principal objectives-the location and apprehension of 
Joseph Corbett, Jr. , the prime suspect in this case who is carried 
as one of our ten most wanted fugitives, and the development of 
evidence to positively identify Corbett as Coors'· abductor. 
In our program acquainting the.public with our interest 
in Corbett, • material has been prepared and transmitted to the field 
which will be furnished to all newspapers in the United States. In 
our specialized circularization of persons and businesses with whom 
Corbett would most likely have contact, we have sent letters and 
Wanted Flyers to all individuals engaged in the prescribing and 
dispensing of eyeglasses, including contact lenses, as Corbett's 
eyesight requires that he wear glasses at all times. 
The special squad in the Denver Division is currently 
engaged in investigation in the mountain area to the west and north­
west of Denver with the objective of obtaining some information as 
to the site of a planned hide-out where the abductor would have taken 
Coors and indications as to where Coors' body could have been left.
