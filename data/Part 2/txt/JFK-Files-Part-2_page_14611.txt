'Bulet 6/29/59 requested 12 field offices directly or 
_potentially involved in this program to evaluate 1 ive source 
devel o_pment under third phase and offer suggestions- for. improve­
ment. As result three specific questions aros.e for consideration. 
t. Are our targets too restrictive? 
2. Are our interview.procedures too conservative? 
3. Shall we endeavor to extend program to reach 
higher-level noncommunist officials and possibly 
communist officials? 
Th,e first guest ion relates to whether we should attempt 
source developments in establishments outside Washington, New 
York City and San Francisco and whether we should alter present 
instructions that potential sources be limited almost exclusively 
to e~ployees of foreign establishments who are U.S. citizens. 
Second question relates to ~,-:~i'frer we ,should relax present 
requirement that all authorized inter1ilews with _potential sources 
be initially conducted under a suitable pret?J:i, "_preferably in 
connec_tion with a criminal matter unrelated?''tcJt.'the employment of 
the _person interviewed. .,,,,,, 
Third question relates to whether we should utilize 
_present sources, who generally occupy clerical _positions, to 
identify noncommunist officials who are (1) strongly pro-Western, 
and (2) in social or business contact with communist officials, 
for _purpose of approaching the noncommunist officials and working 
through them to reach the communists for defection or double g.gent 
pur,poses.

the e~perience of the field would be invaluable in a thorough 
discussion of these matters and accordingly they will be scheduled 
for discussion at next conference with field security supervisors 
and recommendations thereafter will be submitted.
