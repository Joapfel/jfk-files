The greatest use of proven design techniques and 
methods. 
The most understanding of the requirements and 
difficulties in developing, testing, tooling, and 
producing a fighter-type aircraft. 
When the General Dynamics and Boeing proposals were first 
identified in the early stages of the competition in December-January 1961 - -
1962 as the two significantly better proposals among those submitted by 
six competing companies, neither proposal was found to be acceptable 
without substantial changes. Differing opinions were expressed as to 
whether a single contractor, Boeing, should be selected at the outset, or 
whether the competition between General Dynamics and Boeing should be 
continued in order to meet the military requirements. 
Competition was continued over the period from January to the Fall 
of 1962. In November 1962, the Fourth Evaluation Report, prepared by 
the evaluation officers of the Navy and the Air Force, concluded: 
"( 1) Both contractors have the capability to successfully 
design and produce this weapon system. 
11(2) Both designs are acceptable as initial development 
design configurations to the using Agencies involved - - TAC and the 
Navy. 
11 (3) Both designs will require further design refinement, 
and changes can be expected during the development period.
