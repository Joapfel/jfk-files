INTERVIEHER: That was their solution. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, give them a one cent figure. I don't 
care. Or a dollar figure. One dollar. No more. But you 
can't start putting out a bunch of figures like that. 
INTERVIEHER: I don't kno~ if we touched on it last time or not 
-- the murder and funeral of Richard Helch and it's impact on 
the Congressional Committee's work. Some say this lessened the 
Committee pressure and won public opinion over to the side of 
the Agency. Did you? 
MR. HALPERN: Hell, being on the outside and having been at 
Dick's arrival at Andrews field that night when his plane came 
in, I don't know whether it lessened pressure from Congress. I 
think it did have an impact on public opinion, and I think that 
can be checked by looking at the old tapes in the old news 
broadcasts and looking at the headlines and the stories in the 
responsible newspapers The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago 
Tribune., The New Y_ork Times, The Hashington Post, etc. -- and 
ordinary papers across the.country and Halter Cronkite's 
broadcast and things like that. And I think you will find 
overall, there was a pulling back from the constant drumbeat of 
CIA being evil, CIA evil, CIA evil. I'm not sure if it had too 
much of an impact on Congressional Hill. Particularly the 
Church Committee and the Pike Committee. Particularly the Pike 
Committee more than the Church Committee. I.t had some, but I 
don't think it really stopped them. They kept going.
