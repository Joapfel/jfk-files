Senator Huddleston. Good. 
Senator ·Mathias. There·isno question about the writing 
American press or the value in print domestically. M~ybe the 
role, any legitimate role that news men could, journalists, 
writers could fulfill is available through the information 
agencies, USIA and groups of that sort. 
So does anybody know whether there is any real need 
for allowing some latitude, which is not covered by situations 
that can be envisioned under USIA or other programs? l 'f 
Mr. Kirbow.

Well, Senator, the one that I discussed earli r 
13 that I probably didn't make my point well because no one 
14 seemed to have picked it up, ~s we do, by the words here, if I 
15 understand Mr. Bader, prohibit an American citizen living in 
16 Brussels ~nd working fo:r: a local newspaper there from having 
17 anything to do with the CIA. 
18 Senator Huddleston. No we don• t, do we? • 
19 You mean ·by his extension? • 
20 Mr. Kirbow. Yes, sir.

Mr. Kirbow. But wasn't that·what you wanted to put in 
23 the· law, that you didn't know if you wanted --
24 Senator Mathias. This is the point I wanted to raise 
25 here.
