CONFIDENT I A-L 
Women's National March 
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971 
Law Commune 
On September 16, 1969, a second source, who 
has furnished reliable information in the 
past, advised that the Law Commune is not an 
organization in the usual sense of the word. 
It is rather a law firm comprised of a group 
of lawyers ·interested and sympathetic to the 
New Left and Black Power organizations, and who 
counsel and defend individuals in these groups 
as the occasion arises. They likewise permit 
their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting 
place for these organizations and distribute 
some of their literature. 
On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of 
now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of 
the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the 
people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision 
regarding the route of the march. The source stated that 
in NY, information concerning buses for Washington, D.C. 
will be available at the Upper west Side Women's Center, 
627 Amsterdam Avenue~ NYC, telephone number 874-6696. 
On March 24, 1971, the second source made available 
a piece of literature sent out by the 11April 10 Women's 
Committee 11 concerning the national women's march on the 
Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as 
follows: 
11We are going to the Pentagon on April 10 to 
serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against 
them. Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the 
Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black 
and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now. 
we are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday 
things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us 
from getting them. • 
11We need and want our sisters around the country 
to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate 
with;other sisters their ideas, suggestions and criticisms. 
This I is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann 
Arbor Conference:
