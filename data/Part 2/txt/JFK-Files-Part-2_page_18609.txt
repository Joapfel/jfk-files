fO~ECT: OPERATIONS 
LEGAL ATTACHE, . 
l,$ANTO DOMINGO OFFICE -------·--···--·-
This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular tegal 
l · Attache Office in Santo Domingo in.view of the President's 
• desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and th~1= 
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn i;D 
~nformants·over to the Agency. 
In accordance with the desire of the President ar.c 
recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special 
Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Dom:~ican 
Republic, the Direct.or, on 8/2/66, advised the White House 
that our staff in Santo Domingo would be Tedu.~·ed to three r:en 
and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner 
~sii:liilar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not 
• ~be an operational office but rather will serve as a str~teg:c 
,listening post for-intelligence data and as liaison with 
:agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agen9ies 
'9f foreign governments in that country. : ~ .. 
.. -
- -:_.y~ In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed 
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant cover~4e· 
to determine if any of our informants should be made availa~le.,.., 
to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recom.~ended 
, that~ informants, mm;2n~. be turned over·to CIA. 
~ has been used principally to develop subversive data 
NW 
on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republ~c. S™ is 
. :.a penetrative-type informant who has _gained membership in 
]
~Dominican subversive groups. Both oj these sources are 
• operational and are not the type we would contact in a norc~l 
lhison capacity. Continuation of their se~vices under our 
current criteria would be a questionable procedure .
