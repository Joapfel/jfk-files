program to expand our use of technical surveillances on diplomatic 
establishments of countries outside ___ Soviet _Bloce-----In connection therewith 
( 
we advised the Attorney Gene'ral•:,·•on··'•172·6762 .. • that on a selective and • 
-~---. probing basis of six to eight establishments at a time ____ we would. explore 
coverage o~ ~6.c~untries (~elect!on being base~ on potential for intelli-
gence acqu1s1 tion and cons1derat1on of. trouble-spot status). ,_./,~~ 
··To date we have at one time or another afforded coverage td 
all countries on this list except Laos, Morocco, Panama, Thailand and 
South Vietnamo At present tim~ we have technical coverage on Brazilian

~ which for one reason or another developed a potential for intelligence
