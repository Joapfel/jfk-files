• Jaffe' s Employees in Moscow· 
l 
Jaffe advised that in 1965 prior to his 
expulsion he had a Soviet cameraman and a translator. 
The cameraman had left several months before the ABC 
office was crdered closed, and he was replaced by Yuri 
Bo1.'idorov (phon·etic): who stayed until Jaffe·' s expulsion 
ana actually closed the ABC office. The translator, Aleksandr 
"Sashan Nezmanov (phonetic), "was good and- would stick his 
neck out, but he was mixed up with some girl. This was the 
excuse he gave." "Sashan told Jaffe he had. "gotten himself in 
tiouble with a circus girl and this was about to cause a 
scene." "Sasha, 11 who broke down and ·cried when he r·elated the g" .. 
story to Jaffe, said he made the girl pregnant and she had ~ 
threatened to come down to his office and complain~ Jaffe 
said he asked "Slava" about this, and his only comment was 
"they weren't ve-i;y good 11 employees. Jaffe said the translator's 
replacement was a "great big goon type who knew nothing," and 
Jaffe fired him. 
Jaffe stated he.left Russia about a month after 
the Scali story brolrn. He continued: 11 I had already reported 
the ~en~al based on what I saw and believed, but ABC didn't 
use them-~ radio·did but TV didn't." Jaffe stated the Soviets 
viere aware- of· the ABC radio d_enial but they asked Jaffe why" /) 
the. d~nial did no~ appear on television~ stating "the impact l:.,-~ 
, was created on TV." According to Jaffe, this is why Henry .. _. -· . 
Shapiro, UPI correspondent, called and complained. Then Reuter's 
c;:alled·. Jaffe said he replied: "No, gentlemen, I have knocked 
.the story down." J~ffe again commented that it was only when 
the Soviets indicated they were aware of his criticism of the 
story "that • I knew I Jiad been bugged. 'l'hey knew everything I 
said."
