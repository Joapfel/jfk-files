arrangements could be made to have selected individuals meet 
with his appointed repres~ntative. His instructions and words 
could be relayed to the public ·by many means. 
As his political platform becomes more apparent within 
the exile groups, it may be possible to· determine those willing to 
follow his leadership (to gain-Cuban independence under his terms) 
or those who are unwilling to accept his leadership. The lines of 
controversy among exiles can be drawn more clearly. Undesirable 
leaders and exile groups can be eJfrninated from the competition 
throQgh his disavowals. • 
Eventually, a member· of the resistance in Cuba rn.ay gain 
sufficle~t stature to assume or to be given the title of this imaginary 
leader. This, of course, will depend in ~arge measure on in~vidual 
leadership ability and the ability to "fill the boots" of this anti-Castro 
image. 1 
While this scheme is repiete with gimmickery. its imple-:­
mentation could be undertaken in a relatively short period of time. 
Sensitivity of this scheme is such that the knowledge should. be held 
on the tightest basis and if ~plemented, those proposing should 
not be informed. In the event the scheme is cornprornised, (unless 
knowledge is widespread) there is little need for plausible deniability; 
however, once used and compromised the scherne can hardly be 
reinstated. A major advantage ie that this image can be created 
over a long period of time or developed rapidly without a political 
or economic commitnlent on the part of. the U.S. There rn.ay be a 
point at which the U.S. could no longer disavow collaboration with 
this imaginary person. This point,.however, is so distant that 
during any point in the intervening period it would be possible for 
the U.S. to disengage easily without suffering embarrassment or 
loss of prestige.
