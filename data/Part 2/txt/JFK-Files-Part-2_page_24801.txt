C. Immediate Post-Assassination Period 
The U.S. Consulate in the Dominican Republic was quick 
to dispatch its early reports that Tri:ijillo had been assassinated, 
and the U.S. corrnnunications network transmitted the report to 
President Kennedy in Paris. The President's Press Secretary, 
Pierre Salinger, made the first public announcement of the i 
assassination, preceeding by several hours release.of the news / 
in the Dominican Republic. Secretary of State Rusk testified / 
that when he learned of Salinger's announcement he was most con-/ 
I 
cerned. Rusk said that Trujillo's son Ramfis was also in Paris/ 
i 
and he was afraid that Ramfis, upon first learning of his ! i 
father's death from the press secretary to the President of the\ 
U.S., might try to retaliate against President Kennedy. (Rusk, j 
32, 33.)
