estimated to have been somewhat more than $3 million. These funds were 
apparently used to generally augment the level of effort undertaken by SOD. 
Agency requirements for specific R&D were not levied in any programmatic way, 
but rather the Agency identified particular work being done by SOD as part of its 
program supporting the Army Special Forces as being of interest and then _levied 
requirements for the customizing of such developments for Agency use. Through 
the course of years, Agency objectives in the project became better defined. 
Thus a project approval_ memo of 1967 identifies the four functional categories 
of project activity: 
a. Maintenance of a stockpile of incapacitating and lethal· 
agents in readiness for operational use; 
b. Maintenance, assessment and evaluation of a designated 
balance of biological and chemical disseminating systems for 
operational readiness; 
c. Adaptation and testing of a non-discernible microbioinoculator 
(a dart device suitable for the clandestine and imperceptible 
inoculation with BW/CW agents) to determine compatibility with 
various materials and to assure that the microbioinoculator 
cannot be identified structurally or easily detected upon a 
detailed autopsy; and 
d. Provide technical support and consultation on request to meet 
ad hoc requirements related to offensive and defensive.BW/CW. 
In the later years the activities dwindled to the point of simply maintaining 
a stockpile of agents and delivery systems for possible Agency use.
