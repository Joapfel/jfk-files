Memorandum 
TO The Attorney General DATE: July 15, 1975 
FROM Director' FBI 
SUBJECT: U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
By letter dated July 9, 1975, Senators Frank Church 
and John Tower requested our appearance in Executive Session 
before the Senate Select Committee to discuss matters of 
concern to me and steps which might be taken to expedite 
responses to requests for documen s essential to the 
Committee's inquiry. 
It is my intention to raise the question of privacy 
as well as the protection of s rces at this forthcoming 
meeting. In the most recent equests of the Senate Select 
Committee dated June 30 and J Iy 8, 1975, copies of which are 
in the possession of Mr. O' nnor, the Committee appears to 
disregard the rights of ce~ ain individuals' privacy, going 
so far as to ask for copie of the annual performance ratings 
of certain former Special Agents of the FBI. 
It is my inte tion to request the Committee to 
relieve the FBI from t e obligation of violating the 
privacy rights.of ind· iduals or placing in jeopardy 
the identities of co erating sources of this Bureau.
