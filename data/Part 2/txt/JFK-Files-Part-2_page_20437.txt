The December- 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World 
,...:i;ram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC 
was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity 
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pr·o-Castro street 
rallies and maEEpicket lines, and the direction of an active . 
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. 
Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting 
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional 
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United 
Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which 
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf 
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H .. · Oswald, 
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second 
source advised that V. T. Lee had rec~ntly ~emarked that ~h~ 
FPCC was dead and .that there were no plans to or-ganize another 
simi~ar vrganization, 
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there 
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the 
FPCC had been dissolved,
