First, it assumes· that Dulles himself knew of the· plots, a

it necessarily assumes that the Presidents would understand 
from a "circumlocutious" description that assassination was 
being discussed. 
The chain of assumptions is far too speculative for the 
Committee ·to make findings inplicating Presidents who are not 
able to speak for themselves. Moreover, it is inconsistent 
with Bissell's other testimony that "formal and explicit" 
appro_val would be required for assassination, ·k and contrary

closest to both Eisenhower and Kennedy. 
* If the evidence concerning President Eisenhower's order 
to assassinate Lumumba is correct, it should be weighed against.

Presidents in the Castro case. First, the Lumumba case would 
imply that President Eisenhower and Dulles did discuss such 
matters bluntly and not circumlocutiously. Second, the Lumumba 
example indicates that the President would discuss such matters

approached privately. Third, it can be inferred from Bissell's 
testimony in the Castro case that if President Eisenhower had 
told Dulles that he approv·ed of the plot, Dulles would not have 
told anyone else of that fact. _Yet Gottlieb's testimony in the
