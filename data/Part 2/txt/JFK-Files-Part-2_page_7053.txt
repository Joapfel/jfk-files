26. (AIUO) CONCLUSIONS: The JFK Project cost far 
too much, took far too long, produced no information to 
change the conclusion that Oswald acted alone. But it did 
make available to the public previously withheld operational 
material to negate what DCI Gates had called the most 
heinous of the conspiracy theories: that CIA was involved 
in the assassination of the President of the United States. 
The resource impact was a .function of: the unique 
requirements of the law; the crash nature of the initial 
release; the National Archives decision that every duplicate 
must be reviewed and indexed as a unique document; less ~han 
satisfactory indexing, contributing to inadvertent releases 
and tim~ wasted in checking for consistency in the handling 
of duplicates; problems in determining the cover status of 
retired employees; and stonewalling. 
27. (AIUO) Although there was inconsistency and 
inadvertent release and some resultant retiree anger, we 
know of no significant national security breech. Previously 
withheld information from the Church Committee hearings and 
from the Presidential libraries declared relevant by the ARRB 
will be titillating and may stimulate FOIA requests, but the 
variance from FOIA. rul_es was not a legal justification for 
withholding under the JFK law. 
28. (U) If this experience leads to a serious 
objective look at the theory and practice of secrecy in 
this changed world, perhaps the cost will have been worth it.
