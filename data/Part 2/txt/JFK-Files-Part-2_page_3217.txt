A. Propaganda 
The desire of WH Division to undertake the propa­
ganda operation against the government of Fidel C~stro, 
antedated the formation of Branch 4 in the .Division by 
more than two months; for on 27 October 1959 in a Memo-
, .... 
randum to the Director of Central Intelligence, J.C. 
King proposed: 
That CIA undertake clandestine propa­
ganda operations targeted ·at Cuba. These 
operations would employ primarily-radio 
broadcasts and other-means of propaganda, 
and at informing the Cuban masses of the 
truth. 1/ • 
Col. King's memorandum pointed out that repre-
·,-
sentatives of various of the Cuban opposition g~·oups 
organized in the United States had requested Agency 
assistance to set up propaganda operations directed 
against the Cuban mainland, and, in addition, he also 
indicated that he and the Director of Communications, 
Gen. McClelland, had his people studying the best, 
methods for carrying out such propaganda broadcasts.
