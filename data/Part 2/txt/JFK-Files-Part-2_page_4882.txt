~NDLESS-~EB-OF-MEETINGS TO BUILD WILL BE GONE WITH THE FIRST 
IPUBLICATION LOCALLY CONFIRMING OUR USE OF STATE COVER. 
\ 4. MOREOVER, BILATERAL U.S.-ARGENTINE RELATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN' 
yLOSER; THESE WOULD BE TARNISHED, NOT IRREPARABLY BY ANY MEANS, BUT 
VNtJECESSARILY, BY OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA USE OF STATE COVER. 
¥ISTORICALLY RELATIONS WITH ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN STRAINED, AND IT IS 
?NLY DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT A NEW PRESIDENT AND HIS BOLD 
fREE-MARKET REFORMS HAVE PUSHED ARGENTINA SQUARELY INTO THE 
~EMOCRATIC ORBIT. CURIOUSLY, THE CLOSE POLITICAL RELATIONS AND OUR 
STEADILY-IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH LIAISON MEANS THAT BOTH PARTIES 
f-EMBASSY DIPLOMATS AND SENIOR LIAISON OFFICERS-- WONDER WHY WE NEED 
'f'O'SPY HERE IF WE CAN GET VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE ASK FOR FROM LIAISON 
9R _,FROM ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. INDEED, IN THIS RELATIVELY 
98-EN, COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT, AN INDICATION THAT STATION WAS WORKING 
rN IN:~MP::I::: ::::LO:A:::::GW;::DR::::p::::L::T::G:::~SSY BUENOS 
fIRES IS SO OPEN A WORKPLACE THAT THERE IS NO REAL CLEARED ACCESS 
fREA (CAA), BUT RATHER A "HYBRID" CAA, TO USE THE RSO'S PHRASE. THIS 
MEANS THAT FSN'S HAVE LONG HAD OFFICES ON THE THIRD FLOOR, WHERE THE 
.*+EXECUTIVE>OFFICES AND REPORTING OFFICES (INCLUDING STATION) ARE 
~OCATED. NEEDLESS TO SAY, STATION IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE LOCAL 
¢oNFIGURATION OF OFFICES, SINCE IT TENDS TO IDENTIFY OUR UNILATERAL 
9FFICERS. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE EMBASSY OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE A 
fULL APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE/NEED FOR INTELLIGENCE IN SUCH AN OPEN, 
fRIENDLY SOCIETY, OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA'S USE OF STATE COVER 
~OULD ONLY REAFFIRM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. OUR FEW UNILATERAL OFFICERS 
WOULD ESSENTIALLY THEN BE DECLARED. STATION WOULD HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO 
I 
QHANGE OUR COVER PROFILE BY OBTAINING MORE NOC OFFICERS WHILE 
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNILATERAL C/O'S. AS HEADQUARTERS IS AWARE, 
I 
U,NDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FEW NOCS, AND THE SELECTION AND 
T;RAINING OF NEW ONES TAKES YEARS AND IS EXPENSIVE. IN THIS SCENARIO, 
BUENOS AIRES WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ENOUGH PRIORITY TO WARRANT SENDING 
I 
'.DHREE NOC OFFICERS TO REPLACE THE THREE UNILATERAL SLOTS WE CURRENTLY 
I 
HAVE. THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD COLLECT VERY LITTLE 
]NTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATING DIRECTIVE (OD). 
I 
~PECIFICALLY, INTERNAL POLITICAL REPORTING, WHICH IS A FIRST PRIORITY 
GBJECTIVE, WOULD BE ZEROED OUT, AND REPORTING ON THE WP AND ES I 
tARGETS, BOTH SECOND PRIORITY OBJECTIVES, WOULD BE NON-EXISTENT. i 
THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS LOSS TO THE USG, SINCE OUR WP REPORTING HAS 
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF LEARNING TO WHAT EXTENT THE I 
4RGENTINES ARE RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NOT REBUILDING 
THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM. ON THE ES TARGET, WE WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT ;· 
REPORTING ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE ASIAN 
FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE AMERICAS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, 
I 
WE WOULD LOSE THE TRUST OF KEY HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF SOME • 
~ENIOR LIAISON OFFICIALS, WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT IT WOULD f 
I )AKE YEARS TO REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP. ;/ 
\ 6. IN TERMS OF A SECURITY THREAT, BUENOS AIRES REMAINS THE ONLY 
CJ'..PITAL IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE THAT HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF TWO 
H:IZBALLAH BOMBINGS, KILLING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. A TERRORIST ,
