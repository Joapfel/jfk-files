SUBJECT: Sunmary of C.Overt Action Operations Targeted at 
Right-Wing Governments 
1. Pursuant to your request, forwarded as attachment A is a paper 
providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing 
governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select 
Committee. 
2. All of the cases in the attached summary are cons~dered sensitive 
by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to 
today. In many ways public disclosure of some of these operations could 
impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the bthet dis­
closures on our foreign involvements. For example, a disclosure of our 
past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military 
base negotiations now underway. With this problem in mind, we have 
broken the operations into two categories: Category I are those oper­
ations about which full connni ttee could be briefed, if necessary, and 
Category II are those operations considered extremely sensitive about 
which the connnittee Chairman and Co-Chainnan might be briefed, if abso­
lutely necessary. 
3. In addition to the attachment A sUJJDTlary, we also approve the use 
(with the full committee) of the case swnmary on our operations to assist 
the survival of the Betancotrrt government in Venezuela, which was pro­
vided to you directly by LA Division. 
4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this information 
to the cornmi ttee. However, should it be necessary to do so, we \\Ould 
appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances 
of any use of this material outside of the Agency.
