U.S. The concern we have previously expressed about the role of ··, 
Lt. Ceneral Yevgeniy N. PITOVRfu'lOV and the Soviet inte.lligence · 
officers in the foreign trade business was well founded. and, in 
fact, w'e believe was··somewhat understated. It is no,1. evident that 
PITOVRANOV controls most if not all of the activities going on·. 
• where American business encounters Soviet trade. officials, in the 
International Trade Center to be -built in Moscow, in exhibits in.· 
· the USSR and abroad, in the patents and licensing agreements, in· 
the supervision of the travel. of trade delegations· to the U.S. • 
and the like. •

15. Reports which rev~al that .the KGB is active among.Ameri~~­
businessmen are ·beginning to surface. Not too surprisingly, these· 
reports indicate that their techniques are both subtle and blatant.·.· 
. One of the most. blatant approaches to· American business ·involves .• 
.• Igor ARTEMYEV, who_ is attached to the Soviet Embassy in Washingto_n. 
ARTEMYEV claims to be a student in the U.S .. to study·relationships 
·• between U.S. companies and their foreign subsidiaries ~d licensing 
· ~ ·.: agreements between U_.S~ and foreign companies. In the course of.··· 
• •.. his research, ARTEl-lYEV sends detailed questionnaj.res to U.S. com- ... • 
_panies. The questionnaires -are the kind required.by our Securities 
and Exchange Commission .. While some companies do not respond~ ... · 
•• there are those that do. ARTEMYEV also visits various companies to· 
·. talk with officials. · On.one occasion he replied to a question 
about the level of classification of the meeting by saying.it was • 
"confidential.'' • With that kind of access, who needs to recruit in· 
the• classic sense.· • 
l6~. PITOVRA.i.'lOV' s people are very evident -in varl..ous· t;ad~ 
delegations under their Chamber of Coiilillerce cover,· and they are . 
applying what appear to be classic assessment techniques .... It has. 
been our experience to date that they are thinking long-range and. •·.·. • 
are themselves not interested in the cheap shot or quick pitch,· . 
although these devices are being employed against some American.·· • 
businessmen who visit Moscow. There are also strong indications . 
that the Soviets are using recruited agents among the rapidly ex'."'·· 
panding demi-monde of fixers, many Russian-speaking, who gain -
• employment as the. in-house experts who "know how to, deal with the 
Russians" and who find employment with American firms as guides -• 
and advis'ors accompanying U.S .. delegations to rtos cow.
