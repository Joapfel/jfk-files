In June,. ~hortly t~rireafter, he discusied ~ith an Ameri~an 
consular official in Zurich his recurrent fear that the 
CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to 
West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was 
traversing ihe. DDR, he says .that he was taken off the 
train and_illeeally detained. Ile is not certain why he 
was taken off the, train but admits to having talked freely 
on the train to other.passengers about his life history, 
and he was also carrying with him a heavy portfolio of all 
of his Army and government records involved with his service 
career, disability, and imprisonment. For several mcnths 
Nagell claims that _he was inte~rogated by the East Germans 
and repeatedly asked to corif~ss hi~ role as a spy or govern­
ment agent. Eventually, Nagell says· that he.concluded the 
onl~ way to be released would be to feign mental illcess, 
which he says he proceeded to do. This was several ~eeks 
ago and he says he was soon examined by an East Germ&n 
psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated. 
in his release today,. four· and, one-ha-lf months·: after his, 
detention began. 
Mr. Nagell's plans fo~ the .future cent~r around retu1~irir 
to the United States and beginning an appeal to the 
ment to grant him~ psychiatric disability pension, 
aG for his physica·1 disability, on the lJasis of his 
injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic 
that the CIA ~as trying to kill him.
