• Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 1553. which amends the President 
John F. Kennedy ~assination Records Collection Act of 1992-Public Law 102-526-to provide 1 
additional year for the Assassination Records Review Board to complete its work. This legislation 
would extend the Review Board's September 30, 1997, termination date undercurrent law to 
Sept.ember 30, 1998. H.R. 1553 autho.ri7.es $1.6 million in fiscal year 1998 for this purpose. I am pleased 
that the Honorable Henry Waxman, the ranking minority member on the Committee on Government 
Refomi and Oversight, and the Honorable Louis Stokes, who sponsored the 1992 Act and who chaired 
the House Select Committee on Assassinations that was established in 1976, are original cosponsors of 
H.R. 1553. 
• The purpose of the 1992 legislation was to publicly release records relating to the Kennedy 
assassination at the earliest possible date. The Assassination Records Review Board was set up to 
review and release the voluminous amounts of information in the Government's possession. The FBI, 
·the Secret Service, the CIA. the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, the Church • 
Committee in the Senate, and the House Select Committee on-Assassioati.ons have all held 
assassination records . and records have also been in the possession of certain State and local 
authorities as well as private citizens. When this legislation was considered, nearly 1 million pages of 
records compiled by official investigations of the assassinatlon had not been ~de available to the 
public, some 30 years after the tragedy. Congress be~eved that simply making all relevant information 
available to the public was the best way to respond to the continuing high level of interest in the 
Kennedy assassination • and was preferable to undertaking a new congressional investigation. The 1992 
law requires the Re"View Board to presume that documents relaµng to the assassination should be made 
public unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contraxy. I believe that the release of this 
information is important to ensure accountability in the Government and to clearly demonstrate to 
Americans that the Government has nothing to hide. • 
• As a result of the Review Board 's efforts, over 10,000 documents have been transferred to the national 
archives and Records Administration for inclusion in the JFK collection. At the end of 1996, that
