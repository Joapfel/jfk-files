SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR-CUBA: 
The -US Embassy in Beirut believes· that Lebanon may act 
to curtail the use of its ships in the Cuban trade. This would 
result in a significant decline in Cuban shipping in free world 
bottoms because Lebanese companies provided ten of the thirty­
two free world ships which called at Cuba in_ October. The 
Lebanese foreign minister planned to ask the cabinet for a pro­
visional measure wherel?y he would be able to demand that all 
ships carrying Lebanese flag must call at Lebanon periodically 
and report their destinations._ He believed this would cut 
the Cuban traffic quickly by 60 percent. Because US aid to 
Lebanon is almost nonexistent, tl:ie US Embassy believes that 
this Lebanese action would be prompted by motives of princi-
ple rather than fear of losing US aid, an action which is being 
discuss_ed by • the US Congress. (Am Emb Beirut 520, 5 December, 
CONFIDENTIAL)
