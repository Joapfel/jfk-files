MEMORANDUM 
TO: Clifford Fenton 
Chief Investigator-JFK 
FROM: John Moriarty 9;~ 
Staff Investigator-JFK 
DATE: July 20, 1978 
RE: Mary Ceciliadell Bertucci 
This lady placed a call to our Committee at 2:30 p.m. 
on July 18, 1978, seeking Mr. Bill Brown, and spoke to me 
when advised the former would no longer be available.' 
She advised she and her husband had been interviewed 
on past occasions by Brown and it was imperative these 
reports be modified regarding "the reward." Previously she 
had indicated she wasn't concerned with the one hundred 
thousand dollars, but she's since reconsidered and has decided 
to accept this recompense. 
I checked the files and reviewed 5117 (2/7/78), 7196 
(4/14/78), and 7255 (4/18/78) submitted by Bill Brown and found 
she reiterated the essential story. Today's notes added the 
following data: 
am 
1. Maiden name Tinner; DOB, 9/28/43; SS #439-60-9743. 
2. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was her first cousin. (It 
was due to circumstances that they never met.) 
3. Judge Garrison is her attorney of record. 
4. She's currently confined to "Parker 3 West" of 
De Paul Hospital in New Orleans, with 11 of the 
15 days' confinement to go. 
None of these four items verified at this time.
