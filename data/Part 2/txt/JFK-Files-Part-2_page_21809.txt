Mr. Wides. With any CIA offices in New York. Was your 
impression that the only contact that he had with CIA was all 
the way back through Miami? 
Mr. Sarno. I believe that was the cas~, y~s, sir. 
Mr. Wides. Yon had no understanding? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, obviously once this thing came up, we 
put this fallow in contact with somebody in the base up ther~ 
who in turn delivered th~m to the Bureau. 
Mr. Wides. And this was the Domestic Operations Base, not· 
the Security Office? 
Mr. Sarno. Domestic Operations. 
Mr. Wides. Now thereafter, did they keep contact wit­
this group? 
Mr. Sarno. I cannot recall. 
Mr. Wides. Did you continue after that incident to get 
reports through 
Mr. Sarno. I believe so, yes. 
Mr. Wides. With no indication whether they were also in 
touch with the Agency? 
~Sarno. No, sir. 
Mr. Wides. You wer~n•t curiou~, or did you ever inquire? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, I would believe it to be that they were 
not in contact with anybody up there, because if the report 
were to come down, they would probably have indicated in thdir 
report that they had passed this information on.
