unique sources. There is, as well, the related question of how much information 
'llae knovn at the top of the cooperating governments and the extent to which such 
knowledge would enhance our understanding of the assassination as being ehe work 
of foreign conspirat.ors. If we compromise any of those relationships and 
consequent.ly cause political damage to the cooperating government, we may find a 
valuable fucure source of intelligence closed. n190

Exhibit Seven poses some of t.hese liaison issues. n191 The FBI provided the 
Beard with this heavily redacted document, arguing thac release of the body of 
material in the message from the FBI field office in Paris to the Director of 
the FBI in Washington on Occober 12. 1960 (three years before the 
assassination), would damage the ability of .the Unit.ed St.ates to work with the 
int.elligence and police operacions of a foreign nation. The cable, however, 
st.ruck t.he Board as being particularly important, in that it showed that three 
years before the murder of the Presidenc the FBI was engage·d in surveillance of 
Oswald's activities. nl92 The Board was also c:onc:erned that concealing so large 
an amount of material would only heighten speculat.ion about .the document's 
significance.

As Exhibi~ Bight demonstrates, the cont.ent.s of the cable were far more 
sinister when redacted than when they were disclosed in full. n193 To gain this 
release, the B_oard sought the cooperation of the. Swiss ambassador to the United 
Stac.es, who c:oneented to the relQase, only with the proviso that the names of 
specific Swiss officials not be divulged. As a result of the cahle•s release, we 
know that the FBI had knowledge of and interest in Oswald's activities well 
before the·assassination, to the extent of relying on officials of the swiss 
Federal Police_ to learn about his possible attendance at Albert Schweit~er 
College. n194
