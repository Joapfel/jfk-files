Mr. Schwarz. 
anybody from the Central Intelligence .Agency or anybody 
else inform you that in earlier years there had been 
a relationship with to use Senator Tower's caution 
with persons alledgedly involved with the criminal syndicate -
in order to accomplish the assassination of Fidel Castor? 
Mr. Dundy. No. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, going back to the post-Bay of Pigs 
period, would you put before the witness and mark as Exhibit 
2 the National Security minutes of a meeting held May 5, 1961. 
'---
It is at Tab B of the Senator's Book 1 of 2. This reflects, 
am I correct, Mr. Dundy, a discussion of Cuba, held with the 
President and high officials of the government who are all 
listed on the front page? 
Mr. Bundy. Correct. 
Mr. Schwarz. And Cuba was discussed, and it was 
agreed, following the discussion that U.S. policy toward Cuba 
should aim at the downfall of Castro, and that since the 
measures agreed below are not likely to achieve this end, 
the matter should be reviewed at intervals with a view to 
further action? 
Mr. Bundy. Right. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, can you describe the measures agreed 
to at that point? 
Mr. Bundy. My only way of doing that with any accuracy 
TOP SECRET
