The case file of captioned organization has be~. 
reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned 
organization and it has been determined that while some o 
the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia 
area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist 
Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance \ 
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be \ 
individuals interested in~social change rather than revolu-,3 
tionary political ch~4.\) ;·,, , I 
• REC-5 . • • , 
In view of the facb €hat WONAAC represents basically 
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of 
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U.S. Supreme 
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing 
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a 
_-CQ.!ltinued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not 
·c-~-ae7s. rable.
