makes us wlnerable for capricious search demands 
Interpretation of Additional Records 
a.) and b.) This relates to Agency classified resources that refer to 
the total Agency mission. • well beyond the ·assassination" subject 
identification of all such resources will require a separate effort 
requiring substantial resources. In addition it may be impossible to 
identify all such specific resources as the review effort involved 
many people having experience throughout the Agency. 
These resources are classified and most probably would be 
recommended for "indefinite" postponement. 
d.) and e.) Information described in these sections has been and is 
protected by the National Security Act 
As a time period for this information is not stated it is thus implied to 
be open ended and that all such information would be made 
available.
