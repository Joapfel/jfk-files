CIA-IR-03 - Full Computer Search for List of HTLINGUAL 
_Files 
(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church 
Committees investigations, all HTLINGUAL files which 
were identifiable, as such, were destroyed under court 
order. Copies of materials from these files that may 
have been made prior to the destruction order and put 
into other files have, however, surfaced as files are 
reviewed. This includes material in the HSCA 
sequestered collection. 
(C) The DO ran a search on the term "HTLINGUAL. 
11 
Some records were identified as destroyed. Some were 
not so marked but are not locatable under the job 
number identified; however, given that there is no 
requirement to record destroyed records under the 
Federal statutes for disposition programs and given 
limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is 
not uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified 
files because they had been the subject of Freedom of 
Information Act queries; however, these were not 
HTLINGUAL files per se, but files which contained the 
F0IA requester queries for HTLINGUAL information. 
(U) ARRB staff member Michelle Combs has reviewed 
the HTLINGUAL file run and has selected some folders 
for review. OIM has identified that they have only 
redacted records for the large FOIA case that is 
listed. IMS/ESG/HCS is retrieving its records for 
unredacted copies of the records and will make them 
available.
