While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the 
~t effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in 
mo.. d 'b d b ' • h Mexico. He has been escri e as eing ~it ou~ mor~ls, 
education, and manners. Shortly after his arrival in 
Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of 
prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with 
some locals. It appears.this incident did not affect his 
position in _Mexico City, despite the fact that it 
received a good deal of press coverage. 
we are aware oniy that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in 
June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there 
now. 
Although our file indic~tes that Kostik0v may have 
been a member of Department 13 {Executive Action) 
(Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to 
confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB 
has not engaged in such executive action since 1959.
