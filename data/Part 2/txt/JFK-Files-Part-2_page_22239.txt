OCCURRENCE: 
Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only' back­
ground memorandum requested by Ros;well Gilpatric, information was requested 
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant 
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans­
were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation 
was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba, 
although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside. Two action teams 
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting 
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)* 
*!NB: A hand-written note next to the above statement by Lansdale reads,"Havvy/
