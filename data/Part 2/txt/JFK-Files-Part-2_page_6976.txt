before, including information derived from intelligence sources and methods. 
While some historians have been critical of the resources devoted to this 
particular effort, I like to believe that a breakthrough had to be achieved 
somewhere, and in fact, the records pertaining to President Kennedy's 
assassination make an excellent demonstration project of what can now be 
released. The lines drawn by the review board should prove helpful as the 
government undertakes to declassify the vast body of records generated during 
the Cold War. 
Finally, I'd like to say the entire history of the federal government's efforts 
in the wake of the assassination, including the experience of the review board, 
serves as a cautionary tale. Perhaps it will enable the government to strike a 
better balance between secrecy and disclosure in the future, for there exists no 
better example of the heavy wages of doubt, suspicion and public cynicism 
exacted by secrecy than the Kennedy assassination experience. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
