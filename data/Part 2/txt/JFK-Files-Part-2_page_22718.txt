or counterespionage case, the authorities, as I understood it 
then, might require the Director to go outside the Agency to 
the White Bouse or the Attorney General and so forth. 
Alternatively, we in the CI Staff might be directed to 
coordinate this with tho FBI. We would go to the FBI, explain 
the case and so forth. The FDI would then go to the Attorney -i 
the Department of Justice and get authorities, whatever 
authorities they would require in order to pursue the investi­
gations, conduct the case, and do it according to whatever 
stipulations that the Department of Justice· would put on it 
I 
in order to either neutralize the suspected spy or agent, anJ/or 
conclude th~ case by prosecution. 
And I am talking now of primarily in terms of a serious 
counterespionage case involving an American citizen.

operations? 
Mr. Angleton. I know of cases, yes . 
I-Ir. ,Johnson. /\nd what would the approval system be?
