WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL, ALGIERS - 1965 
. The 9th Communist sponsored WYF, after early 
speculation as to the probable site at which it ~ould be 
held, was finally announced for Algeria from 27 huly to 
6 August 1965. This WYF, however, was cancelled! in late 
June 1965 despite the advance planning and arrangements 
that had gone into it. j 
An August 13, 1964, memo from Morse Allen t~ C/SRS, 
Subject: 9th WYF, concerns what, if anything, SRS and/or 
Wiley might do regarding the probable holding of! a 9th 
WYF during the summer of 1965. Wiley had sever all weeks 
earlier reminded Allen that he, Wiley, had attended the 
last one at Helsinki and had been active in the I 
"disruption of that festival." Wiley wanted to know if 
SRS had any planned operations in connection wit~ 9th 
or had SRS given any thought to setting up some ;p1a·ns. 
He pointed out that it would take considerable .dime to 
~A==~~2 ~~~~~ f0r a~0ther penetration effort. ~llen told 
Wiley that \Viley was r..:oo c,lJ. anG. t::,~ :·:ell kr.0 1,rn i::o

said Wiley could, however, organize and direct it, possibly 
from with out the area, if it were decided for SRS to ta1~-~ 
part. Wiley indicated that he would be perfectlly willing 
to commence working on it and to direct the opetiations 
from behind the scenes. Allen asked Wiley to w~ite up an~ 
submit a proposal regarding same if he had a chance. 
Allen suggested to C/SRS that the matter of pen~tration 
and a disruptive effort in connection with the ~th WYF 
be given consideration in the near future. 
An October 1, 1964, memo for the record by Morse Allen 
records an interview he had with Wiley on 30 Segtember 1964. 
One long paragraph titled "Communist Youth Fest~val, 
Algiers, July 1965" - notes that Wiley had speaFheaded 
anti-Communist attacks on Youth Festivals in ViJnna and in 
Helsinki previously, has disrupted their programs, and has 
to a considerable extent interfered with their propaganda 
at thes~ festivals. Because of this, Wiley is interested 
once again in divisive and disruptive efforts against 
the Communists in Algiers in 1965. This time Wiley states
