Howard--
SELECT COMMITTEE TO 
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH 
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
(PURSUANT TO S. Rl!S, 21, UTH CONGRESS) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510 
In re your "battle plan" memo to Hart 
and Garn, I think you should consider possible 
wiscbm of our Committee making some kind of 
very low-key anouncement that we're doing 
something. Purpose would be two-fold--to 
prevent getting wholly co-opted by new 
House Committee (and agencies making a 
claim that since House is doing it, they can 
ignore us---also to put House on notice there 
is specific area we have carved and will 
continue to carve out for ourselves). Most 
important, we must do something a·ff:trmative t 
insure that the scurces out there come to us. 
If we say nothing, potentials which just go 
to House.under assumption that that's the onl 
thing going on. 
Attached is the type of low-key someone· 
could sayJ in response to an inquiry (which 
I.assume Spencer gets:lots of).
