PASSING I1Hi'OR11ATION IN DOUBLE AGENT OPERJ,TIONS

is frequently passed either to build up a ~ouble agent's stature 
or as evidence of espionage activity. 
b. Each case must be carefully evaluated to make certain that a net 
gain accrues to the U. s. 
c. The information which is passed should be c~.refully handled and 
appropriate explanations created for its acquisition by the double 
agent to avoid his compromise. 
2. Locating information to pass 
Wherever possible the field office handling the double agent should 
locate appropriate informa·tion to be passed; however, the Bureau can 
assist in fulfilling requests for information in possession of 
Government agencies, 
3. Obtaining Bureau authority 
Bureau authority must be obtained to pass any information in a double 
agent operation except: 
a. Newspaper articles 
b. Magazine articles 
o. Pamphlets, brochures, etc., prepared by a private company or corporation 
for distribution or sale to the public. (This does not· include highly

limited use by engineering staffs and not intended for release to the 
public.) .
