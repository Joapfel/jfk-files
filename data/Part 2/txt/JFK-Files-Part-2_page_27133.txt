SECRET SENSITl!ff; 
was responsible for the breaking of many espionage cases in 
the West, but equally important he divulged Soviet plans, 
strategy and organization effected in 1959 by the KGB under 
the auspices of the Central Committee which in turn mapped 
out in partnership with other services of the Bloc a pro­
gram of action -whose principal targets were the isolation 
of the U.S. as the "Main Enemy" and the ultimate change in 
the balance of military power in favor of the Soviet Bloc. 
During the later tenure of Mr. Hoover, which was 
fraught with difficulties between the FBI and members of 
the Senate, and included other changes hampering or limit­
ing the FBI's ability to conduct internal security opera­
tions, the hard issues of disagreement were never dealt 
with on an agency-to-agency basis. To the contrary, as 
the Commission is well aware, there was eventually a break­
down in liaison across the board between departments and 
agencies of the Government with the FBI (with the exception 
of the White House). Further, the internal disputes within 
the Bureau challenging Mr. Hoover's leadership were extremely 
detrimental to any objective consideration concerning the 
national security, and consequently years were lost in 
pursuing the national counterintelligence objective. 
During this period, in our view, national estimates and 
evaluations were formulated in concrete 'establishment of 
detentist philosophy which marked the real state of 
Soviet Bloc subversion in the secret war.
