previously obtained State Department ·clearance for investigation and 
interview of the individual considered as a potential s.o:urce without 
revealing to State the purpose of same. Recently State declined qlearance 
for interviews with individuals e·mployed at three embassies although 
clearance had earlier been obtained ·from State to investigate these • 
individuals. -In order to eliminate wasted investigative effort on 
source development in an establishment at which State will not give 
clearance for interview, since J.J:zy, 1958, we have cleared our intentions 
with State Department before authorizing Field to expend investigative 
effort in developing sources in a particular f t:eld. (lfemorandum Donahoe · 
to Belmont 5/16/58). 2.'hat.memorandum also stated that we should concentrat 
in this regard on a controlled selection of specific "trouble-spot" 
countries where a program of source development is warranted. 
• In this regard the existing critical pol {tica·l situation in 
the Far East definitely warrants that we continue our efforts to· 
develop saurces at .. all official establishments in the u.s. of lvational ist 
China.
