a.. Recei.pts should be of such a nature that they wil::. ·be self-sufficient 
so that, if it becomes necessary to introduce receipts in evidence, 
they will not relate to other documents or files. 
b. Receipts should clearly show: 
!
ll Date on which payment was made 
2 Period for which made when informant is paid on period basis 
3 Total amoun:t paid broken dovm into separate amounts for services 
or expenses where pertinent 
(4) Name of Agent making payment 
(5) Signature of person receiving money 
c. Receipts are not to be witnessed by another.Agent. 
d. If necessary to make corrections on receipts, they must be initialed 
by informant and not by Agent .. 
e. When transmitting receipts and itemized statements of expens·es to 
Bureau, staple them directly to blue slip, leaving margin of one 
to one and one-half inches at top .to ·avoid contact with Acco fastener 
punch. Place staples so that date or other data appearing on··. 
receipt will not be mutilated and all information· on receipt can be 
_ easily read without detaching it from blue slip. 
6. Income tax returns 
a. .Advise informants who receive compensation for their. services to Bu­
reau that such compensation must be reported as income when filing an 
income tax return. . 
b. Bureau income s~ould be set forth on Federal income tax return, form 
1040, as income received from other sources for personal services 
rendered through a private enterprise or similar general term applicable 
to informant's position and station in.life. 
c. If informant is self-employed and files schedule C as self-employed 
individual, it may be possible to include his Bureau income with his 
self-employed income from other sources without reveal~ng connection 
with Bureau . 
d. If informant cannot repor.t payments received ·from Bureau: for services 
without jeopardizing his security as informant, such payments will be 
subject to 20 per cent withholding tax. There are four categories of 
circumstances in which taxes will not be withheld. Taxes are not. 
to be withheld fr-om payments made (1) to other than security in­
formants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under 
SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able to report . 
Bureau income on their Federal tax returns without jeopardizing their 
security or without challenge from Internal Revenue Service. Each 
office has detailed instructions and exhibits concerning procedure to 
be followed in handling and control of money withheld .. 
e. When informant or former informant is initially considered as potenti~l 
witness in Bureau case, determine whether he paid Federal and state 
taxes on income he received from Bureau for his services. If ~uch 
taxes have not been paid, obtain all pertinent details and promptly 
submit recommendations for handling situation. 
7. Stipulation re payments made to witnesses 
a. In trials in which informants, former informants, or other persons 
who were paid sums of money are prospecti-ve witnesses, Bureau must

by prospective witnesses. Original receipts and set of photostats 
will be transmitted to field office in whose territory trial will

ment attorney which individuals are to be used as witnesses. There­
