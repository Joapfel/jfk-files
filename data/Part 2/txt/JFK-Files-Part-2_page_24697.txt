plan (Hedgrnan, 8/21/75, pp. 63.:.64) .• He stated that he consulted 
with Congolese officers about the possible routes Lurnurnba might 
take to Stanleyville, but he was "not a major assistance" in track­
ing down Lurnurnba prior.to his capture (Hedgman, S/21/75, p. 65). 
Despite the fact that O'Donnell had planned to draw Lurnurnba 
.out of m;i. custody and turn him .,over to Conp;olese authorities, he 
insisted that Lumurnba·escaped by his own devices and was not.tricked 
by the CIA (O'D6nnell, 9/11/75; p. 22). 
(b) Transfer of Lurnumba to Katanr,a 1·1here He Was Killed: 
January 17, 1960 
The contemporaneous cable traf fie shows that. the CIA was 
kept informed of Lumurnba' s condition and movementf; in January of 
1961 by the Congolese and that the CIA still considered Lumumba 
a serious political threat. But there is no direct evidence of 
CIA involvement in bringing about Lurnumba's death·in i,;atanga . 
. * Exc~rpts from cable traffic of January 1961 and from the 
testimony of CIA officers Hedgrnan, Tweedy, O'Donnell, and Helms 
(investigative report) should be inserted.
