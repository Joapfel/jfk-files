Lawrence Houston, retired General Counsel of the Agency, testi­
fied that his office instigated the establis·hment of MHMUTUAL. This 
was because his staff would be the repository of all problems related 
to the death or disability of a person during the course of his 
Agency work. These problems were all handled in what Houston called 
,a very "sketchy way" and this was simply undesirable from all 
points of view. Moreover, when the Agency went into air proprie­
taries on a large scale there were certain risks which simply 
could not be underwritteri,commercially. 
So somewhere in the late 1950s or around 1960, 
I think I was 'the one that posed that we might 
organize our own insurance entities. I had a 
couple of lawyer fri~nds deep in the insurance 
business, and I suggest I talk to one of them, 
and he promptly said, well, it so happens that 
I have a couple of offshore insurance entities 
that I can make available to you. And we took 
a look at them. It looked like they were or­
ganized properly for the purpose. They cost 
practically nothing. They were just shells. 
But they could be filled out .. So if my recol­
lection is correct, we acquired these two as the 
first step in what became the MUTUAL project. 
Simultaneously, the decision was made that if the Agency was going 
to maintain such a capability, 
they had to have enough body and backstopping so 
that if a suspicious foreign intelligence outfit 
tried to investigate, they would stand up under 
investigation as would any normal insurance outfit. 
In other words, they had to appear to have finan­
cial stability, they had to have names that could 
stand up and answer questions. and in other words 
appear to be in the normal business of writing the 
type of annuities (and) insurance, death.and dis­
ability. 
This concept was totally organized originally then under the Domestic 
Operations Division. DOD eventually recommended that the complex
