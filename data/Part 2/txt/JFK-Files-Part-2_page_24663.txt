sent in a channel that was even more closely restricted than the 
normal CIA,cable traffic (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 22, 32-33). Tweedy 
said destruction of ~uch cable traffic.would have been left to the 
discretion of the Chief of Station and he did not know whether 
Hedgman destroyed the Station's copies (Tweedy, 9/9.; p. 22). 
Tweedy said "I would. be sur-prised .if I• di-dr..' t," have a conver­
sation with Sidney Gottlieb about i•anything in his inventory that 
could possibly be used, including lethal biological substances 
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp.·. 68-69). Tweedy "suspected'' that "the first 
conversation along these lines would undou~tedly have been held 
between Dick Bissell and Sidney Gottlieb," which Tweedy then would 
have ''followed-up" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 69). 
Tweedy maintained that the period in which he explored the 
means of ac.cess for assassinating Lumumba remained "a planning 
interval and at no point can I recall that I ever felt it was im­
minent that somebody would say 'go''' (Tweedy, 9/9. pp. 18-19): 
Tweedy. It was always my assumption that at the 
time anything like this should occur there would 
have been some kind of real focus on the problem 
at probably a very considerable policy level with-
.in the Agency. and it ·neve.r occurred to me that 
I would get a call or Bissell would ask me to come 
down to his office and sya go to it. Nor were we 
ever in a position where he said that I would. 
merely implement plan so-and-so. We never got 
that far. 
Q. You didn't have any ~ction plans for th~ 
assassination of Lumumba th.at you had prepared or 
were aware of? .
