nS0. Even President Johnson expressed his belief that Castro could have 
planned Kennedy's assassination 'in retaliation. See Hurt, supra-note 6, at 31 
(citing interview with Lyndon B. Johnson~ The CBS Evening News with Walter ./

Third, in appointing the Commission, President Lyndon Johnson had one goal: 
co check rumors that the assassination was a communist plot. n52 Johnson ,. 
appropriately feared that Kennedy's murder could precipitate World War III. n53 
Oswald's time in the Soviet Union and hie trip to visit the Soviet Embassy .. in 
Mexico City just weeks before ·the murder pointed to Communist intrigue. n54 ~h., 
concerns were amplified because Oswald had identified himself vith~ the Faix- ~iay j 
. for Cuba Committee, an organization openly supportive of Caacro and'~harply 
critical of Kennedy's CUba policy. n55 Thus, Che Commission was wider enor111oue 
pressure to produce an answer chat discounted foreign influence. n56

Fourth, as the science of forensic analysis has progressed over che past 
three decades, questions have inevicablyarisen about the Warren Commission's 
conclusions involving the President's body, n57 the alleged tnurder weapon, n58 
the number and sequenc;ing of the shots [•101 fired at the President, n59 and 
che condition of the so-called nmagic bullet,n whic:h passed through cile 
President and Governor John comially with a minimum amounc of damage·. n60 We now 
know that the autopsy perfo:rm~d on the President was problematic,· both in 
technique and organization. n.61 Yet, the C:on1111ission relied on it. On.ocher 
matters, new forms of analysis have been generally supportive of the 
Commission's findings; although ic now appears tllat the sequencing of the shots 
fired in Dealey Plaza was somewhac different from that d.escribed·by the 
Commission. n62 Ironically, even when the latest tec~iques cor.. [•11] 
roborate the Commission's findings, the result has not been greater confidence 
in those findings, but rather, a belief that the Commission got it wrong instead 
of almost getting it right. n63
