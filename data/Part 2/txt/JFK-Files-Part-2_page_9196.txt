RE: ·MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN 
'hear that 15 out of 17 convicted traitors since 1945 
have been Jews? (Of course, 17 out of 17 members of 
the Mafia are Italians). Or that Jews run the NAACP 
(PRE31 Sidney Fineberg), CORE, etc? Or that three 
Russian Jews own ABC. CBS, and NBC (For a record of 
their activities see •None Dare C~ll it Treason')? 
Vlhat he~said that really hit me between the eyes, 
though, was when he referred to the 6 million Jews 
Hitler allegedly gassed: 'Dont' you think those people 
DID something'? 
"Wha·t really drove his point home to me, however, was a 
full page ad in our city newspaper- 'Six Reasons Why 
You Should Worry About Extremism' Put out by the National 
Council for Civic Responsibility (A very left-wing 
outfit). Most' of ~he people listed as directors, etc· 
of the organization were you-know-what. Seems they're 
scared stiff of the John Birch 3ociety, etc., because 
they'·might repeal the inconie tax and impeach Earl 
Warren. It's too bad they didn't mention us Nazis-
we're not going to impeach Earl Warren when Rockwell 
gets to be President in '72. We're going to hang him. 
"Sure will be glad when I get back to the states. All 
the girls over here are a bunch of coon-loving bleeding 
• hearts and i·t makes my Alaban1a blood boil. 
"ls there any race problem in Colorado? My buddy in the 
photo is going there in a year or two and if there's 
a demand fo~ ~hite men to stand up to the racemixers 
I might go with him. T~1e way the Negroes are pushing 
now we're headed for ~- full-scale racial war: I don't 
want to be left out when it starts. 
"You sure got over on your jail time. I got six months 
in the stockade once for just having a pistol. Colorado 
must be-a swinging state.
