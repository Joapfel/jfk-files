Welcome back! Here are the two letters we received from the LBJ Library with 
the listed materials attached. We can process these documents as assassination records 
by designating only the sections of the reports/checklist/memoranda that are 
assassination related and declaring the rest NBR. We could include a short 
memorandum which explains that these documents are compilations of lots of issues, 
and the NBR redactions are unrelated to the assassjnation. ff these materials are about 
to be released under the Executive Order and there are no redactions in the 
assassination related parts, the Board will probably not need to see them. 
As lorig as you are talking to the Executive Order folks, there were additional 
materials (beyond the~ones specified in these letters) which the LBJ Library sent to CIA 
and I reviewed early last spring. Some of those items also could be designated as 
assassination records. I can give you a copy of the list if you don't have it. It would be 
nice to know what has happened to these materials too. 
Thanks for checking on this issueilimrfi:tii~RQI.Ks~2 ff this issue is settled, 
CIA-9 may be close to completion.
