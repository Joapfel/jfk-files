/ with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact 
l LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that 
BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently 
"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of 
the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet 
have not met should not b~ construed to mean that LEVISON 
has refused to confer with DAVIS. As NY 694-S* understands 
the situation, DAVIS ha,B been awaiting contact by LEVISON, 
and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS. 
Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to 
expect that the other would make the first move in an effort 
to establish contact. NY 694-S* believes that probably the 
reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements 
for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that· 
HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting 
between LEVISON and DAVIS. 
NY 694-S-K· has never obtained any information re­
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to 
Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party 
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member, 
there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is 
no longer an ideological Communist. 
JACK talked to LE;"1 HARRIS yesterday who said he 
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial 
.hello which was a change from the past when he was cool. 
LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him 
and would like to see him :immediately to which LEVENSON said, 
11I would like very much to see you but I don 1 t have the time 
now. I 1m leaving and paclcing for a trip. I will p,e glad to 
see you in six weeks." 
LEVENSON implie,:. that he was going to Ecuador but 
LEM doesn I t know why. Th1:ire was no anger ~own, and LEVENSON 
will see LEM when he retu::11s in six weeks. )
