Tweedy might have been unaware of the true ·purpose of Gottlieb's 
visit (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 20-22). 
Bissell did not recall cables concerning the dispatch of a 
messenger and subsequently confirming that his instructions were 
to be followed, but he said "This sounds highly likely. I 
would.expect, given the background, that the confirmation would. 
have been forthcoming" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 43). 
It was "very probable," according to Bissell, that he discussed 
the assassination of Lumumba with Sidney Gottlieb, who was then 
his Science Advisor (Bissell, 9/10, p. 14). Bissell said that on a 
number of occasions he discussed with Gottlieb "the availability 
of means of incapacitation, including ~ssassination'' (Bissell, 9/10, 
p. 60). 
Although he had no "specific recollection," Bissell assumed 
that, if Gottlieb went to the Congo, he.had approved the mission, 
(which "might very well" have dealt with the assassination of 
Lumumba) (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 18, 20, 44).. Desp_ite his absence of 
specific recollection of these events, Bissell said, "There is 
nothing in mind that I remember that would be .in conflict" with.the 
testimony of the Chief 6f Station that Gott1ieb carried poisons to 
the Congo (Bis~ell, 9/10, p. 35), 
Bissell testified that it wonld not have been against CIA policy 
in the fall of 1960 to send poisons to the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).
