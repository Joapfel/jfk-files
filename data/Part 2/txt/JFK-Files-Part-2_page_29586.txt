HSCA Deposition of .B. Manel.~, 4/28/78, pp. 51-52. .-The 
HSCA has requested a copy of any internal regulations 
or any liaison agreement 1iith the Federal Bureau _of 
Investigation that may ha·,e been in existence in 1963. 
(Letter tb Breckinridge, 7/20/78.) The CIA iesponded 
"tha t there are not now, : 1or were there . any, agreements 
between t~e CIA and FBI~-o~ other U.S. government agen­
cies concerning CIA respo1sibility to report on contacts 
of U.S. cutizens with Communist Embassies or officials ... 
The CIA under operative l?gislation has a counterintelli-. 
gence responsibility for :ounterintelligence cases 
but it is notamatter of ag ~eement with other agencies nor 
does it concern simple co1tacts of Americans abroad with 
Communist Embassies or ofEicials." (Memorandum to 
Breckinridge from Shepane(, 7/31/78.)

graph to Oswald by including the description in the 
cable that reported Oswald's contact.with the Soviet Em­
bassy has created more ccnfusion and controversy than 
perhaps any other CIA related issue stemming from as­
