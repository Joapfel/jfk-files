Springfields did go in. 
Mr. diGenova. Could he have found out about this after 
the fact from people that he knew in Cuba, members of the 
resistance in Cuba that he knew of who woulrl have told him the 
nature of the items that they would have received in a cache 
delivery? Would that be one way that he could have found out? 
.. 
Was he that intimately involved, to your knowledge? 
Mr. Halley. He was not. at the time. This is thP. period 
that I am familiar with, '62-'65. I do not know. Maybe some 
10 of these people have come out since then, and ma;be he has 
11 talked to people who have come out in 1 68, '69, things like that 
12 I cannot exclude that. 
13 At the time,, I do not think, however, he would have had 
14 that kind of firsthand knowledge, anrl therefore I have trouble 
15 with that statement and I cannot identify with it.

Mr. Baron. The Harper's article says: "By the end of 
1961, several men affiliated with the CIA had already been 
foiled in attempts to kill him" -- meaning Castro -- "among 
them, Luis Toroella, executed; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, still in 
.prison; lvilliam Morgan, executed; and Antonio Veciana, escarerl. 
to the Unit.ed States. Had these men succeeded, their effort.s 
would have been tied to the U.S. only indirectly, if at all." 
Let me show you the passage I am reading fror.t and ask 
you whethtr you have any knowledge of the ccnnection of any of 
those mer. namerl to the CIA.
