i\ 8. Problems With Congress 
{ Q. Mr, President, Charles Kirbo, your 
-;: friend Charles Kirbo seems to feel that 
\you're going to be having a oontlni.Iing 
·,;'problem with. the Congress and that 
i _: you'll have to go over Congress.'s head -
,, to. the peopl~ in order to get results. 
-:., Is this true? 
. • A. I think if you read the whole 
< statement that Mr. Kirbo made, which 
:. is just a priivate citizen's opinion, he 
\ would say that every President has had 
/ arguments and debates and disagree­
: ment.s .. with the Congre·ss. And I think 
• that's inevitable in our system of Gov­
ernment. That's part of the checks and 
balances that's very precious to us all. 
• I have found up t6 now a growing. 
. sense of cooperation with the Congress. 
I think last week when I was a,~ked 
·roughly the same question that the 
troubles were perhaps underestimated 
by the news media. I think now per-
But I will work with Congress on 
the deregulation, of natural ga_s as a 
part ,of an overall energy policy. By 
Ap-ril 20 I think we'll be prepared to 
present to- you, the news media; and 
the people and the Congress more 
specific proposals involving direct 
:legislation proposa'ls that wm answer 
your question more fully, . 
13. Energy Program Sacrifices 
Q. Mr. President, w'e've been told that 
the central thrust· of your new energy 
• progriam • will involve sacrifice and 
voluntary conservation, yet the public's. 
always reading stories in the paper of 
pow the major oil companies are with­
holding natural gas. So I'd hke to ask 
how are you going to expect the public 
to make sacrifices when there's such 
widespread pub>lic suspicion. aibo.ut the 
role of the oil companies in the energy 
crisis. ' 
A I think the comprehensive nature 
of the proposal that takes iri all these 
very disparate and sometimes conflict­
ing elements at one time and a long­
range projection of our needs and a 
tangible demonstration to _the Ameri~ 
• can people, to the extent that I'm able 
to put it forward, that there will be 
direct ultimate benefits to them will 
. be the elements that will· cause them· 
to make those sacrifices. At the same 
time, Twa:nt to increase the surety that 
we have that the reserve sup))'ly data 
given to us by the oil companies and 
others are accurate. 
We are now conducting some admit­
tedly superficial studies by. Secretacy 
Cecil Andrus in Interior and also they'll 
be followed up by more detaJled studies 
under Dr. Schlesinger, to see whether 
or not the reserve supplies are ade­
quate and· whether or not the oll com­
panies ate giving us accifrate data. I 
think it's obvious to all of Us that there 
are .some instances where natural gas 
is withheld from the market. That's 
understandable. If I was running an 
oil company I would reserve the right 
to release or to reserve some supplies 
of natural gas. 
With the em.ergency' legislation that 
the Congress did .pass, I think in about 
a week of assessment during the frigid 
part of the winter-it's still very cold­
v.,e were given some authority to buy . 
extra gas at a very high price. This 
is obviously a transcient circumstance. 
But I believe the American people 
will be willing to make. the sacrifices 
required,_ if they are convinced that fu. 
ture reports will be accurate, that sup­
plies will riot be withheld from the mar­
ket and if we can 1et the oil companies 
know in a predictable way what_ our 
policy will be two months or two years 
or ·20 years 'in the fu'ture-within the 
bounds of human reason-then I think 
•. haps the troubles with the congress 
• ,are overestimated. I have frequent 
,; meetings with the Congressional lead­
; ers bbth Democratic. and Republican. 
\' And i think th~t the progress of the 
/, leiislation ·that we consider to be cru­
!,' cial which seemed to be moving vr:ry 
·• slowly in the past •is no,v speeding up. '·. 
So I don't believe that we'll have 
•• nearly the problems with the Congress 
> that has been the ca_sc in recent years. 
they'll be much less likely to withhold 
supplies of oil and natural. gas from 
the .market just hopirig that they'll get 
. And I have to • say in summary that 
• I;am very pleased with my relationship 
with the Congress now. • 
•· 9. The Electio1i Prt1cess 
Q. Mr. President, in view of your 
assignm·ent to Vice President Mondale 
._ regartj.ing the election laws, could_ you 
; g!ve _us .Y?ur _ vie:V,. s_ir, on t~~-_d.1!.::t 
sonte bonan~a ilicreased. pr-ice in the 
future if the policies do change . 
14. Rise in Gasoli11e Tax 
, Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri­
fices that you say your upcoming ener­
gy program is going to demand. Is it 
likely that one of· those sacrifices. is 
going to -come in the form· of ,a largely 
increased Federal gasoline tax? . 
A. I don't know how to answer vour 
·; . , ... """"': 
was a waste. You also promised td dJ: •• 
the waste out of the defense budg~1!,.! 
When woulcl you expect to sto,p 
production of the B--1 as opposed to 
research and· development on the B-1? 
A. I think I cut out about more than , 
$200 millio'i1 from the B-1 program-,in:,j 
the budget just submitted to the Con~:'.. 
gress. I have serioos questions about 1 
whether or not the B-1 ought to be • 
in the future the center of our airborne, : 
defense capability. . ' :'. >·. i 
''i--l1ave several more months before, i 
I have to make a decision on that mat.,~;: 
ter and the National Security Council,,; 
which combines, as you know, State,:• 
Treasury, Defense and ·o.ther clements.,! 
of the Government, working very clos:e~:, 
ly with me, is now making a complete ' 
reassessment of the need for the :I!~l; 
bomber. " ~,,: 
I don't know whether WC will deci~e: 
to go on with it or not. And I don',!>; 
know whether we'll expedite produ.c~ 
tion of it or not, at this time. ,, : 
Part of the factor to be assessed ,is. 
the attitude of the Soviet Union: lf-·we
0 
can have ,a general lessening of tension,;, 
a demonstrated commitment on the-ir•· 
part toward dis-armament, it would cer,"'. 
tainly make it less likely that we woulcl 
go ahead wdth the B-1. , ,;;, 
Bi.!tl can't answer that question untif' 
I complete my own study, a~d I thlnlci 
that would have to be terminated ·by·

18. Campaign Financing Law .. ; 
Q. Mr. President, I wa~ a little und~~'f: 
abo,ut what you're gomg to propo,se: 
in the campaign finance law. Are ,Y,()I~. 
saying that you wi'll l?ropose t? l\,ijV~

-Q. Is that what Y?U will. propp~e ,J:o 
Congress? A. The Vice President 1s·n~W. 
doing a study o·n a complete elect10n 
law package, And I'd like to resei:v.~ • 
my own judgment until I see wh~~ his_ 
report is to me. But that's my _b.wn 
inclination. It's a position that I took 
during the campaign and so far .I ·Ji~j/f 
no reason to change my mind. • . , :

"'. 
... ::,. ' 
Q. You gave us a kind of a timetaMe·· 
for your domestic program in yonr .pre­
liminary statement. I wonder if _you 
have a similar timetable of what you 
hope to achieve in foreign policy be­
•tween now and the end of the year, 
• such as Middle East peace, Cyprus, .. the 
treaty with Panama. , . .,, ... ". 
A. Of course I can't answer. that 
question specifically because I don\t 
know what cooperation we will get 
from other nations and I don't know, 
what the inclination of those nations 
in disputed regions of lhe world w.aiit 
to do toward one another. . . 
Secretary Cyrus ·vance !,as ju,sl.,~e~ 
turned from what I consider to be a 
very successful trip to the Middle East., 
He not only probed with the heads- of, 
those Governments and <their Cabinpt_. 
members their own positions, both pulw 
lie and private on the controvcrsiiJ:I, 
issues that have so far prevented_-,a, 
• peace in the Middle East. He al;;o ha'cf 
a chance to compare their positiQn9 
on issues-which_ ones they found to 
.be in harmony, which/ones ther.e was
