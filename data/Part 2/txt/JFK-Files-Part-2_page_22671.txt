Mr. Schwarz. ·And provided false information? 
Now, is it your current understanding that what was

have recounted that he was providing false information? 
Mr. Angleton. I don't think the Warren Commission was 
ever faced with the issue of the internal issues of GolitiJ~-,/ 
or Nosenko. 
Mr. Schwarz. You first said that the information was 
suppressed from the Warren Commission, and then you said no,

the usefulness of the material? 
Mr. Angleton. That is right -- and not to do what the

record and documents and articles, and so on. 
Mr. Schwarz. 13ut your current understanding is that the 
information was rrovided? 
Mr. Angleton. That was classified, and never came out in
