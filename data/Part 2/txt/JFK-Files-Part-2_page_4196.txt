MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Meeting with the President, 11:00 a. m., November 30th, 
in attendance Mr. Bundy, meeting lasted approximately 
11/2 hours 
r..;, 98' 1. Reviewed the Checklist., L!he President immediately 
raised the question of what we were doing about Colonel Chennault. 
He expects most serious public reaction and has a feeling that we 
are "drifting" on this situation. I assured him we and the Venezuelan 
government were doing all that was possible. However, he requested 
more positive action on a report on the actions being taker0 
NOTE: Wish a full report from the station for Sunday 
morning briefing. 
2. No other Checklist items raised any serious questions. 
3. The President again raised the question of what we were 
going to do in Cuba. Bundy advised that a policy meeting was scheduled 
for Monday, time not set, to discuss Cuban policy. I pointed out to 
the President the statements of President Kennedy on September 5th, 
September 13th, and November 20th, 1962 and then I showed the evidence 
that proved absolutely that arms had been imported into Venezuela from 
Cuba. I stated that most positive efforts should be made immediately 
to secure complete OAS agreement on a course of action which would 
involve a series of steps ranging from economic denial through blockade 
and even to possible invasion, but that it must be OAS action, otherwise 
it would involve confrontation with Khrushchev. I stated that if the 
action was a Hemispheric action I didn't see that the USSR could do 
much about it. The President agreed but decided to await the policy 
meeting on Monday. 
NOTE: DD/P and WH should prepare full recommendations 
for positive actions which might be taken unilaterally with 
the Caribbean states or with the OAS, for my use in the 
policy meeting.
