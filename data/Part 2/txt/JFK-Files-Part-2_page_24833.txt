The False Flaggers were compartmented from each other and reported 
separately on their contacts to a "deep cover" CIA officer in Santiago 
who in turn reported to the Station. According to the testimony of the 
Chief of Station, they received their instructions from Washington and 
not from him. (Chief of Station testimony (Felix), August 1, 1975, p. 27) 
E. Chief of Station 
Although most of the Station officers in Santiago did not know of 
Track II, the Chief and Deputy Chief of Station were knowledgeable and 
the Chief of Station initiated contacts on his own with Chilean officers. 
The COS has testified that he regarded Track II as unrealistic: 
I had left no doubt in the minds ~f my colleagues 
and superiors that I did not consider any kind of 
intervention in those constitutional processes 
desirable .... And one of the reasons certainly for my 
last recall (to Washington) was to be read the riot 
act--which was done in a very pleasant, but very 
intelligible manner. Specifically, I was told at 
that time that the Agency was not too interested in 
continuously being told by me that certain proposals 
which had been made could not be executed, or would 
be counterproductive. (Chief of Station (Felix) 
testimony, August 1, 1975, p. 10) 
The Chief of Station's objection to Track II did not go unnoticed. 
The following instruction to the COS was sent on October 7: "Report 
should not contain analysis and argumentation but simply report on 
action taken." (Headquarters 612, 7 October) Very simply, Headquarters 
wanted the Station to take orders quietly as was the Agency itself.
