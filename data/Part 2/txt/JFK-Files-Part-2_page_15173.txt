• EXECUTIVE ASSIGNI\IBNT SYSTEM 
_ Executive Order 11315 established an Executive 
Assignment System for filling positions in Grades· 16, 17, and 
18 of the General Schedule.· The FBI v,as specifically excluded. 
The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-
grade positions allofted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of· 
employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through 
18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill 
vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this 
inventory all such employees, including tl)ose in the FBI. This 
would make our executives available for consideration by other 
agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider • 
employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The 
Department, the ref ore, was requested by letter dated Decembe~ 21, 
1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request­
ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as 
retention by ihe FBI of its executives is considered essential. We 
have been following with the Departrnent but the matter has not yet 
been acted upon by the Attorney General ..
