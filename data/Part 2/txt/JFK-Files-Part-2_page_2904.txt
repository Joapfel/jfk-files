HM T-1 explained that when Dr, MIRO CARDONA ret_urned 
to MiaJ!li from a trip to Wnahington, D. c., on Sunday, wher~ he 
contacted high go,errunent officials, he came away with the 
feeling thatt 
1) The United Statea has no plan to rree Cuba 
or CollllDunism. 
2) 1r the United. States ever does ro·rmulate an7 
plans, it will do so without conoid.eration 
for the Cuban exiles in the United States. 
3) The united States policy is now one of 
peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba, 
MM T-1 said that 1n his opinion, the Cuban exiles 
are frustrated, confused, losing faith in the United States 
and there 1s a growing reeling of abandonment of them by the 
United States. 
The April 10, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald" 
carried a headline article entitled, "Miro Resigns as Exile 
Chief; Raps U. S. Polley". Thie article stated that MIRO 
CARDONA resigned because the United States refused to allocate 
fifty million d.:>llars to train a Cuban in•::;.sion force, according
