The one man who could be expected to 
ha•;e the most informed opinion regarding 
the work of the Warren Commission iS 
iormer Chief justice Earl Warren himself. 
He had declined to be inter,1ewed on the 
CBS program in 1967, but he did appe.1r 
on television in May, 1972. in an interview 
" ... we found no evidence 
of any kind that there was 
any conspiracy." 
There was very hard stress 
on "no evidence"

The stress was hard. As I had r.C\w come 
to expect, the word "nothing" seemed a 
partic .. !:=t'!y beautifwi exam;:::-ie of stress.

ary 19, 1970. Senator Richard 8. R•Jssell. 
a member of the Warreri Commissio:i. re­
vealed th?.t he had r.aver believed !hat Lee 
Harvey Os·,,.,a:d acted a,c,e. 
I had c'1arted the last of t:ie assassination 
tapes. Of course, these few :housand feet 
of recordir.g tape are only a srna:1 !rac:ion· 
of the relevant testimony recorded and 
stored away in the archives of ~elevision 
news departments. There is. ior exarnole. 
Lee Harvey Oswald. as he was :ed through 
the Dallas police station, denying that he 
had killed the Presiaent. There are state­
ments by Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby and 
by others. 
I have no doubt that with these tapes, 
a Psychological Stress Evaluator. and time 
to work on them, a very detai!ed picture 
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy 
could be reconstructed, a picture that might 
even reveal the identities of the assassins 
and their co-conspirators. I hope that sooner 
-----------------. or later someone does this. I have gone as 
which was part of a series called The Bran­
deis Teievision Recollections . . Bob Smith of 
the Committee provided me with the tape. 
The interview was an hour long, but the 
Kennedy assassinatlon and the Warren 
Commission came up only once. The inter­
viewer. Abram Sachar. Chancellor of Bran­
de:s University, was friendly and deferen­
tial. I charted some of War~en's remarks 
unrelatec to the assassination and found 
that he was generally unst~essed. Sachar 
raised the subject of the Commission 
obiiquely, and Warren vo!unteered several 
rather lengthy stateir.ents about it 
Warren said that immediately after tha as­
sassination there were ,wo theories. one that 
Khruslichev and Cas:ro v;ere behind the 
killing. the other that a grC'c!;) of right-wing 
Texas oilmen w~re responsible. He said: 
"We exp!ered both of those theories for 
ten months and found no evidence that 
either of them was involved in it.'' 
The PSE showed hard stress. 
He continued: 
" ... we found r.o evidence of any kind 
that there was any conspiracy." 
Again there was stress. and particulariy 
hard !'liress on th~ words "no evidence." 
"I have read ever~•thing." said Justice 
Warren, "that has come to my notice in the 
far as the private resources of a free-lance 
writer permit. 
What. given tile sample of testimony I 
have processed with the PSE. can I say 
about the assassination? 
We should first examine the testimony in 
which no stress was found. si:,ce it is almost 
certain that these people were telling the 
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests 
the following: 
1. Oswald owned a rifle. 
2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found 
on Governor Connally's stretcher at Park­
land Hospital. 
3. Bullet iragments alleged to have bean 
fo~nd in the presidantial limousine also 
came from Oswald's rifle. 
4. At least ooe eyewitness believes he 
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll. but 
another is equally certain no shots came 
from that direction. 
5. Oswald shat and killed 0:ficer Tippit!. 
6. At least one member of the Warren 
Commission and one member of the Com­
missioll'S staff really believe in the validity 
of the· Warren Report. 
7. Jim Garrison had little or no case 
against Clay Shaw. 
Almost all of this tends to support. in one 
way or another, the Warren Report But now
