After. the assassination. Rea jquarters asked Mexic·o City 
not to destroy any ~f the Soviet tapes fiom this opera­
tion. (DIR 87770, 12/9/63) A note.written by Ann Good­
pasture in 1963 seems to ~·onf irm Arehart' s assumption 
that the tapes were retaiaed at the station. 
(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring­
ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them ·are not 
.labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones 
return.) The storage problem 'is one for us and as 
the reels come in with transcript-ions, I store them. 
Whe_n we can erase therr, I' 11 take off the labels 
and send them back·out.

Emphasis added~ Mr. Areha1t was absolutely positive that 
Cuban t~pes were retainei for thirty days because he 
maintained them in the. s1,ecial. rack~ (Areha_rt Interview, 
6/2/78, p. 3·.) Hence, tl,e two week "usual practice" is 
probably not correct insc,far as the Cuban tapes are con­
cerned.
