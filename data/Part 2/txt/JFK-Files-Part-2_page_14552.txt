,Since 10-10-56 we have had a _program of develo_ping Holloman --
sources at official establishments in UoSc of various Arab Gaod
y --
nations and have developed over 10 excellent sources at these various 
establishments. In connection with this program, we rave.,?falways obtained \ 
State Department clearance for investigation and interview of the -\ 
indi_vidual considered as a _potential source without revealing to State 
the _pur_pose of sameo Although State to date has not dee.lined clearance 
for interview of any individual under development as a source at an \., 
Arab establishment, (recently State declined clearance for interviews with..-, ! 
individuals employed at Pakistani, German and Turkish embassies although\ 
clearance had earlier been obtained from State to investigate these 
individualso State Department's declination based primarily on fact 
these countries are friendly and if any interviews were reported to 
embassies diplomatic relations with country involved might be strainede \\

~ 
regard on a controlled selection of s_pecific "trouble-s.pot" countries i;;__ 
where program of source development is warranted. ' t 
In. this regard, the existing critical political situation in 
Middle East definitely warrants that we continue our efforts to develop 
sources at all official establishments in u.s. of following Arab(/.
