By earlyNovernber 1960, as the concept of the 
--~, 
operation was shifting from one of guerri:lla warfare 
and infiltration to invasicin, the staffing pattern 
for WH/4 was again increased. Mr. Bissell authorizing 
a total of 308 positions. Even as he signed the 
approval, however, Mr. Bissell noted his reservations, 
saying: 
I have signed this request to indicate 
my approval, but do so with a good deal of 
concern. I realize that this is a very 
major and top priority activity and I also 
realize that the senior officers engaged 
in it continue to be heavily overworked. 
On the other hand, I am fearful that the 
addition of large numbers of personnel will 
not in fact reduce the load on those indi­
viduals who·are most overworked, but may 
instead create additional burdens· of 
management without contributing signifi­
cantly to.the success of the underlying 
activities. I am concerned also that we 
may.be simply running, out of suitable 
people in the Agency in certain categories. 
Accordingly, I urge you to re-examine even 
the double-starred positions in the staff­
ing guide submitted with your request to 
see whether they are all in fact of a high 
,order of essentiality.* 129/ 
* Much of the staffing problem, of course, traces 
back to the failure of the DDP to insure early on that 
only the best· people'be assigned to the WH/4 project. 
As. early as August of 1960, it had.been indicated 
that the DDP might be leaning toward the use of 
directed assignments, but nothing ever came of this. 130/
