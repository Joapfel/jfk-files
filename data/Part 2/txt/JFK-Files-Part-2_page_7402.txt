for possible future reference and one copy should

b. It is recognized that the badge access and the 
length of the stey in the building by the staff' 
members m9¥ lead to unscheduled contacts .. If 
such contacts are connected with the official 
duties of the staff, then appropriate comments 
should be forwarded to SA/00/O on the form cited 
above. Officers should be careful not to allow 
conversations to drif't to areas of interest not 
covered by official interviews. If this does take 
place, however, we shall rely on the officer 
concerned to inform the SA/00/O of these develop­
ments. 
5. SECURITY 
The blue badge should be sufficient to indicate that· 
staff members should be treated as visitors in the 
presence of persons not connected with their official 
duties. Persons introduced under alias should be 
careful that the alias is protected if a chance 
meeting takes place in the presence of other col­
leagues. In this connection, persons interviewed 
should be careful not to expose associates who have 
not been interviewed.
