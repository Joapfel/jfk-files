MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Executive Committee Meeting - 12:30 p.m. - 29 March 1963 
IN ATTENDANCE: All present, plus Cottrell, Kaysen, Dungan and 
others 
The President raised the question of what should be our 
policy on hit-and-run raids and asked my views. I reported my 
views as per the attached memorandum of 29 March. Secretary 
Rusk stated that the United States would be blamed for unauthorized 
raids, the Soviets would expect that we could stop them and they 
would immediately take counter actions such as escorting ships, 
etc. On a minimum, we should act to disassociate ourselves 
and do all possible not to permit the continuance of unauthorized 
raids. 
Dillon stated that we could no·t stop them because of 
the number of ports, small ships, inadequate coast guard facilities, 
etc. McNamara countered by saying that we could stop them by 
utilizing military re sources. As a second alternative he suggested 
we might explore modifying our course of action and finally, should 
disassociate ourselves from responsibility. The Attorney General 
outlined various. step~ that could be taken to identify the leadership 
of the various groups and to either prosecute them or exclude them 
from the country through immigration procedures. Thompson and 
Harriman expressed particular concern over the reported airplane 
that was ready to bomb Soviet ship. Practically all in attendance 
thought that we should try and guide the operation away from attacks 
on Soviet ships because of obvious reaction of the Soviets. The 
Vice President felt that we would be criticized either from letting 
them go on the one hand, or stopping them on the other. He felt 
the military should immediately study that which should be done to 
stop them and all actions should be taken to halt the unauthorized 
raids.
