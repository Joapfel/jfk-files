suppose the same arguments could be used here on this matter. 
Mr. Kirbow. But the point I raised at the staff meeting 
just before the Committee came back, when the subject was 
raised, was did Admiral Raborn, as a retired military officer, 
I . currently in a civilian status, although he was former -- treak· 
any American law, or had they sold it to this, would it have 
been a violation of the law, and the answer was no .. 
If' he was involved -- or they knew of no law that he· 
had violated, and none is apparently cited in the record. 
Pressure was brought-to bear, there is no doubt about it, by 
Admiral Ra.porn. I think ·there's another example·~ 
sure whether Joe described it to me or someone else, of a 
very senior official out there dealing back with the Agency. 
I 
N_ow, the military, as Senator kart knows, is prohibited 
• I . . 
from this by regulations and I thin~ by law. I know that as a . . I 
I regular.military officer, you are not allowed to do .contractual 
I business with your agency forever, but with the other military 
I 
departments and the Department of Offense, I think you have to 
have a cleansing period of .five to keven years.
