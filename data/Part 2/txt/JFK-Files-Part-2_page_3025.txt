Gordon Gray and Allen Dulles had some differences 
of opinion concerning the advisability of reading other 
individuals into the act. Gray suggested that the 
President's Board of Consultants (later the President's 
Foreign.Intelligence Advisory Board) be made party to 
the discussions, but Dulles rather strongly suggested 
that there was a significant difference between the 
discussions which were intended for the Special Group 
5412 on co·vert Operations, and PFIAB responsibilities 
for general problems related to foreign intelligence. 
Dulles made the specific point that if the Board of 
Consultants was going to get involved in the details· 
of planned covert operations, they were then in a 
position of reviewing US foreign policy. The discus­
sion also seems to have verged on the right of Congress 
to attempt. to oversee covert operations -- a point 
about which Eisenhower expressed himself very strongly, 
noting that such action by Congress would be an in­
fringement of his prerogative as Commander-in-Chief .. 24/
