·souRCE U_S citizen, radiation physicist who at tended the Second International 
Congress on Radiation Protection, Brighton, UK, 3-8 May 70. 
l. The Soviet delegation to the Second Intemational Congress on Rad.iation 
Protection arrived several days late. As a consequence, the only presen­
ta.tion from the USSR personally attended was a paper: entitled, "Disorders 
in Embryonal Development of Rats after Injection of 1311 ," by A }1 Lyaginskayaf-' 
()YD Parev a.,d S ~~Sinitsyana. Since this sa.~e experiment ?as been co~ducted/. 
r on the human embryo,. there was really nothing new or even interesting 1.1: 
Lyaginskaya's presentation.

fi'.nilly panning to request membership in the International Radiation 
Protection Association (IRPA). 
3. The most interesting work presented at the meeting from a personal point 
of view was that of Professor J Lnfum3, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. He is ·: 
charged vith the responsibility· of eettlng the· plutori:!um protection· standards.-i­
and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Laf'uma's 
most impressive work involves the success he has bad in removing copious 
amounts o~ plutonium and other transuraniu.n products from humans using D'l'PA; 
4. Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only 
two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhnlation and wounds. 
His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier trcntmcnt is begun the 
better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an 
area of the body exposed to plutonium th.rough cont:act or a wound than to 
remove it from the· lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively 
for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very s.ignificant amount of the 
.; 
5 tra.,suranium particles are discharged from the body in urine. For the treatment 
4 of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DTPA aerosols and injection. He find 
3 his results from injection are better thnn the use of aerosols, even in lung 
2 decontamination.
