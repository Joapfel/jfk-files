2. It is recomn1ended that we go ahead and authoriz.e the 
New York (and Washington Field Offices to conduct secure surveys 
as to feasibility of coverage of the.establishments mentioned. 
Thi$ will enable us to movemore rapidly if the Attorney General 
approves the proposed targets. If approved, New York and 
Washington Field will be.so instructed.
