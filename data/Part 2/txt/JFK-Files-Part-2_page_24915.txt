was said to have been the basis upon which the Special Group

On February 17, 1961, Richard Bissell sent a memorandum 
on the Dominican Republic to McGeorge Bundy. Bissell knew 
that the dissidents planned to assassinate Trujillo, but his 
memorandum did not mention assassination. It indicated-that 
the dissidents' ltplan of action" included arms for 300 men. 
Those involved agreed that support of this nature suggested a 
non-targeted paramilitary plan, not an assassination. 
The passage of the carbines was approved by CIA head­
quarters on March 31, 1961. The State Department was apparently 
unaware of this passage for several weeks. The pouching of the • 
machine guns was not disclosed outside the CIA. 
The State Department official from whom the CIA sought 
permission to pass the machine guns stated that on "cross 
examination" the CIA official conceded that the purpose was 
assassination. The CIA official then agreed the United States 
should have nothing to do with assassination plots "anywhere, 
anytime'', even though the previous day he and Bissell had signed 
a draft cable permitting the passage of the machine guns for 
use in connection with a planned assassination.
