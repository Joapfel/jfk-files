November 1970: Clara still seldom goes out. Her best 
friend appears to be Daisy ZULUETA, also a negro. 
Daisy does Clara's hair, sometimes shop together. 
5. Meals, where, when and with whom: 
Jesus and Mercedes both generally return to the Embassy 
after lunch. Lunch is often hurried at home. Comparatively 
speaking they have few luncheon guests. Apparently they 
often eat the evening meal out (in Mexico this is the 
light meal of the day). 
For an evening snack they often go to "El Farolita" 
on the corner of Juanacatlan and Altata. 
6. Barber: 
Not known, but Cruz always appears neat. 
Mercedes goes to the beauty shop quite often.. She 
keeps her hair dyed--black. 
7. Tailor: 
Jesus: As of September 1968 Jesus had two suits. 
He apparently brought one with him from Cuba. He had 
one made in Mexico. Cost him over 1,000 pesos (U.S. $80) 
When in Yucatan during 1968, both Cruz and Mercedes 
bought a lot of things (LIFEAT implied in the clothes 
line). When Cruz returned in July 1968 he bought a 
lot of Guayaberas (typical Yucatecan sport shirts).
