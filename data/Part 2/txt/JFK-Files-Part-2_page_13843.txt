FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
Dale of transcription 6-18-7 5 
Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the United States Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, telephonically contacted me on 
6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P. M., and inquired as to the status of a 
request by the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked if I 
could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered 
to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and 
Mr. Shaheen of the Department concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen 
had indicated to him that he could e4pect the resporn~e to have been given to 
him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a time certain for 
delivery of a response concerning this request could not be given, and it 
was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed 
pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of 
Congress and that because of the amount of work involved in all these requests 
it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date of the response. 
Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been misled by Mr. Shaheen 
into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was 
going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general inquiry as to whether one 
Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be 
allowed to com,e to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to 
this point. He was informed that all disclosures have to receive proper 
Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such 
information in the absence of such approval. He asked if the Bureau could 
separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail 
cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of maU 
covers in the domestic field. He again was informed that this was not 
possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallach stated that he 
wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list of Bureau mail covers 
for the past five years which he had been furnished by a source whom he did 
not identify. He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the 
national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr. Wallach stated it 
was a national list in the nati0nal security areas. He stated he was not sure 
of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservatiohS about using 
the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that inter­
views may be conducted based on the list.
