primarily written by CIA authors. In the past decade, 
however, Studies has been enriched by an increasing numbe,r

Studies it is circulated to the members of the Board for 
their review. The Board then decides whether an article 
meets the criteria for publication and, if it does, begins 
the publication process. All unclassified submissions are 
reviewed by the Publications Review Board· (PRB) 1 to ensure 
the unclassified nature of the article. The articles are , 
edited, approved by the Chief of CSI, and published in the 
classified version of Studies. Most of the unclassified 
" articles published in this version are then picked up by the 
unclassified version of Studies and with further slight 
editing are published. If an article has been deemed to 
contain classified information by its author, and it is 
subsequently requested co be released, it will be reviewed 
1 PRB is the same body that reviews private writings proposed for 
publication by current and former Agehcy employees as required under 
Agency regulation.
