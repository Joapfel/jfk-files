Bissell did not recall cables concerning the dispatch of a 
messenger and subsequently confirming that his instructions were 
to be followed, but he said ''This sounds highly likely. . I 
would expect, given the background, that the confirmation would 
have been forthcoming" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 43).

(which "might very well" have dealt with the assassination of 
Lumurnba) (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 18, 20, 44). Despite his absence of 
specific recollection of these events, Bissell said, "There is 
nothing in mind that I remember that would be in conflict" with the 
testimony of the ~hief of) Station that ~~·~-~-l~·eb) carried poi.sons to 
the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35). 
Bissell testified that it wo11ld not have been against CIA policy 
in the fall of 1960 to send poisons to the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).
