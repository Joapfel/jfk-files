In March of 1964, the Warren 
Commission requested from Director 
Hoover information on certain pro­
Castro and anti-Castro organizations 
which were active in the U.S. 
including the Fair Play for Cuba 
Committee, and Alpha 66, among 
others. The Bureau furnished less 
than a full and satisfactory 
response and did not disclose the 
fact that the CIA had operational 
interests in certain of the entities 
inquired about.
