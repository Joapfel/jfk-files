subject coming up o·r being .di~cUssed? 
Mr. Bundy. I don't recollect the meeting. And I 
don't recollect the subject ever coming up in a meeting of 
that size, or indeed in any I don't have any recollection 
of it coming up, al though I do have a gener·a1 recollection of 
there being times at which this possibility was heard of. I 
7 wouldn't want to testify that·I never heard anyone say, 
8 there is somebody thinking about this, because that would be 
9 different from my vague r•collection. 
10 nut I have no recollection of that meeting, and there-
11 fore none of any specific statement made by anyone in it.

The Chairman. Senator Baker? 
Senator Baker. In that connection, before I go to the 
question I had in mind, is it fair to say, Mr. Bundy, that 
all, or virtually all, of your testimony this morning, about 
MONGOOSE, about the August 10 meeting, and about the general 
situation, is from reconstructed memory rather than first 
impression memory? 
Mr. Bundy. !·didn't want to go that far, Senator Baker. 
My knowledge, my sense of what 54/12 and Special Group 
Augmented were, and whcrn they stood in thn line of authority, 
is very clear, and is not reconstructed, I spent five 
years -- except for the time when Gen~ral Taylor was there, 
I was the chairman of these things. 
Senator Baker. Let's take a piece at a time, then.
