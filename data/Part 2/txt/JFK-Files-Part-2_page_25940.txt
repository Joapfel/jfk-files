~:into Trnllicante, Sr .. and that he \Yas well infonncrl on the activities 
of tlie orga11i,rntion in the Uni!l'd States, in Sicily, and in other coun­
trirs of tlie world. T1·:tlliC'n11te had told him, ·wall said. that the 11afia 
ill the United States was directed liy a local lJoar<l in ewry city lrnving 
:1 sizable Sicilian population. There was a national board, headed 
liy ,Toseph Profaci in Xt'\\' York City, \Yltid1 ,qs composed of the heads 
of the major local boards. Traflicante is reported to haYe snid that 
Frank Costello, Vincent "'fangano, and ,Jop :\fnc:sie \Yet·e influential 
r.nrmbers of the nat io11al lmanl, and that Frank Nitti and Lncky 
Luciano '"ere fol'mer members . 
According to 1V:tll's ncco1mi, the Malia was composed of two dis­
tinct g-roups, an "inner eirde" and an "011tcr circle." The ge!leral rule 
was tliat. only natives of Sicily m~rc ndn1itied to the "ini1cr circle," 
while Ameri<'.an-bon1 Italians were recl'l1itc<l into the "outer circle." 
'Wall was told it was possible for a member to be trausforred from 
"outer'' to "innrr·' status .whrn he performed an act of special merit, 
rvrn tho11glt he li:Hl liei~n horn in the United States. The restrictions 
were not dne to lack of trnst by natirn Italians tomud those of Ameri­
can birth, but because the "inner circle" 11snally took the major part 
oft he prnc•pecls of 1 lie ::\fa Ila ·s ii I 0gal :1cti v itirs a11d, therefore, preferred 
to krep tlw 111P111bership of the ''inner circle" as small as possible. 
Senator :;\[usi~rn. '\Vould you say that this chart represents the 
inner circle, Chief? 
l\fr. BmnvN. At the very top portion, Sena,tor, would be the inner 
circle. 
Below that--
Senator l\[us1nE. By the "top portion," do you me:tn--
:Mr. Bnnw::-.. I ,rnnld inelnde in that that the three top men would 
be in the i1111cr circle and those below that would be in the outer circle. 
The CIIAIIDIAN. Those wo11ld onlv be in the inner circle so far as 
the Tampa area is concerned~ • 
)lr. Br:owN. That is right. • 
The CirA11nrAN. Not, in the inner circle overall~ 
l\Ir. BnowN. No,sir; thisisjustintheinnercircleintheTnmpaarea. 
The CHAIRMAN. But that gives an indication of how the overall 
organization is set up. 
Mr. BnowN. That is correct. 
The CrL\IllMAN. You may have it in here, bnt I may have missed 
it, but who "·as '\Vall taJking- to when he gave all this information? 
l\Ir. BnowN. That was n. confidrntial informant. 
ThcCnAIIUlrAN. Isee. Verywell. 
( At this point Senator .Tavits entered the hearing room.) 
l\Ir. BnowN. '\Vall believed the influential :Mafia members in Tampa 
from rnao through 1945 were: Santo Trafiicante, Sr., Salvatore Itali­
:mo, -Tames Lmnia, and the Diecidue family-Alfonso, Antonio, 
Thomas, and Frnnk. The Diecidues and their in-laws opposed the 
lradership of Trafiicante in the Tampa organization. Trnflic:inte told 
Wall that Vincent. l\fongnno, of the national board, supported the 
Diecidues bnt that he, Trnffirnnte, was able to stay in power because he 
hnd Joseph Profaci's friendship. 
Senator Mmm:rn. :May I ask a question here? 
Mr. BnowN. Yes, sir. 
Senator Mus10E. Yon refer t.o the nationn l board. I do not recall 
1ny point in this hearing where there was this kind of a direct refer-
