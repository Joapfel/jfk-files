1. HlTRODUCTIOl: AUD SliiITlARY 
This interim report covers allegations of United States involve-.. 
ment in assassination plots against forei~n political leaders. Of equal 
si~nificance in this report are certain other cases where foreign political 
lea<lers in fact were killed, where the United States was in some manner 
involved in activity leading up to the killing, but where it would be 
i.ncorrect to say that the purpose of United States involvement had been 
to encouraie assassination. 
The evidence establishes that the United States was implicated in 
-several assassination plots. The Committee believes that the use of assassi­
nation as a tool of foreign policy is incompatible with American principles, 
international order, and morality. It should be rejected. 
Our inquiry also revealed serious probler.is with respect to United 
States involvement in coups directed a 0ainst foreign governments. Some of 
these probleos are addressed here on 1 the basis of our investigation to <late; 
others we raise as questions to be answered after our investigation into 
covert action has been completed. 
We stress the interim nature of this report. In the course of 
the Conu11ittee' s continuing work, other alleged assassina ~ion plots rr.ay 
surface, and new evidence. concerning the cases covered herein may come to 
light. However, it is the Commit.tee's view that the cases covered herein 
have been developed in sufficient detail to clarify thi issues which are 
at the heart of the Committee's mandate to recom,nen<l le 2;islat:ive and other 
reform~ relating to the vital matters ~iscussed below.
