Sorensen, who participated in these meetings, testified 
that the "widest possible range of alternatives" were dis­
cussed, but that "assassination was not.even on the list". 
(Sorensen, 7/21/75, p. 4.) He said that consi.deration of 
possible options such as forcing "a non-Cormnunist solution 
in Cuba by all necessary means" did not encompass assassina-
tion:. 
''[this] could not have included or implied assassina­
tion. Instead, it expressly referred to 'the develop­
ment of pressures' and 'gradual escalation of the con­
frontation in Cuba' to produce an overthrow of the • 
regime, including 'a willingness to use military force 
to invad~ Cuba'. Such a course was obviously not 
adopted by the President, and in any event expressed 
an approach far different from assassination''. (Soren­

The record of the first Standing Group discussi.on of Bundy's 
memorandum shows that a number of alternatives were discussed (none 
of ·which involved assassination) but no conclusions were reached. 
On Hay 28, 1963, the Standing Group met again. McCone argued 
-for steps to "increase economic hardship" in Cuba, supplemented 
by sabotage to "create a situation in Cuba in which it would be 
possible to subvert military leaders to the point of their acting 
·k/ The Bundy memorandum also used the phrase "all necessary measures" 
to-describe the steps the U.S. was willing to take to "prevent" a di­
rect military threat to the u~s. or to the Western Hemisphere from Cuba. 
Sorensen explained the meaning of this phrase in the context of the 
April 23 discussion of Kennedy .Administration policy. 
''[this phrase] could not by any stretch of semantics 
or logic have included assassination or any other 
initiative. It reflected the purely defensive posture 
implemented six months earlier when long-range missiles""· 
and other offensive weapons were placed :i,n Cuba--.Y.,..,,'\':?0.r;:'
