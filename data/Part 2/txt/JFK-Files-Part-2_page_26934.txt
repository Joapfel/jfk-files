Q Which of these activities, if any of them were 
actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami? 
A Well, the collection of forei~n positive and probably

look at the forms and based on previous experience or what 
they might have been doing, ~d they felt that perhaps they 
might have some information of intelligence value, they would 
reinterrogate them.
