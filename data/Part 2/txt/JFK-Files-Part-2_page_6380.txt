(ARRB)' Reviewers 
Attached i~ott_'Nann. 1._ilnote on INFOSEC procedures. 
It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap­
tops in and out of the building as long as security 
requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified 
PCs are met. HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and 
forms. 
I propose we implement Situation #3 (board reviewers 
can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the 
building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form 
4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG 
staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or to 
escort the Board reviewers out of the building.
