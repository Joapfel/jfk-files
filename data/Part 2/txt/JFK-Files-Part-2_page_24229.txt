Such concerns have extended beyond the.se operational levels 
to general issues of propriety and legality. For example, as 
noted earlier (supra, p. 90) the so-called "Anti-Pinkerton Act 11 
prohibits a company engaged in investigative work from contracting 
with the Federal government. ·But. 
the Agency and its predecessor organizations began 
contracting as early as November 1942 with certain 
commercial, investigating companies to perform in­
vestigations and to provide commercial credentials 
to, and ·cover backstopping for, Agency investigators. 
As of March 1975, the Office of Security had a relationship with 
three such companies which issue their credentials to·Agency inves­
tigators and backstop the cover of same. Two of the three have 
previously "conducted limited personnel investigations" on behalf 
of the Agency. During that same period the Director of Security 
asked the General Counsel of the CIA whether the "Anti-Pinkerton 
Act" prohibited the Office's continued contractual relationship 
with these three private companies or their employees for pur-
poses of conducting investigations or providing cover, or both. 
The General Counsel responded as follows:

placed upon your office in support of the Agency's 
mission~ many investigations must be conducted with­

even revealing Government interest. Absent the 
relationships you question, you could not discharge 
your responsibilities. It is this inability to 
accomplish your tasks which causes recourse to the 
Agency's rather broad statutory authority to expend 
funds as contained in Section 8 of the .. CIA Act of 
1949, as amended. This authority provides
