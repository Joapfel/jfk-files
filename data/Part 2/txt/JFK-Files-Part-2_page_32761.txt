lies at the heart of the entire TFX endeavor. My instructions on this point 
were clear and consistent. 
Another aspect of the Fourth Evaluation Report struck me as I reviewed 
the report and consulted with my technical advisors, including Dr. Charyk, 
who was then Under Secretary of the Air Force, and Dr. Brown, the Direc-
tor of Defense Research and Engineering. On the basis of my studies, dis­
cussions with my advisers, and my experience over the years in judging 
development and production programs, it became clear to me that the 
General Dynamics proposal was generally more straightforward in approc3.ch 
than that of Boeing, although the General Dynamics design was fully''icc~ptable. 
There were aspects of the Boeing proposal which, on their face, complicated 
the development of the aircraft. Three problems in particular stood out in 
my mind. 
The first problem was Boeing's proposed use of engine thrust reversers 
for in-flight deceleration, as well as for reducing ground roll after landing 
touch down. To date, engine thrust reversers have never been used in flight 
on operational fighter aircraft, nor have they ever been employed on super­
sonic aircraft. The only operational experience has been on subsonic commer­
cial jet transports and cargo~type aircraft in which the engines are mounted on 
outboard pylons underneath the wings. The Air Force does have one fighter 
aircraft iri which a research and development type installation has been made. 
This is a single engine aircraft with the exhaust on the airplane centerline
