Mr. Schwarz. We have indicated to you that we are going 
to discuss the countries of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and 
Vietnam, although not much on Vietnam. And the majority and 
minority staff have shown you some documents of that period, 
some 15 years ago. Before I get to those three countries, 
I would like to ask you some questions about a subject 
called Executive Action. Have you ever heard of the subject 
called Executive Action? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have. 
Mr. Schwarz. When did you first hear of it? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, as I have told your staff, that is a rca 
difficulty for me, because I cannot pinpoint the time at 
which I heard of it. My impression was that it was some time 
in the early months of 1961. 
Mr. Schwarz. And do you have a recollection as to the 
]B context in which you heard about it, the person from whom you 
i! 
J'J !! heard about it, and will you provide to the Committee your

22 Mr. Bundy. Would it help if I try to describe in a 
23 general way what I now understand of this matter, the 
24 part which is recollection and the part which is clarified 
25 by discussions with the staff and what I now think about it?
