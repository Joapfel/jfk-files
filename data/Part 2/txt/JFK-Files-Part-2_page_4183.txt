SUBJECT: Meeting with the President on Cuba at 1100 on 
19 December 1963 
1. Included in the meeting were Acting Secretary of State 
Ball, Acting Secretary of Defense Gilpatric, Secretary Cyrus 
Vance, Secretary Douglas Dillon, Ambassador Thompson, 
General Wheeler, Mr. Donald Wilsorr, Mr. McGeorge Bundy, 
Mr. Bromley Smith, Mr. Edwin Martin, Mr. Ted Sorensen, 
Mr. John Crimins, Mr. Gordon Chase, Mr. George Ready, 
Mr. Bill Moyers, General Carter, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Fitz­
Gerald. 
2. The President, after full discussion, postponed any 
sizable operations by FitzGerald, primarily to avoid any possible 
embarrassment to our OAS negotiations on the Venezuelan arms 
cache. We are authorized to continue to put forward proposals 
for operations and also to continue preparations for air ops. The 
main thrust was to greatly increase political action with Ca~da, 
Britain, Spain, Italy, and others in an effort to promote greater 
economic blockade. 
3. Mr. Bundy later stated that his analysis of the meeting 
was that the President would continue to approve smaller 
FitzGerald-type operations even though they would be relatively 
unrewarding if they would assist in keeping up the morale of the 
troops on shore, of our agents, and otherwise help in keeping the 
ball rolling.
