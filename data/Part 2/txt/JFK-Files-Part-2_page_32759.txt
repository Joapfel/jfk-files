common design; and (2) demo;nstrably credible understanding of costs. 
It should be em:phasized that these two conditions VvOuld understandably loom 
less important in the eyes of the Source Sele:ction Board than operational 
capab;i.lity. These are conditions more properly the concern of those 
charged by law with the over-all direction of our defense effort. They are 
equally a part of my determinatio;n of what is in the national interest. 
When I reviewed the Fourth Evaluation Report from the standpoint 
of minimum divergence from a common design, Twas ir;nmediately struck 
by the difference in approach adopted by the. two contractors. The Report 
found that General Dynamics proposed an airframe design that has a very 
high degree of identical structure for' the Navy arid Air Force versions .. 
On the other hand, the Report estimated that in the two Boeing versions less 
than half of the structural components of the wing, fuselage and fail were. 
the same. In fact the Evaluation Group concluded that Boeing is, in effect, 
proposing two different airplapes from a structures point of view .. The 
same differences in approach were apparent in the larger number of 
identical parts in the General Dynamics design - - a particularly crucial 
point, since there are strong incentives in the course of the development 
process to retain identity of parts• while, on the other hand., small 
divergences in the early stages tend to grow.as development proceeds. 
In short, Boeing simply did not meet the fundamental reauirement of 
minimum divergence from a common design,. No amount of peripheral 
technical argument should be permitted to obscure this central and cru~ia~ fact.
