of :ilU,KllUV .in Geneva. Ile gavi.:.:' SHAKHOV di sinf LWma t.ion and then 
watched for an indication that he passed it on to his American 
contacts. SHAKHQV 1<,1 us told to perform countersurveillan<.::i.:: 
ta.sks during a me(~ting b:z• NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, 
while other KGB off ice rs checked for signs th:.1t SIIAKl-!CW had 
forewarned che Americans about the meeting. Finally NOSENKO 
revealed to SHAKHOV the location of a KGB de~d drop and 
checked five days later to see whether the specially prepareci 
materials emplaced had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's 
conclusion wa~~ that SIIAKHOV was absolutely free of suspicion, 
and it was his intention to report this finding when he re­
turned to KGB Headquarters from Geneva. 
Comment: Currently in the United States, SHAKHOV is still 
"undl~r suspicion", according to Ill a sensitive source.

t:OSENl~O sa_i_d ti1at l1t~ wai; the sole KGB off icec::- ,.:i th the 94-­
rnan Soviet Jslegation to the Uisarmament Conferance and as 
sucll he was responsible for the security and ~eha-.,;·ior of tlv:; 
entire ckdegation. (!<GB officers I.S. MAYORO\/ and i·l.S­
TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left 
Geneva before NOSENKO made the foregoing stc::ttement to CIA,] 
To assist him in carrying out his s2curity functions, NOSENKO 
had the services of a nu~ber of coopte<l informants of the KGB 
who were scrv ing in the de legation. [ NOSENI:O has r..ever re­
ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates 
1n his charge, or whc1t, if any, information his info::::nants 
provided him. ] 
NOSENKO has never been precise about how he spent his days 
and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed 
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little 
to do. He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he 
pleased because Arnb~ssudor ~orirr knew who he was, as d1.d most 
of the delegation. No one paid him any attention. It was 
known that he was not really a Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
officer, and i1e could abt:;ent himself from conference meetings 
at any time.
