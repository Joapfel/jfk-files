7. Latin Americans returning to their coun­
tries after having received training in Cuba often 
take a round-about route to conceal the fact that 
they have been in Cuba.

Europe to some other Latin American country, from 
which they enter their own. Cuba gives these 
travelers documents which show no indication that 
they had been in Cuba. Some guerrilla warfare

guerrilla warfare and other types of training in 
Cuba are encouraged, on their return home, to pass

9. Numerous reports have alleged that Cuba 
is supplying arms clandestinely to some Central 
and South American-based extremist groups. Only 
in the case of the arms cache discovered in Vene­
zuela on 1 November, however, has there been in­
controvertible proof of Cuban complicity in such 
efforts. A good deal of the undeniably extensive 
arms traffic which goes on in several areas of the 
hemisphere is basically a continuation of long­
established patterns of arms smuggling between 
nationals of the countries involved. Cuba does

planes which are well-suited to gun-running or 
air drops, but we cannot confirm that they are used 
for this purpose. In addition, Cuban leaders have 
always stressed the importance of Latin American 
revolutionaries procuring their own weapons from 
local sources. Moreover, some financing from 
Havana undoubtedly is used to buy arms. 
10. Another important aspect of Havana's ef­

and guiding hemisphere front organizations. Havana 
has long sought to establish a new hemisphere-wide
