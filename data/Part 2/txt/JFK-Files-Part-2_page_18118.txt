Dear Mike: 
In connection with our investigation of the 
Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI 
COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return 
inform':".tion: Included .in this mater~al are a number. of 
1
, 
cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according 
to the'documents, received tax returns or tax return in­
formation from IRS employees, such as the locai Chief of 
Audit or Chief ?f Intell~gence. • 
We wish to determine whether these requests 
were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre­
scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the 
information, or Whether the requests were treated as 
informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored. We 
cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the 
FBI documents we have reviewed. In many cases, the only 
way to determine how the requests were treated will be to 
interview the I~S employees who handled the requests. 
Since these requests were directed to a federal 
agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption 
that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do 
not believe there is any basis for characterizing.the IRS 
employees in question as 
11
confidential sources". They 
would then be in essentially the same position as the Com­
missioner of Internal Revenue is·where the request is 
':r;-ected through normal channels to the National Office
