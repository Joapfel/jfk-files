William Colby. Fou th, members of the Wh te House staff authorized 
the CIA to convey orders to the Army Attache on the basis of high or 
highest government authority. Further, that the White House staff 
directed that the Army Attache's superiors in the Pentagon not be in­
formed. This possibility would contradict the sworn testimony of Dr. 
Kissinger and General Alexander Haig. 
D. The False Flag Base 
In order to minimize the risks of makinf contact with the dissident 
Chilean officers, the task force decided in late September to set up a 
"False Flag Base,", i.e., to send four staff officers to Ch:ile posing as 
nationals of other countries to supple~ent Colonel Wimert's contacts 
~ith Chilean military officers.* Given the limitations of the Station's 
resources and Colonel Wimert's visibility, Headquarters felt the use of 
"False Flag Officers" was necessary because "We don't want to miss a 
chance." One of these officers posed as a Brazilian intelligence officer 
so that "any flap would be a Brazilian one." (Headquarters 363, 
September 27, 1970) 
*The use of "False Flag Officers" is not, according to David Phillips, 
"an unusual practice," either by the CIA oi;:. J:_qrr~gn intelligence • 
services. (Phillips testimony, pp. 47-48) 'fl ·r \;, \ .
