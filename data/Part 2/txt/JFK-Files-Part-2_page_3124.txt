Guatemala or removing it to the US should be raised 
again with the Special Group. The Agency's repre­
sentatives agreed to this suggestion "with the strict­
est proviso that no move from Guatemala could or 
should be made until adequate staging facilities in 
the Zone of the Interior have been prepared." 98/ 
Tracy Barnes put the question of moving the 
base from Guatemala to the Zone of the Interior in 
a somewhat different context than had been suggested 
by Esterline and J.C. King. Barnes recommended con­
sideration be given, among other items, to: 
The fact that a move from the present 
training sites to the US should not be 
made too· hurriedly and the import.ance of 
avoiding a decision at a later date that 
the training in the US is a bar to opera­
tional use. I realize that this latter 
point would be a complete contradiction 
of the present theory but, after all, 
there ls an intervening election; and 
political views can shift ·so that every­
thing possible should be dorie to avoid 
our getting ourselves into the box where 
we move to the.US for one reason and then 
find that the US move is used against us 
to prevent or limit ultimate operations.* 100/
