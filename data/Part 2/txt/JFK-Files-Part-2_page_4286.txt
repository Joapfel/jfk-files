Sabotage Program, Cuba 
In connection with the new Cuba sabotage program approved 
yesterday, Mr. McCone suggested that CIA make a report to the Special 
Group every two weeks. The Group agreed with this procedure. They 
felt that such a report need not be in written form nor very elaborate, 
and that it should consist of a briefing on activities during the 
preceding period and those planned for the next one. Mr. Bundy 
commented that keeping the Group informed in this way constitutes 
protection to the operators, since all a~encies concerned are thereby 
given a continuing _feeling of just what is going on.

The CIA paper of 17 June was approved. Mr. McCone said he has 
some reservations about the quality of any possible replacements for 
Duvalier, but agreed that it is necessary to take some action in order 
to prevent Haiti eventually going very far to the left. Colonel King, 
in support of the paper's recommendations, said that in his opinion 
we have no feasible aliernatives but to cooperate with Bosch in 
attempting to unseat Duvalier, and that if this is not done we are 
likely to end up with a far worse situation. 
Mr. Hughes told the Group that the State Department shares the 
reservation about the quality of alternatives, but it also recognizes 
the necessity of taking some action. He said. the ·Department is 
principally worried about the possibility that the U.S. hand in any 
such ope rat ion mi)?,ht be rev ea le':]
