VOTER REGISTRATION CASES 
UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960 
The Civil Rights Division has requested the 
delivery of demand letters to registration officials and 
subsequent inspections and copying of voter registration 
records in eigh~ counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia, 
I South Carolina and Louisiana. The desired records were 
made available in South Carolina and Georgia. 
In Louisiana a suit has been filed in Federal 
l 
Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr., 
and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 3 and 6 of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests 
an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI 
from proceeding under the Act. United States District 
Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Shreveport, Louisiana, signed an order 
on May 25, 1960, directing the Attorney General, Acting 
Assistant Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show 
cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter­
locutory inj.unction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also 
signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until 
June 20, 1960. 
In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been 
issued by Judge James A. Hare of the Fourth Judicial Circuit 
I
. which c.overs Wilcox County, Alabama. This requires clarification 
of the Act before granting permission to inspect and copy 
voter registration reccrds. The Attorney General, Mr. Ryan, 
plus the Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Office and 
the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, are named in the 
injunction. No reply has been received to the demand letter 
in a second investigation although one h~s been promised
