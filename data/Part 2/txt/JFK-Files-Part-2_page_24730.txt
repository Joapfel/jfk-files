.,._As discussed-. above, Bissell testified that the minutes 
of meetings of the.Special Group on August 25, 1960 and the 
NSC on September 21, 1960 indicate that assassination was con­
templated at the Presidential level as one acceptable means 
of "getting rid of Lumumba

(see Sections S(a)(ii) and 5(a)(iii), 
supra). 
• There was

ho question", according to Bissell, that the 
cable from Allen Dulles to the Chief of Station in Leopoldville 
on August 26, which called for Lumumba's removal and authorized 
Hedgman to take action without consulting headquarters, was a. 
direct outgrowth of the Special Group meeting Dulles had 
attended the previous day (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 31-32). Bissell 
was "almost certain" that he had been informed about the Dulles 
. . . 
cable shortly after its transmission (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 12). 
Bissell testified that he· assumed that assassination was one of 
the means of removing Lurnumba from the scene that is contemplated 
within the language of Dulles' cable (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 32): 
It is 1TIY belief on· the basis of the cable drafted 
by Allen Dulles_ that he regarded the action of 
the Special Group as authorizing implementation 
[of an assassination] if favorable circumstances 
presented themselves, if it could be done covertly. 
(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 64-65.) 
Dulles' cable signalled to Bissell that there was Presi­
dential authorization for him to order action-to assassinate 
Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62):
