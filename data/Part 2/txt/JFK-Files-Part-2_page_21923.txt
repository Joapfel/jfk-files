bring a CIA officer together with the criminal syndicate (Sissell, 
(. 6/11/75, pp. 19-20). Harvey did not recall any mention of the 
White House or any higher authority than the DDP in his November 
meeting with Bissell (Harvey, 7/11/75, pp. 60-61). 
Although Richard Helms was briefed and given 
administrative responsibility (as DDP) for Project ZR/RIFLE three 
months later, he did not recall that ZR/RIFLE was ever contemplated 
as a capability to assassinate Castro (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 55). 
Asked whether the actual assassination efforts against Castro were 
-related to ZR/RIFLE (executive action), Helms testified: "In my 
mind those lines never crossed" (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 52)'. However, 
Bissell's testimony leaves more ambiguity: "the contact with the 
syndicate which had Castro as its target . . folded into the 
ZR/RIFLE project ... and they became one" (Bissell, 6/11/ 75, 
p. 47). When asked by Senator Baker whether the executive action 
"capability ... for assassination" was "used against Castro", 
Bissell replied that it was "in the later phase". (Bissell, 6/11/75, 
p. 47). The instruction from Bissell to Harvey on November 15; 
1961, however, preceded the reactivation of the CIA~syndicate assas­
ination operation against Castro by approximately five months.
