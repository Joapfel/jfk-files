...... 
.. . ~' 
Wire taps are utilized only in the internal securitv 
fie~d and when absolutily essential to carrying out our 
investigative respon~ibilitics. ,Their number varies and as 
of this date we have· 42_wira~.taps in operation. In addition, 
at the specificrequestof .. the National Security Agency, we • 
have electronic coverage~on~teletypes of 40 foreign diplomatic 
establishments. .. , - •.. • • 
The importance- ot-· utilizing wire taps, in the internal 
security field.cannot be·overemphasized in rlew of the dangers 
that exist in· the internal.-security of the United States. The 
intelligence data obtained~from such coverage makes it possible 
to keep appropriate officials'. of our Government currently 
aware ._o:f t.he activities~,-- pJans, stra teg-y, and tactics of 
subversive organizations and:indivi~uals. Also, informatioii 
gathered from these sources .-:is of. immediate inter(~st to the 
Uni te~l States intelligence.· agenCies and off icialF ·Of the Govern­
ment in the formulation of·pians ·in the foreign policy.field. 
We are not ritilizing any microphone surveillances, 
mail.covers, or trash covers•in connection with our investiga-
·;tions. We are utilizing security informants and·confidential 
sources to provide us necessary coverage. Currently, we have 
- security informants who· are membe:rs of the· ComJnunist Party 
and some of these are·operating at the-highest level. In view 
of the valuable coverage these informants provide. us, we place~ 
. great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be 
- interestini to·not~ that durin~ • of our security infor-
mants became members of~th~ Communist- Partv and this was 
increased. to ~ informants • becoming. members of the Party in 1i&. 
In this connection, we noted that ~uring those two years while 
informants became members· of· the. Party, t\!t- discontinued. • 
their association w1th the Party primarily due to personal 
reasons, thus· leaving us a total gain of-., informants in .the 
Party. • -
