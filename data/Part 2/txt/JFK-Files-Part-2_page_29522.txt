on there he felt it w1s incorrect or he would 
not have ·spotlighted it that way. But I ·don't

The explanation most oft~n advanced was that Mr. 
Sc.ott often used the symbols "Sic" and "aka" interchang­
eably and that all he w~s injicatin~ he~e was that th~ 
" Lee Os w al d" from t n e. taps w 1 s a l so to: b.e i n de x e d and 
filed under the additional n1me "Lee Henry Oswald."

Q: Was ne~the kind oPinjividual. that would have 
interchanied or used interchangeably the words, 
the l e·t ters "aka". and "sic" interchangeably 
as having ihe s~me me1ning?· Do you appreciate 
that? 
A: Yes. I don't think SJ. He was an intellectual. 
His great secret was that he wrote poetry. He 
didn't want anyone el ;e to know. that. He was 
very well educated, e<tremely well read, and no, 
he is ~ot the kind of man-~. 
Q: He would appreciate t1e di~tinction?
