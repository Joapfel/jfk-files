• -478/ If one assumes that Oswald :::ould not speak any Spanish 
the~ only two condlusions ~bout the first thr~e calls 
of 9/27/63 are possible: 1) either these calls do not 
pertain to Oswald, or 2) they do pertain to Oswald 
but were made by someone Jther than Lee Harvey Oswald. 
This second possible conclusion will be addressed in· 
a more detailed fashion in subsequent sections due to 
its ramifications vis a vis Oswald's activities and pos­
sible associates as opposed to the substance of the in­
formation available to the CIA Station prior to the· 
assassination.
