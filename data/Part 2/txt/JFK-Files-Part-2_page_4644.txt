BL: This was a DI person? Milton Brown? 
SH: No, it wasn't Milt. I know Milt. No it was somebody 
else. Gray-haired gentleman. Elderly statesman kind 
of thing. 
MW: But a Cuban expert? 
SH: Not really, no. He was just a good analyst and a good 
estimator. Anyway, Des made available everything, 
against every single solitary rule or procedure you can 
imagine., He just brought him down and said "Look, here 
are all =of our sources, true names, ranks, positions, 
everything. And this is the kind of by-lines we are 
using for these people. You sit and look at this stuff 
and see if it's worth disseminating. See if it's worth 
putting out. We've been putting it out, but tell us. 
What do you think when you see it? Des did this to 
avoid this constant nonsense we used to get from the 
'DDI types, which was "You can't tell us the source, so 
we can't really understand the information without 
knowing who the source was." 
BL: Was it Archer Bush? 
SH: No, that doesn't sound right. 
MW: When was .this; when did this happen? 
.SH: Right after Des came aboard in early 1963. After the 
Missi·le Crisis. 
MW: So he wanted a real (cut off) 
SH: He wanted a totally honest appraisal from somebody 
without an ax to grind. If we did it in-house and the 
Task Force - or the SAS, we were suddenly called - or 
in Miami, nobody would listen to it. You can't do it 
that way. And if we did it to the DDI as a 
whole .... There are lots of arguments back and forth 
between DDI and DDP types, and that wasn't fair. So 
pick one guy who's an honest fellow - and everyone 
knows he's honest, he's not going to be swayed one way
