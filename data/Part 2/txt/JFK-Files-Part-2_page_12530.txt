"If two or more persons conspire to commit.any offense named in this 
section, each shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned 
not more than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for 
employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, 
for the .five years next following his conviction. 
"As used in this section, the terms 'organizes' and 'organize', with 
respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the 
recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the regroup­
ing or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of 
such society, group, or as::.;embly of persons." 
The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to 
action, i.e. , advocacy to do something, now o~- in the future, rather 
than merely to believe in something. 
In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there 
are two other statutes which might provide a, statutory foundation for 
an investigation under this section. These are: 
The Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communist Control Act 
of 1954 (TSO, USC §§ 781-810). • , . 
In summary, these statutes make it unlawful to knowingly contribute 
to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship within the 
United States which is controlled by a foreign government, organi­
zation, or individual. The statutes also impose various restrictions 
on the activities of members or organizations cited, by the Subversive ( 
Activities Control Board (SACB) as "communist action," ."communist 
front," or "communist infiltrated 11 groups. The restrictions apply 
principally to employment by the Federal government or by a defen~e 
facility. 
The former SACB cited only one organization, the Co!lli~unist Party, . 
USA, which was named as a "communist action" group. 
2. Prosecutive determination 
All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigation$ 
initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with Departmental 
officials. These cases should not be discussed with local U.S. Attorney's 
office without FBIHQ approval. 
3. Related statutes 
There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative 
jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling these investigations. 
Information concerning possible violations of such statutes is frequently 
developed during these investigations. Where this occurs the field should 
consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with the 
policies and procedures governing the statute in question. 
A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these .investigations 
is outlined in an appendix to this manualo
