Mr. McCone said that representatives of CIA and_ of Ml-6 are 
scheduled to meet_on the 30th of April and the first of May. They 
will consider: an up-to-date assessment of the situation;· a proposed 
British operational plan; alternative proposals if thispplan proves 
not feasible; identification of Indians who might pr~vide alternative 
leadership to .Jagan; the division of operational responsibility; and 
an inventory of operational assets. 
The DCI said it is estimated that a continuation of th~ current 
strike would require expenditures on the order of_ $10,000 a day. 
The Group felt that if thi.s could result in the defeat of .Jagan, it 
would be well worth it. Accordingly, Mr. McCone unde_rtook to look 
into the situation iDD11ediately and to assure that support for the 
strike is not cut off, pending a broader decision. He said he might 
see.James Fulton of MI-6, during his forthcoming trip to Europe, to 
coordinate views. •
