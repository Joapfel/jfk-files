J 
EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMBNT 
Charles W. Wiley first came to the official atten­
tion of the Office of Security (OS) on 9 September 1955, 
when Carl F. Heney (Executive Officer, OS) forwarded a 
letter written by Wiley to Ermal Geiss (Chief, Personnel 
Security Division, OS), who in turn directed the letter 
to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office 
of Security (SRS)]. How Heney obtained the Wiley letter 
is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addressee was 
de 1 e ted in the 1 et ter. Ho1._;cver, the 1 et ter was recorded 
in the Executive Registry under number 6-98S1. The l~iley 
letter is dated 27 April 1955, gives Wiley's address and 
telephone number, and Wiley advised that he was 1rnrking 
on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945 
"and thought that perhaps you might be interested 1n 
specific information that I am 1 ike ly to find.'' 
On 10 Se'ptember 1955, James W. McCord contacted Wiley 
in Flushing, New York. At that time, Wiley explained the

1945, by stating that he was preparing the index uncter a 
grant from the A.'Tlerican Legion ,Americanism Committee, 
headed ':i·,, Lee Pennington (a former employee of the FBI). 
Wiley started the index in November 1954. Wiley stated 
he contacted the major government agencies in Washington 
to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would 
be of most interest to them, and in addition, contacted 
a couple of Congressional Committees which ~lcCord surmised 
were the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the 
Senate Internal Security Committee. l~iley estimated it 
would take two and a half years to complete the index. At 
that time, Wiley was receiving part-time clerical assis­
tance from the Women's Auxiliary of the American Legion 
Post in Flushing, New York. Wiley also indicated an in­
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index. 
The results of McCord's interview with Wiley were 
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Dcpt1ty Direc­
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined 
that "this may be valuable."
