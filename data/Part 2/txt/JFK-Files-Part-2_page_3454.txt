maintained that Angleton and Miler had given these tiles to 
him to review and to keep as long as he needed ehem, and he 
was not finished With theJ11 yet. Ultimately, all the files 
that were found were ~etrieved from Golitsyn, though it haG 
never been possible to be certain that this represented all 
the files that he in fact had. 
--A, potentially e:icplosive find surfaced in June: a bag 
of mail from the ~ail-intercept--HTLIN~UAL--program. It had 
been the p·ublie expos~ of HTLINGU/1.L and the MHCHAOS program, 
infiltration of domestic leftist and dissident groups in 
search ot insidious foreign sponsorship, in a front page 
story by Se~our Hersh in The New York Times on 22 December 
1974 that had precipitated Colby's decision to force 
Angleton•s retire~ent, and led to establishment in 1975 of 
the Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities in the United 
States, and the Church (Senate) and Pike (House) cOlTIJllittees 
to inves~igate CIA and its activities. Both these program& 
had been CI Staft responsibilitie&. CIA was receiving 
letters from citizens who believed CIA had intercepted their 
mail, a CI Staff reprasentative had just finished briefing 
the senaee Select Committee Staff on the subject,* and Colby 
on 10 July would be making a state~ent on the mail-intercept 
program before the Postal Facilities, Mail, and Labor 
Management subcol'lll\1ittee of the House Post Office and Civit 
Service committee. The bag of mail was a hot potato. 
Kalaris's memorandu~ to ADDO Blee dated 3 July 1975 tells 
the story.••
