young intelligence officers soon after the 
completion of their initial training, at the 
outset.of their careers. They send many of 
them abroad, direct their work through 
Chiefs of Stations and Bases and bring them 
back in accordance with the personnel needs 
of f!eadquarfers and the Field. The result 
is a system of rotation that benefits both 
the Agency and the employee. .In contrast, 
the counterintelligence unit in Headquarters 
has no representative of its own overseas. 
To secure competent replacements, it must try 
to intervene in the normal progress of 
careers, to persuade officers and Divisions 
that highe~ interests require a ~hange of 
their plans and to convince the officers that 
they should choose careers in counterintelli­
gence even though their career advancement 
is in fact likely to be impeded by this choice. 
In brief, CIA has no system for developing 
counterintelligence career officers; sending 
them abroad on a rotational basis to acquire, 
through a series of tours, the necessary 
experience as specialists; and providing them 
with the same incentives and career prospects 
as those of their peers in the Area Divisions.
