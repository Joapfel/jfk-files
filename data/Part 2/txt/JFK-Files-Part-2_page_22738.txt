the Bureau. 
·would it help today if there was a separate Bureau under 
I 
the Attorney General for counterintelligence, separate from the I 
_FD!? 
Mr. Angleton. You are posing tho same problem that the 
RCMP ·in Canada had. In other words, they set up, I might add 
because of us, because we brought them into counterintelligence/ 
in a way they had never been brought into it, we brought them 
down when this first defector, this major defector came out, 
and the cases that were revealed to them, cryptonyms, telegrams 
that were taken from them, an ambassador who was recruited, 
one of their ambassadors and all this, led in time to the 
Canadian Prime Minister desiring to set up a special counter­
intelligence. And so they had this problem oi how you take 
a law enforcement force and what do you do about it. And 
their ultimate decision was that you had to keep it within the 
RCMP. You created the separate office~ and you created sort 
of a director general of it, but the cadre, your people came 
from the regular force, even though they are separated from 
the rest of the RCMP, and they are independent of the Commissio 1wr 
of the RCMP. I mean, they are there for rations and quarters. 
Mr. Lombard. I guess what I had in mind was more the 
Dritish model of the Yard having --
Mr. Angleton. Well, the Hritish model is the most 
) 
overexaggerated model in the world, I think I can guit«c.
