Il1lERVIEW AND MEETmJ SUMMARY 
ocuments to FBI and 
he has no knowledge of any COINTELPRO-type use of 
CIA alias documentation or other document forging. 
If this had been done, it would have had to go 
through Papich. 
Papich knew nothing about Vesco. 
On Ober me a ich recalls a code ~·c) 
designati he purpose was so~ 
that when to CIA from FBI 
it could be sent directly to Ober. The counter­
intelligence staff had an office to log communica­
tions. The determination as to what FBI informa­
tion would go to Ober was first based on Ober's 
request for specifics and second based on FBI 
criteria which considered whether there would be 
any possible CIA results. FBI.would alert Ober 
regarding an individual and ask for any informa­
tion generally about his overseas activity. 
Papich does not recall any CIA breaking and enter­
ing operations in the 1960 1 s. 
Regarding CIA security research staff, Papich 
recalled that it concentrated on developing counter­
intelligence equipment. It also was "an Angleton­
type" operation, doing research on penetration of 
the CIA. It also analyzed and evaluated the 
exposure to the agency of OSS personnel who might 
have been Communists or have had World War II 
Communist contacts. For example, in Germany until 
the mid-50's, CIA was vulnerable to recruitment 
by Communist intelligence. CIA brought in brilliant 
minds who might still have strong identification 
with their home countries in eastern and middle 
Europe. 
Finally, Papich and Creager felt that "the guts of 
liaison" was with DDP on counterintelligence, not 
on their internal security problems. With Office 
of Security there was a small nu~ber of investiga­
tions overlapping FBI.
