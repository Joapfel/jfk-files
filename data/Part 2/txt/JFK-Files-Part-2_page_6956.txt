Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of the members of the 
Assassination Records Review Board, I thank you for allowing us this opportunity to 
discuss our work and our future. We urge you to favorably report H.R. 1553. I would 
be happy to answer any questions that the members of the Subcommittee may have for 
me. The Board and staff stand ready to provide the Subcommittee with any additional 
information that may be required. Thank you. •
