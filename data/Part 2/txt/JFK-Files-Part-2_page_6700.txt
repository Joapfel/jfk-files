SUBJECT: Request No. CIA-16 from JFK Board 
-cT Defectors File (#0341008): The ARRB staff has requested 
access·to the parts of the Defector File that contain the Oswald 
documents, items a-f, listed in your 27 February memorandum. 
{We were unable to locate documents ~e• and •f• in the HSCA 
sequestered collection.) Assassination- and Oswald-related 
documents in this file will most likely be declared assassination 
records. HRG will handle any third Agency coordination required. 
Please let me know when it will be possible to give the ARRB 
staff access to the files. The access is considered for back­
ground purposes only, and any notes taken will be reviewed by 
your staff and HRG. If a file is considered sensitive, access 
can be restricted to one ARRB staff member and monitored by your 
staff. The review can take place either at your office or in 
HRG. If you any questions, please give me a call, secure 31825.
