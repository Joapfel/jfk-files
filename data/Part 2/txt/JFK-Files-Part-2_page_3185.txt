In one of the longer and ~ore detailed papers 
being prepared toward the close of the Eisenhower 
administration, the State Department drafted the polit­
ical action recommendations. and suggested collective 
action through the Organization of American States 
to effect the ouster of Castro. Failing in that, 
State then outlined a unilateral political action· 
program for·the United States. The paramilitary and 
covert action segments of this paper were prepared 
by the CIA. Neither the State nor the CIA paper 
introduced ideas that had not been thoroughly dis­
cussed. These recommendations were made just as if 
. the Secretary of State, the Special Gro.up, and the 
President had approved, or would approve, the courses 
of action, that were being outlined. This being the 
ca~e, it was suggested that the concurrence of the 
President-elect should be sought for the proposed 
program. In the best of all possible worlds one' 
could hardly -find fault with this optimistic approach 
~- in the pragmatic world it is difficult to under~ 
stand that anyone'would go on record with the expec­
tation that_such recommendations might be followed
