When the fact that a subject has given a confession is included in a com­
plaint and an inquiry is forthcoming from the press, a "no commenttr reply 
should be. given. The complaint is a court record and must be le·ft to. 
speak for itself.

and radio media should be merely provided with a written copy of the press 
release, and Bureau personnel should not submit to -live, filmed, or tape­
recorded interviews of any kind, including the reading of the release it­
self, without prior Bureau authority. Tact and diplomacy must be exercised 
in declining to participate in such interviews, With respect to local 
press releases, Sil.Cs may, when requested, make persona·l appi;arances on 
television and radio provided no interviews are conducted and there is 
absolutely no elaboration over and above the original press release. 
These conditions should be made known in advance to television and radio 
station representatives when such requests are received.,. Reading of these 
local press releases on the telephone to the news media should be done by 
the SAC or .ASAC. 
In the absence of special circ.umstances, Bureau Agents should never suggest 
or request a reporter or another representative of a newspaper or similar 
publication to withhold the publication of news. In the. event that special 
ci~cumstances do exist, it will be necessary to clear with the Bureau prior 
to making any such request.
