s reference to the fact that 
QJWIN's mission had been "completed" by saying .that.once Lumumba 
was in the hands of the Congolese authorities "the reason for 
the mounting of the project ... had become moot" (O'Donnell, 
9/11/75, p. 35). When asked if he and QJWIN were responsible for 
Lumumba's departure from UN custody and subsequent capture, O'Donnell 
said: "Absolutely not" (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 35). Harvey did not 
.recall the meaning of the memorandum, but he assumed that O'Donnell's 
return from the Congo constituted the ".completionll of QJWIN's 
mission (llarvey, affidavit, p. ) . 
Despite the indication in the Inspector Generril's Report that 
QJWIN may have been recruited initially for an assassin~tion mission 
and the suggestive language of the cables at the end of November, 
there is no clear evidence that QJWIN was actually :i.nvolved in any 
assassination plan or attempt. The CIA officers who were involved 
in or knowledgeable of an assassination plot against Lumumba gave 
no testimony that tended to show that.QJUIH was related to that plot. 
The Chief of Station had a "vague recollection" that QJWIN. 
was in the Congo working for Juitin O'Donnell. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 95.) But Hedgman did not recall why QJWIN was in the Congo. 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95,) QJWIN was not a major operative of 
Hedgman's. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) Richard Bissell and Bronson 
Tweedy did not recall anything about QJWUJ' s mission in the Congo
