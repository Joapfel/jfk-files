', 
Mr. Schwarz. In connection with the MONGOOSE program, 
you had some. dialogue about .. the Attorney General which was 
quite extensive. Let me ask you one additional question on 
that subject. What was the relationship personally and pro­
fessionally between the Attorney General and General Maxwell 
Taylor?· 
Mr. Bundy. It was very close. I think that they first 
met in a hardworking sense when they were -- I think they 
were both members of the committee to look into what happened 
after the Day of Pigs, or if the Attorney General was not 
a member he was certainly closely interested. 
Mr. Schwarz. He was a member. 
Mr. nundy. And I am sure the Attorney General was 
one of the people strongly favoring the appointment of General 
Taylor as the President's military advisor. They were both 
active and ardent tennis players, they liked each other, and 
! 
they visited back and forth. One of the Kennedy children 
is named for General Taylor, I think. There was a relation of 
real trust and confidence between them. And the measure of 
its strength is that I think it easily survived later very 
shart differences over Vi~tnam. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now recognizing that, what I am asking for 
you is a matter of opinion and not a fact, given your under­
standing,of that relationship, will you give us your opinion
