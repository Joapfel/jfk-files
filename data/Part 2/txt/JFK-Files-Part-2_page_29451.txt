This statement in the original.Mexican report given 
to the CIA in Mexico aft~r the assassination would 
tend to add credence to Ms. Tarasoff's 
recollection ~hat Oswald rrentioned to the Soviets 
that he. had also tried to elicit aid from the Cubans.347/ 
At least one -0ther CIA ofiicial who was in Mexico 
also remembers that Oswalc indicated in his 
discussions with the SoviE·t Embassy that he hoped 
to receive assistance with the expenses of his trip.348/ 
Daniel Stanley Wat:.on, a retired CIA employee 
who was Deputy_ Chief of d~ Mexico City Station from 
1967 to 1969, told the Hoise Select Committee on· 
Assassinations staff that he had seen a file on Oswali 
in Mexico City that contained only one or two intercept 
transcripts and surveilla1ce photographs of Oswald.349/ 
_Mr. Wation also told HSCA staff investigators that Win 
Scott had a private personal safe in which he mai·ntained 
e s p e c i a l l y sens. i t i v e ma t e r i a l s . 3 5 0 / Accord i n g to 
Mr. Watson, these materials were removed from the safe.
