CCURRENCE: .// 
With regard to paragraph-+of-I:.ansdale's memorandum to Sru\ dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no infonnation on 
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ul timatc paragraph and Lansdale' s memorandtm1 conccminp; a report for the CIA which he 
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to 
a telephonic-conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever 
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference mcmorandu. 
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that <late took place as reflected in my reference memorandlffil. 
During t}lis conversation ther.e :was o discussion of previous operations except a hricf 
discussion of the COBRA a,nd ~fli!l@fll[•ID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's 
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
SOU Ii CE: woulcl logically have led to the discussions at the timp S'rAPP: 
of the Matahambre operation.
