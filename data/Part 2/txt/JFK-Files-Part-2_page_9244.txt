Survival Day refers to a program 
implemented by the BPP with purpose 
of giving away bags of groceries to 
oppr-essed families living in the inner 
city of Detroit. • 
Due to the great expense of purchasing the necessary 
large quantities of groceries for Survival Day Programs, 
the Party has not held a Free Food Giveaway in the past 
three months.

D~ Political Education Classes 
R:il.itical Education classes are no longer held 
on a regular basis. The classes are held occasionally 
during the week as the Party feels it is more beneficial 
to personally come into contact with members of the black 
community on a one-to-one basis. For this reason, Party 
members solicit donations and sell BPP newspapers door to 
door and attempt to "rap" with the people concerning the 
BPP, its aims and programs.

For example, DE T-2 advised on January 30, 1973 
that a Political Education class was conducted by ALVIN 
BROWN, BPP Member at the 157 Collingwood Office on 
January 29, 1973. The class was entitled "Liberalism 
in the Red Book of Chairman Mao". Only three non-Party 
members were in attendance. 
In order to establish a better rapport with the 
members of the black community and in order to raise money 
for the Party, the Party organized and sponsored the 
following events:
