relationships with the Zaireans because of our nABd for their 
cooperation in assisting with a Presidentially-mandated program 
and will need to improve our relationship over the next several 
months to accomplieh our goals in that part of thA world. We 
also continue to have a Station in Dakar, Senegal. We have 
liaison there and would not want to jeopardizA it. In dealing 
with developmental contacts, there have been.recent instances 
where potential assets have voiced concern about our Agency's 
ability to keep its relationships clandestinG. To expose our 
station there would further hamper developmental relationships 
and eventual recruitments. (8) , 
4. Within the context of our European presence, I have the 
following comments: 
Brussels - Public acknowledgment would force the 
gov9rnment and liaison service to pay closer attention to 
station operations and therefore present a threat to ongoinq 
sensitive operations. (S) 
Helsinki - A neutral country. Public acknowledgment 
of a CIA station would embarrass the qovernment and liaison; 
thereby inhibiting the close and productive liaison 
rQlationships we now enjoy as well as presenting a threat to 
ongoinq sensitive operations. (S) 
Paris - No additional damage. (S) 
Bonn - No specific damage. (S) 
Berlin - No specific damagQ. (S) 
Luxembourg - Public acknowledgmQnt would embarrass the 
governmant and inhibit liaison cooperation; thus endangQring 
ongoing operations. (S) 
The Hague - Public acknowledgment would draw questions 
from the press and create political problems for the 
govQrnment and liaison. This would endanger thQ 
continuation of sensitivQ joint operations. (S)
