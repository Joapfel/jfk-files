-RE: INDONESIAN ACTIVITIES IN THE. UNITED STATES 
105-87125 
. It is the Bureau's_feeling-that coniacts with person~ 
with other than American ci:tizenship and who have not displayed 
any loyalty to the United States Government or indicated sympathy 
with our investigative responsibilities are extremely risky and 
could result in impairing relations between the United States and. • , 
Indonesia if a contact with the _FBI was disclosed. 
NOTE: . Bureau in memo 6.;.15~60 captioned "Indonesian Activities in 
the United States, IS -- Indonesia" pointed out that we needed . 
informant_ coverage· in the ·Indonesian field. It was also ··noted in 
the memo that there have been differences between the Indonesiari 
Army and President Sukarno 9£ Indonesia over the composition of the 
-new Indonesian Parliamento _Sukarno ls said to have personally 
appointed certain communlsts to the new bodyo On 3-8-60 Khrushchev 
and Sukarno issued joint communiques calling for relaxation of 
tension, peaceful coexistence and general disarmament. The Soviets 
al~o recently extended-a credit of $250,000,000 to Sukarno and both 
parties agreed to increas~ mutual trade and cultural exchanges. We 
requested liaison to discusi this matter with appropriate official 
at State with possibility o_f this Bureau developing live sources 
within Indonesian diplomat!~ establishments in the United States and,· 
if approved, also secure cleaiance for discreet inv~stigations ~f _ 
_ potential sources which we will thereafter select. As indicated in 
inst1nt letter, State furnished approval for the above program on 
7-19-60 which also afforded Bureau clearance to conduct discreet 
investigations of potential·s~urc~se WFO and New York being advised 
• accordingly. •
