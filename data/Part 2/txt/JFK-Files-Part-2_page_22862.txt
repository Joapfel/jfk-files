in connection with the possible removal of Castro from the 
Cuban scene, and ari up_datirig of the overall plan for 
covert c;,perations". 
Now; after having reviewed those documents, and'in the 
light1of your testimony that it is possible that the 
consideration of the possibility of assassination which you 
say did occur at some point; occurred in the fall of 1961, 
do you agree that at that time the contingency under consider­
ation here was the possibility of the assassination of Castro? 
Mr. Bundy. No, I would put it another way. The contin­
gency here is, what would we do if Castro were no longer 
there. So that the question of how Castro ceased to be 
there is left out of this set of papers. Clearly one of 
the possibilities would be assassination, but only one of 
them. What we are talking about here, as I read the docu­
ments, is a plan against the contingency that I am not reading 
from the Parrott memorandum, against the contingency that 
Castro woujd in some way or other be removed from the Cuban 
scene. NSJ\M 100, whose language is indirect, nonetheless 
indicates, to me at least, rereading it, that the President 
wanted to know what was likely to happen if Castro were no 
lor.ger there. lie was, in other words, trying to get a·picture 
of whether that would really change things, and if so, in 
what way.
