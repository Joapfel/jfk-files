During initial stages of de7elopment and on occasion active informants 
may raise a personal question concerning their own position if it 
becomes known publicly that they are affiliated with a subversive 
organization. In the event a. potential informant or informant inquires 
as to what can be done for him in such a case, he may be told that 
his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
a~ises concerning his loyalty we will consider mak~ng the facts of his 
.cooperation with the J.i'BI known to his employer or to the responaible 
individuals. It should be pointed out that this action may make it 
impossible for him to continue on behalf of the FBI and the service 
which he is performing for his country may :.ie terminated. Before 
taking steps to advise anyone of a potential inform?.ntf s o.r informantf s 
cooperation, prior Bureau authority must be obtained, 
Specifically advis~ each potential informant that he is not and cannot 
oonsider himself a Bureau employee or "undercover .Agent" of the FBI. 
In this regard, the seriousness of violating the impersonation statutes 
must be impressed upon the informanJ.;. 
.Advi3e poten·l;ial informant that h:i s cooperation must be strictly confi­
dential at all times and if hes~ ,nld feel he cannot maintain this 
confidence he should so advise. here should be no doubt left in the 
mind of the informant that his relationship must remain on a confidential 
basis and if he -violates the confidence he will .be of no value and by 
. so doing the Bureau's investigative activity may be jeopardized, This 
must be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you accept him 
as such. If the in:f'.ormant has a special problem which would require 
his reyealing his relationship to his wife, etc., this should be learned 
from him during the in1.tial interview and a recommendation made to the 
Bureau when the results of the interview are furnished. The special· 
circumstances will be taken into consideration by the Bureau. 
If a prospective informant is connected in any manner with a labor 
union, inform him that the Bureau is not interested in employer­
employee relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
information 011 the infiltration in labor unions by subversive elements. 
·rr the potential informant is a student, te2.cher, or has 2,ny similar 
reiations with a school, college, or uni7eriity, in his initial interview 
and subsequen·t; handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern­
ing in--restiga·!;ions on the campuses of colleges and universities. 
From the first intorvie-.-1 with a potential :i.nfo:r-mant through his dev-elop­
rnent an.d until he is discontinued, extreme caution should be used at 
all times to be certain he is not a plant. 
When potential informant begins to furnish current information and 
otherwise qualifies for designation as informant~ assign perman~nt 
symbol number and advise Bureau. 'fhis communieatiori must be pe1·sonally 
initialed by SAC or ASAC acting in his absence; individual's background 
must 2.1s·o be thoroughly revievred at this time, keeping in mind possibility 
of using informant as a potent.ial witness. If individual h~.s any 
weaknesses, set forth safeguards being followed to insure seourity and 
to pre-vent embi.,,rrassment to Bureau.]
