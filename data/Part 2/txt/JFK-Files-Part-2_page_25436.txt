Book V, p. 72 In late July 1964, an FBI informant 
reported that the CIA was meeting with 
AMLASH for the purpose of assassinating 
Castro. Informant also reported that 
AMLASH was unhappy with the CIA's efforts 
and that Attorney General Kennedy had 
refused to support the plan but that the 
plan had not been completely put to rest. 
This information was not disseminated 
outside the Bureau at the request of the 
informant. But the Bureau notations 
indicate that the Bureau was looking

into an underworld plot against Castro 
that might be coincidental with the 
AMI.ASH plan. The Bureau had first been 
informed of AMLASH-CIA meetings in 
October 1963. That information did not 
indicate assassination involvement.
