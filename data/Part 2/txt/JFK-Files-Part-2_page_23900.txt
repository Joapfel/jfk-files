The "Executive Action" Capability 
Along with the question of authorization for actual assas­
sination attempts, the Committee considered the extent and nature 
of authorization for a CIA project which included,. as one element~ 
the development of an assassination capability. 
(a) Introduction 
Sometime iri early 1961, Richard Bissell (Deputy Director 
of Plans) in~tructed William Harvey, who was at that time the 
Chief of one of CIA's Foreign Intelligence staffs, to establish 
an "executive action capability" which ·included research into a 
capability to assassinate fo~eign leaders. (Ilissell 6/9/75, p. 51; 
Harvey 6/25/75, pp. 36-37.) At some time within the same period, 
Bissell and McGeorge Bundy (Special As~istant to the President for 
National Security Affairs) had a conversation about the matter.

Bissell, Harvey and Helms all.agreed that the "generalized" 
cipability was never ~sed'i (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 87; Harvey 6/25/75, 
p. 45; Helms 6/13/75, p. 52). 
"Executive action" is· a_ CIA euphemism, defined ·by the 
testimony -before the Committee as a project for research into 
developing means for overthrowing foreign political· 1eaders, .includ-
i.rig a ''capability to perform assassinations". (Harvey 6/25/75, 
;:, . 3L: .. ) Bissell indicated that executive action covered a "wi.Lie 
spectrum of actions" to "eliminate the effectiveness" of foreign 
leaders, with assassination as the "most extreme" action on the 
spectrum (Bissell, 7 /22/75, p. 32). The Inspector General's RC::port
