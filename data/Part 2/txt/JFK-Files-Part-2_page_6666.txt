President Kennedy. We hope that opening up and giving journal­
ists, historians and, most importantly, the public access to govern­
mental files will help to resolve questions that. still linger over 28 
• years after the assassination. Further, I believe that maximum dis­
closure will discl'.edit the theory that CIA had anything to t:lo with the murder of President Kennedy. 
• Even before the introduction of this joint resolution, I recognized 
the need for _greater public access to CIA documents of historical 
importance. Two months ago, I announced the establishment of a 
new unit within CIA that will be responsible for declassifying as 
many. historical documents as possible, consistent with the protec­tion of intelligence sources and methods. 
This new unit, the Historical Review Group, in the Agency's Center for the Study of Inte}!igence, will review for declassification 
documents 80 years old or older and national intelligence estimates on the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older . 
• In addition ·to the systematic review of 30-year-old .documents, I 
have directed the his~ry staff in the Center for the Study of Intel­~ence to ~emble CIA • i:ecords focusing on particular events of 
histor.ical importance, including the assassination of . President 
~edy.- The Historical-Review Group will tl;ien examine the doc- · umeµ.ts-for the .P~, of ~eclassifyinfi ,the records. · .. 
• --~1:188 of high µiterest m the JFK' papers, ,I am -not waiting for 
legislation or other ~ncies to start declassifying qocuments be­
longing to CIA. The Historical Review Group, at -my· direction, al­
ready has.begun its review of the documents related to the assassi­
nation of President Kennedy, and I .am hap_py to report that the 
firs_t group of these recor,ds, including all CIA documents on Lee 
Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination, has been declassified 
with quite Illinimal deletions and is being transferred to the Na­tional Archives for release to the public. 
This .is, I acknowledge, a small fraction of what we hold, but it is 
an earnest of my COmmitJ;nent immediately to begin review for de­
classification of this material. Indeed, as I speak, the reviewers are 
going through a substantial number of documents and I anticipate that __ many of these will be released shortlr,. 
.As-we carry out our program.to declassify Kennedy assassination 
documents, our goal will be to release as many as possible. In fact, 
I recently approved a new CIA declassification guideline for our 
!ustoricaI review P!Og:raJ:n whic}l specifically directs a presumption 
~ fl?-vor _of.decJassification. I believe we can be very forward-lean­
mg ~ making these documents available to the.public, and I have 
instructed the H,istorical .. Review Group to take this. attitude to 
heart. In this spirit, the /\gency ·today will make publicly available these new guidelines for histoncal review and declassification. 
To ·understand the ~tude of the effort involved in reviewing these documents for declassification, it is important to place them 
in some context. The CIA's collection of documents related to the 
i!SSSSsination -of • President Kennedy consists of approximately 
250,000 to 300,000 pages of material. This includes 64 boxes of 
copies and originals of information provided to the Warren Com­
m1SSion and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and 17 
boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald accumulated after Presi­dent Kennedy's assassination.
