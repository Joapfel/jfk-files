In the letter to David, I would add at the end of the third 
paragraph: 
"Our Office of General Counsel provided some legal comments 
on the scope of the definition that we've included in the 
attached." 
In the attachment under the comments to Section 1400.1: 
After the first sentence, ending with "beyond the limits 
established by the [ARCA]", I suggest adding the following 
sentences: 
"The Act authorized the Board to issue interpretive 
regulations. Interpretive regulations, while entitled to great 
deference, cannot be inconsistent with the congressional intent 
to cover only certain specific activities. Rather, they should 
stay within the clearly articulated definitions provided by 
Congress. This is particularly· important with respect to the 
definition of "assassination records" since the ARCA has a 
overriding effect on other statutory grants of power found 
necessary in the interests of national security, such as the 
National Security Act's direction that the Director of Central 
Intelligence protect intelligence sources and methods from 
unauthorized disclosure. The ARCA provides a statutory standard 
for protecting or "postponing" intelligence sources and methods" 
that applies only to "assassination records." The standard in 
the ARCA restricts those sources and methods that can be 
protected in assassination records. The Review Board is given 
the ultimate authority to apply that standard, subject to being 
overridden only by the President. Thus, the ARCA reflects a 
congressional desire to limit the DCI's authority to protect 
sources and methods, but only for "assassination records" as ARCA 
defined it. An interpretive definition by the Board that would 
sweep in records not covered by the Act, we believe, would exceed 
the Board's limited rulemaking authority. Thus, the proposed 
definition should be limited more clearly to those records 
identified by Congress as "assassination records. To do this, we 
believe .... "
