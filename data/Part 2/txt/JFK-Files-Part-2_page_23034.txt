was? Was it a cache of arms? 
Mr. Halley. It was a cache. I think that you could=·:·,, 
o:·.tothe record to establish what was in the cache. I do not

conversations with Desmond FitzGerald, though, in the first

11 AMLASH had requested assurances that'high"officials of.the U.S. 
12 government would stand behind him if he undertook operations on 
13 behalf of th~ CIA? 
14 Mr. Halley. I do not recall this at the time. 
15 You know, I also want to say, as you probably know from 
16 th~ record, I was later Chief of the WH Division from 1972 to

the case. But at the time -- I am trying to be schizophrenic, 
19 you know, to put this in the time sequence in which we are 
20 • talking about. My recollection of that is that I did not know 
21

Mr. Daron. It would then be your testimony that Mr. 
23 FitzGerald never broached with you the subject of making a 
24 representation to AMLASH-1 that Rohert Kennedy or other high 
25 officials of the U.S. government would stand behind hi~?
