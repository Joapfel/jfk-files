equally valuable information. We currently pay(WF ··1777-S) 
up to $200 per month for services .and up to $75 pe~.month for 
expenses. ~. 
' 
The attendance of the inform~nt at this cotiference 
can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning 
the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive 
against the United States. It·will also afford us a live 
informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involv.~ng 
individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying 
the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam. It 
will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts 
and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We 
should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce 
positive intelligence information.·.
