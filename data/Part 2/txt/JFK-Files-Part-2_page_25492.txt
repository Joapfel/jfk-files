realize what a bomb this is? This top KGB spy wants 
you?" And I said, "Well", I say "he's not really my 
type.", I said but again, the best interests of the 
country, but how far do you want me to.go? And he 
said llall the way". I said what is all the way? He 
said, "You start with a Christmas card." Well the 
Christmas card was answered by Oleg going to Louis 
and saying, "I got Ilonka's Christmas card. Where is 
she living, Louis)" You know, so John talked me into 
calling the mission. I call up the mission, across 
from 19th precinct, and I said, "Oleg, this is Ilonka 
Marischa. Hello darling", you know, and this, this 
and this. And 1 said oh boy everything is wired and 
everything from the mission anyway. But he's top dog 
there. He is top dog in the mission. He has the 
say. He's a very important person in the Soviet 
mission. Anyway, John okays a telephone coil pickup 
that I have on my phone to a Soni tape recorder. We 
make a tape of this because John Kotter is sitting on 
pins and needles waiting for me to replay that tape 
on what Oleg tells me, you know? Oleg doubletalks 
but we get a message that we want to meet, you know? 
So they had some kind of a security council and we 
made a date and it was postponed. Oleg called up 
and apologized which I also have on tape. And each 
time the Bureau was very happy. We're gonna start a 
blossoming relationship here, you know, and end up 
with photographs and better something, which I don't 
think I would have gone all the way. But that's what 
their idea was so they can excqange at a later date. 
FS: Blackmail? 
:ML: Well. .. 
into 
FS: Blackmail him/ giving them information (unintelligible).

right? Or make him ...

Right. 
That's the idea.
