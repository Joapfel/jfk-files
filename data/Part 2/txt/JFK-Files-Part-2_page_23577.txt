. (2.) His role should be told to only a few people at the very top 
with most of the contact work in carrying out his decisions being le.ft to his 
deputy. U that deputy is someone already closely identified with the conduct 
of Cuban affairs then it would appear as if normal charmel11 are being followed 
except that decisive attention wowd be given to the decisions which canie 
through those chamu11la. There are probably three or four people who could 
fulfill t;his criterion. 
Thie still leaves a ~betantial danger of'. identi!ying the Attorney General as 
the fellow in charge. This danger must:be weighed against the increased 
effectiveness of an operation under his command.
