By this point, Hedgman had conducted his "exploratory con­
versation" with the agent who was his best candidate for gaining 
access to Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 60). Hedgman testified 
that the subject he "explored" was the agent's ability to find a 
means to inject poison into Lumumba's food or toothpaste (Hedgman, 
8/21/75, p. 60): 
I believe that I queried the agent who had 
access to Lumumba, and his entourage, in 
detail about just what that access, what 
access he actually had, as opposed to speak­
ing to people. In other words, did he have 
access to the bathroom, did he have access 
to the kitchen, things of that sort. 
I have a recollection of having queried him 
on that without specifying why I wanted to 
know this. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 48.)

Hedgman testified that his exploratory steps left him with 
doubts about the wisdom or practicality of the assassination plot: 
[C)ertainly I looked on it as a pretty wild 
scheme professionally. I did not think that 
it ; .. was practical professionally. 
Certainly ... to keep the U.S. out of it .... 
I explored it, but I doubt that I ever really 
expected to carry it out. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 111.)
