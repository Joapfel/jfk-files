actual assassination plots against Castro already undertake& by the­
CIA (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 47; 7/22/75, p. 31). Bissell was "quite 
certain" that he would not have expected Bundy .to mention the 
executive action capability to the President. (Bissell, 7/22/75,' 
p. 35). Bissell testified: 
Q. Would you think the development of a capability to 
kill foreign leaders was a matter of sufficient irnpor-: 
tance to bring to the attention of the President? 
Bissell: In th~t context and at that time and given the 
limited scope of activities within that project, I would 
not." (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 35). 
-. Bissell said that he and Bundy spoke about an un.targete<l 
''capability" rather than the plan or approval for an ass.assination 
operation (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 11) .. Bissell said that although 
he does not have a specific recollection, he "might have" mentioned: 
Castro, Lumumba, • and Trujillo in the course of a discussion: of 
executive action "because the·se were the sorts of indiv.idual-s at : • 
that moment in history against whom such a capability might possibly 
have been employed." (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 50-51). 
Bi~sell said his impression w~s that Bundy, in addition to. ex­
pressing no unfavorable reaction to the project, mig_ht have. actua:lly

·given a more ,affirmative reaction (Bissell, 7 / 22/ 7 5, pp. 25, 28) ·• 
Bissell testified that he might have interpreted Bundy's reaction 
as approval for the executive action concept (Biss~ll, 7/22/75, p
1
• JO). 
Q: I think the testi~ony of this witness is going 
further in saying what you received from (Bundy) was, 
in your v,iew, tantamount to approval? 
Bissell: I, at least, interpreted it as you can call. 
it approval, or you could say no obj,ection. • He (Bundy)
