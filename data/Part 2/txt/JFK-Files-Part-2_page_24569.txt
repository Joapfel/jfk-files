NW 50955. 
h. Testimony of Sorensen 
Sorensen served as a Special Assistant to President Kennedy during 
the entire Kennedy Administration. Sorensen was a member of the National Security 
Council Executive Committee that dealt with the Missile Crisis, although he 
was not involved with Mongoose. 
Sorensen testified that in his daily personal meetings with the 
President and at all the National Security Council meetings he attended, there 
was "not at any time any mention -- much less approval by him -- of any U.S.­
sponsored plan to assassinate any foreign leaders" (Sorensen, p. 4). Based 
upon his close contact with President Kerinedy, Sorensen stated that it was his 
opinion that: 
"such an act (as assassination) was totally foreign to his 
character and cons~ience, foreign to his fundamental reverence 
for hwnan life and his respect for his adversaries, foreign to 
his insistence upon a moral dimensio~ in U.S. foreign policy 
and his concern for his country's reputation abroad, and 
foreign to his pragmatic recognition:that so horrendous but 
inevitably counter-productive a precedent committed by a 
country whose own chief of state was inevitably vulnerable." 
(Sorensen, p. 5).
