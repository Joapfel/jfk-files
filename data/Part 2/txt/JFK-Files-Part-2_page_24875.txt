* It must be noted that on October 30, 1963, Ambassador Lodge 
notified Washington that there might be a request by ked leaders 
for evacuation, and suggested Saipan as a point for evacuation 
(Saigon Station Cable No. 2036, 10/30/63). Conein was charged 
with obraining the airplane. Between 6:00 and 7:00 on the 
morning of November 2, Minh and Don asked Conein to procure an 
aircraft. Conein relayed the request to David Smith, Acting 
Chief of Statibn at the Embassy, who replied that it would not 
be possible to get an aircraft for the next twenty-four hours, 
since it would have to be flown from Guam. Conein testified 
that Smith told him that Diem could be flown only to a country 
that offered him asylum and that the plane could not land in 
any other country. There were no aircraft immediately avail­
able that had sufficient range to reach a potential country 
of asylum (Conein, p. 54).
