Dear John: 
" 
September 15, 1977 
Through art oversight, the Research Unit failed 
to notify the Budget Office that you had terminated 
your services with the Select·Comrnittee. As a 
consequence, you were overpaid for the month of 
August. 
As I understand the facts, you worked through 
Friday, August 12 and that Mr. Gay gave you vacation 
through Friday, August 19. Therefore, you were • 
overpaid for the period August 20~31, 1977 which 
amounts to a gross salary of $220.00~ 
If you agree with,the facts, I must request, 
from you in the name of the House of Representatives, 
the return of House funds in the amount of $220.00. 
The check should be made payable to the U. S. 
Treasury and sent to me in care of the Committee. 
If yott dispute the facts,"" kindly get in touch 
with me as soon as possible so that we can settle 
the matter. 
Kind regards and good luck in your classes at 
school.

Thomas Howarth
