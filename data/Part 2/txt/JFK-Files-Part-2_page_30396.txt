Mr. Goldsmith. I hav•:!n' t seen the list of 117 people. 
Mr. Tovar. What is tlis? 
Mr. ·Goldsmith. • That Ls a list of _350 odd people I was 
I 
i 
l 
going to ask you about. H,)wever, since you don• t have knowledgr 
I 
of the 117, I am not going to ask -ou about them . 
Mr. Tovar~ If Oswald's name was on the list, I can't 
explain why he might not h 1ve been contacted, Maybe he didn't I 
appear attractive or inter•:!Sting enough. I don't know what I 
I 
. i 
information might have bee,1 given with. these names on the list,i 
I 
such as a memo from the FBC or State Department, whoever had I 
I 
i originated it, w}:lat they s-lid that would have titilated the ! 
analyst who might have see:1 it that would have elicited a 
response on the part of th•:! analyst who would say "Ah, let us 
look into this further." 
Mr. Goldsi:ni th. In pa.::-ticular, a lot of focus has been 
given to Mr. Robert Edward Webster, who appears in CIA Number 
1820 who defected approxim.1tely the same tiro.e that Oswald did 
i and returned at approximat,:!ly the same time that Oswald did anclj 
who was debried by the CIA for two weeks in Virginia. 
Mr. Tovar. I didn • t :cnow that he was. It doesn't say so 
here. 
Mr. Goldsmith. That ioes not indicate the extend of the 
debriefing. That informat Lon was obtained independent,ly by :. 
this Committee. 
Mr. Tovar. The name :neans nothing to me so I can't ·.:i·1
