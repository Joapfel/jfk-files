The testimony indicates that the meeting between Dulles, 
Bissell, Edwards, and Cabell occurred sometime "in the autumn" 
of 1960, probably around September. The minutes of a meeting of 
the Special Group, the high-level governmental body for consider­
ing covert action, on November 3, 1960, reflect the following 
remarks: 
"Finally, Mr. Merchant asked whether any real plann·ing 
had been done for taking direct positive action against 
Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara. He said that without these 
three the Cuban Government would be leaderless and 
probably brainless. He conceded that it would be necessary 
to act against all three simultaneously. General Cabell 
pointed out that action of this.. kind is uncertain of 
results and highly dangerous in conception and execu-
tion, because the instruments must be Cubans. He 
felt that, particularly because of the necessity of 
simultaneous action, ~t would have to be concluded 
that Mr. Merchant's suggestion is beyor,.d our capabilities."
