Mr. Wides. That was from the start? You had a separate 
cover for the debriefi~g? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, from the start we didn't have a place 
for them, and it wasn't pulled together as a debriefing unit. 
When a large flow of refugees started to come in is when we set 
up the special unit. 
Mr. Wides. When was that? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, they cut off --

took them to a restaurant or took them to a motel or somethinq 
and would debrief them. And then we found that it would be 
better to get a building for them to be in where we located 
them altogether, where thdy could pr~pare their reports and
