tacts within the Soviet Bloc.

been training in Prague and, on re­
turn, will find ready employment in 
the new agency. 
a. Czech President Novotny 
returned from Moscow on Thursday 
after signing a renewal (for another 
20 years) of the treaty of friend­
ship and mutual assistance.

else out of Khrushchev. The final 
communique was conspicuously cool. 
c. There were no Soviet con­
cessions, nor were there the usual 
references to Czech 11progress" or 
to public support for Novotily's 
leadership.
