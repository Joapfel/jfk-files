With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to srtA dated 14 Nov. 
1962 I-larvey states: "The s.tatement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on 
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansclale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he 
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirhl)atrick. This refers to 
a telephonic-conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever 
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference mernorani:lu. 
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum. 
During this conversation the s no discussion of previous operations except a brief 
discussion of the COBRA and teams and Lansdale _did not ask, according to Cheever's 
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which --- SOURCE: wou ogica y ave e o e 1 cu s n 1 STAFF'.
