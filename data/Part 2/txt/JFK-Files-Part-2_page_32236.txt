effect of embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the 
Castro forces on continual ale,:t; retaliatory measures, as 
appropriate,., incltiding the imposition of a POL blockade; 
harrassment of Cuban officials in other countries; 
severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of 
sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba .and on key
