answer tomorrow morning. So we had a whole mechanism just in the screening 
~rocess. As a result the orders went out. "Don't talk to each other." Well. 
over a number of jears we fina11y broke that down which I thought we should 
.have. 
INTERVIEWER: When would you say what point of time was it pretty well broken

this and he said fine. I persona 11 y knew from the war -- from the OSS days

wasn't going to tell her how to run the show. But it never was on a DDP-DDI 
basis. you see. the two got together and said. "Here's· the operation." No 
way. The second time we were breaking it even more was after the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. After the Cuban Missile Crisis. 1963 now -- we have moved 
about five or six years.
