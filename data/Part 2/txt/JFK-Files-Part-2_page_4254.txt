SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 8 February 1963 
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone, Mr. Hilsman, 
and Mr. FitzGerald 
1. Agent Operations in Cuba 
Mr. FitzGerald discussed with the Group the CIA paper of 
6 February which recODDI1ends a total of five maritime infiltration/ 
exfiltration operations during the next thirty days. 
He emphasized that these black operations are entirely of an 
intelligence_ nature and that they should be viewed only as a 
supplement to intelligence coverage·accomplished by other means. 
In the latter connection, the point was made that information ob­
tained by agents of this type can contribute to the targeting of 
aerial reconnaissance sorties and can assist in making the process 
of photo interpretation more meaningful .. 
Mr. FitzGerald also emphasized that the teams now proi>osed 
are comprised of only one to three agents. He noted that the agents 
available are particularly well motivated, and that those whose 
primary motivation was toward action rather than intelligence have 
been weeded out. 
The consensus of the Group was that while agent operations of 
this type cannot be considered as a primary or major source of 
intelligence, nonetheless_ this type of operation is consistent 
with u.s. objectives in the Cuba situation and that approval of 
these five should be recoI1U11ended. 
(These missions were approved by higher authority, 9 -February 
1963.)
