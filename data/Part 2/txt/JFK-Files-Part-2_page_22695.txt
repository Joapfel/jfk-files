advise that you send it to the Anny. 
And I might add, the man who wrote that memorandum was 
the Burt Turner I mentioned who was one of the competent 
FBI analysts. So it was in limbo. And we stated that "X" 
was the penetration agent, and tile Bureau refused to accept 
that. And in 1967 a Soviet -- on whom we had a dossier on thi 
thing, because he was once stationed in India, and therefore 
we knew who he was, and all the rest of it -- with an unknown 
coming to us as Nosenko was, he was a real man, we had years 
of surveillance on him, and so on. And he came, and he 
-,;,1 
alleged -- and he was a TDC, temporary duty in Washington 
here -- and he established contact with the first Mrs. Helms. 
And eventually I was called to take the case. knd he ~tated 
that among his missions to the us was to effect the redefectio 
or the return to the Soviet Union of a man, and that man was 
) 
the man whom we had identified as a Soviet agent. And he went 
into the whole background, that this man was one of the 
highest grade illegals that they had ever had, and he was in 
our Agency. 
So this had a tremendous impact on Burt Turner, because 
he was one of the two interrogating officers. And I can't 
talk to you about professional pride, but for a man of his 
competence to have done it the wrong way, that hurt. 
So I hdd a question injected, which was, what do you know 
about George Blake?
