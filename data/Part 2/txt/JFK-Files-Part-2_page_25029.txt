authorization for an assassination within the CIA? 
Mr. Dillon. It is possible. And the same thing with 
Castro, when that came·along the following year. That is

Mr. Baron. Mr. Secretary, I would like to show you a 
series of minutes from the Special Group and ask you if those 
refresh your recollection as to the attitude of the US toward

(The above referred to document 
was marked Dillon Exhibit No. 2, 
for identification.)
