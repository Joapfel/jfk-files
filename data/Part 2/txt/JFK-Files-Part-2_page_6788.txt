Although our holdings at. CIA do include many documents 
-from other agencies, we nonetheless have a substantial collection 
-··· - ·-··· ---- -·- -- -- ·-·· --·- --- ·-- ----- - .•• 
of CIA documents that will require a considerable effort to 
review, and, as I said earlier, this review for declassification is 
now underway. A preliminary survey of these files has provided 
us some indications of what they contain. Although the records 
cover a wide variety of topics, they principally focus on CIA 
activities concerning Cuba and Castro, Oswald's defection to the -
Soviet Union, and Oswald's subsequent activities in Mexico City 
and New Orleans. They also include a large number of name 
traces requested by the staff of the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations, as well as material relating to the Garrison 
investigation and Cuban exile activities. 
CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally 
because of the limits in the Privacy·Act·(which protects ~e names 
of American citizens against unauthorize~ disclosure), the 
•• sequestration of many documents by the ·House Select Committee 
on Assass~tions, and the fact that many of the documents 
belong to agencies other than CIA. However, we have already 
taken steps to lift the sequestration, to coordinate with other 
agencies, and to begin the process of declassification. If 
necessary, in the absence of legislation, we will ask the House of 
Representatives for a resolution permitting CIA to release the 
results of the declassification effort on the sequestered documents. 
We hope to work with you, Mr. Chafrman, to remove ~by 
obstacles that might arise in releas"ing the sequestered documents.
