Mr. Bundy. I am sure I gave no instruction. nut it is 
only fair to add that I do not recall that·I offered any 
impediment after I was briefed. 
The Chairman. But your best recollection is that some­
body toldyou that such a capability was being developed? 
Mr. Dundy. I don't want to be too firm on that, but that 
would be my best recollection. 
The Chairman. We received testimony from Mr. Bissell. 
Are you acquainted with Mr. Bissell? 
Mr. Dundy. Yes, sir. I have known him a long time, and 
he has been a great friend of mine . 
The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz,-since you are very familiar 
with the record, are you going to take Mr. Dundy through the 
record of Mr. nissell's testimony? 
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell testified 
The Chairman. And we have the transcript. If it would

note indicated, as they did, that he, Rissell, told Harvey 
in 1961 that he had been twice urged by the White House to set 
TOP SECRET
