.>! THIS DOCUMENT 
Dear Dlrcctor Tenet: 
As Chairman olthc Commiucc on Oovemmcat Rcfomi ind Ovarsight, I have a groat interest m 
ensuring that lhe Assassination Records Raview Board, which is under the jurlsdic::tion of the Committee,. 
completes its work by its sc.bedulcd tcnninatioo date of September 30, 1998. Barlierthis year I introdueed 
H.R. 15Sl, now Public Law J0S-25. which extmdcd tho authorizationof'the Review Board for one additional 
year. until September 30, 1998. This mio-year extension or authorization for the Rcviow Board wu included 
in President Clinton•s fiscal year 1998 budget, aad rec:cived bipartisan support in Congress. 
During consideration of'H.R. 1553. l stated my firm intmtion for Ibis ID bo the. f'mal cxlCDSiou. of 
authomation for1hc Roviow Board. Accordingly. I believe that it is of utmostimpodanco that all federal 
agencies holdiog assnsinntion records fully cooperate with tho Review Board. in a timely manner. in order 
that.documents may bo processed and transferred to tho National Ardlivcs. in compliance with the Prcsidcnl 
John F. Kmaedy Assassinatioa.Records Collection Act of 1992 (Public Law J02-S26). ,· 
The Rmow Board has advised me that \\bile it perceives that the CcolFal·ll)tclligcoce Agency (CIA) 
generally has .b0e,a coopcntivo and hclpibJ. the Board novrioless believes that the CIA is not transferring 
records to tho Board at a paoo consistent with die need to complele the work on·limc. Tim Board similarly 
1w advised 1hat. unless it RICCives processed records in a more expeditious manner. il is prq,an:d to use its 
1cga1·powa-s to order a transfer of rcmrds to cho Boan! whidi would then vote IO open tho records without 
benefit of a pic-reviow by1ho CIA. The Board bas infmmcd me that it docs nol ~ Co _take this step. but 
that it is fully prcparccl to do so if necessary to complete its work by its Scplmlbcr 30. 1998. tcnnination 
date .. 
I urgo you to tab all appropriate steps to ensure that the CIA promptly 1idfiUs its obligations under 
the law by expeditiously reviewing and transfening the relevant rcoords to 1hc Review Board.
