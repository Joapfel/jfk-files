1. Marwell requested a figure for the number of 
records in the sequestered files that contained 
postponements. I explained that our review figures were 
based on pages and that there was no record count for the 
microfilm part of the collection. However, based on the HRG 
index unaudited record count (see below).of the Oswald 201 
file and the JFK hardcopy boxes, I was able· to give him an 
estimate of 28,000 records. 
2. Unaudited HRG Index statistics:

Records w/Postponements ------·r,-a7r 
12,132 
32,.881 (154,724 pages) 14,003 
The page count for the hardcopy part of the cCYllection is 
within 10,000 pages of the Microfilm (163,500). Given that 
the microfilm contains many duplicates and similar records 
as the hardcopy, the percentage of sanitized documents 
should be close to the same. I estimate the total number of 
records with postponements to be approximately 28,000.
