16. Night clubs, cafes, pubs: 
There is little indication Cruz and his wife go to 
night clubs, cafes. On 15 August 1968 they did go 
to CARDINI's, but this probably because a Cuban 
singer was playing there. 
17. Vacations: 
cruz and Mercedes do not appear to take vacations in 
Mexico nor to travel much in Mexico on weekends. 
Mercedes does, apparently, think it is important to 
see the tourist sights as has told this to visiting 
Cubans. 
They also seldom go to Cuba. The whole family, including 
maid, returned to Cuba for one month home leave in 
January 1969, after having been in Mexico for 2 years .. 
Mercedes had not returned to Cuba in this time, nor had 
the children. 
She returned again with the children the end of· 
September 1969 to have her third baby. They·. all returned 
to Mexico the end of January 1970. 
18. Hobbies, clubs, lodges: 
Cruz' sister indicated Cruz has no hobbies. 
From information available to the Mexico City Station 
neither cruz nor Mercedes have been noted to have hobbies.
