Unfortunately, and for reasons that I do not know, what we are 
dealing with is a mass of material that is not indexed, is uncatalo­
gued, and is ·highly disorganized, all of which makes the review 
process more difficult. The material contains eve~hing from the 
most sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane· news clip-
· These records include documents that CIA had in" its files before pings. 
the assassination, a large number of records that CIA received 
later as routine disseminations from other agencies, as well as the 
reports, correspondence, and other papers that CIA prepared in the 
course of the assassination investigations. I should emphasize that these records were assembled into the present collection as a result 
of specific in~ries received from the Warren Commission or the 
House Select Committee on Assassinations. Prior to President Kennedy's assassination, CIA held only a 
small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 34 documents 
amouriting to 124 pages, some of which • originated with the FBI, 
the State Department, the Navy, and newspaper clippings. Only 11 
of these documents originated ,within CIA. l have brought along a 
copy of Oswald's file as it existed before the assassination so that 
you can see firsthand how slender it was at the time. AB I have 
already noted, we have declassified the CIA documents in this file with quite minimal deletions and we are providing them to the Na-
tional Archives. • • • The records in this file dealt with Oswald's defection to the 
Soviet Union in 1959 and his activities after bis return in 1962. By 
contrast, it was only after the assassination that CIA accumulated the rest of the material on Oswald, some 88,000 pages, most of 
which CIA received from other agencies after November 22, 1968. 
The Committee·, has asked about documents in our possession 
generated by other agencies. In fact, much of the material held by 91A origil:lated with other agencies or-departments. For example, 
m the 1'7 boxes of Oswald· records, approximately 40 percent of the 
documents originated with the FBI and about 20 percent originated • 
from the State D~partment or elsewhere.-Our staff is. still going through the·-material compiled at the re-
quest of the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on · Assassinations, which includ_es 63 •. boxes of· '2aper -records and 
one box that contains -73 reels of microfilm, The xq!crofilm:s, in 
part; overlap material in other parts of ·the collection. ·We estimate 
that within the 68 ·boxes of paper records, approximately 27 per• 
' cent origiDated with a variety of othei'· u,s;aGovemment agencies, 
private organizations~ arid foreign and American press. • Although our documents do include,many documents from other 
agencies, we nonetheless have a substantial collectlon of CIA do~u­
ments that will require considerable· effort to review, -and as I said 
earlier~ at my direction, this review fof declassification is. now un· derway. : · • • • • • • ·' • ·, 
A preUmin&rY survey of these files has provided us some indica• 
tions of what they contain, Although the records cover a wide vari: 
ety· of topics, they princif.allY focus on CIA activities concerning Cuba and Castro, Oswald s defection to _the Soviet Union, and Os­
wald's subsequent activities ·in Mesico City and New Orleans, They_ 
also include a large num~r of name traces requested ·by the staff
