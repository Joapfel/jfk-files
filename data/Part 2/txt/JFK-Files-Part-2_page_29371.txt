accuiate and expeditious manner after 
the ~ssassination to headquarters'. 
With the exception 6f those areas that 
involved sensitive sources and methods~ 
such as theinformation pertaining to the· 
electronic and photographic surveill~nce 
of the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic 
compounds, information develo~~d by 
the CIA in Mexico was generally relayed 
to the Warren C6mmission in an accurate 
and expeditious ma-nner. 
It is the conclusion of this Committee 
. . 
that th~ CIA's photo-surveillance . . 
operations 'in Mexico City probably 
obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey 
Oswald entering_either or both the 
Soviet and Cuban Consulates. The CIA 
denies that such a photograph exists. 
Hence, the diipostion of this photograph 
is un kno·wn.
