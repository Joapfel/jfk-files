V. Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board 
A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination: 
Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining 
relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed. 
The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant 
documents would include: 
-- documents that obviously are related to assassination 
CIA internal investigations 
Oswald records 
Garrison investigation 
Castro assassination attempts 
-- documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on 
issue under consideration 
dates associated with Oswald 
dates immediately around assassination 
dates of Warren Commission 
dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations 
-- individuals of importance 
CIA officials in Mexico City 
David Atlee Phillips 
Win Scott 
CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation 
John Scelso 
JJ Angleton 
- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico) ,,. 
B. Handling of records in sequestered collection 
First, ARAB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection. 
Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to 
word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over 
time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria·for identifying ~ • 
relevance. The focus will be on individuals and groups that have been 
identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination. 
Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the 
greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips, 
Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups
