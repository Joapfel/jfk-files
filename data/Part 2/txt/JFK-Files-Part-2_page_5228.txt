could endanger current .activitfes o_f. ~e Agency in that country. I do not recall 
whether in my subsequent, assignmont as Chief of the Cuban Task Force, any 
mention of the assassination oaxne up. I:-Iowever, if it did, revelation of my name

None of the above should be construed as a waiver of my rights. or those of 
my. heirs~ to take legal action to p~event the release of my name and/or· to oollect 
dam.ages, both civil and punitive,·. resulting from the release of my name. There 
exists an-implicit contraot between me and the Agency dating from when I accepted . . . . . .. 
-~e inconvenience_s of a clandestine r_etirement. Tho Agency undertook to provide a 
• LASTING cover _for me. It should be noted that this implicit contract predates 
.Publ!c Law 102-526 by some 18 years. Naturally, I run going to inform my legal 
advisor of this entire matter. _J suggest that you pull together a set of all documents 
pertaining to my retirement, so. that-these can bo mado available for· his review.

ij I refrain ~om co~ent about a U.S. Congress thnt would pass suoh a bill,

: and a Presictent who would fail tc> veto it. (You of course, are not t~~blame.) The 
\. • New York Times and the Washington Post, will, of oourse, be drooling to get their 
\\ ··hands on your papers. ·1 don't envy you because this is an extremely complicated 
\ ~atter. Unf~rtunat~ly, the release· on a lot of non-pertinent information will go a 
t long way to reveal the soopc and :role of the Agenoy in Latin America to any analyst . .. • . . 
. who wants to review the :materiel and pieoe it together. l believe that this role is not 
significantly ~iffercnt today th~ it was when President Kennedy was murdered. 
Only the targets and the gadgets have changed.
