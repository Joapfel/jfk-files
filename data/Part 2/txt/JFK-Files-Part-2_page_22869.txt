Mr. Bundy':: : As far as· ··· 
Mr. Smothers. And by you~' d;c~~i-t~r·~:~~\ d~cuments 
signed by you? 
Mr. Bundy. They wouldn't be all signed by me, not 
every NSMA was signed by me. But they would all be documents 
for which I had responsibility. 
Mr. Smothers. And the timeframe was --
Mr. Bundy. Sufficiently before and after to gi'Ve me a 
picture of the political context of August 1962 in relation 
to Cuba. 
Mr. Smothers. And do you recall when you saw this file? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, as I say, it was in'the context of my 
appearance before the Rockeferrer Commission. And that would 
~e early this year. I don't have the dates, and I don't 
want to make· a mistake on it. 
Mr. Smothers. I am not trying to pin the date down. It 
would be helpful if you remember. Dut we can ask. 
Mr. Schwarz. 
Mr. Schwarz. I want to make sure that we have what we 
have done so for accurately summarized, and that you agree 
with it. 
Can I use discussion of an assassination, will you 
accept that? 
Mr. !3undy. It implies.more seriousness and more 
sustained argument than I recollect.
