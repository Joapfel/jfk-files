stressed the difficulty of trying to carry 
out such an operation. (Hedgrnan, 8/21/75, 
p. 47.) 
The cable that Hedgman sent to headquarters reporting-his. 
initial contact with Gottlieb was clearly an affirmative res~onse 
to the assignment. The Chief of Station said that he and Gottlieb 
were "ON SAHE WAVELENGTH." (CIA Cable IN 18989, Leopoldville to 
Tweedy, 9/27/60.) Hedgrnan was _"afraid" that Mobutu's government 
was "weakening under" foreign pressure to effect a reconciliation 
with Lumumba, and said: 
HENCE BELIEVE MOST RAPID ACTION CONSISTENT 
WITH SECURITY INDICATED. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.) 
(c) Hedgman Testified That Gottlieb Told Him That 
President Eisenhower Had Ordered the Assassination 
of Lumumba 
Hedgman testified that in the course of their meeting in 
Leopoldville, Dr. Gottlieb informed him that President Eisenhower 
had authorized the assassination of Lumumba:

Hedgman: In essence, I think I must have ... pointed 
out that this was not a common or usual Agency tactic, 
and I may have probably said that I never heard of 
it being done, which I had not, never in my training 
or previous work in the Agency had I ever heard any· 
references to such, in my recollection at least, such 
methods. And it is my recollection I asked on whose 
authority these instructions were issued. 
Q: And what did Mr. Gottlieb reply?
