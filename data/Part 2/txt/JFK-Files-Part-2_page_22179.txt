In a Presidential ITEeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONJ;:, HELMS, AND COLBY 
in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested 
that 1n the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHARI', andR.~IDl\~Sr@I!Tifjact as a 
comni ttee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that (&~!~should 
----------n~ot-5e involved ffi sucha policy-making functron~although-he-wou:tct-be-1n-a-posit±on-t·o----------
provide technical advise to HARKINS and 1'RUEHARI' as well as carry out their instructions 
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not 
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General 
felt the U.S. was risldng too much based on flimsy ev idence. The OCI stated his view 
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might 
only be solved by a second or third coup.
