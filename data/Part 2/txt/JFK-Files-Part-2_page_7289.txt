.This· letter is ·to confirm an oral request by Committee staff 
for an orientation briefing for a visit to South America which two 
members of the staff, David Aaron and William Trueheart, have been 
asked. to make next month. 
Although plans are not yet firm, it is expected that they will 
be free to travel during the second and third weeks of September. 
It is proposed that they visit Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro,_and 
~ If time permits; they. might also visit another con- • 
sular post in Brazil and/or Buenos Aires. • 
The primary purpose of this travel is to discuss State-CIA 
relations in the field with Embassy and Station officers. Asap-. 
•propriate, past Agency programs may also be reviewed . 
. Messrs. Aaron and Trueheart are not expected to consult with 
officials of the host government and, so far as the Committee is 
concerned~ the latter need not be informed of the visit. 
Sincerely youi;-s, 
William G. Miller
