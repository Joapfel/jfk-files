MR. HALPERN: They were not. 
INTERVIEWER: OK.

MR. HALPERN: And the oversight committees, maybe that was one of the 
problems, d1dn't do much oversight as you well know. And as a matter of fact 
I remember these reports from DCI's coming back say1ng, "I got nobody to talk 
to up on the H111. They won't listen. All they want to do is give me money 
and personne 1 . -And they say, you know, "Go -do your job." And so this is 
true. I have heard that from senior officers in the jobs I have held at staff 
meetings over and over ~gain. The Director came back again and he doesn't 
have anybody to talk to. Nobody wants to listen. Nobody wants to know. And 
there is Senator Stennis and Saltonstall and all of those others. 
INTERVIEWER: And Russel.1? 
MR. HALPERN: And Russell who sat on the floor of the Senate. You know there 
are certain things you have to just accept and not knpw_ about. Or Goldwater 
even today, when he was chairman of the Senate Committee said, "This Committee 
shouldn't exist." So the four oversight committees never gave us any trouble 
really except toward the end, they were very clear about one thing. I think 
it was Russell who told I th1nk Dick Helms, DCI -- and you can check the 
record on th1s one I'm sure -- who told him, "this is the last year,

forget what year 1t was. I guess it must have been

71 or something like 
that.> This is the last year we are going to fund those Meo tribes for you. 
It's getting too big. Turn it over to the r:nil1tary,
11 
you know, "and lose it 
in the Defense budget." Because it. got to over a hundred million dollars and 
• all that k1nd of stuff, I guess in those days that was a little big. 
INTERVIEWER: Well did you have the impression besides Pincus that Paul and 
L&M were also Vietnam veterans or .. 7
