\\\,, :o a public acknowledgment of a station in Tunisia and might well 
r engage in harassment/ sabotage/terrorist actions in Tunisia to 
show its displeasure. If tha Tunisian Government should ask that 
( our station b8 clos8d, the U.S. Government would lose a 
; capability to collect on Libya, north African stability, and 
• !\, Islamic extremism. (S) 
10. Public acknowledgment o~ a station in Morocco would be a 
i\ problem for Morocco vis-a-vis its Islamic fundamentalist 
, population. Morocco, like so many countries with a majority 
Muslim population, has a growing Islamic fundamentalist problem, 
and Ielamic fundamentalists are frequently opposed to the U.S. in 
general and the Agency in particular. Public acknowledgment of a 
station in Morocco could cause its Islamic fundamentalist 
·population to react negativaly and demand that our station be 
closed. If th8 station ware closed, the u.s. GovernmGnt would 
lose intelligence on the western Sahara conflict, north African 
stability and Islamic extremism. (S) 
11. In those instances whare I have indicated damage to 
operational capability and national security, I would feel 
compelled to seek a reversal of any decision to make a publio 
acknowledgment. In those cases where I indicatQ "no spedific or 
additional damage", I am prepared to accept your decision yet I 
must call your attention to the general damage done to us by any 
disclosure of operational presence. Our operational capabilities 
are in direct proportion to the confidence placed in our ability ·• to protect source identities and operational ffiQthoda. Disclosure 
to the public of our presence weakens this confidence._!!L-_··~'·~·-·~~~~~~
