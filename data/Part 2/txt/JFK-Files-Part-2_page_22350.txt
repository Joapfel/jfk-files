~ psychiatrist and that he had 
no knowledge of t;l-iat ma.tter prio1. to the brea'L:-i n. He is na,.; ao:ruainted 
v.d. th the \\1hi te House re.quest rrade to Ge!"'.eral Cushrna.11 for assistill1ce to 
Vir. Hunt in 1971. He is also na.v· farriliar 1;;it..l-i t..1-ie fact that the CIA 
orovided to i•ir. Hunt disguise equiprre.>1t, false identification pacers, 
and a ca:rrera , in response to the Mute House re::_ruest. He also now knows 
that Mr. Hunt arrar1ged for the develop:,2.,t of the photographs which he 
had apparently tak-::11 on th,2 occasion of the break-in at the off ice of 
~1r. Ellsberg's psychiatrist. 
In 1971 Mr. Osb:Jm received a request from Mr. Young at the White House 
for the psycrnlogical profile on Daniel Ellsberg. He says that Mr. Young 
stated that the White House had been ve.ry pleased with the profile which 
had reen developed by the CIA on Fidel Castro and wuld like the sarre 
kind of profile on Ellsterg. 
Osb:Jm stated that he resoonded to YOUL'ig that the CIA personnel had a 
are.3.t deal of biographical material on Ells berg. Young assured Osborn 
that the White House ,-.Duld provide ITUtc.:::-ial on Ellsberg. Osborn re­
sponded that such a request ¼Duld ha'\le to be approved by the OCT, 
Mr. Helm:3. 
Oslx>rn then took the matter to Mr. Helns, wro aporo'\Ted the proiect and 
told him to provide the renuested assistance to Young. 
Young thereafter sent materials from t.:.::-e to tirre to Osoom relating to 
Ellsberg. It was Osborn's ~ression that these materials vvere very 
fragarrentary and ¼Duld not be sufficient to provide a rrean.ingful psycho-
10:Jical profile. Nonetheless, the reauest and the materials were 
turnt=>d o'\ler to the doctors at CIA and a draft of a profile was ultimately 
·worked up. Mr. Young did not appear to be very well nleased with the 
drrift. 
Mr. Osb:Jm sui.1Tlises that the break-in at the off ic:es of Dr. Fielding 
(Ellc;!:erq' s psychiatrist) was cJ.ccon--;:, li.sl-':2d for the pu.r,:::x::x,e of gathering 
rrore inforrration with whic.'7. to d2velop :1 better psvchological profile.
