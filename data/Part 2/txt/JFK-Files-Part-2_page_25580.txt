Dear Mr. Miller: -:·;}::~:r.-. 
Recently I discussed with Dr. E. W. Pfeiffer, University of Montana • ·,, 
zoolocist., an incident in which he has had an abiding concern: the 
herbicide attack that occur red in eastern Cambodia in -the spring of --:-:~ ~" 
1969., • 
As I under stand it, from my talks with ·Dr. Pfeiffer and from my 
review of the correspondence he has received from vario~s aijencies, 
there is no doubt that thu attack actually occurred, that it was 
l~rge and sipnificant, and that the nature of the chemicals and 
aircraft involved indicate that the U.S. had:a direct role in 
carrying it out. 
Yet it seems the State and Defense departments, the CIA and the 
"nrivate 11 CIA-affiliate Air America have all denied in one way or 
another that they conducted the attack. 
The obvious question is who did make the attack? Who ordered it., , c "· ·:·.,.·' .,' 
why was it ordered and under what authority? Dr. Pfeiffer has :r.:_: ___ :_-~_/: 
indicated your committee is looking into this matter and that the 
affair may ultimately be discussed in-the course of Select Committee 
hearings at some point. 
Is it nossible for you to tell me the status of your inquiry? Would 
. it be a"propria te at this time for our newspaper to_. interview Dr. 
Pfeiffer and write -a news story on the documents he has received., 
or would su.ch a s tuJ.y benefit from new information your committee 
efforts may resurrect within the near future? 
_ '.rhanks in advance for your interest. We have followedwith great 
interest the Sele.ct Committee efforts to date.
