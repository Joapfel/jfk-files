MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT 
SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro 
Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the 
Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con­
tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish 
to review. The three operations involved are: 
( 1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal 
warehouse and pier; 
(2) a sabotage attack ;against naval or patrol vessels in 
a harbor; and 
(3) a sabotage operation against a fue~ barge proceeding 
in coastal waters.; 
All of these operations would·have been approved three months ago, 
and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted 
be cause of high seas. While it is always hard to predict the noise 
level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the 
small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which o_ccurred in late December 
which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation 
approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it 
seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed-_in your first review 
of the Cuban problem). \ 
\, 
The policy question now is this: Ii we continue these even small 
sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally,; if we 
call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians. We1 thus 
I 
have an opportunity to choose. 
I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone. 
I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle 
of covert_ sabotage against Cuba. I know that Rusk has never liked it 
and that McNamara thinks it does very little good. McCone and the CIA 
are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the 
Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely rvenly balanced,
