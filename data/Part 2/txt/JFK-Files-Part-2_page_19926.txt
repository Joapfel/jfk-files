Women must use their minds, their voices, and 
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do 
less is to ignore our special responsibilities to • 
the human race. 
"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons 
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women 
willing to go to ja_il if necessary we could stop 
the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with­
out women. " 
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in 
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first 
woman elected to Congress, she voted against 
World War I. She has consistently maintained 
her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura 
geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all 
women. 
The presence of the United States forces in the in 
ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal. 
There can be no possible justification for our int 
ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distan 
land. 
This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is w· 
ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N 
all women are free to join her, but we can assure 
.; .-·her that tliou'sands ·of women will'march peace'full 
beside her. Some will picket, others will go to j 
with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation • 
equally valuable. We are confident each one will 
the maximum of which she is capable. 
On January 8th, women from all over the land wi 
converge on Washington to demand the end of this 
dishonorable war. We shall come as individuals, 
or as organizations, but we shall join together as 
concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Rai
