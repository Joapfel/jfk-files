limited to our investigating logica1 persons who may be so developed. a 
Prior to actually contacting such persons to determine their potential, ~ 
State clearance is again obtained for each person being considered. In S 
the past, State has indicated it feels that because of the risks involved, ' 
we should only consider for development ~s sources, American citizens 
employed at African diplomatic establishments. However, State has / f 
indicated that w~ere there is an investigative need for such a _sourcf, 1\ 
State would consider granting clearance :for development of other tha- { i j
