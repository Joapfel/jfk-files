MR. HALPERN: But Bill wants to build nations. And its very laudable and 
maybe some government agency ought to build nations. And maybe he ought to be 
in the AID, or ICA in the old days, or the Red Cross or wherever. But not as 
a clandestine operations officer, trying to collect intelligence and recruit 
human beings to be your agent, your spy. A lot of us in the old FE Division 
on the working level thought, there is going to be trouble with this guy. 
INTERVIEWER: Did you meet him in '56 then? 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, su.re. Yes I was Des' Exec then too. 
INTERVIEWER: I see. 
MR. HALPERN: In FE. So, a lot of us thought this was a problem guy but Des 
wants him around, and Des is the boss, so what the hell. There's nothing we 
can do. You know, maybe he'll learn something under Nick we used to say. 
·-
Nick was a tough old Greek, old hand and he knew the business. In fact, he 
was a poet. 
INTERVIEWER: So it was thought that maybe he'd change. 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, but he didn't. - Bill never changed. And so a lot of us 
well, for example, Bill, when he was Division Chief in FE -- I wasn"t even in 
the Di-vision at that point -- but Bill had an idea, for example, on how the 
OCI's Daily Intelligence Report should look. He thought 1t ought to be like a 
tabloid newspaper and even had a dummy made up for this thing. Well, it was 
laughed out of court at the time. Bill kept that dummy until he became DCI 
and he put it into effect. It became what is now called the National 
Intelligence Daily although I am told it is no longer in the newspaper 
format. That was changed as soon as Casey came aboard. But that is Bill for -
you. Once he gets something in his head, you don't change him.
