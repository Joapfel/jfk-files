1. Iraq~Syria a. The shaky new accommodation 
between the two countries following 
the recent coup in Iraq has been 
threatened by Syria's action in
1
grant­
ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the 
exiled leader of the extremist wing 
of the Iraqi Baath. • 
b. Saadi had arrived in Syria 
unannounced following a brief stay 
in Madrid. On Friday, Iraq sent a 
message asking Syria to expel him on 
grounds that sheltering him was a 
breach of agreement. 
c. Both regimes continue to be 
troubled with internal dissension 
with affairs in one deeply tangled 
with those in the other. 
d. In Syria, as we mentioned 
yesterday, the Baathist regime is 
split. between moderates who desire 
a broadening of the government's 
power base,and a doctrinaire faction 
which wants to keep all control of 
the government in Baathist hands. 
e. In Iraq, the pull is· more 
away from the Baathists. Two minis­
ters have threatened to resign unless 
the government adopts an openly pro­
Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the 
goverriment feels secure enough to 
ease up on curfew and transport re­
strictions imposed since the coup.
