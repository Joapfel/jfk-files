On 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, staff Jf#JP~r~ 
members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence fbf:0; , '· \ 
Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and °m \ 1 
members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD. Briefe ' , 
from the Committee were Mr., William Mi_ller, Staff Director; \J 
Mr. Frederick A. o. Schwarz III, Chief(;ounsel; and 
Messrs. Mark Gitenstein·; ·Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt /1 
Snider and Loch Johnson, all staff members. l,· 
The first hour of the briefing was occupied wii:h -1/ \ . 
the showing of the INTD slide presentation and commentary 1/ 
which provided highlights of the work of the INTD, both in 
the counterintelligence and internal security field. Following 
this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the 
rest of the briefing. Mr. Miller ~nd Mr. Schwarz posed most 
of the questions. 
In the counterintelligence field the thrust of the 
'
questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the 
hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its 
short-term and long-term effect on the FBI's operations. 
Mr., Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions 
had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence 
effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents, 
and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to 
assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent 
personnel, thereby freeing additional Special Agents to function 
as case officers. In response to a question·as to whether the 
additional investigative effort necessary to counter the 
mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve invest~ 
gation of more and more American citi~ens, Mr., ~wann!:.~c~~~~~;)
