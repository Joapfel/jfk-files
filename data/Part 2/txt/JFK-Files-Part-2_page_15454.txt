l 
indicated on 1-11-62 l1e was tf1inking in terms· of extending coverage 
on the smaller countries ra.ther. than the "Iron Curtain" countries.

' representatives of the smaller· countries might talk more freely. • He 
indicated he did·not want coverage of our true friends, like the 
British. He hinted at possible coverage of the Indonesians. On 
1-20-62 ·when Evans spoke with him he ·indicated he felt additional 
coverage of the African countries might be worthwhile.
