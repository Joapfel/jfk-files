ADDENDUM ·INTELLIGENCE DIVISION :SFP::lhb 7/2/75 
INTD has re.ceived no report . ·or has any information 
concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum. 
Concerning t.:: the allegation in this memorandum 
that information originated with the FBI that communist 
funds were used to· finance Martin Luther King, Jr., and _that 
King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted. 
We have never had any information that communist funds, 
literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable 
) 
reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly 
as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close adv•isor, 
Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA. •• 
However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that 
11communist funds" were financing King. King was·never known 
to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had 
a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time 
were either current or past CPUSA members. 
INTD is unable _to pinpoint the report that 11King 
laughed all the way to the bank."
