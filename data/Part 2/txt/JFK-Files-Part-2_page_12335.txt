respondence setting forth derogatory informa·tion, an4 should be ad­
dressed to attention of Administrative Division, Voucher Unit. Inter­
divisional correspondence should be addressed to Bureau with copies 
designated for interested offices. 
Receipt of unemployment compensation • . 
a. At times informants and/or sources temporarily lose ·!;heir jobs 
and become -eligible for unemployment compensation. Whe~e un­
employment regulations require listing of all sources of income as 
prerequisite for unemployment compensation and informants and/or 
sources who are being paid by Bureau fail to comply, situation is • 
potentially embarrassing. Bureau cannot be placed in position of 
condoning violation of state law on part of any informant or source. 
Field office must determine from state unemployment compensation 
officiils effect of unemployment compensation laws on _paid informants 
and/or sources.· Depending on local requirements, informants anci. 
sources must be alerted accordingly. • 
b. When paid informant and/or source becomes unemployed or has knowledge 
of impending unemployment, discuss all facts with him and submit 
recommendations to Bureau on UACB basis. At same time, weigh ser:i_.ously 
possible need for informant to apply and accept unemployment compen­
sation to protect his security. Fellow members of subversive organi­
zation may be aware of his unemployment status and would expect him 
to apply. Where state requires notification of Bureau payments t(? in­
formants that would necessitate di·sclosure of identity, discontinue 
Bureau payments during period of unemployment compensation benefits.
