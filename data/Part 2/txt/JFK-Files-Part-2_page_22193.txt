With regard to paragraph Z-otL"ansdale's memorandum to Sr..A dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation ~-1ongoose had had no infonnation on 
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdal~'s memorandum conceminp, a report for the CIA which he 
used as a basis for memorandrnn dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This r_efers to 
------------a-te·lephonic~eonve:r-sat-ion-on_the_ey_eniim of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and @!frl@&~;It: 
which is referred specifically in· paragraph 2 on. pages 7 anc1-s-o-f-my-refcrence-mem0FancJ.u..--------­
I have discussed this matter in detail with [~"1;J,)%:v.LeJj and clearly recollects that his 
conversation ,vi th Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

diso1ssion of the COBRA t~E'.fili@JlI~ISJ teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to (i8'S.e~\le~r5:} 
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
--SOURCE: would logtecllly have led to the tiiscussions at the timp STAPF: 
of the Matahambre operation."
