l nsked Sirhun's mother why she 
thought her son had shot Kennedy. 
"Ev~rything in this country was helping 
Sirhan," she maintai!led. "It was push~ 
ing him to the danger point. Everything, 
the propaganda of the Zionists, every­
thing, was against his country, against 
his people." 
Adel described Sirhan's current state 
of mind: "He feels he has done a terrible 
thing, but he feels now it is too late to be 
sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen 
to something they have never listened 
to." 
And at their first meeting in the jail, 
Sirhan's mother said to him, "Shame on 
you: Why hnvc you done such a thing'!" 
tk replied, "It's too late to speak of iL. 
. But all the Am(."ricans will know why."

EPSTEIN'S GARRISON 
T
' WO'SUMMl:RS ,\(a} a tandem .allack 
on the Warren Report nil hut rele­
gated thut work to the fiction 
section of your local library. The first 
was Mark Lane's Rush to Judginent, 
which convincingly demonstrnted-us­
ing the·Wurren Commis~ion's own evi­
dence-that Oswald could not have done 
. it alone, and drew the first dim outlines 
of the conspiracy theory. The second • 
w~s.Edward Jay Epstein's Inquest, which 
exposed the rather shoddy inner work­
ings of the Commission and laid bare the 
tortured logic it finally employed to dis­
pel notions of a conspiracy. 
Roth books became best sellers, but 
their authors have since gone different 
ways, l .. lllll'. Wh\.J shullered his lnw prac­
ti1·l' and ,;tnii-:gk•d r.,r yeurs to get his 
mu1111scrip1 published in . the United 
Slates (it was tirst published in Britain), 
has st.11111pcJ lhc l'l)Untry in support of 
Distrirt Attorney Jim Garrison's theory 
thut the ussnssinution w11s rnrril·d out by 
1111 unti-Castro p,m1111ilitary tcum super-
vised by persons with CIA nfflliatlonil, 
Epstein, whose book was a converted 
Cornell University master's thesis,--the 
subject was urged upon him by his men­
tor, Andrew Hacker-has emerged as 
one of Garrison's most fervid accusers. 
His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the 
issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-
word blast at Garrison, calling the DA 's 
investigation a fraud. • 
The New Yorker article had its genesis 
over a year ago, when the author showed 
up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.· 
According· to Chief Invesugator Louis 
Ivon, Epstein spent about. 48 hours in 
town, some three hours at the office, and 
. hasn't been seen since. Much of what he 
writes about has occurred since this 
touch-and-go visit and is obviously heur-
• say on his part, yet he writes with the 
authoritative tone of a participant. Un­
doubtedly this technique is convincing· 
to his audience, which assumedly is un­
familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's 
investigation. But to those familiar with 
the facts, the article is badly slanted. 
For example, Philosophy Professor 
Richard. Popkin of the University of 
California at San Diego, author of the 
book The Second Oswald (propounding . 
the theory of an . Oswald double) and 
"Garrison's Case" in The New York 
Review of Books (September 14, 1967), 
recently commented on the article: 
"I found it a queer mix of facts, half• 
facts, rumors and v~ry dubious in.forma~ 
lion from people hostile to G11rrisori. 
Epstein has compressed all this to make 
it look -like everything's on the same 
level. I think it would take an awful lot 
of work to disentangle what he's saying 
on almost any page as to how much of 
it has a factual base, how much of it is 
• rumor that he has heard from people, 
how much of it a~ charges that have 
been made by people like [William] Gur­
vich [who volunteered to work on the 
• .. investigation without pay, pa~d him­
self off as the Chief Investigator, then 
. turned on Garrison] agains~ Garrison,-· 
which haven't been substantiated any­
where except by Gurvich's statement of 
them. And also that he tenas. to take 
focts and information and rul'!lors and so 
on, that occurred over a year and a hairs 
period, and compress them all into 
simultaneous events, so that a statement 
made by Garrison at one • time is 
pounced upon on the basis of informa­
tion or stnternents he mude II year und u 
httlf later in u totally different context. 
: • . 
So 1 Jhlnk it 'ii u '-!Ulte 1111foir pre11eilln• 
tion, which has some foct1111l b11se, hut 
_which also has a lo_t of very dubious 
elements in it.'( 
One of the dubious elements is Ep­
stein's version; of the testimony of Dean • •.•••. 
Andrews Jr., :a colorful attorney who 
numbers amo~g his former clients Os-
wald (who wantecl. his undesirable dis­
charge from the Marine Corps rectified) 
and the late ,David William Ferrie, a •• 
central figure in the Garrison investiga­
tion. The day after the assassination, 
_Andrews told the Commission _he re- _ 
ceived a phone call from a man he knew . 
as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as . 
a "lawyer without a briefcase" for local 
homosexuuls. Bertrand asked him to go 
to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison· 
contends Bertran<! is Clay Shaw, whom 
he has chargecl with conspirucy. .. 
According, to Epstein, Andrews ini~ 
tially gave the FBI "several different de­
scriptions" of liertrand, and finally ad­
mitted that • Bertrand "was merely a . 
figment of his imagination." Later, be, 
fore the Commission, Andrews stated 
that he had recently seen Bertrand in a 
bar and, Epstein says, described him as 
"a boy" who'.was"five feet eight inches" 
and had "sandy hair.'' "No other clues . 
to BertraQd'i; identity turned up, how-.· • 
; ever," write$ Epstein, "and Wesley J. 
Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con­
ducted thi= i~vcstigation in this area, said 
he was convinced that no such person 
existed." 
An objc.-ctive rettdirik' of 'Andrews' __ ,.~ 
testimony, however, reveals that he 
-told the FBI :that Bertrand wai;"approxl­
mately six feet .one inch t~ six feet two 
inches in height, brpwn hair, and weil 
drcssc;d,t.;_a: description that closely 
matches thq tall, aristocratic Shaw. As •• 
for Bertrand being a figment of his 
imagination~ Andrews declared, "Thijt's 
what the Feebees [FBI] put on." He re­
counted thJt G~meri had pestered him . • 
to the poin4~hefe he told them,,.Write 
what you want, that lam nuts. _I don't 
car4'." As for his later remark· to the 
Commission's Mr." Liebeler that :t:39,r­
trand was pnly five feet, eight inches, .. 
Andrews e~plained that "this time I was 
looking fo~ the fellow, he was sittios • 
down." Nbwhere • does he refer to Ber• • 
trand as a ''boy." Epstein was perhaps 
confused by his exclam11tion: "l don't 
pluy Doy Scout and measure them."
