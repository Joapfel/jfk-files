Re: Submission of CIA's Initial Statement of Compliance Under the JFK 
Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 
.Dear Mr. Harrelson: 
I have been asked by Jeremy Gunn to take responsibility, along with Robert Skwirot 
and Michelle Combs, for handling the Review Board's JFK Act Compliance Program 
with respect to the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Mr, Gunn has informed me that you have agreed to provide us with the CI.A's initial 
compliance statement (as it is described in our November 27, 1996 letter to the CIA) by 
the end of November 1997 .. Thereafter, we can establish a reasonable time for the CIA 
to prepare and submit its Final Declaration of Compliance. The OA's Final Declaration 
will be submitted to Congress and the President. 
Thank you for your cooperation. 
Sincerely, 
14Ji 9d -~ 
Ronald G. Haron
