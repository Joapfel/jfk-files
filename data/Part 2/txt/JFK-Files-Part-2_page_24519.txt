b. General Lansdale as the Chief of Operations of MONGOOSE. 
General Edward Lansdale wa9 named the Chief of Operations of the MONGOOSE 
activities by President Kennedy. Lansdale had developed a reputation in 
the Philippines and Vietnam for having .an ability to deal with revolu­
tionary insurgencies in less developed countries. In addition, as a 
result of the Bay of Pigs failure, President Kennedy distrusted the CIA 
... 
and believed he required someone from outside the Agency to oversee 
major covert action programs. Rather than appoint Robert Kennedy to 
head Mongoose as proposed by Goodwin, President Kennedy gave Lansdale 
the task of coordinating the CIA's Mongoose operations with those of the 
Departments of State and Defense, and made General Taylor the Chairman 
of the Special Group Augmented. However, Hobert :~ennedy did play an active 
role in the Mongoose structure, unrelated to his position as Attorney General.
