telephonically related that he had been requested to come to Washington for \V't/·

Senate Select Committee. Baumgardner advised Epstein that he would make 
himself available for interview but at his office at 970 South 4th Street, Louisville, 
Kentucky, telephone number 584-5183. Mr. Baumgardner expressed concern ,~ 
regarding the interview pointing out that he was Section Chief in the Intelligencerf 
Division for some 18 years and during the time was continually dealing with .11 • 
very sensitive matters which he felt were not the proper subject matter of disciis­
slon .-:, with people outside the FBI. Additionally, he pointed out he has been 
out of the Bureau for some eight years and since he is not aware of current 
Bureau operations he, therefore, requested the Bureau have a representative 
present during the interview and that the Bureau representative so designated 
be thoroughly fruniUar with Intelligence Division operations so that he might 
be made aware of those areas which are sensitive and might compromise 
current Bureau investigations. He suggested that the Bureau representative 
I 
should arrive sometime the day before . the proposed interview which is 
f 4-2Q-75 so that he may have a preliminary discussion with the Bureau repre­
sen1:.~t~ve concerning those areas in which he has knowledge of and~K, 1::..,... _
