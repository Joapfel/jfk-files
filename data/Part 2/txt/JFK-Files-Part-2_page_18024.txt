~ ~-. _____,...,, " r On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney h1 the office 
U of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney 
recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and ~ 
advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines ~ 
for the Attorney- General's approval concerning legal representation of "-, Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of 
legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI 
concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the 
larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed 
guidelines. s ,4 t;i 
I told Miss \Vaguer that in the beginning of the inquiries received ••<of 
from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by· ti1e g 
Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys, 1.~ 
i.ncludirglawyers in the FBI, from providing legal representation individualli 
to the employees of tha FBI in 1natters relali.ng to the Senate and House (j. 
inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the 
procedures involved i.n Congressional committee interviews and appearances 
for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive 
areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to 
counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have 
to be privately employed. I told Mtss VJagner that my reading of tbe 
Attorney General 1s memorandum for the Director dated· September 12, 1975, 
was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available 
to en1ployees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines to be 
written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal
