SUBJECT: ( s) Protection of ([~oECANTiR)cryptonym 
information to the effect that OSWALD was a KGB source. It 
continues by stating that CIA did not believe ZHURAVLEV to be a 
credible source. It continues by stating that this CIA

stating that this source 6IJDECANTERY has had his " ... bona fides

... fully established [by CIA]." It is this final fact which is 
critical to our request. By having released this substantive 
information --_ ~'bona £ides ... established" -- and by otherwise 
having Q=Jl)ECANT~R]known to the public in true name and crypt, we 
must protect the cryptonym here so that the key intelligence 
judgment of CIA is not compromised. _______ . _ __ __ __ __ __ _ ___ _ _

four basic questions: 
• what information was compromised? 
• what foreign intelligence service(s) received the 
information? 
• what understanding of the information did the 
service(s) have? 
• what informat1on did the intelligence service(s) 
believe and thus act on to its benefit and to the 
detriment of the United States? 
6. (C) The first two questions are largely factual and can 
be acquired through a combination of confessions, polygraph 
interviews, and/or assumptions based on access. Questions three 
and four, however, are the most difficult and the most important 
for both the acquiring iptelligence service and the target 
intelligence service.

7. (S) With further respect to question three, if a )) 
foreign government fully understands the substance (i.e., the 
import), they will be abl~ to exploit the information fully and 
the damage will be far beyond the ostensible value. A perfect / 
example of this is the Boyce/Lee espionage case. The information)//
