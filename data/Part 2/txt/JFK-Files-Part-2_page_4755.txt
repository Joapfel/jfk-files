~ibitzing. After you've 1een a piece of paper if jou.want to give it to me to

to be• able to talk to you privately.

And he looked at me and he said, "Yeah, 
yeah.

And he never said anything about it again. So, I didn't know 
everything. But I didn't need to know everything. That's crazy. Oh sure, 
while Des was there I ran operations for Des as his case officer and case 
officer for him. He didn't tell his deputy, Tom Karamessines, who didn't know 
anything about it. It was up to me after Des died to go in and brief Tom on a 
bunch of activities that Tom may have known about but. not officially and to 
clue him in. And then he had to do the same thing in turn to Cord Meyer when 
Cord became the deputy. So no, I didn't know ev~ryth1ng that went on. And I 
never claimed that I did. The only thing I couldn't do was that I couldn't 
stop people from unloading on me. They had to have somebody to talk to so I 
let them talk. 
INTERVIEWER: Nice to have somebody. How about the assassination. Did that 
business surprise you when it came out? 
MR. HALPERN: No, because I was involved with one. Some of the others that I 
hadn't known about, yeah sure, 1t wasn't in my area. So I wasn't involved and 
I didn't know. The one I was involved in was the one, I guess the (I'm 
forgetting the crypts for these>, the one against Castro. One of the ones 
against Castro. I did not know about the use of the Mafia by 8111 Harvey. 
INTERVIEWER: You didn't know about . 
MR. HALPERN: No, Bill, you think I was tight lipped. He could run rings 
around me. 
INTERVIEWER: I can imagine.
