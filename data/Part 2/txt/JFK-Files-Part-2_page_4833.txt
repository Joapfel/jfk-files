anything about it. 
INTERVIEWER: I'm glad to get it on the record. 
MR. HALPERN: It's on the record. I've had it on the record so 
many times with people. I've told this to Seymour Hersh. But 
he didn't believe me until he did his own homework. He didn't 
even believe in looking at my copy. It wasn't here 1n this 
house. I was out with him. I do my homework. And when I've 
got, you know, I said, "I'm not saying this. Here, you read 
it." He had to do his own homework and he finally told me at 
another subsequent session, he said, "Yes, you were right, 
Sam." I said, "I didn't make it up." And I don't know 
Senseney from a hole in the wall. You got me at the wrong 
moment. 
·INTERVIEWER: I'm glad to get it. 
MR. HALPERN: I'm getting hot under the collar. 
INTERVIEWER: .That's fine. That's fine. 
MR. HALPERN: I don't mind, you know, taking blame for 
something we did. And there is no blame in having a dart gun, 
by dammit. I think Senseney was right to have perfected one. 
The fact that we didn't use it and nobody else used it, that's 
another one of those wasted things, wasted efforts maybe. But 
if suddenly somebody needed -- well, we did use it, I'm 
sorry. But not as an assassination weapon. He used it against 
dogs. 
INTERVIEWER: Right, guard dogs.
