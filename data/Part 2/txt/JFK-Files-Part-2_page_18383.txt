Dear Mike: 
As Mark and you discussed today.on uhe phone, 
it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz' letter to 
you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the 
Internal Security Division, ·provide informatio~ pertaining 
to the individuals and organizations listed in"that letter. 
Of course this letter and the August 29 letter are modified 
by my letter of September 10. Furthermore, ·this request is 
of the highest priority and therefore we want to be kept 
. informed of its progress on a daily basis. Perhaps the 
; • best approach would be to have Bureau representatives con-
, D~Jsc~~1 tact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so 
: 10 ,~ ~v·y/ot that we might prioritize the names listed in the September 
sS c /~'1"' f/.?- 4 letter.
