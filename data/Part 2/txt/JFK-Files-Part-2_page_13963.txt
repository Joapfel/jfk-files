Please provide: all memoranda and other materials 
reflecting conversations, contacts, or communications between the 
FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of 
!!notional" Marxist-Leninist organizations within the United States. 
No information has been. developed indicating this Bureau 
conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau- ..._/ 
sponsored "notional" Mf1,r~ist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI 
did, in fact, direct ,several such organizations, no information has been 
developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their 
establishme:i;it or creation. 
In one instance, CIA advised in 2/70 it had established 
a notional organization with post office box addresses in Boston, 
Massachusetts, and Philadelphia, PEJJIBylvan.ia. This notional organization, 
to be kn0wn as the Union for the Revolution, had the objective of qeveloping 
penetrations and/ or sources in revolutionary Arab g:r;oups in the Mitldl:e 
:E.a:tst.~. It was CIA' s intention to circulate propaganda from the post office 
boxes in anticipation of interesting Arab groups. Thereafter, it was 
CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to contact the 
Arab groups. (See memorandum dated 2/13/70 captioned "Union for the 
Revolution, TT 100-456409-2, copy attached.)~ -1 
By letterhead memorandum dated 3/23/70, the FBI 
indicated information had been received indicating·the Union for the 
Revolution had been in contact with a domestic Marxist- Leninist organization _ 
requesting literature. This memorandum set forth an analysis of a 
"Statement of the Union for the Revolution" indicating the document lacked 
credibility as a revolutionary document. (LHM dated 3/23/70 captioned 
"Union for the Revolution, " 100-456409-4, copy attached.) 
[ As the Union for the Revolution w~s. strictly a creation of ( 
CIA, it is recommended before any information be disseminated outside 
the FBI relating to this orga~ization, clearance be obtained through CIA]
