Schlesinger came in it was just a traumatic, _really traumatic, experience. 
INTERVIEWER: Was Schlesinger known to the Agency? 
MR. HALPERN: No, just by reputatiori. 
INTERVIEWER: JOst by reputation. And that wa~? 
MR. HALPERN: Bad. Because ·of the things he had done in the Atomic Energy

impersonal. The new "machine man" kind of thing, you know, the mathematical 
brain or whatever -- oh, I guess machine is a better stated cause. 
INTERVIEWER: So that reputation was known and therefore .. 
MR. HALPERN: Oh yeah, not only known but it was, you know -- immediately the 
phone calls went out all-over town asking, "What about this, who is this guy, 
what's he like?" And everything we .got back was bad. _Bad, bad, bad, bad,

made i.nputs of the information for whatever attitude Schlesinger had on the 
whole thing. N?w Schlesinger's attitude about what he did total_ly changed 
since he's out of government, since Helms' ou~of government. and ·everybody 
else. It was 180 degree switch. 
INTERVIEWER: For Colby? 
MR. HALPERN: No, for Schlesinger.
