Counsel of Senate Select Committee on Intel­
ligence· 
This meeting occurred on Wednesday~ 29 October 1975 
as a re·sult of concern on the par.t of Senate Select • 
Committee officers that the Agency.was not forthcoming 
wi.th file material related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case, • 
i.e., 'the assassination ·of President Kennedy. The 
foll9wing po_ints w,~re made by .the principals as indicated. • 
Chi~£\ "er - To open the meetin-g Mr. Kaiaris made i •. ciear 
that the Agency is anxious to demonstrate that we have 
nothing to hide and that all pertinent material was made 
available to the Warren Commission.· He added'that.the 
procedure for making material available to the Senate 
Staff posed certain problems with regard to sources, 
methods and liaison, which were delaying the turnover of 
material. He then presented several examples of the 
sanitization process in ·which cables .taken directly from 
the 201 file were edited so that all evidence of source, 
method and liaison information was removed. 
Chief Counsel-- Asan opening reply Mr. Wallach stated 
that his position was that he conside~ed that the Senate 
Committee should have the same access as the Rockefe:l:ler 
Commission. He added that in his di.scussions with several 
senators on his committee they had mentioned reports that 
a Rockefeller.reviewing official by the name of Belin who 
had had access to the original file.,had appeared on several 
talk shows and was going to write·a book based on his 
review of Agency holdings on the Os~ald case. 
Chiei, CI - Mr. Kalar{~ then pointed oui that there were 
certain particularly sensitive aspects of the material 
which c:ould not be released for· us·e --ot1:tside of the building.
