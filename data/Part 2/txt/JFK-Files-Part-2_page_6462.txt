DISCUSSION 
IRTRODUCTION 
l. ~• This report is in response to a request from 
• the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to cons.ider the desira­
bility aDd requirements of a fomented revolt in CUba. It 
includes an examination of engineering an incident or a series 
of incidents as a c~u~e for invasion and consideration of 
pertinent comment·s received f1'0Dl CIHCLANT. 
2. Summary. Study of the desirability and the requirements 
of a fomented revolt in CUba and of the advantages of 
engine,iring an incident or a series of inci~ents rather than 
trying to generate and coordinate action from•inside involving 
many CUbans of doubtful reliability leads to.tbs conclusions 
that: 
a. it is unlikely that an effective spontaneous revolt 
will occur in the near future. 
b. Any uprising without US_ overt_ support is likely to 
be short-lived because of the improved Cuban/Soviet· 
military capabilities presently in Cuba Jl,Dd Castro• s· 
increasingly efficient i~ternal securit~'operations. 
c. There appears to.be little likelibocxi that the Castro 
collllllUDist regime will risk a direct provocation that 
could be used as a pretext tor US intervention. 
d. UDJ.ess the United States intervenes•militarily, tbe 
Castro government will become more firmly entrenched aDd. its 
etforta and ability to sprea~ intDrnational communis;n Will 
increase.
