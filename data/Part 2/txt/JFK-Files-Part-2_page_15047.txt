New Left Movement 
The New Left movement, an amorphous, undisciplined 
collection of malcontents, has led a wave of extremism on our 
college campuses which has been marked by growing violence and 
lawlessness. During the past year a surge of bombings and 
arsons, along lines advocated by New Left extremists, has. 
accounted for over $2,000,000 in damages to· property consisting 
mostly of college facilities and u. S. Government property. 
The New Left movement in this country is clearly an integral 
part of a worldwide revolutionary movement of students and 
young intellectuals. New Leftists from the United States have 
played an important role in demonstrations which have taken 
place in England, France, West Germany, Japan, and Mexico. 
They have established and maintained contacts with representa­
tives of communist and other leftist organizations abroad 
through meetings, conferences, and correspondence; traveling 
to communist countries, such as Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, 
North Vietnam, and the Soviet Union.
