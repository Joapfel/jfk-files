Perhaps best illustrative of the ·merry-go-round 
which the Special Group had been riding for at least 
two months was Willauer's closing statement: 
In our discussions we weighed without 
coming to a conclusion the advantages of 
a rapid,· effective action by direct war 
in terms· of getting matters over with 
without~ long buildup of ·world opinion 
vs. the inevitability of such a build up 
under any seven month program. 38/ 
Having reviewed the meetings during the last 
few weeks of the Eisen~ower administration, it is 
interesting to review the comments of some of those 
who were principally involved, as they looked back 
on that period. One of the most inunediate responses 
was found in Fidel Castro's virtuoso performance for 
the Cuban television audience on 23 April 1961 when 
he explained the invasion to .them. Among other things, 
Castro claimed: 
That on certain occasions, we have also 
been in danger of direct aggression. This 
danger always has been lurking about us 
an9 at certain times has gathered consider­
able support in the minds of leading circles 
of the United States. One of those moments 
when this type of direct aggression was 
very near was at the end of December [1960] 
and the beginning of [January 1961], and 
that is to say, during the last days of the 
Eisenhower administration. 40/.
