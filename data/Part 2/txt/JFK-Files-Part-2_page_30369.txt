Mr. Fithian. All right. Let me just stop you here. 
Mr. Nosenko. Yes. 
Mr. Fithian. The forms in there by the KGB were filled out 
based on what information? 
Mr. Nosenko. On his name, what he • S:llPJtLi;ei;],; who he is, when 
he was asking visa. 
Mr. Fithian. But they conducted no check, no search? 
Mr. Nosenko. It is in the archives of KGB, if he ever was 
in Soviet Union, on him there will be something. If he wasn't in 
Soviet Union but he was known to intelligence service 
Mr. Fithian. But you didn't have any record on that . 
Mr. Nosenko. Nothing. 
Mr. Fithian. And so the final question is that the only 
thing that you had to judge -that he was an uninteresting subject 
was what he had told the Intourist guide? 
Mr. Nosenko. Right. 
Mr. Fithian. That is the only substantive thing? 
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir, and his questionnaire for who he 
is, his name, whatever he filled about himself. That's all. 
The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
The Chair has one additional request from one member, for 
one additional question. 
Mr. Sawyer? 
Mr. Sawyer. I just have one additional question, and that is 
the $80,000 you got for compensation and·· the $15,000 or $20,000
