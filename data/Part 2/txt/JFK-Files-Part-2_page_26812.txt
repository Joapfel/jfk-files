Q Fishing companies? 
A Well, fishing companies, Geodetic Survey, marine 
supply. In all, I think during the period that the station 
and these other entities were under commercial cover, or non­
official cover, I think we had 100 so cover companies. 
Q Did any of these companies actually engage in any 
legitimate commercial activities? 
A Not to my knowledge, no. 
Q None of them -- were any of them in competition with 
firms in that area? 
A These are probably what we would call devised 
facilities. They were probably registered with the State of 
Florida and they paid taxes and this type of thing, but if one 
was.blown or became known, we just crossed that .out of 
existence and started up a new one. 
Q What did Eugenio ?1artinez do when he wasn't running 
these operations? 
A Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as 
I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that 
contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent 
under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys. 
Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He 
came back -- he might come back once a month,.or something 
like that, ta see his family, perhaps once every two weeks 
if he got some time off.
