:::, ;:_· Simfl~~ly ~. Kissinger did not remember having been informed that the 
CIA had called off a coup it regarded as premature. He stated: 
My perception at that period was that if they 
had a coup they would come ... back to us before 
triggering it ... at no time during the period 
did they, in fact) tell us ... that they had a 
coup that might be ready to go. And, indeed, 
they generally told us the opposite. 
(Kissinger testimony, pp. 25~26) 
As Karamessines' calendar indicated, there was a 40 Committee meet­
ing on October 6. He attended this meeting, along with Richard Helms 
and William Broe of the CIA. According to the minutes of that meeting, 
CIA efforts to promote a military coup in Chile were not discussed. 
However, in an exchange with Charles Meyer, who was then the State De­
.partment's Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs, Dr. Kissinger 
stressed the desire of "higher authority" (P.resident Nixon) to prevent 
Allende's assumption of office. According to the minutes: 
Mr. Meyer pointed to the need to determine a post-Allende 
position such as proposed· in NSSM 97. , It was agreed that 
an early NSC meeting was desirable on that subject; Mr. 
Kissinger said this presumed total acceptance of a fait 
accompli and higher authority had no intention of conced­
ing before the 24th; on the contrary, he wanted no stone 
left unturned. (Memorandum for the Record/Minutes of the 
Meeting of the 40 Committee, 6 October 1970, 7 October 
1970) 
October 8 
Karamessines met fo~ lunch with General Haig. (Karamessines calendar) 
In his testimony, Haig recalled being aware that the CIA was in touch 
with two differenct groups of military plotters. He believed there must 
have been another meeting in which the CIA informed him of its on-going 
contacts.
