v.· CIA/White House Communication During Track II 
The testimony given to the Committee by Heory Kissinger and General 
Haig conflicts with that given by CIA officials. 
Kissinger and Haig testified that on October 15, 1970, the White 
House .stood down CIA efforts to promote a military coup d'etat in Chile4 
Both testified that after that date they were neither informed of, nor 
authorized, CIA Track II activities, including the kidnap plans of 
General Schneider and the passage of weapons to. the military plotters.

after October 15 with the knowledge and approval of the White House.

it bears on the degree of communication between the White House and the 
CIA in. the earlier perio.d as well. For instance, Henry Kissinger testi­

of General Schneider. He was aware of General Viaux's plan--which he 
and Karamessines decided on October 15 to try to forestall--but did not 
know that it was to begin with Schneider's abduction. 
CIA officials, especially Thomas·Karamessines, stated that there was 
close consultation throughout Track II between the Agency and the White 
House. Kafamessines testified that he me•t.With KisSinger some six to

page 66); and that he kept Kissinger generally informed of developments. 
(Ibid., page 56) The Committee has records of two meetings between 
Karamessines and Kissinger and of one telephone conversation between 
Karamessines and Kissinger's deputy, General Alexander Haig. Karamessines'
