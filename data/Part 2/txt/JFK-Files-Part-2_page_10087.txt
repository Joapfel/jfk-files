Enclosed is a letter from Special Agent Seymor Fred 
Phillips to the Attorney General, dated March 1, 1976, in 
which Mr. Phillips requests the Department of Justice to pro­
vide him with legal counsel in connection with a request from 
the Senate Select Committee for an interview under oath con­
cerning the FBI's investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., ( 
and related matters. , -....._ 
Since Special Agent Phillips' involvement in the sub­
ject matter of the interview arose out of his duties as a 
Special Agent of the FBI, I recommend his request be granted.
