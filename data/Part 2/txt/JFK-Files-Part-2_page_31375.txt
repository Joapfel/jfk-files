Investigation requested by Comdr, Eglin AFB, .FL on 7 Jul 69, to determine circum­
stances surrounding importation of 3 boxes of captured enemy weapons by SUBJEC'I;'. 
Two boxes containing a total of 21 weapons, 5 noise suppres~ors, and related equip-,, 
ment seized. Both boxes marked for SUBJECT. Munitions officials advised boxes 
were stored at request of SUBJECT. Deputy Comdr, AFATL, advised his agency was

ment., SUBJECT advised he shipped one box containing 12 captured enemy weapons from 
SEA in approximately Nov 68 as part of his assigned duties to assist Vice-President
