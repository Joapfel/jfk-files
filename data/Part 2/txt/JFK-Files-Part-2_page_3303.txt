Conclusions 
This volume has traced the history of the CIA's 
official anti-Castro program from its inception in 
1959 through the end of the Eisenhower admfnistration 
in January of 1961. It emphasized that in the initial 
period when Castro's revolution was taking place, the 
.... 
Agency, reflecting the policies of the US Government, 
was caught betwixt and between -- to move ~ith Castro 
or to move against Castro. Shortly following his take­
over, it became clear that Castro had little or no in-
tention -- nor apparently concern for establishing 
cordial relations with the "Colossus of the North." 
Instead, he turned to the Soviet Union and its allies 
' 
for military, technical, and economic assistance. It 
became clear that a new philosophy~as being intro­
duced into the Caribbean basin and-that this philosophy 
was directly contrary to the interests of the United 
States Government and to the governments of many of 
the Latin American nations, whether democratically 
governed or governed_ by dictatorships of the right.
