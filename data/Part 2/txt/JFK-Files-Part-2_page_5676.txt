MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Intelligence Coordination, 
Intelligence and Research, Department of State 
SUBJECT: Appeal of Unfavorable Determination by the JFK 
Assassination Records Review Board (AIUO) 
The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) recently 
released documents revealing the existence of CIA stations in 
zli.e.l§_in.Jg), LB.em) ~ and[The Hague) a (Ioint tel-tcili:)operation 
with(Mexican ~' and the identity of a unilateral 
penetratioJ1,1of~lTaison service_) It is the CIA's assessment 
that such releases could seriously damage intelligence operations 
as well as adversely affect the foreign relations of the United 
States. CIA is presently preparing an appeal of these rulings by 
the Board and requests the support of the Department of State 
should these appeals be brought before the President. (S) 
Additionally, the Board has just released the existence of 
stations in(~") tMaarl:ID ~? QgQ_~Brussel"s;; and 
~~ and in March-April, it will be reviewing a document 
that reveals the location of every CIA station in 1965. It is 
anticipated that CIA will be preparing to appeal those releases 
and requests State Department's assessment as to the damage to 
foreign relations should the location of CIA stations be publicly 
acknowledged. (S) 
It remains essential that the U.S. Government stand by 
assurances to persons and foreign governments that information 
they provide and activities they undertake based upon expected 
confidentiality remain protected for as long as necessary. These 
releases made by the Board seriously undermine the ability of CIA 
to uphold secrecy obligations it took on in the past and to make 
those assurances in the future. (C)
