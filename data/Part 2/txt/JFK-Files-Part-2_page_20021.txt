and our meetings with those of you whom wo have seen recently have been brief. 
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration 1ve all feel occasionally, 
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. Dut this feeling is only 
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. 1\r:, women, we bear the major 
responsibility for the preservqtion of life, a.nd thus a major responsibility 
in the peace movement,

for peace. Several peace groups in Portland ;ire cooperating in raising funds 
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this 
effort, to insure representatjcn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon 
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort,

in Portland at
