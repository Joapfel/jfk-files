which were tossed back and forth, we agreed 
that it was not necessary or advisable to brief 
him at that time. 
I then said, as I recall, to Mr. Helms, if you 
decide in the future that he should be briefed, 
I would like to know about it in advance to 
which, to my best recollection, he agreed. 
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 66) 
Harvey then offered the following explanation for why he and 
Helms had decided not to discuss the matter with McCone at 
that time: 
There were several reasons-for this. One, 
this operation at that stage had not been 
assessed. It was obviously questionable on 
several grounds .. It obviously involved know­
ledge by too many peopie. We were not even 
sure at that point it had any remote possibility 
or rather any real possibility for success. It 
had arisen with full authority insofar as either 
of us knew lortg before I knew anything about it, 
and before the then-Director became Director of 
the Agency. 
I saw no reason at that time to charge him 
with knowledge of this.,. at least until we reach-
ed the point where it appeared it might come to 
fruitation or had had a chance to assess the 
individuals involved and determine exactly the 
problem we faced, including the possible problem 
-- and it was a very, or it appeared to be, and 
in my opinion was, at that time, a very real 
possibility of this government being blackmailed 
either by Cubans fo'r political purposes or by 
figures in organized crime for their own self­
protection·or aggrandizement, which, as it turned 
out, did not happen, but at that time was a very 
pregnant possibility. (Harvey, 6/25/75, pp. 67-68)
