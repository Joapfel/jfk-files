Mr. Goo<lwin. Wel 1, 1 woul<1 agree with a good part I of that •I 
s~nator, although I think that th~rd wire assassination plotA

pos,lbility that Trujillo miqht be oosaeelnotort or that thero 
might be an att~mpt~~ assassination, which is t~~ purport cf 
D~drhorn's, b~causa i! the asoassination wa~ succ~ssful, thor~
