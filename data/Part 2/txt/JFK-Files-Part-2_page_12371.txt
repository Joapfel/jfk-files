ignate· individual as Bureau-approved potential sec·urity informant and to 
proceed with development. Do not submit on UACB basis. Include physical

setting forth the number of racial and/or security informants, the 
number of potential racial and/or potential security informants, and 
( 
the number of panel sources currently being operated at the particular ( 
college or university to which t·he request pertains.] .

lowing matters should be made clear to him: 
3. 
a. His assistance is strictly voluntary and he is to understand there is 
no coercion or intimidation involved. 
b. He is not and cannot consider himself employee or "undercover Agent" 
of FBI. Seriousness of violating impersonation statutes must be 
impressed upon him. 
c. His coope~ation must be strictly confidential at all times and if 
he should feel he cannot maintain this confidence, he should so 
advise. There should be no doubt left in mind of potential informant 
that his relationship must remain on confidential basis and if he 
violates confidence he will be of no value and by so doing B~reau's 
investigative activity may be jeopardized. If he has special 
problem which would require revealing his assistance to his wife or 
other pertinent individual, this should be ascertained and appropriate 
recommendation made to Bureau. 
a. If potential informant is connected in any manner with labor union, 
inform him that Bureau is not interested in employer-employee relation­
ships as such and is only concerned with obtaining information on 
infiltration of unions by subversive elements.

relations with school, college, or university, in initial interview 
and subsequent handling, follow current instructions concerning in-
vestigations on campuses. • • 
Do not interview female potential informants in their homes"or apart~ents 
unless necessary and any such interviews should be conducted by two 
Agents after specific approval of superior in field office responsible 
for development of informants. This instruction is not applicable where 
active investigation has established that potential informant is of good 
character, there is no indication of affiliation with subversive groups, 
and there will be no embarrassment to Bureau.
