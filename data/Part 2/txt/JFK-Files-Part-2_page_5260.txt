DO/IRO 
SUBJECT: JFK Information Release 
Per SA to ADDO, please consider this as the officiat~-ooo 
response and include it in your memo. ., • • • 
The ODO reluctantly acquiesces to release of documents cited 
in ARRB Memo of 21 June 1995 with the following exceptions: 
Document No. 104-10015-10052, CIA Cable, DIR 74673: 
c. Bustos, originated the cable and testified about it using 
her pseudo. She retired in a covert status and resides in 
the United States. Release of her name as a CIA employee 
will damage cover credibility, expose her to the public as a 
CIA employee subject to any physical threats which might 
ensue, and abrogate our agreement with her as to our 
willingness to protect her identify in return for her 
willingness to engage in clandestine operations on behalf of 
the CIA. We would also point out that she was later 
assigned in several overseas locations including Mexico City 
and a posting as©os in Trinidad/. Exposure of her as a CIA· 
employee would also endanger any operations in which she 
might have been engaged. Substitution of her pseudo in lieu 
of true name would allow the identification of a person yet 
protect the persona itself. 
Document No. 104-10015-10153, CIA Cable, DIR 85039: 
R.W. Herbert was chief of WH Div at the time and signed off 
on this cable as authenticating officer. He was an 
~ntegrated· state Officer"]who retired in a cover status. 
His present residence is un own but his overseas 
assignments as an U.S. s e artment o ficer would be 
compromised by exposure of him as a CIA officer. It is 
believed that exposing him as a CIA officer would not only 
endanger his operations and those associated with the 
operations, but would also place him in _physical danger in 
that his field of operations involved anci-Cuban operations:
