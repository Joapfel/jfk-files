HARVEY writes a memorandum to DDP HELMS saying 
that he advised Lansdale '.s aide FRANK HAND to 
excise the words "including liquidation of leaders" 
from the LANSDALE memo because of "the inadmissibility 
and stupidity of putting this type of comment in 
writing in such a document"~ Harvey also tells Helms 
that he has "careful notes" on MC N.AMARA'S discussion 
of assassination at the Special Group meeting of 
August 10. 
Pills still in place; HARVEY learns that VARONA is 
ready to send another team to Cuba. (51)
