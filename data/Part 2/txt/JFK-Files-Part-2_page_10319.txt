sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised two-sections .. 
The first was a philosophicnf treatment of student unrest, 
its.mqtivation, histor, and tactics. This section drew 
heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Stt,J.dents 
for a Democrc:itic Society and affiliated groups. In a sense, 
the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter l30 page} 
typescript study of1 SDS and its foreign ties the sama
