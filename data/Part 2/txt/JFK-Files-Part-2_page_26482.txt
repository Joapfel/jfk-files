27 March.1963 
COSTA RICA 
1. A total of 216 Costa Ricans visited Cuba 
in 1962. As many as 30 probably received para­
military training. 
2. In February, 1963, 21 Costa Ricans re­
turned from visits of four to six months. It has 
been reliably established that nine of them were 
trained,as instructors in guerrilla warfare, and 
one was trained as an organizer and instructor for 
militia training. The length of stay suggests 
that the remaining 11 also.received paramilitary 
instruction. Three other Costa Ricans, including 
one woman, known to have gone to Cuba for such 
training are not yet reported to have returned 
to Costa Rica. 
3. Two Costa Rican Communist leaders are 
reported independently by fairly reliable sources 
to have stated'that guerrilla warfare training 
camps are to be established in Costa Rica. The 
purely Costa Rican aspect makes this a new d~velop­
ment; guerrilla activity in Costa Rica hitherto 
has centered in the rel•tively wild and lightly 
policed northeastern frontier area, and has been 
targeted against Nicaragua. 
4. There have been no arrests for sabotage, 
terrorism, or guerrilla activity in Costa Rica. 
About 50 have been temporarily detained for sub­
versive activity, and one individual was arrested 
and jailed for one year. (This does not incll1de 
about 30 suspected subversives detained during 
President Kennedy's visit.) 
5. Nineteen of the 30 Costa Ricans believed 
to have received guerrilla training in Cuba are 
known by name. Of the 19, the only ones in posi­
tions of influence are Oscar Morera ~adrigal, San 
Jose physician, and Modesto Ruiz Ruiz, leader of 
the Communist labor union in the banana zone.
