John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld 
recruit in attempts to kill fidel Cas­
tro, had been privately claim\ng that 
agents of the Cuban p_remier, i~ re~~ll­

Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec­
tion to the Kennedy assassina9on was 
expressed through his attorney, Ed­
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as Jon~

conversations with a longtime assoc1-.

Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli

formed him that Castro became aware 
of CIA assassination conspiracies 
against him and "thereafter employed 
teams of individuals who were dis­
patched to the United States for the
