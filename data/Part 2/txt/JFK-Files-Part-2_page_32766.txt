I discovered· additional evidence of unrealistic cost estimates in the 
Boeing proposal. In the judgment of the Evaluation Group, Boeing was 
overly optimistic in its estimate of production tooling and was dangerously 
low in estimating the manufacturing hours for poth the development and 
production phases. It appeared to me that Boeing simply did not appreciate 
the complexities of developing the TFX. This is understandable because 
Boeing's past experience in aircraft development and production has been 
with bombers and transport aircraft -- experience which is largely inapplicable 
to TFX estimating. 
I therefore concluded that as to the third cardinal condition 
demonstrably credible understanding of costs -- Boeing's proposal was 
deficient. 
The Evaluation Team cost estimators recognized this fact. They 
attempted to correct for it by raising Boeing's costs to a level which in 
their j1:1dgment was more accurate. They also made adjustments for the 
General Dynamics cost esti~ates, which were considered deficient, but 
not nearly so much so as Boeing's. 
The Air Force estimators applied experience and other statistical 
factors to the two proposals in an effort to arrive at ultimate costs. The 
application of such factors is well suited to correction of an intentionally 
low proposal. Where, however, the low proposal is the result of alack
