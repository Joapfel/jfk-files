33. There have been indi¢ations of disapproval of Cae-u-o-s ' 
poli~eB Ol!l the p~r,t of those Lati.n American Communist pa.dies 
which are committed to a m9li'~ g3:'adual .and l@f\llS violent approach to 
t¢volutio.n. Ca'Eltro has shpwn himself wilUng to collabo:rate with any

la.tter reae~t eµc;h tactics and have appealed to the Soviets against 
Castr0. It seem.Bl! likely that the q,ueation of relations with othe~ 
~~GommWlist parties, as well a$ the question of tactics, 
is likely to hamper Go:mmwrlst revolutionary efforts in Latin America 
and cause $tl'aine in Soviet,-Cuban relations.
