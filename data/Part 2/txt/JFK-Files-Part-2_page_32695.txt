SUBJECT: Defense Clearance of Missile Crisis Section of President's Report.:· 
To Congress on US Participation in UN During 1962. 
UNP., with RPA's cooperation, has prepared the attached draft chapter: .. • 
on the missile crisis for the President's annual report to Congress on 
US participation in the• UN. 
Mr. Monsma is handling clearance oft he chapter within ARA. I have 
been asked to obtain Defense clearance. When I spoke to Mr. Knaur about 
•. this last week., he touched. base w.ith Mr. Yarmolinsky and came back with 
the reply that the most expeditious way to get DOD clearance is through 
CCA channels. Could you please arrange for this to.be done as quickly, 
as possible as the report is now overdue?
