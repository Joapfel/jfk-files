MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations 
VIA Mr. Ralph J. Katrosh 
Special Assistant to the DDO 
for External Oversight 
FROM 
SUBJECT 
Samuel Halpern 
Review of 168 Deleted Items in 
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" 
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks 
(U) 1. This is the report of the review done by 
the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items 
which are the basic responsibility of the DDO. The 
remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi­
bility of the_ DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those 
Directorates ~hich are reporting directly to OGC. 
Responsible components did the necessary inter- and 
intraagency coordinations. 
(U) 2. Several points need to be highlighted 
concerning the completeness of the review, especially 
as regards those items declassified by "of.ficial 
public disclosure" as defined by the courts. While I 
am sure that as diligent a search as possible was done 
by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely 
complete search is impossible for the following reasons: 
(U) a. _ There is no index of any kind, 
let alone having the ~aterial in machine form 
such as iri the RSM, to the fifteen published 
hearings and reports of the Senate Select 
Committee· to Study Governmental Operations With 
Respect to Intelligence Activities (C_hurch 
Committee), the six published hearings and 
proceedings of the House Select Committee on 
Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume 
Report to the President by the Commission on 
CIA Activities Within the United States 
(Rockefeller Commission);·
