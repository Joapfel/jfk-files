i October. _ It now appears that AMFAUNA-26 never rfl'48".;~ eittier of these 
'sets of group,.· As of. 22 November when AMFAUNA-26·1n!sterf-Olga arrived 
in Mexico (see paragraph 5), AMFAUNA-26 already had in· her possession ; 
the letter containing the groups written· in SW, but either had trid.d and 
failed to develop it, or.had hesitated to try to do so, not knowing in 
what strength to use the reagent and erroneously thinking that this was 
a critical factor. As mentioned previously, AMFAUNA-26 did not receive 
SW message no. 10 until 22 December; on the-. following day she sent an 
open telegram to the son of AMFAUNA~32 in Miami, confirming her willing­
ness to trav~l to Pinar del Rio and recover the material. It is not 
known whether she actually did so. - • . .. . ·' 
. . . 
4. It h~d been planned, once AMFAUNA-26 wa~ r;~ing OWVL and 
her ability t<> ·recover c!lches confirmed, to have{AM~;ycache 1'MFAUNA-11 c: 
radio and to inform AMFAUNA-26 of its location by OWVL. Events did not 
·permit this. 
5. AMFLORA-1 sent. a telegram to his JMWAVE area accommodation 
address· on 16 November igs·3, repor.ting that his wife,: the sister of 
AMFAUNA-26, _was due to arrive in Mexico City on 20 November. Mexico 
City Station was so informed on 18 November (see WAVE-7762), but by the 
time confirmation arrived (MEXI-7031'of 23 November) the lady had 
• already departed for Carac~:s. The oral messages which she brought from 
AMFAUNA-26 therefore did not r_each JMWAVE until 20 December when HVCA­
l0'.780 was received .. • This· dispatc~ transmitte·d a typewritten note from 
AMFLORA-1'~ wife contai~ing the following information: 
_ a. AMFAUNA-26 had run out of developer pills. (In retrospec 
this does not seem to be true, because AMFAUNA-26 was evidently able to 
.. develop SW message no. 10 which she received on 22 December (see para~ra 
3).- What AMFAUNA-26 had probably been trying to convey was that she -
was running very short_ of pills. AMFAUNA-1.-·does not· remember bow many 
he gave her, but the most probable number appears to be twelve.) 
b. AMFAUNA-26 had been unable to develop the SW message 
containing her cipher groups, because she had not been told how to mix 
her reagent. 
c. • AMCUTLER-2 was ve_ry worried by the fact that AMFAUNA-14 
had been telephoning her frequently,· and was afraid that AMFAUNA-14 was 
betraying her to the DSE. 
d. AMFAUNA-26 was uneasy about being left in Cuba without a 
responsible leader to report to. 
e. AMFAUNA-26's cover was wearing very thin, due to indis­
cretions by-AMFAUNA-31.

6. In her, SW message no. 29, which was received at JMWAVE on 21 
October,-AMFAUNA-26 reported that AMFAUNA-38 had been arrested on 7 
_September and taken to Santa Clara. At 0200 hours on the following 
morning, ~ourteen policemen came to AMFAUNA-26's house and searched it 
on the pretext of looking for a burglar. However, the only part of the 
house which they searched was the part.inhabit~d ?;r~AUNA-26 •.

,- 7. In ~er SW message no. 30, AMFAUNA-26. eported the full names 
6f two individuals who ~ad approached her sub-·gents AMFAUNA-29 and 
~FAUNA-31, claiming tcoe doing underground ~~rk agaJ,nst CASTRO. These 
persons are one Amable;f=~ANCHEZ Borroto andldfne Raul ¥'SIMON Delgado. 
While neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters (DIR-78835 qf 30 October 1963) 
had any traces on these persons, JMWAVE has a carded reference to a 
sensitive source document which carries the full name of Amable SANCHEZ 
Borroto and the implication that he enjoys the confidence of the Cuban 
Governme_nt. Unfortunately, an error was made~:-~p. j;y.pi~g the card, and 
the document is unrecoverable. In S_W messa_g~::·l\.~•f·I;Qf· ,AMFAUNA-26 was
