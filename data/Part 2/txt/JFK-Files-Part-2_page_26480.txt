27 March 1963 
COLOMBIA 
1. We have record of about 400 Colombians 
who traveled to Cuba legally during the past year, 
and no record of any illegal travel. Approximately 
100 appear on manifests via Curacao, and 65 via 
Mexico City. Travel information on the remaining 
235 is based on agent reports and liaison. 
2. Of these 400, 37 are reported to have re­
ceived training in guerrilla warfare, one in coun­
terintelligence, and one attended a staff or cadre 
school. 
3. Most of those selected for·training are 
members of either the United Front for Revolutionary· 
Action (FUAR) or the Worker-Student-Peasa.nt Move­
ment (MOEC). Both are made up of revolutionaries, 
dissident Communists, and recruits from the ranks 
of labor, students, and the unemployed lower cl~sses. 
Both receive Cuban financial support, and are at­
tempting--without appreciable success to date--to 
coordinate operations with the ba,ndi t gangs terror­
izing the violence areas of Colombia. 
4. Two guerrilla leaders imprisoned in 1961-­
Eddie Aristizabal of MOEC and Tulio·Bayer--and one 
killed in 1961--Antonio Larotta of MOEC--were re­
ported to have received guerrilla warfare training 
in Cuba. Larotta's training was in 1959. 
5. Colombian army statistics (which the U.S. 
army attach~ considers on the high side because of 
the statistical procedures used) list 2,~82 rural 
bandits captured and 1,029 individuals detained on 
suspicion of involvement in rural banditry in 1962, 
and 300 captured and 134· detained in the first two 
months of 1963. The Colombian army has no statistics 
on subsequent trials, but on the basis of past ex­
perience it is estimated that about two percent of all 
those arrested and detained--i.e., about 80 persons-­
were convicted and sentenced. The bandits are not 
considered guerrillas in a political sense, althotigh 
some Cuban propaganda has been found on dead bandits. 
There were 388 ~andits killed in rural ~reas in•·1962, 
and 89 in 1963.
