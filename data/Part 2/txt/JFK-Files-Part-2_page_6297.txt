REVIEW AND DECLASSIFICATION OF THE SEQUESTERED FILES 
In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas· Foley 
r~esting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the 
records. In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter 
to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The 
Speaker's decision was made in anticipation of passage of 
the Assassination Records Collection Act. 
THE HARDCOPY MATERIAL 
The hardcopy part of the sequestered.collection 
includes copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald 
201 file. Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and 
security files on persons who are mentioned in documents 
relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the 
conspiracy theories. 
The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of 
documents, memos, and notes (many handwritt·en) that were 
created by the Committee staff during their investigation.
