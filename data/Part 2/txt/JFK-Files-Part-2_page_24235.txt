VIII: MHMUTUAL: THE INSURANCE-INVESTMENT COMPLEX 
a) A BRIEF HISTORY 
1'lllMUTUAL is a complex of insurance companies, most of which 
are located abroad, operated by the Agency to provide the following 
services: 
a) reinsurance of aircraft damage or liability risks 
ostensibly insured under commercially issued policies 
(for cover): 
b) extending term life insurance, annuities, trusts and 
workmen's compensation for independent contractors 
and agents working for the Agency who are not entitled 
to U.S. Government benefits; 
c) handling escrow accounts* for agents; 
d) limited operational support activities, i.e., holding 
real estate formerly used in Agency operations abroad;** 
and 
e) investing in domestic and foreign markets to obtain 
earnings_ to fund the above. 
MHMUTUAL was created ·in 1962 to provide death and_ disability bene­
fits to agents and beneficiaries when security considerations pre­
clude attribution to the U.S. Government. The losses during the 
Bay of Pigs prompted its establishment.· From sixty-seven (67) to 
seventy-three (73) companies operated originally under the Domestic 
Operations Division and later a board of directors controlled by the 
Office of General Counsel. This internal board of the project made 
investment decisions. 
* Escrow accounts are established when an agent cannot receive his 
full payment from the CIA without attracting suspicion. The funds 
not paid to the agent go into escrow accounts and are invested under 
MH.MUTUAL.
