Asked whether the actual assassination efforts against Castro were 
-related to ZR/RIFLE (executive action), Helms testified: "In my. 
mind thos·e lines never crossed" (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 52). However,

syndicate which had Castro as its target ... folded into the 
ZR/RIFLE project . and they became one" (Bissell, 6/11/75,

"capability ... for assassination" was "used against Cas.tro",
