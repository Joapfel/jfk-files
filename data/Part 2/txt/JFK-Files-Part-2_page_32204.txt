B. Contigency Planning 
New opportunities for accomplishing our 
objectives may arise either as a result of Bloc 
action in other parts of the world; as a result 
of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions) 
by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a 
result of uprisings or internal conflict within 
Cuba. 
Our contingency planning, which will be 
undertaken immediately, should include preparations 
for increased multilateral and/or bilateral 
political and economic measures, large scale use of 
Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive 
air activity including both high and low level 
flights primarily directed toward surveillance 
and collection of intelligence, and which may also 
have the effect of embarrassing the Castro 
government and keeping the Castro forces on, 
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as 
appropriate, including the imposition of a 
POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in 
other countries; severance· of communications 
to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping 
destined for Cuba and on key installations to 
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; anc, ultimately, 
the use·of U. S. military force. To the extent 
feasible, U. S. military forces employed against 
Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily­
trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of 
those Latin American nations desirous of 
participating in the U. S. effort.
