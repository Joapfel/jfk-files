MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD 
Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of 
years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he 
·has been employed by the United States Government, for the 
greater period by the Department of Commerce, and the Small 
Business ~dministration. He was detailed to the White House 
in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of 
former President Johnson. 
We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the 
White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking 
problem prior to the investigation and was considered an 
alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces, 
the first of which was precipitated by his drinking. Several 
people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recom­
mend Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in 
1964. After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued 
to hold an office on the first floor of·the Executive Office 
Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew. 
On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office 
and his White House pass has been taken. The White House 
has been in contact with the Department of Commerce, on whose 
payroll Underwood has been while working at the White House, 
and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood 
his services are no longer required. 
Persons interviewed during our current investigation 
state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no 
longer has the drinking problem. Results of current investigation 
were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969. 
Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled.
