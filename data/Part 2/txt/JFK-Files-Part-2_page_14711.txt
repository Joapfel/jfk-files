The essence of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans 
• • "" lies in the connection New Orleans District Atto~riey James C. 
Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee Harvey Oswald, 
David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw. The principal 
witness -has been Perry Russo who has sa~d Oswald, Ferrie, 
and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at a 
meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September, 
1963. 
Immediately following the assassination of President 
Kennedy, the FBI received allegations of a connection between 
Ferrie and Oswald. These allegations were thoroughly and

that Oswald -and Ferrie were acquainted. Clay Shaw's name 
never came up in the investigation and the FBI never 
investigated him. 
The FBI has held to a "hands-off" policy regarding 
Garrison's inve~tigation. Although ~e are closely following 
Shawts trial, we have no observers in the courtroom. It is 
notet that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice 
h~s an unofficial observer in the courtroom. 
Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He 
received a medical discharge in October, 1951~ from the u. s. 
Arm.y for an emotional problem. He admitted to Army authorities 
that he had recei:ved psychiatric treatment. • Garrison wa.s a 
Special Agent of the FBI for four months~ resigning to 
re-enter military service in Julv. 1951.
