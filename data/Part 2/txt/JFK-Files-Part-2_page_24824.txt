back to Washington to head the operation. With the exception of the 
Division Chief, William Broe, his deputy james Flannery and the head 
of the Chile Branch, no other officers in the Division were aware of the 
task force's activities, not even those officers who normally had respon­
sibility for Chile. The task force had a special communications channel to 
Santiago and Buenos Aires to compartment cable traffic about Track II.

has said that Kissinger "left no doubt in my mind that he was under the 
heaviest of pressure to get this accomplished, and he in turn was plac-

messines testimony, August 6, 1975, page 7) The Deputy Chief of the 
Western Hemisphere Division, James Flannery, testified that pressure was 
"as tough as I ever saw it in my time there, extreme." (Flannery testi-

constant, constant .... Just continual pressure .... It was coming from the 
White aouse." (Broe testimony, August 4, 1975, page 55)
