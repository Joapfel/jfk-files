to perform a task for Naval Intelligence. He received per­
mission to travel in the North Sea al:o ard a -Soviet Ice 
Breaker "Lenin!i and prior to starting. this assignment, he 
was briefed by Naval Attaches at the American Embassy, 1:!oscow, 
ofi thei~ interests inblrtding any observations he might make 
of Soviet atomic submarines. Accompanying Jaffe on the trip 
was Dieter. Steiner, another foreign co~respondent in Moscow. . 
Jaffe did not observe any atomic submarines and every time the6,,,,-. 
ship neared a Soviet naval base, the guests were told the • 
Captain desired to brief them be-low deck in his cabin. Bv 
the time the brj_efings were over, the ship had p_assed the., 
naval bases. On one occasion, Jaffe, while en route to the 
Captain'"s cabin, realized he had left his photographic equip­
ment on- deck. He returned to get it and was approached by 
Soviet Naval Officers who reminded him he WRS expected to be 
receiving a briefing in the Captain's cabin; however, he was 
.not reprimanded and was treated well throughout the cruise. 
While in Riga, Jaffe and Steiner observed a 
group of buoys in a large channel which were spaced uniform 
distances apart. Jaffe- and Dieter finally reaized that by 
photogr·aphing these· buoys, th.e size of various Soviet ·ships
