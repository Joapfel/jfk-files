the other thlngs_ tihat he had to say, many of which were true. You understand 
that Nosenko watrmuch ot'what he said was true. 
Mr. Ju)!:IN. You are talk1ng about other areas? , 
Mr. MUBPHY.· Yes, sir. This one seemed to be tacked on and did11't have much 
relationship, and it seemett to be so totally dependent on not Just o.ne coincidence 
but a whole series of colncldences, for him to have been there and all that soit 
of thing. That ls what I mean; 
• • • • • • • 
Mr. KI.B:IN. Do you recall any other specifics about what you could not accept 
in Nosenko's statements ·about Oswald? -
Mr. MUBPHY. Yes; that they Just---thls ls part. of the first one-no contact was 
ever made, that 11e·went up to Minsk and lived happily and well with no contact. 
The Soviet Union with foreigners don't_ do that. I mean, : he ls the only person. 
Read the accounts of what happened to this poor. gentlellian; what happened to 
Jay Crawford in Moscow and their intensive debriefing of him on the layout of 
tbe American Embassy. It didn't seem to be possible. • ._-
-Now, again, that does not constitute proof, doesn't constitute any breakthrough. 
It seemed to me to i6e strange. ·- • . • _ _ • • 
Mr. KLm. Would you distinguish between first the facf'.>Uiat nobody debriefed 
Oswald when he first came to the Soviet Union, nobody trl.ed to find out what he 
knew as a marine, as a radar operator, and, second, tli.e fact that once they 
decided to allow him to stay, nobody debriefed him to flild out if he was some 
kind of a Westeni security agent or working for OIA? ··• 
Mr. MUBPHY. Yes, they would be two dUl'erent points. ;The first point clearly 
involves the KGB and GRU. This ls_ simply a chap arriving with this background 
and no one taking the time Just from a mllltary intelligence technical point of 
view, telling us how it worked when this thing came in at 00,000 feet what did the 
blips look like. I don't think they had many American ~dar operators handllng 
operational traJBc hi.volvlng U-2's. • • • 
Mr . .Kumr. Bow would you react to a statement by l'iosenko that although 
the KGB knew Oswald was a marine, they did not bother to question him, 
and because of that, never knew that he was a radar operator or that he 
worked at the base from which the U-.2's took off and .landed? 
Mr. MUB.PHY. I think it would be strange. 
My other point, going back to your first qu!!9tlon, that ls, the first aspect of 
your question, which ls the initial arrival and lack of debriefing. There la no 
indication here that the GRU was advised, which in the case of a defector, 
there ls no operational interest in a defector. GRU would be. properly the out­
fit that would want to be talking to any marine. They will talk to a marine 
about close order drllL You follow nie? It doesn't require that he be known to 
have been a radar operator or that he be known to have been a-they would 
talk to him about bis mllltary a11lllatlon Just as we would. . 
I realize that there ls a body of ~ought which says that some people think 
the Soviets are 10-foot tall I don't believe they are. I think they are very, 
very, very much the other way. What I find dlfflcult on the part of many Ameri­
cans ls that they will not ascribe to the Soviets the same elemental competence 
that we have. That ls all I ask. And, therefore, we in Germany will talk to a 
private in the East German Border Guards, period. The GRU would be interested 
in talking to a private. Be was a corporal in the Marine Corps, who had stated 
to a consul in a consular omce, which ls manned by the Soviets, Soviet locals 
and what have you, fully accessible to the Soviets, UDlike the higher 11.oors at the 
Embassy, that he wanted to talk about his experiences, that he wanted to tell all. 
I guess I found it dl111cult to believe this ls one of the thlngs that made, or ma.ny 
other aspects of the case, but this ls oile of the things that created an atmosphere 
of disbelief that there must be something to this case that ls important, vitally 
important to the Soviet Union and we can't understand lt. . 
·Yuri may be right, he may be right, but at the time it was very hal.'d to 
believe. . •

Mr. KLEIN. And on the basis of your experience and knowledge gained over 
almost 30 years, ls that what ls giving you trouble with Nosenko's statements 
about Oswald? 
Mr. MUBPHY. And other things. 
Mr. KI.B:IN. Do you know of comparable situatdons where somebody wasn't 
questioned llke this, was ;Just left alone, as Nosenko says Oswald wii.11?
