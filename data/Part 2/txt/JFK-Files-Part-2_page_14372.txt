Dear Mr. Colby: 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO 
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH 
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
(PURSUANT TO S. RES, 21, 91TH CONGRESS) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510 
March 12, 1975 
On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental 
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, I want to thank 
Ad Hoc Staff 
your for your letter of March 11, and the copy of the Employee Bulletin 
you have issued to all CIA employees. As we jointly recognize, in 
order for the Committee to carry out a thorough inquiry, in accordance 
with the mandate.contained in S. Res. 21, the Agency's full cooperation 
w::.11 be necessary. Your recognition that our mandate authorizes all., 
past and present, agency employees to cooperate fully, and without 
imped;i.ment due to secrecy agreements, will serve to + acilitate our 
expeditious collection of material relative to that mandate. 
I particularly appreciate your statement recognizing our security 
precautions. M you know, your staff was very helpful to the Committee's 
staff in designing those precautions . 
. The Staff Director a..11.d the Chief Counsel will, under the direction 
of the Committee, notify Mr. John Clarke of the members of the Committee 
who have been designat~d to carry out studies, inquiries and investigations 
required to meet the tasks specified in S. Res. 21. 
It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee 
and designated staff will have access to any and all information which 
the Committee determines is necessary for its inquiry. We recognize, 
however, that the Committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such 
as the.identity of CIA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations 
whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the event 
that the Committee inquiry touches on s'uch sensitive areas, which matters 
✓ we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we should discuss 
jointly, and as you suggest quic}dy, what procedures might be followed 
should the Cornmitte~ decide it requires more information in these specific 
areas.
