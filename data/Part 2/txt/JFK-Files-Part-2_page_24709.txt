_.,. As Johnson s~tated, his testimony standing alone is "a clue, 
rather than precise eyidence of Presidential involvement in decision-
making with respect to assassinations" (Johnson, 6/18/75, p. 5).· To 
determine the significance of·this "clue," it must.be placed in the 
-context of the records of the NSC meetings attende·d by Johnson, 
testimony about those meetings, and the series of events that pre­
ceded the dispatch of poisons to the Congo for Lumumba's assassina-
tion. 
In the Summer of 1960,.there were four NSC meetings where de­
velopments in the Congo were discussed at which Robert Johnson was 
present. .The President was not in attendance at two of those occa­
sions -- July 15 and July 21 (NSC Minutes, 7/15/60; NSC Minutes, 
I have no independent recollection of being consulted by 
Mr. Johnson about how to handle in the memorandum of dis-· 
cussion any sensitive statement regarding Lumumba. I am 
not saying I was not consulted; merely that I do noire­
member such an incident. If I had ·been consulted, I 
would almost certainly have directed Mr. Johnson to omit 
the matter from the memorandum of discussion. (Boggs 
affidavit, 10/10/75, p. 2) 
James Lay, who attended other NSC meetings where Lumumba was discuss­
ed(~, September 21, 1960), also confirmed the fact that NSC min­
utes would not be likely to record a statement as sensitive as a 
Preside.ntial order for an assassination, if such an order were given: 
If extremely .sensitive matters were discussed at an 
NSC meeting, it was sometimes the practice that the 
official NSC minutes would record only the gener~l 
subject discussed without identifying the specially 
sensitive subject as the discussion. In highly 
sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would 
be made in the NSC minutes. (Lay affidavit, 9/8/75, 
p. 2)
