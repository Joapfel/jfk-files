describe_d executive action as a "general_ stand-by capabil.ity-" t.o 
carry out assassination when required (I.G., p. 37). The project 
was given the code na1:1e ·zR/RIFLE by the CIA.* 
A single agent ("asset"), given the cryptonyrn QJ/lHN, 
was placed under Harvej's supervision for the ZR/RIFLE proj~ct, 
but never used in connection with any actual assassination efforts. 
Richard Helms . described QJ /WIN' s "capability":. 
"If you needed somebody to carry out murder, I guess you 
had a man who might be prepared to carry it out." (Helms, 
6/13/75, p. 53). 
Harvey did use agent QJ/WIN, however, to spot "individuals 
. with criminal and underworld connections in Europe -for possible 
multi-purpose use" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 50). For example, QJ/HIN; 
reported that a potential asset in the Middle East was "the leader 
of a gambling syndicate" with ."an available· pool of assassiI)s" 
"'·· (CIA file, ZR/RIFLE/Personality Sketches). 
However, Harvey testified that: 
"during the entire existence of the 'entire ZRRIFLE prpject 
. n6 agent was recruited for the purpose of assassina­
tion; and no even tentative targeting or target list was 
ever drawn." (.Harvey, 6 / 25 / 7 5, p ·- 45. ) • 
Project ZR/RIFLE involved,·generally, assessing the 
problems and requirements of assassination and developing a stand• 
,., ZR/RIFLR was a cryptonym relating to two programs. One was 
the executive_ action assassinat.ion capability. The other was 
another program ~hich is not part of th~ subject matter 1,E this 
report; (William Harvey had _been in charge of the CIA section 
with general responsibility for such programs,) This second 
program was genuine, but it was also to provide a .. cover. for anr 
executive action operation: (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. ·49_) •
