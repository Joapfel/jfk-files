SUBJECT: Foreign Government Information 
(Aiis'tral~ 
(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA once the 
Board has completed its deliberations on the issues discussed 
below.) 
1. (S} Issue: This memorandum will address CIA's position 
on the review and declassification of foreign government 
information that appears in the JFK collection. This issue has 
come to CI_A '_s attention because of the recent review by the JFK 
Board of <Afui"'st.raIIa11).1a~documents. The Agency believes it is 
important to address this issue at this time because this is the 
first instance that this type of rtoreign'Tf~S®~document has 
been reviewed by the Board and it is possible that such 
information will appear again in CIA's collection. This memo 
will, therefore, focus on the larger issue of·a United States 
Government (USG} agency's legal obligations in the dissemination• 
and declassification of foreign government info:i:::m~!~on {!?lit wifr"l

2. (S} Conclusion: CIA does not object to the release of the 
information in these six documents, but is only concerned about 
protecting foreign government information. Therefore, the Agency 
does not object to the release of the four CIA documents in the 
redacted form proposed by the Board. With regards to the(two_} 
t'Au.scraiiari lette~) the Agency has no authority to unilaterally 
agree to their release in any form. Pursuant to its legal 
obligations, CIA ordinarily seeks the consent of the foreign 
government prior to declassifying their information. U:!owever,~
