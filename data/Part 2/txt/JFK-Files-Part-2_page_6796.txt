. The Honorable William V. Roth, Jr. 
To avoid disrupting our continuing efforts to gain 
access to the Russian files on Oswald, the fact that the 
Agency has had direct contacts with the Russian service on 
this topic must remain classified. For the purpose of 
correcting the public record, I suggest the following 
unclassified statement: 
In response to a request from the US. embassy in 
·Moscow,·the Russians have reviewed their file 
holding~ on Oswald. They have advised us that· 
they had nothing that would add t.o our ~-~owledge· 
or to the 22 November 1991 ABC television ~pecial 
on th~s issue, which they termed •detailed and 
objective.• 
I enjoyed the opportunity to testify before the 
Committee, and I hope that these corrections prove helpful. 
A similar letter is being sent to Chairman Glenn.
