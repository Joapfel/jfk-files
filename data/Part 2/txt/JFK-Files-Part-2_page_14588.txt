interviews under suitable pretext. Murphy has the over-all knowledge 
to steer us aux:ty from extremely sensitive countries at outset rather 
than UXJ,iting for interviews to be proposed and at same time knows 
intelligence eno~gh to realize risks must sometimes be takeno If we 
can work something out with Murphy it is believed we can get better 
results and still afford Bureau protection of State clearanceo 
ACTION: 
Recommend our liaison representative Oo H. Bartlett discuss 
this matter with Mro Murphy along above lines to see if something 
practical can be worked outo
