ASPECT OF CIA PRESENCE IN FRANCE. FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND 
SERVICES, THE DISTINCTION THEY HAVE DRAWN IS BETWEEN UNILATERAL 
OPERATIONS THAT TOUCH ON FRENCH AREAS OF INTEREST AND SOVEREIGNTY, IN 
OTHER WORDS, THE ACTIVITIES OF OFFICERS UNDER STATE COVER AND/OR 
NOC'S, AND THOSE JOINT AREAS OF OPERATIONAL ENGAGEMENT WHICH THE 
FRENCH BELIEVE SERVE MUTUAL INTERESTS. AS WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY, 
WHEN THE FRENCH DISCOVER THE FORMER, THEY TAKE QUICK INVESTIGATIVE 
AND DIPLOMATIC ACTION TO CLOSE THESE OPERATIONS DOWN. 
F. IS THERE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILE USE (E.G. RUSSIAN OR CUBAN) 
TO DISCREDIT US EMBASSY AS A "NEST OF SPIES" OR SIMILAR? 
THIS IS A PO~SIBILITY, BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT ANY HOSTILE 
EXPLOITATION WOULD BE SEEN IN PRESS PLACEMENT/PROPAGANDA RE A "NEST 
OF SPIES" VICE A DIPLOMATIC PROTEST. WE WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT SUCH 
PRESS COVERAGE, IF UNSUBSTANTIATED, WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON 
OUR SERVICE-TO-SERVICE OR GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. IF 
SUCH PRESS EXPLOITATION BY HOSTILE SERVICES DREW ON SPECIFIC AND 
CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF PARIS STATION'S USE OF STATE COVER, IT COULD 
fEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR A£ILITY TO SUSTAIN SOME UNILATERAL ACTIVITY DUE 
fO A POSSIBLE INCREASE OF FRENCH SCRUTINY OF OUR OFFICERS (SEE 
BELOW). 
I G. HAVE THERE BEEN PAST IMBROGLIOS OVER CIA PRESENCE OR 
ACTIVITIES THAT THIS RELEASE COULD RESURRECT? 
I AS NOTED ABOVE, IN EARLY 1995 THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DEMARCHED 
~HE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE OVER INCOMPATIBLE ACTIVITIES OF A I 
STATION NOC AND SEVERAL UNDECLARED OFFICERS. THE FRENCH REVEALED 
[NVESTIGATIVE MATERIAL (INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF PHYSICAL AND 
I 
fECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTOGRAPHY OF OUR OFFICERS) THAT 
BULWARKED THEIR CONTENTION THAT PARIS STATION WAS RUNNING UNILATERAL 
I 
OPERATIONS TARGETING FRENCH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS BY 
I 
OFFICERS UNDER EMBASSY COVER AND NOC'S. THE FRENCH PRESS COVERAGE 
I 
rAs EXTENSIVE AND HOSTILE. BY THE TIME THE FRENCH CONCLUDED THEIR 
SERIES OF DEMARCHES, THEY HAD INDICATED THEIR DESIRE FOR THE RECALL 
bF SIX STATION OFFICERS. 
\ WE HAVE -GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ENSURE THAT ANY/ALL UNILATERAL 
ACTIVITY IN FRANCE IS CARRIED OUT UNDER STRINGENT OPERATIONAL 
I 
GUIDELINES TO PROTECT SUCH ACTIVITIES AGAINST FRENCH 
I 
~OUNTER-ESPIONAGE CAPABILITIES. WHILE WE VIEW THIS AS AN ONGOING 
I 
~EQUIREMENT, ANY PRESS OR SERVICE APPREHENSION REGARDING OUR 
yRESENCE, SUCH AS COULD RESULT FROM ARRB TYPE RELEASES, COULD FORCE 
US TO FURTHER RESTRICT OUR UNILATERAL OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS -­
/SOMETHING WE WISH TO AVOID. 
H. HAVE OFFICIAL USG RELEASES SUCH AS FOIA EVER APPEARED IN THE 
LOCAL MEDIA (E.G., JAPAN AND CAMPAIGN FINANCING OR PERU AND FOIA 
RELEASED CONCERNING VLADIMIRO MOTESINOS TORRES). REFERRED TO BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT EITHER ON THE RECORD OR OFF THE RECORD.
