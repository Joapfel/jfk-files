Mr. Halley. I went before you came 
in and explained to Mr. Baron that the subject of assassination 
was constantly beinq discussed in the Cuban community and was a 
part of the fabric of the times. 
Mr. diGenova. That· I am aware of. You are not the only 
one who has expressed that knowledge that they w~re all saying 
let's kill him, let's get together~·. 
Mr. Halley. There was a lot of discussion of this kind of 
subject of assassination and that is why I keep trying to be 
precise that there was no programmatic op~rational program that 
I was aware of to assassinate Castro. 
Mr. Baron. Although the context in which we discussed the 
talk that was in the air of assassinating Castro was coffee shop 
in Miami and conversation among Cubans as opposed to conversa­
tions among high CIA officials back in Headquarters, were you 
aware that th~re were at least serious discussions of the 
use of assassination against Castrc at CIA lleadquart~rs? 
Mr. Halley. No, I was not. We are plowing the same ground 
that we covered before in this. 
As I indicated to you, people would come out of,Cuba ann 
discuss these kinds of things. Some of tho:s1=. were reported in, 
you know, traffic back to Washington. People would discuss 
what are the prospects of somebody assigned to assassinate 
Castro. In that particular context, y~s, discussions on th~ 
assassination of Castro took place. That is why I keep coming
