intend to address only Intelligence ·Community concerns; I will 
defer to the Department of Justice on any additional problems 
posed by the joint resolution. 
First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to 
whether CIA materials related to the assassination can be released 
to the public is inconsistent with my own statutory responsibility 
to protect intelligence sources and methods. 
,. 
Second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no 
provision requiring security clearances or secure document 
handling by the Assassination Materials Review Board or its staff. 
Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not 
provide the Agency with the opportunity to object to the release 
of CIA information contained in documents-originated by 
Congress or the Warren Commission. Under the joint resolution, 
documents originated by these entities can be released directly by 
the Executive Director of the Assassination Materials Review 
Board without any review by the President or other Executive 
Branch agencies. 
Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for 
agencies or departments to appeal decisions by the Executive 
Director to release information may not provide sufficient time for 
meaningful review of what could pro've to be a large volume of 
material at one time.
