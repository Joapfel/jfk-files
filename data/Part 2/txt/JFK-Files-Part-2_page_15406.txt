Re: INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE DF .FRIENDLY 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES (SEM1ANNUAL EVALllATIOJ!). ·. 
Costs of this _phase of our _program are _pr inc i_pall y 
those arising from field investigations of potential sources 
and Agents' time in handling _producing sources. Cos_ts are 
considered fully justified since sound counterintelligence 
coverage requires sources which can _produce not .only investi­
gative data but also intelligence information of val.ue to us 
and other agencies in guiding _policy·and making decisions.· 
TIE-IN WITH OTHER PROGRAMS 
This program·supplements, and is su_pplemented by, a 
number of _programs which result ~ inteJ.,,J igence coverage of 
friendly foreign countries. The~nagramJProgram is a typical 
e.xam_ple. Our technical.coverage on :past occasions has assiited 
in Anagram operations. The name-check _program on holders of 
official and di_plomatic visas covers many of the intelligence 
_personnel who fall within the first category described above. 
Even the Intensification Progra0, which is directed against 
Soviet bloc officials and establishments, _produces data on . . . 
activities of ·friendly foreign, officials and their contacts 
with ~ommunist officials.· 
.MAGNITUDE 
Program handled on Section-wide· basis sin·ce it has 
ramifications touching work on any desk handling matters 
relating to noncommunist countrzes, depending u_pon international 
devel~pments and intelligence requirements of ~reau and State 
.De.pa rtme n t. 
PAST OR PRESENT WEAKNESSES 
No weaknesses have cro_pped u_p in the _past six months.·. 
Over-all _program is operating smoothly and effectively.
