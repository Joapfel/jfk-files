CHAPTER 5: THE STANDARDS FOR 'REVIEW: REVIEW BOARD "COMMON LAW'/. 
individual who has provided or is currently 
providing information p~rtaining to natio~al 
security matters, the disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to result in 
damage to the FBI's intelligence and counter­
intelligence-gathering capabilities." 
The FBI offered the following arguments in 
support of its request to keep intelligence 
sources' identities secret: (1) Review Board 
disclosure of intelligence sources would harm 
the FBI's ability to develop and maintain new 
,111d existing sources, because sources would 
reasonably . believe that the government 
"·ottld reveal their identities, and (2) disclo­
su rc of intelligence sources may subject the 
sPurces, their friends, and their families to 
physical harm, ridicule, or ostracism. 
Thl' Review Board's interpretation of the 
·'dear and convincing" evidence. standard 
rl'quired it to reject the FBI's general policy 
,irguments, and instead required the FBI to 
prl'scnt asset-specific evidence that explained 
thl' particular harm that the FBI expected the 
.1:-.~l't to face if the Review Board voted to dis­
di 1se his or her identity. As a general rule, the 
Rl·,·icw Board usually protected the identities 
, if foreign nationals who could be prosecuted 
in their home countries for espionage. Like­
""isc, where the asset was a United States cit­
izl'n interacting with foreign government offi­
l·i,1ls, the Review Board considered whether 
thl' individual was in a position of trust with 
I hl' foreign government. and whether he or 
shl' might be in danger if the Review Board 
disclosed his or l;ler relationship with the FBI. 
Unlike the above-referenced scenarios, the 
source who was a United States citizen interact­
i11g with other United States citizens was gener­

gl'nce activities against Communist Bloc 
l·ountries during the cold war period were

nation records contain information that 
reveal many of the FBI's foreign counterintel­
ligence activities during the cold war period. 
Beginning in late 1995, the Review Board 
considered how it could release as much 
information as possible in the records with­
out jeopardizing operations that still require 
protection.

In spring 1996, the 
Review Board considered 
and voted on a group of 
FBI records relating to the 
FBI's foreign counterin­
telligence activities. In 
response to the Review 
Board's requests for evi-
- dence on the foreign 
counterintelligence 
records, the FBI had pro­
vided its "position paper" 
on foreign counterintelli­
gence activities. In its 
paper, the FBI defined 
"intelligence activities" as

"intelligence gathering action or techniques 
utilized by the FBI against a targeted individ­
ual or organization that has been determined 
to be of national security interest." The FBI's 
primary argument in support of its request for 
continued secrecy of intelligence activities 
was that disclosure of specific information 
describing intelligence activities would reveal 
to hostile entities the FBI's targets and priori­
ties, thereby allowing hostile entities to 
develop countermeasures. 
Sections 6(1}(8} and (C) of the JFK Act pro­
vided the standard for postponement. -In 
addition, the JFK Act's legislative history 
instructed the Review Board to consider a 
variety of factors related to the need to post­
pone disclosure of intelligence sources and 
methods, including the age of the record, 
whether the use of a particular source or 
method is already well-known by the public, 
whether the source or method is inherently 
secret, or whether the information collected 
was secret. 27 
The Review Board considered the FBI's evi­
dence and weighed it against public interest 
in the records. After careful consideration, 
the Review Board decided to release some 
foreign counterintelligence information. The 
Board's primary reason for releasing such
