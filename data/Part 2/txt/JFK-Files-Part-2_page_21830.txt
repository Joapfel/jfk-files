During the time this training was conducted, i.e. from 
1959 to the Bay of Pigs invasion, Mr. Stephens recalls there 
were two occasions when he and/or members of his 4-5 man train­
ing cadre were told to give parachutes and weapons to individuals 
who were to be parachuted into Cuba to attempt to assassinate 
Castro. Mr. Stephens stated that he did not precisely recall 
whether he was expressly told these individuals were going to 
Cuba to try to kill Castro, but he said he was cleat that from 
either the instructions he received or the nature and details 
of the particular situation that this was the mission. 
I asked Mr. Stephens to describe what he would do after 
being told to outfit the individuals who were to be dropped 
into Cuba for these assassination efforts. He stated that he 
or members of his cadre (lie declined to specify whether he 
personally outfitted these individuals or whether it was done 
by his co-workers) would provide parachutes and whatever 
weapons the individuals desired. He referred to an "assassi­
nation package." Such a "package" would contain a variety 
of !~apons, grenades, and other armaments, including a special 
"assassination gun." This gun, Mr·. Stephens said, was a 9 mm.
