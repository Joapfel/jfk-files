Reference is made to the memorandum of Mr. W. O. Cregar 
to Mr. w. R. Wannall dated 6-3-75, concerning the above committee~. 
Attached for approval was a revised draft of the M~morandum of ~ 
Understanding concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members '-' 
of captioned Committees. It was pointed out that in accordance 
with opinion expressed by John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy, 
Intelligence Community Staff, and Donald E. Moore, Chairman, 
Security Committee, U. s. Intelligence Board, a copy of the i 
Memorandum of Understanding will not be furnished to Senator Church. 
The revised draft is to be furnished the Attorney General for 
his approval. ~ lf~ 
C 
[ 1 , It is felt that we are confronted with a complex legal ~! 
~.~ problem here and it would appear that if the Senate Select a 
~:~ Committee is a party to the Memorandum of Understanding, it is ~ 
E '-entitled to a copy of such communication to prevent any misun- ~. 
,t:tij~q derstanding in the future and to protect the FBI which ha\ drawn~ 
~~li!i up this Memorandum of Understanding, ·-}; c' 8 
~ Inserted in the revised draft are references to ~ ~ 
4 Executive Order (EO) 11652 and Director of Central Intel~:irgence ~ 
~ Directive (DCID) No. 1/14. Both are limited in their stated o 
'-:> application to the Executive Branch and here their application § 
,.4-i'- is being extended to the Legislative Branch, which apparently ~ 
'1 has no established clearance procedure nor suitability for 
.~ employment program. Of particular interest is that part of 
-;-.:. the "Personnel Security Approval Criteria" under DCID 1/14 
which reads: "The individual shall be stable, of excellent 
character and discretion and of unqµestioned loyalty to the 
United States." ..-'\~~ /l In rrz.. - ~ (:)> I /
