3.i~se of Chinese Pilots in Southeast Asia '1~ 
// The NRO paper of 25 June, proposing the substitution of Chinese 
Nationalist pilots for Americans for the high-performance coverage 
of North Vietnam and Laos, was discussed. 
Mr. Johnson said that the State Department's view is that if 
Chinese Nationalist missions out of Taiwan are so scheduled as to. 
cross over the border into North Vietnam from time to time, they have 
no real objection (on the understanding that the cover story would 
be that the pilot had strayed off course.) On the other hand, the 
Department is unable to concur in any deep penetration into the 
southern part of North Vietna~, .or into Laos. . The latter country is '· 
considered particularly sensitive in this respect. 
In. light of the State position, the Group agreed to proceed as 
at present with the modifications suggested by Mr. Johnsor9

5~ Cuba - Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations 
Mr. FitzGerald briefed the Group on the results of the previous 
month's operations. 
Mr. McCone called particular attention to the continuing buildup 
of fast patrol boats in the Cuban inventory, and said that in light 
of this we must begin to draw contingency plans for alternate methods 
of delivery of agents and supplies against the eventuality that the 
patrol boats may become too great a .hazard. He suggested the possi­
bility of such means. of de livery as submarines.
