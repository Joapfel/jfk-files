Hr. Kelley. With respect to Mr. Chase's memorandum, in 
' I 
his summary of the rationale of proposals,· he.- states, as seconn ,: 
"the present importance of Castro as a nationalist symbol makes 
him the obvious operational target: assassination i? excluded 
to avoid Castro's martyrdom." 
Do you have any recollection of why he would exclude 
assassination? Does that imply to you, or do you reqollect, 
whether Castro's assassination was being conRldar~~ ~nd here 
is a sta·ff paper .excluding it-,. -because. someone asked them .to 
c'ortsider it? 
Mr. Bundy. No, I think it's a simple statement of what 
I would regard as a rationale assessment of the situation by 
whoever the original author was, and certainly by the staff 
\ 
man with respect to a subject that emerges directly from the 
notion that he is an operational_target, whatever that means 
and goes on to say, but w~ don't mean assassination, because 
it would make him a martyr, what other reasons against: that 
there may b~. It doesn't s_eem to me that you can read·the 
statement that assassination is excluded as an inference that 
somebody else is including it. 
Mr. Kell~y. That's all.
