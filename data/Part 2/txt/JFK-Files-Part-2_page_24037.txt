On October 3 Conein contacted Minh. Minh explained that a 
coup was being planned, and requested assurances of American 
support if it were successful. llinh outlined three courses of 
action, one of which 1,as the i.lSSassination of u.ie:n' s brothers, 
* Nhu and Can (Conein~ p.25; cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63). 
The Acting Chief of the CIA Station, D~vid R. Smith, cabled on 
October 5 that he had recommended to Lodge that '·we do not set 
ourselves irrevocably against th~ assassination plot, since the 
other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon or a 
protracted struggle" (Cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63). 
A cable from the Director, CIA to Saigon responded that: 
'' (w)c certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating, 
approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other 
hand, we are in no 1,1ay responsible for stoppinc; every 
such threat of which ~;e misht receive even partial know­
ledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of Diem. 
\•Je bel{eve engaging ourselves by taking position on this 
matter opens door too easily for probes of our position 
re others, re support of regime, et cetera. Consequently 
beli.:,ve best- approach is hands _off. Hm-1ever, * ve naturally 
interested in intelligence on any such plan." 
* The other courses of action were the encirclement of Saigon 
by various military·units and direct confrontation between military 
units involved in the coup and loyalist units. • 
** Colby, who was then Chief, Far'Eastern Division, drafted 
this cable for McCone. Colby testified: 
"Q: So you were on notice as of that date that the Director 
personally opposed any involvement by the .. CIA in an ass-as­
sination? 
"Colby: I certainly was." (Colby, p. 57)
