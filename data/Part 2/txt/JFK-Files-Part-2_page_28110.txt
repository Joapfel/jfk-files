Dear Professor Blakey: 
I am sending the resume which you requested, 
along with a suggested salary of $25,000, (in line 
with the level which I would automati~ally reach with 
the Justice Department in the relatively near future)o 
The-litigation experience reflected on the re­
sume is almost complete; it omits ·only a second easel 
in Puerto Rico (conspiracy). currently in pre-trial • 
stages, .an Atlanta conspiracy case I am preparing 
to indict, and a brief just completed for an appeal 
to the Ninth-Circuit. The· job has provided me with 
a varied and respectable amount of litigation and 
appeal experience, in addition to the more routing 
matters (immunities,·witness protections, indict-
ment ·dismissals, Title II][ wiretap authori.zations, 
solicitor general memos etc.) handled on a daily 
basis-by the various sections within the Criminal 
Division. 
The job which you have described obviously, 
presents an exciting and unique opportunity. Further, 
I would consider it an honor to work with you". on 
the investigation. I expect I would .be able to start 
work with you within a month, or sooner, should an 
offer be extendedo I look forward to hearing from 
you in the near future. 
Sincerely, 
~
