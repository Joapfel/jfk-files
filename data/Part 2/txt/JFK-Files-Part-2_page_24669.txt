Hedgman that he "WOULD EXPECT DISPATCH TDY [TEMPORARY DUTY] SENIOR 
CASE OFFICER RUN THIS OP" by supervising a third country national 
operative (CIA Cable OUT 78336, Tweedy to Chief of.Station, 10/7/60). •

tion of dispatching the senior case officer as S00~ as possible to 
concentrate on the assassination operation (CIA Cable OUT 81396, 
Tweedy to Chief of Station, 10/15/60). Two days later, the Chief 
·of Station replied affirmatively:
