pilot who had.volunteered to assist-the CIA in gathering intelli-
gence informed his case officer in Havana that he would probably 
be chosen to fly to Prague on July 21 to return Raul Castro to 
Cuba (Memo to I.G., 1/17/75). On July 20 the pilot confirmed that 
he would definitely fly the plane. CIA Headquarters and field 
stations along the route were requested to inform the Havana Station 
of any intelligence needs that the pilot might fulfill. The case 
officer testified that he and the pilot contemplated only acquiring 
information about Czechoslovakia and Raul Castro, and that assas-
-sination was not considered.* 
The cable from the Havana Station was received at Head-
quarters on the night of July 20. The duty o_fficer, who was summoned 
to Headquarters from his home, ·contacted Tracy Barnes, Deputy to 
DDP Richard Bissell, and J.C. King, Chief of the Western Hemisphere 
Division.** Following their instructions, he sent a cable to the 
Havana Station early in the morning of July 21, stating: "Possible 
removal top three leaders is receiving seri'ous consideration at 
HQS." The cable inquired whether the pilot was sufficiently 
motivated to risk "arranging an accident during return trip" and 
* A cable to Headquarters requesting any intelligence needs 
supports this account. 
** The duty officer testified that he must have spoken with King 
because he would not otherwise have signed the cable "by direction, 
J.S. King". (Duty Officer,.p. 16) He also would "very definitely" 
have read the cable to Barnes before sending it, because "Barnes 
was the man to whom we went ... for our authority and for work 
connected with the Cuban Project." (Duty Officer, pp. 4, 25) Since 
King at that time was giving only "nominal attention" to Cuban 
affairs, the officer concluded that a proposal of the gravity of an 
assassination could only have "come from Mr. Barnes". (Duty Officer, 
p. 24)
