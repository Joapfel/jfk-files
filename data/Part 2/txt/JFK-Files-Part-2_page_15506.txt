the Soviets to gain additional-influence and scour efforts to develop 
informants in these establishments should continue. We have a very good· 
symboled informant in Washington, D. c., who continues to furnish 
information rega1·ding the Royitl .Government of Yemen and if a coalition 
government between the Royal Government and the Yemen Republic Government 
occurs this informant may again be employed in the Yemen Arab Republic 
Embassy. WFO has a symboled informant who is available to-.':.. furnish 
information concerning personnel. of the Embassy of the Syria Arab Republic.· 
New York has a PSI, who although not associated with the Syrian diplomatic 
establishment, is, however, in a position to obtain information regarding 
·activities of Syrian diplomatic personnel there. 
The UAR.under President Nasser is still a volatile hot spot. 
--Nasser continues to court both the· Soviets and the Western World and at 
any time a. full-scale wa.r between the.-UAR and Israel could erupt so we 
I should· continue our efforts here.• • We have one symboled informant who 
~ furnishes information concerning,-.personnel of the Embassy of UAR but this 
~1 ·· informant is not employed· there: • We had a symboled informant at the UAR 
t' 
. Delegation to the United Nations but she was recently terminated when she 
left her employment to get married.

WFO has a good symboled informant at the Embassy of Lebanon who 
is employed as a secretary there. A former symboled informant who.is an 
employee of the Lebanese Delegation to.the United Nations is available to 
furnish coverage at the Lebanese diplomatic establishments in New York City. 
No further efforts to develop sources,warranted. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
(1) That fw:-ther efforts· to develop sources at Jordanian, 
Lebanese and Saudi Arabian diplomatic establis~...ments in the u. s. are not 
warranted and should be discontinued. Attached is a letter to WFO and 
... : New York· advising. these of fices to discontinue their efforts in this regard. 
(2). That our efforts to develop sources at the diplomatic 
establishments.of Iran, Iraq, Syria, UAR and Yemen should continue •
