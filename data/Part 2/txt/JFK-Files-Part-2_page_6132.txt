release, only twent:~~·nine percent of the public believed that Oswald was solely 
responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy; following its release a 
year later, in 1964, that number increased to eighty-seven percent. However, two 
years later, in 19EiEi, only thirty-six.percent of Americans indicated they 
(AS) believed the Report. nlB By the time JFK opened in the movie houses of 
America, nl9 public confidence in the Commission's Report had.sunk even further, 
with about seventy percent of Americans concluding that Oswald did not act 
alone. n20 The movie, therefore, tapped a deep wellspring of distrust of the 
Report rather than, as is sometimes implied, n21 fostered it.

political killings. Assassins also gunned down Robert F. Kennedy, Martin
