MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of Special Group (Augmented) on 
Project Mongoose, 3 May 1962 
PRESENT: General Taylor; Mr. Kennedy; Mr. Johnson; Mr, Gilpatric, 
General Decker, General Lansdale and General Craig; 
Mr, McCone, and Mr. Harvey 
1. General Lansdale gave an interim report on the progress 
of stepping up recruitment of Cubans into the U. S, Army. He said 
the consensus is that there are not more than a thousand suitable 
individuals from whom additional recruits could be selected. The 
Attorney General commented that the President wishes to have a large 
number. General Lansdale said that various alternatives for training 
of such Cubans are being looked into. 
Jt was agreed that such a cadre of Cubans would be an 
to the U.S., which might be used in a number of ways. General 
Lansdale, supported by General Taylor, pointed out that in this 
connection the matter of holding the individuals and giving them 
useful employment after they are trained is an important and a 
difficult one. 
2. Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on progress to date with agent 
teams and in the general field of intelli nee, including the 
Opa-locka interrogation center and the I clandestine interroga­
tion center. He outlined various difficulties encountered, and said 
that three agent teams have been infiltrated and that five W/T sets 
are in place. Approximately 72· actual or potential reporting sources 
are also in place. A significant development is that Major Duque has 
refused to allow agents responsive to him to be dispatched on purely­
intelligence-gathering missions. (This sort of attitude had been 
forecast earlier as a possibility, but it now assumes particular im­
portance;in-view of Duque's stature.)
