The Chairman. Thank you. 
Mr. Preyer. 
Mr. Preyer. Mr .. Nosenko> .:>_one thing that comes through ve y 
strongly in your testimony is that it is a hard life to be a 
defector. I think to the average mentality we think it would 
be good for a country to welcome a defector, but to the 
intelligence mentality apparently a defector is immediately susi 
<\:·· I 
pect, and you have-.r~~ouAted your 'treatment here, and apparenti 
Lee.Harvey Oswald, from your testimony, was greeted somewhat 
- i .. ' ... 
like this in'·the· u~'s.s_,;If. 'His' treatment was,._·much different 
from yours. •. 
Orie :thing he was not an intelligence agent, of course. 
Bbt you have indicated that he ~as kept at arms' length by the 
I 
KGB. The impression I get was the mere fact of being a defect1r 
I 
caused the KGB to be less interested in him than if it was l 
someone they had recruited? 
Mr. Nosenko . Right. 
Mr. Preyer. Al though he was kept at arms' lengt.h: by the 
KGB, in the sense that he was not contacted, it does appear 
that he lived very well there, relatively speaking. He cer­
tainly live~ much.better than you lived in your early years. 
That he was given a job in Minsk, he was given a pension, 
which is somethinq that seems extraordinary in this country, 
from the Red Cross, and apparently pretty good housing conditi,ns
