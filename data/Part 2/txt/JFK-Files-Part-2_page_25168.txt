OCCURRENCE: 
In a State telegram to Saigon (DEPI'EL 256), on Aup;µst 27, 1963, the following message appeared: 
"Examination of reports to date gives considerable hope but leaves unanswered questions .... 
Proceeding from the concept outlined in DEPTEL 2l/ 3 as modified, now desire your prompt interim 
appraisal of present prospects .... Hii:;hest authority asks whether you and HARKINS, in light 
of developing situation, presently favor operation as currently planned by generals. We wish 
to ~ive you all possible support in best available course but not to insist on any decision 
that.developing evidence makes it wise to modify." (10)
