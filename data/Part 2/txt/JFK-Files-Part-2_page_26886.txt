Q Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force i-1 was 
established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban 
operations? 
A Yes. 
Q Or was that shared with the Miami b'ase, Miami 
Station? 
A No. The Miami Station was under Task Force 1'1. 
Q All right. Would that also be true of the Special 
Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Grouo? 
A Right, except that at the present time the Station 
has no Cuban operations. 
Q I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-
nated? 
A At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down 
there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was 
1.n early 1973. It was a gradual reduction. 
_;nd have those ol_)erations been terminated entirely 
or are they now run out of the Washington area? 
All Cuban ol_)erations are run out of Washington.
