tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the military junta, that it 
would indicate President Johnson's support of Diem rather than the 
present authorities. Therefore he stated he could not move to remove 
Lodge but hoped that Lodge would remove himself and become a 
candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency and would 
be the nominee. (Note: I told the President he wanted· things too 
easy). I told the President that Lodge would destroy d_e Silva if he 
opposed his assignment or did not like him, or wished to get rid of him. 
The President said he would communicate most emphatically with 
Lodge in this regard and asked Bundy to write an appropriate communi- . 
cation.· I told the President this would do no good, th~~ Lodge was 
absolutely unconscionable in matters of this kind and h~ had resorted 
to trickery time and time again during the Eisenhower·:administration 
and that he never failed to use the newspapers in order to expose an 
individual or block an action. I therefore could only conclude that if he 
was go~ng to keep Lodge on that it would be better to s~ay with Davi4_ 
Smith a,s Chief of Station, who is a most competent officer but young 
and not· fully experienced, but this proposal did not m~et his request 
that the: best and most experienced man we can find be.,placed on the 
job. The President said he would exercise the full power of his 
office to keep Lodge in line and felt our responsibilities in South 
Vietnatjl are so great that CIA :should have a "four-star man" on the job and 
that is :What he ·wanted. .,,
