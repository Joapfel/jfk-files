MILANES that the US Govenunent did not condone such

support of this undertaking, he considered it not 
prudent to reveal further details, but added that he 
actually did not know the names of any other possible 
participants and had only a general idea of the scheme 
which was to waylay CASTRO·as he was leaving an apartlllent.

In January 1963 Fidel CASTRO asked MILANES what he 
thought of President Kermedy and his relationship 
with Fidel. MILANES replied that Fidel probably 
underestimated Kennedy, that the latter by no means was

obscene motion and said he would have Kermedy "in the
