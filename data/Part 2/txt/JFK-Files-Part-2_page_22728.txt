and told us to send this off, wo had a development occur which 
it is not necessary for me to go into, it's still a relatively 
'---
live case, in which proof positive came that he was a Soviet 
agent, and it was in the face of 'that proof positive that the I 
Bureau moved in and interrogated him, 
him to go to the Soviet embassy. 
And that is what promptc~ 
And after some ho.urs there he co.mo out, he was asked why 
did you go to the Soviet embassy, and ho said I went there to 
get my personal history and particulars regarding my family 
since those are the questions you have bnen asking mo, In 
other words, instead of -- in this case the man had a wife 
who was having an affair off and on with a Japanese military 
person here -- instead of recruiting the Japanese and the wife 
to work in to him, because what we wanted was a confession, 
because the point I want to stress here is in a case of this \ 
sort, a penetration there, he is not there as a solo person. 
lie is there as a spotter. lie is a person used for entrapment 
abroad. He is a person who can originate an operation, 
induce you to go into the operation and bring in a weak 
element, and put them in a position for further recruitment. 
And I can stretch this on and on. 
And the classic example is the Philby case. l'i1ilby 
would have been Chief of !.lritish Intelligence. lie was also 
identified positively in the end by this defector. When the 
defector first knew about it, it was called the Ring of Five
