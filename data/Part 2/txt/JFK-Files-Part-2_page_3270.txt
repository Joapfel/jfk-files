TOP SECRET 
cable read in part as follows: 
You have been authoritatively advised 
that US Government is not (repeat not) 
backing Rubio group and that it has no 
intention of E;?Ver doing so. It complete 
fabrication that Pawley was given us 
Government assurance that only his group 
would be backed. No resignations of any 
kind occurred, nor are any foreseen. 
Mention Veep in such context and on this 
particular level sheer foolhardiness and 
can only reflect most adversely on those 
Cubans who guilty misrepresentation of 
facts and _severest indiscretions. 14/ 
The cable apparently wa~ never forwarded to 
either Havana ,or to Miami, presumably because of op­
position from Col. J.C. King who had noted and ini­
tialed on his copy of the Memorandum from Jake Ester­
line recommending that all contact with the Rubio­
Pawley g·roup be "immediately and finally severed" 
the following_: "I do not concur with severing of 
all contacts."* 15/ 
* As will be noted subsequently, whether it was 
political expediency or conviction that Pawley could 
actually do some good, the relationship among Pawley, 
Chie~ WH Division, and_ Chief, WH/4 continued through­
out the course of the Bay of Pigs Operation. If any­
thing in fact, the relationship between Pawley and 
Jake Esterline appears to have become mutually sup­
portive, particularly-as the operation drew to its 
unsuccessful conclusion.
