Colonel Roth. That was my impression at the time. 
Q. You understand from you_r work in the Defense Department 
"that the highest level of government usually ~ndicated the 
President of the United St~tes? 
Colonel Roth. 1 would assume .Chae·. 
·The CIA produced copies of several messages which identify 
Gen·er-als Bennett and Philpo.tt as either the sender or recipient. ~ong 
these documents is a message relating ti;> Track II which bears Philpott's 
(Undated message. ca .. 14 October 1970) General 
Philpott admitted that the signature appears to be.his but doubted that 
i.t was and he cou_ld not "recall signing it, or h?ving se·en it. (Philpott, 
p. ) CIA also produced messages of October 14· (Headquarters 762) 
and October 21 (Headquarters 934) conveying instructions from General 
Bennett to the Army Attache. General Bennett testified he did.not 
authorize these messages! 
It is beyond the responsibilities which I had ·in the military 
assistance area. It goes beyond the responsibility which I 
had in terms that I would have to get the authority or the 
approval of the Secretary through the Chairman for covert 
action of this magn-itude. This mess~ge would not have been 
signed by me. (Bennett testimony, p. 21) 
-Accord_ing to Karamessines, qnly the White House had the _authoiity to 
issue the directives contained in those messages (Karamessines testi-
many, p. 84) 
The Department of Defense was unable to provi'de any documents bear~ 
ing on the issu_e of Wirnert' s Track II instructions or responses. A 
DOD file search under the direction of General Daniel 0. Graham, the 
present Director of DIA, produced no copies of communication documents 
for the September-October 1970 period. _(Graham, p. 6) However, Roth 
testified that detailed memoranda for the record ~hich he prepared on 
f ·.; (r~·--r·~-_.'. 1 r -, 1 '. ·_J ;,{ r::
