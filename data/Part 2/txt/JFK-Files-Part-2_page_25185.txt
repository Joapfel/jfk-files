In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG0922) of 16 September 1963 Richardson replied to 
Washington's requestfor his judgrrEnt on the desirability and feasibility of certain 
ideas, as Washington was then in the course of constructing an agreed plan. He 
cabled: "We must go on trying to win the war with current administration for as long 
as it persists in power (we should not attempt publicly to achieve objectives with 
respect to GVN with probability of attainment is virtually nil) we cannot covertly 
tinker with or engineer coup unless general situation is reasonably perpitious 
and if we are Lll18.ble·to establish necessary working contact with Vietnairese leaders 
willing and able to do the job with necessary means. (Agree we should carefully 
explore and perhaps carefully experirrent with graduated measures designed to pressure 
Diem, within context of persuading him to take steps needed. These measures would be 
more effeftive if they are limited to practical and acheivable objectives. )
