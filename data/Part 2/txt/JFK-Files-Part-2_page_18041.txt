were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked 
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a 
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social 
call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a 
public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there 
was any discus~ion between Sullivan and Magill regarding 
any anti-King activities and I told him, 11no.l! He asked 
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta 
and I told him I knew of none. • 
He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry 
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King 
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or 
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked 
whether Nichois, the Agent assigned to the King 
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I 
told him I ha~ hazy recall of Nichols, but did not 
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella. 
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was 
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked· who had 
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
