The Attorney General 
NOTE: - This is the first instance wherein the SSC has 
made available for review a proposed rough draft of a seg­
ment of the upcoming SSC report. It is expected that other 
segments will be made available by the Committee Staff 
Members. It was necessary to review this proposed draft 
in the offices of the SSC since they do not contemplate 
permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises. The 
approval for the use of information from the 2 classified 
doct1II1ents has been coordinated with the rs ... 2 Section of 
the Intelligence Division and with the Budget and Accounting 
Section of the Administrative Division. The handling of 
the budget figure as set forth has been approved by Asst. 
Director E.W. Walsh. •
