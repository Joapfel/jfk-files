SUBJECT: ~Re: PRIORITY - Name !Races tor JFKIARRB - Andrew (Andy) Anderson 
Frieda, 
I have completed searches for Andrew Anderson_ as Anderson for maximum hits, on Howard 
Guebler under Guebler, on Gordon Novel under Nov(;/ and Edward Butler under Butler, all last names for 
maximum possible hits. My searchs on these four individuals produced no hits, no records, and no 
indexed data oh one and all. 
I note the presumption ~Evidently; he (Anderson) was a former employee· because he had a AIN 
number of O 800211 .. An AIN number is an Agency lden(ification Number, not necessarily suggesting an 
"employee· relationship. An ·EIN" is ah Employee Identification Number, but what categories of 
employment fall under it, I'm not prepared to say.

Barry Harrelson, the JFK Project Officer, is requesting that you search once again under the name of 
Andrew (Andy) Anderson in light of the fact that CCS has located a file on one Andrew Clarence Anderson 
(AlN O 800211 ). Evidently, he was a former employee. I regret that we did not have this information prior 
to tasking you the first time.
