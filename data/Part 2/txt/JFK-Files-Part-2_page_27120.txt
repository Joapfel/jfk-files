issues involving Soviet strategic disinformation and our 
defense posture go to the heart of national security inso­

data base which justifies a super power to bargain away its 
strength. (Attachment B sets forth the views of

atmospherics: [a] the peculiar role of ·the KGB among Soviet 
negotiators, and [bl how an uninformed U.S. representation 
learned from the Soviet delegation of changes in the U.S.

Vietnam issue.)
