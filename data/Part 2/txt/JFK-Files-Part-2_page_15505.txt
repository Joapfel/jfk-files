~he·y were drifting toward the so~fiet. _bloc and because the Middle East had 
long been a. volatile "trouble spot •Ou, • ~rhe Middle East remains turbulen.t a.nd 
unpredictable. • Cyprus and the J.~.rab~Isr::1...eli borders continue to be the 
ms,jor trouble spots but poor ir.an:~i111-Iraqi • relations as VJell as the 
unresolved Yemeni· question may also cause many problems. State indicated 
it was al 1 right to investigate ,.any '·prr.rpos!!d source but interviews would be 
considered on a case basis., Stv.te adv:ised it did not desire us to use 
anyone other than Americans, but it·:>v;ould conside1,. the use of· non-Americans 
if there was an investigative inte~-rest involved. We have ·no investigative .. ··-­
