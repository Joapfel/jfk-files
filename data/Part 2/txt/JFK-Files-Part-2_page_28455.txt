September 14, 1977 
Early August, 1977, John Farmer, The Committee's 
summer intern, informed me that he would be registering 
for classes on August 26, 1977, and would like some time 
off commencing August 15, 1977, so he could vacation with 
his family for two weeks. 
Based on the countless hours he devoted, and on 
John's overall performance, which was exceptional, I took 
it upon myself to grant him the week of August 14, 1977 
to accommodate his vacation plans. Therefore, he should 
have been taken off our payroll ending August 20, 1977. 
However, I erred in failing to notify you earlier 
on the above, as I thought I had alieady done. Therefore, 
John Farmer was in fact paid for the remainder of the month 
of August, 1977. 
Should there be additional questions on this matter, 
please contact me immediately. Furthermore, I can assure 
you that in the future, you will be notified immediately 
with regard to personnel changes. 
Thank you.
