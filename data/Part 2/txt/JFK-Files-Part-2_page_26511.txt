DRAFT BRIEFING N9',('ES 18 February 
CUBAN SUBVERSION IN LATIN.:AMERICA 
I. Introductory Statement 
The public pronouncements of Cuban leaders, the 
daily .record of events in Latin America, and reports 
from our intelligence sources within Communist and 
other left-extremist elements throughout this hemis­
phere all agree on one salient conclusion: that 
Fidel Castro is encouraging and supporting the efforts 
of Communists to overthrow and seize control of the. 
governments in Latin America. 
A. Analysis indicates that the immediate threat 
stems less from the subversive efforts of tra­
ditional Communist movements than from Cuban 
support of any and all active revolutionary and 
terrorist movements. 
B. These distinctions are not precise. In some 
countries, Castro's original success has spurred 
the established Communist movement to action, 
and he supports it. In others, the old-time 
Communists may even oppose radical action at·this 
time, and Castro works with more active and more 
militant revolutionists.
