SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
{U) The DO provided the following unclassified 
response about the Angleton Files: The files that 
Kalaris mentioned in Mangold's book were incorporated 
with the files of the CI staff. Per memorandum dated 
1976-1979, the CI files were reviewed and incorporated 
into the DO record system. Items that were duplicates 
or not worthy of retention were destroyed. The memos 
describe the file collection and the process that was 
followed. Because the files that were once known as 
Angleton's have been dispersed within the DO records, 
they are no longer identifiable as a collection. 
CIA-IR-06 -- QKENCHANT 
{U) IMS/ESG/HCS initially provided a classified 
response to DA/OIM/JFK for this request in February 
1998. In a follow-up response for declassification of 
the response, IMS/ESG/HCS worked with the providing 
office and then approved DA/DIM/JFK's unclassified 
response. 
CIA-IR-07 7 Claude Barnes Capehart 
{U) The DO provided a classified response, which 
stated that we found no record when conducting a name 
trace for records on Capehart. Subsequently, we were 
advised by the CIA's Project Manager, Mr. J. Barry 
Harrelson, that this request was primarily being 
researched by the Directorate for Science & Technology. 
CIA-IR-09 -- George Bush 
(S) The ARRB requested information about George 
Bush because of a reference to "George Bush of the 
Central Intelligence Agency" in a certain FBI document 
dated November 1963.
