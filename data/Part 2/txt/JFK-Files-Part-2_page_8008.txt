CORRECTION 
In the July 1973 issue of Computers and Automation. 
a single article entitled "Communication - Three­
Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer" was published. Part 
l was authored by Larry B. Dendy of the Public Rela­
tions Office of the University of Georgia and Part 2 
was authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld et !l of the 
University of Georgia and the Yerkes Regional Prim­
ate Research Center of Emory University. 
In compliance with the authors' wishes, the two 
parts of that article have been reprinted as two 
separate articles. The first article is authored 
solely by Larry B, Dendy and is titled, "Communica­
tion - Three Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer." The 
second article is authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld 
and his colleagues from the Yerkes Primate Research 
Center and Georgia State University and is titled, 
"A Computer Mediates Communication with a Chimpanzee." 
Also, and in compliance with the authors' wishes, all 
figures and tables of the article as published in 
the July 1973 issue have been included in the second 
of these articles. 
In the 1973 annual index Computers and Automation 
will enter the two articles in this manner, which 
serves to separate a regular article from a formal 
scientific and technical report,
