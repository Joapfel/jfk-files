Re ardin your letter (6/705] of 10 May 1982, ou;r. 
'' records 1ndica te t. Valeri Vladimirovich Kos ti 
traveled to Mexico, Fra ce, pain, the U.S. and Cuba 
during the. period 1959-61. In.1961, he was assigned 
permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and 
served there until August 1965. He was variqusly 
described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache. 
During this tour he attempted to cultivate a u.s. 
Government employee assigned to·our embassy in Mexico 
City• ~ I - 7 r i · • 
In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald,,.,----· 
approached ·the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt 
to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. 
Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa 
request. We have no information which indicates 'any 
relationship between these individuals other than for the 
purpose of Oswald~ s making his visa requefs·f.. 
Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of 
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned 
to the consular section and was a second secretary. It 
appeared that he was tasked with following _Fhe activities 
of the Central American communist partie~~,ahd left-wing 
gro_ups, and he met of ten with members of~ these groups , 
reportedly providing them with funds and technical 
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual 
TOY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family 
remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip 
to Havana. 
Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in 
September 1971. Our information indicated that he wa-s 
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at 
the time of his dep~rture, ~here was some speculation that 
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact. that
