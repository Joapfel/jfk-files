Mr. Aaron. Let me try another fix here because I'm 
not too_sure. 
64 
The oversight committee shall require the fiscal impact of 
proprietaries in the CIA's budget be·made clear in the Director' 
authorization presentation, or what phrase is that? In the 
Director's what? 
Mr. Kirbow. The ocr•s annual report to the appropriate 
oversight committee. 
Senator.Huddleston. The DCI's annual report. 
Mr. Kirbow. The Agency would not report separ~tely. They 
should make their pr~sentation a part of the DCI~s report 
to the appropriate oversight committee. 
Mr. Maxwell. While we are on that, could I, on No. 6, we 
have already, I thought, by statute prevented any covert action 
being funded other than by (a) appcopriation to a covert action 
budget, or (b) the contingency reserve. 
Mr. diGenova. That•~ right. 
Mr. Maxwell.Does that ·make No. 6 redundant? 
Mr. Kirbow. Yes. 
Senator Huddleston. The only comment I would make is 
that the other is not an accomplished fact yet. This might 
be accepted.and that might not. 
Mr. Maxwell. Well,· the reason I say that is that the 
way this reads, I would have or would be opposed to it because 
it provides an exception with the approval of the ll1'e·rsight
