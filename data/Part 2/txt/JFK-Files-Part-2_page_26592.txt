2. South Vietnam 
e. Yesterday it was announced 
that the carrying of firearms by 
anyone outside the security forces 
was forbidden until the elections 
are over. 
f. Some 3 1 000 reservists have 
been called up to protect the polls. 
Leaves are being ~ancelled and all 
security forces are maintaining a 
high state of alert. 
a. We now have a fuller ac­
count from official US sources of 
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain 
villages mentioned in Tuesday's 
Checklist. 
b. This account makes it clear 
that the earlier press versions, 
·which spoke of 1,000 missing vil­
lagers, were highly colored. 
c. Our present information 
is that the attack, in company 
strength, was successfully repulsed. 
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas­
ualties; government losses were six 
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.
