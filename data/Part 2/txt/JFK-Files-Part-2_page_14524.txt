WASHINGTON 25, D. C. 
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR 
The Honorable Robert Murphy 
Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Department of State 
\\1 ashingtonp D. C. 
Dear Mr. Murphy: 
Reference is made to your-. letter of 10 October .1955. r.elative to 
the problem of conducting surveillance of certain Latin Americ·an • 
nationals who might be suspected of carrying on: subversive activities· 
in the United States, direct~d against La.tin. American·c·ountries. In 
this regard you are correct in your understanding that the CIA does 
not conduct such surveillanc.es within.the confines. of the United States. 
Mr. I-ioover has furnished me a copy of his reply to your inquiry setting 
forth the FBI's jurisdiction and responsibilities in this matter-. 
111\.r e have been furnishing to the Department and to the FBI such 
intelligence information as·we have obtained through our operations 
a.broad bearing upon possible subversive activities of the type of per­
son ·you describe, as such il.iformation becatp.e available to us. • It 
would also be helpful if we could receive from time to time from the 
Department, leads which you may 1'eceive and which we could possibly 
ii follow up in the Latin Americ·an counti-y against which subversive 
activities are being carried on .. · 
In ord.er to assist us in developing our cc,verage of this field, we 
• would suggest that you designate someo.-ie in the,. Department ~ State 
'1Vho could confer with the appropriate· persons· in this Agency, and if 
you will let me know whom you will designate for this purpose, I \.Vill 
arrange to put'bim in touch.with my .representative. Aleo, if you see 
no objection, I will mention thia matter to the ··members of the· IAC 
as it is possible that the re,.resentati~es in Lat"fn Amerfc~a.~:·ortiie·-mem-
