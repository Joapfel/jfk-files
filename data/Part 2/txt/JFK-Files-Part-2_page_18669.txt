By memorandum dated June 24, 1975, you were 
advised of the Department's intention to make a closed 
Depa1;,t..men:t.al.-.f.i..le-available to captioned Committee. 
~file contained the results of a crirp.inal investigation 
conducted by the Bureau. The Intelligence, General 
Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were 
requested to furnish their views concerning this matter 
and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter 
to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position 
with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney 
General and other representatives of the Department concerning 
Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and 
submitted correspondence to the Department concerning 
this matter. It would appear additional communications 
to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is 
well aware of our position in this matter. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
We do not prepare a communication to the 
Department concerning this matter.
