~ Airways and Trans International Airways (TIA) objected to SAT 
operating any aircraft as large or larger than a 727 in the Far 
East. Saturn Airways objected to SAT bidding on any domestic MAC 
contracts. To restrict SAT to satisfy all potential competition 
could make SAT sufficiently unattractive as a profitable investment 
that financing could become unobtainable. With this in mind the 
Agency took the pos.ition that agreement for sale of SAT had been 
executed, subject to CAB approval. If the CAB ruled against the· 
sale and ownership reverted to the Agency, the Agency would cease 
any bids or service under MAC contracts and dissolve SAT. 
Two of the other supplementals, Saturn and ONA, expressed 
intere.st in buying SAT. ONA did not. make a cash offer. On June 2.9, 
1973, Saturn Airways, however, made a cash offer of about $2 million. 
in ex~ess of what Mr. Williams had offered. There were, however, 
.according to the Agency, compelling reasons not to pursue these 
offers. Agency office~s had reason to believe that ONA was not-as 
interested in actually buying SAT as they were in getting a commit­
ment from the Agency which could be used to compromise the. Agency's 
position in future CAB hearings. Three reasons for not accepting 
either offer were: 
a. Any merger with another supplemental carrier would 
necessitate a very difficult series of CAB hearings during 
which all other major supplementals would certainly voice 
loud and strenuous objections.
