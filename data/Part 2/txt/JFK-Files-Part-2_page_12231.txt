PASSING IN:b'ORMATION IN DOUBLE AGENT OPERATIONS

is frequently passed either to build up a double agent 1 s stature 
or as evidence of espionage activity. 
b. Each case must be carefully evaluated to make certain that a net 
gain accrues to the u. s. 
c. The information which is passed should be carefully handled and 
appropriate explana•bions created for its acquisition by the double 
agent to avoid his compromise. 
2. Locating information to pass 
Wherever possible ·bhe field office handling the double agent should 
locate appropriate information to be passed; however, the Bureau can 
assist in fulfilling requests for information in possession of 
Government agencies.

agent operation except:

or material related to the national defense which is passed in double 
agent operations. 
b. Such material should be appropriately identified by the double agent. 
c. Bureau Agents should not place identifying data on such material but 
should preserve any notes made by them in connection with the passage 
of such material.

passed which is considered evidentiary although not clear.ly related 
to the national defense. •

be obtained at a later date from the Government agency or private 
concern having custody.
