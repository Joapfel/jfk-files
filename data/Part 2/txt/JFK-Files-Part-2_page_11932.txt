and become -eligible for unemployment compensation. Whe~e un­
employment reguJ.a ti ons require listing of all sources of income as 
prerequisite for unemployment compensation and informants and/or 
sources who are being paid by Bureau fail to comply, situation· is · 
potentially embarras·sing. Bureau cannot be placed in position of 
condoning violation of state la;·r on part of any informant or source.

officials effect of unemployment compensation laws on paid informants 
and/or sources. Depending on local requirements, informants and 
sources must be alerted accordingly. •

possible need for informant to apply and accept unemployment compen­
sation to protect his security. Fellow members of subversive organi­
zation may be aware of his unemployment status and would expect him 
to apply. Where state requires notification of Bureau payments t~ in­
formants that would necessitate disclosure of identity, discontinue
