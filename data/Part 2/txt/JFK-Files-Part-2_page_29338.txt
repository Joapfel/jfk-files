The timing of the departures of Calderon and Proenza was 
pointed out to Mr. Phillips as well as the indications that 
they had met Oswald, had prior knowledge of the assassination, 
the nominal reason regarding Proenza over the Raul Roa note. 
He was asked if he knew if their:recalls were connected and 
if they were connected :with the assassination. He said that 
he did not know, maybe Calderon and Proenza had been lovers, 
but that may have been part of the disinformation, he just 
could not remember .which, fact or fiction. 
Mr. Phillips stated that it was very possible that HQ 
Cuban 
or JMWAVE could have recruited and run/agents in Mexico without 
the knowledge of the Mexico Station. Phillips said: "I suppose 
it would have been possible for an agent in Mexico City to 
be run out of JMWAVE station in Miami without my knowledge, 
but I would have been furious if I found out about it: .. He 
said that this may have even been "probable" in the case of a 
n 
"sensitive operatic/," but he pointed out that anyone doing 
that took the risk of crossing Win Scott who was close to both 
the DCI and DDP. This lead Mr. Phillips to say that if that 
was the case then the DDP, at least, would probably have 
approved the WAVE use of an agent in Mexico. We took Mr. 
Phillips through the documents on Ms. Calderon again and 
asked him if this could have been an instance such as that 
we were talking about. He said that it very well could have 
been but that he had no knowledge that would indicate that that 
was the case. He said that this was the kind of thing "they 
might have asked Barney Hidalgo to do." Phillips agreed that
