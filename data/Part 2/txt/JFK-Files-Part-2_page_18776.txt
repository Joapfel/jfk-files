Memorandum for Mr. Belmont 
RE: SAMJJEL .ADASON JAFFE, aka. 
105 ... 28333 
I 
: Background investigation of Jaffe was instituted as a result of 
his interview on 9 ... 12 .... 58. No derogatory information has been developed 
and it appears that all of his contacts with the Soviets have been.as the 
result of his news~gathering assignments. The New York Office, aware of 
the additional significance of Jaffe's former ass:(!cia_tion with "The 
Nation,'' since publishing the article en~1!7ie1!"!1i;" in the 10,,..18-58 
issue of this publication, has requested Bureau authori~y to maintain 
contact with Jaffe pending coverage of one remaining lead invo1._vzng 
review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA} records in order to receive 
information concerning the Soviets with whom he is in contaai and as a \ 
foll ow up of our 9-12-58 interview. • Q:} 
OBSERVATIONS: 
It is believed that we should allow New York to continue 
contacts with Jaffe and and it is possible that this pontact, if _properly 
handled, may develop a source of information of significance concerning 
I
. Soviet officials in New York as well as providing a possible source of 
• information concerning the article and general policy of "The Nation~) 
through such contacts as Jaffe may still have on the staff of that ,c 
publication. . . '-, 
RECOMMENDATION: 
. ' If you approve, there is attached ~ 1 etter to New York 
authorizing continuelcontacts with Jaffe concerning information of 
interest to us concerning Soviet officials and instructing New York to 
be -alert in their contacts with Jaffe to develop any opportunity that 
might arise toward obtaining information concerning the general policy>, 
and personalities that Jaffe may have knowledge of who are presently 1c \ 
connected with "The Nati on. " L,::J
