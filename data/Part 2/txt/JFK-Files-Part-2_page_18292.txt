7. When did the Department start reviewing and 
appr.oving the SI list? (Matters pertaining to the old 
Custodial Detention List were first referred to the 
Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were 
submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department, 
on a continuing basis, reviewed matters perta:ining to the 
SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower 
were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.) 
8 . Was there a form used by the Department 
concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals 
on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like? 
(Forms were utilized and copies have been obtained to 
exhibit to SSC Staff Members.) 
9. Do we have a copy of the form for including 
or deleting an indiv.idual from the AI? (FD-397 was 
utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be 
exhibited to SSC Staff Members.) 
At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members 
expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present 
and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better 
understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above 
indices and the KAP. 
ACTION: 
With your approval and in accordance with your 
previous instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact 
with Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nine 
questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC 
Staff Members .
