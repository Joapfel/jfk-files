A. September 
September 18 
Helms and Karamessines met with Kissinger at the White House. As 
Helms' notes of the September 15 meeting indicate, Kissinger wanted a 
plan within 48 hours. ·rn the meeting on the 18th, according to CIA 
records, there was little discussion of a military coup. Rather the 
conversation focused on "what economic leverage could be exercised in 
the Chilean situation .... " (Memorandum/Meeting with DDP, 18 September) 
The efficacy of economic pressure continued to be a subject of con­
cern during the last days of September. Apparently that pressure was 
viewed as another inducement to Frei to opt for the "Frei gambite u 
September 21 -
The 40 Committee met. The Select Committee has no confirmation 
that Chile was on the agenda at this meeting. Karamessines' calendar 
confirms that he attended; presumably Kissinger, the 40 Committee chair­
man, also attended, although the Committee has not been able to review 
his calendar. All that can be said about this meeting--and the meetings 
of the Senior Review Group, which Kissinger also chaired--is that the 
meetings afforded Karamessines and Kissinger an opportunity to meet 
privately and discuss Track II if they desired. In all these instances 
save the 40 Committee meeting on September 22, the Colll!llittee has no 
evidence to confirm that such a private Kissinger/Karamessines meeting 
actually took place. That the CIA prepared a memorandum of conversa­
tion for the private meeting on the 22nd but has been able to find none 
for other meetings may provide some support for the argument that no 
other such private meetings occurred.
