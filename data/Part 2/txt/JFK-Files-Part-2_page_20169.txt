~ ENNESS made a final plea for tfie indepen-
dent women to econsider. Th~ removal-of the independe~ts 
from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most 
independent representatives will be going back to their • 
own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations 
wh~ch haye no connection with the SvW. 
The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will 
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform 
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be· 
furthering abortion la~ reform. 
Independents vowed before leaving NY that they 
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an 
effort to prevent this. - ' 
III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL 
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE 
When contacted under pretext on November 24, 
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National 
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report, 
related that she has been actLve in WONAAC since its 
inception. EATON,_ while ~yerr1.ng she is definitely not a 
YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group", acknowledged 
there always have been SWP, YSA and 11radical 11 elements 
in WONAAC. She went .on to state, however, that WONAAC 
ha·s never allied itself politically with any organization 
or individual, including any of the political candidates 
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse 
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership, 
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only 
to the objectives for which it was originally founded. 
To t~is end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from 
whatever source offered.
