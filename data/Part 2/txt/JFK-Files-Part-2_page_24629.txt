RETURN WILL BE ALMOST IRRESISTABLE" (CIA Cable, IN 33499, - . • • 
Leopoldville to Director, 10/26/60). ·k Another general concern . 
at CIA headquarters was that £oreign powers would intervene in 
the Congo and bring Lumumba to power (CIA Cable, OUT 81720, Director 
to Leopoldville, 10/17/60). Similarly, throughout this period 
Lumumba was viewed by CIA officials and the Eisenhower Adminis­
tration'b', as a stalking horse for "what appeared to be a Soviet .. 
effort to take over the Congo'' (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 10, 45). 
During this period, the Leopoldville station continued to 
maintain close operational relationships with, and off_er aid to, 
Congolese contacts who expressed a desire. to assass.inate Lumumba*-;'d· 
although there is no direct evidence t.hat aid was provided for the 
specific purpose of assassination . 
. * A CIA Cable (IN 37289) from Leopoldville to the Di~ector 
on November 3, 1960 returns to this theme: the opening .of the 
Congolese Parliament by the United Nations is opposed because it 
"WOULD PROBABLY RETURN LUMUMBA TO POWER."
