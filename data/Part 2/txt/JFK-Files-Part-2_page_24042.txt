Don at the Joint General Staff headquartets and offered to 
surrender if he and Nhu were given safe conduct to an airport. 
Shortly afterwards, Diem offered to surrender unconditionally 
ani ordered the Presidential Guard to cease firing. Accordin~ 
to Conein, an escort for Diem appeared in front of the palace 
at 3:00 a.m., but Diem and Nhu were not present (Conein After­
Action Report, p. 24). 
At 10:30 a.m. the bodies of Diem and Nhu were reported to 
be at the Joint General Chi~fs' headquarters. Conein declined 
• to view the bodies because he feared that doing so might damage 
United States interests (Conein, p. 57). 
The details of Diem's and Nhu' s deaths are not known. -1, 
,·, Conein specualted that Diem and Nhu escaped through a tunnel 
from the palace and.fled to a Catholic Church in Chalon. He 
opined that an informant must have identified them and called the 
General Staff Headquarters (Cone in After-Action Report, p. 23). 
Another CIA source states that Diem and Nhu had left the palace 
the previous evening with a Chinese businessman and arrived at 
the church at 8:00 on the morning. of November 2. Ten minutes 
later-they were pt_cked up by soldiers and forced into an army 
vehicle (Cable, Saigon to State, Nri:-388). Minh originally told 
Conein that Diem and Nhu had committed suicide, but Conein 
doubted that Catholics would have taken their own lives in a 
church (Conein, p. 56). The Inspector General's Report states 
that on November 16, 1963, a field-grade officer of unknown 
reliability gave the CIA two photographs of the bodies of Diem 
and Nhu in which it appeared their hands were tied behind their 
backs (I.G,., C, pp. 43~44). The source reported that Diem and 
Nhu had been shot and stabbed while being conveyed to the Joint 
General Staff headquarters.
