WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION ACTION 
COALITION (WONAAC) 
IS - C (TROTSKYIST)

RePElet 2/28/73.

The Women's Nat.ional Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) 
has been the subject of a separate investigation by-t~e Bureau 
in numerous offices. In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed 
out that WONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with 
abortion rights and that i~ view of the fact the u,s. Supreme 
Court upheld the right of abortion# the continued investigation 
of WONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and 
should ba discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that 
continued investigation of the Sooialist \"lorkei•s Party (SWP) 
and its youth group, the Young Sooialist Alliance (YBA), should 
determine pertinent activities of VONAAC. 
After careful conside1--ntion of this ~atter, the Bureau 
agrees with the obse-rvations of the Philadelphia Office that the 
investigation of WONM.C should be discontinued. However, in view 
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a 
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General 
pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the 
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent info1'"l1lation relating 
to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned 
organization. • 
Therefore, recipients should close separate 
investigations concerning WONAAC. In the future, report above­
describsd infomation regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading 
in the SWP semiannual organizational reports. -
