MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP 
SUBJECT: Proposed New Covert Policy and Programs Toward Cuba 
As a follow-up to yesterday's Special Group discussion on the 
proposed new covert policy and programs toward Cuba, the following 
decisions have been made: 
On Item 1. of the summary from the Coordinator of Cuban 
Affairs, dated 19 April, additional planning and consultation is 
approved. This will include further refinement of the Rules of 
Engagement (in this connection, also see the minutes of yesterday's 
meeting); an assessment of the capabilities of specific groups; 
and an estimate of the scale and scope of activities which selected 
groups could carry out successfully. 
Item 2.a. of the above-mentioned paper is approved. To 
the extent possible, it is desired that the Special Group be in­
formed in advance of specific proposals under this heading._ It is 
recognized that this will in many cases not be feasible. 
Item 2.b. is disapproved. 
Further planning for individual elements of Item 2.c. is 
approved, with the understanding that targets will be justified in 
terms of their usefulness rather than with regard to the noise level 
they might generate. Specific operations will be referred back 
through normal channels (i.e., the Special Group in the first instance) 
for final approval before execution. 
Item 2.d. is approved. 
Distribution 
Mr. Johnson
