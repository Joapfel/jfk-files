1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to ~~ 
be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try ~_'(/Jv 
to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various · "tff,~ 
types of operations which will be discussed, al though it was ~ .f.1, 
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid (:l,.,.:: lv 
discussing the Soviet targe! specifically. I have recently_ ,, ;t,_'/ ! • \\ 
learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from materia 'J: 
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a serie~ /2 
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.s.u The infoJ-'-.i c,/· 
mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes. on t1-l "' 
s~: I J.

"Included among them are operations against the /' 
Czech Embassy, the UAR Embassy, the Chilean Embassy,-~ 
the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, the present 
Soviet Embassy, the planned Soviet Embassy, and the 
quarters occupied by the Chinese Communists in New 
York City." 
2. This being so, it ca~ be expected that the Staff will 
have brought this information to the senators' attention, and 
I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in __ 
pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination a;!,~fi~}"2- -S:y~-:;J
