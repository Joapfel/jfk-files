The EXDIR concurs with the OGC recommended option (1#5), provided that the letter is low-key and 
stresses that the pre-publibation review "obligation" is standard operating procedure. Additionally, he 
requests the opportunity td view the letter in draft. Thanks.

(Option 5. In lieu of a sJurity exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly 
mentions that they have ah obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to 
publish (related to their w9rk as Board members or staffers) as part Qf their obligation to protect classified 
infonnation. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this 
obligation (which we woul~ be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy 
agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.)
