Mr. Tovar. precis13ly what you wanted? 
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes. 
Mr. Tovar. I don ' t k110w the answer to that. I would 
assume that the criteria ~Ley applied here as best they could 
·, 
was when did he defect, whnn did he return, was he debriefed 
or contacted? In some caSE!S they hit one out of three, in 
other cases two out of thrEie. I think they. were giving the 
best correlation with your criteria that they could.

• Mr. ··Goldsmith. I undE'.rstand that. My point might be 
i 
then;

' were people in 1958 and '6:: when in fact they were not. I I 
Mr. Tovar. You are rj_ght. That is an incorrect statement~

Is your requesting memo heJ·e? 
m:ent. 
I 
That is not a very good state-
Mr. Goldsmith. Here j_s the letter dated April 6, 1978

which I show.you just ·for your information to show yo~ what thel 
Conmri. ttee was requesting fJ·om the Agency. Jf you will look ' 
I 
under number two. 
I 
I 
I Mr. Tovar. ·, Then this would appear to correlate with that. i 
You asked to indicate wheti.er the AGency from 'SB to '63 
interviewed or debriefed fc,rmer AmeFican defectors. So, the 
time they defected is not -t-he·operative consideration. 
Mr. Goldsmith. No, it. was not. 
Mr. Tovar. The .time c,f the debriefing
