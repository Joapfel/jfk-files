assassinating Cast~o. After the Bay of 
Pigs, a Cuba Task ~orce was established, 
first chaired by P~ul Nitze and then by 
Goodwin in his cap 1aci ty as White House 
Staff Officer. A~ a.meeting of the T~sk 
Force, held at th~ State Depart~ent, 
McNamara suggested: "getting rid of Castro", 
someone from the C:IA, perhaps Bissell, 
then asked if McNa~ara meant "Executive 
Action". McNamara
1 
responded that he did 
and stressed his ~nterest in the idea. 
However, Goodwin d1id not bring the topic 
up later in the me;eting after McNamara 
left. (See interview infra.) 
c. The Goodwin Documents 
The documents which M_r. Goodwin has furnished 
' • I 
the Committee are of no startling significance. One docu-
i 
I 
ment, the ~ay 2, 1961, memorandum from Bissell to Goodwin, 
! 
is noteworthy because it does dot advise him of the Roselli 
connecti6n or the efforts to aJsassinate Castro. Bissell 
notes, "I have not attempted to! provide you with much 
- · I • I 
detail." A May 24, 1961, Memorjandum of Conversation with 
Bissell by Goodwin does not mention any reference by Bissell 
to actions against Castro on tJe assassination front. An 
- I 
Arthur Schlesinger memorandum °If June 30, 1961, to the 
President discusses the need f9r revamping of the "intelli­
gence set-up 11 'of the United stlte~. In a footnote in that . . . I 
I 
memorandum, Schlesinger notes that the CIA is not 'able to I • . 
control its operatives once thdy are in the field and of 
the attendant dangers this posJs. (See page 6 of the memo.)
