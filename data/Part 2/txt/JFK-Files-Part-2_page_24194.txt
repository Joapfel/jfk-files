in concert with the original objectives of the pro­
ject.. In 1967 under the terms of the Katzenbach 
Report, it was necessary for the Agency to discon­
tinue its support to the bona fide U.S.\foundation 
(ostensible former owner of .the bank as· mentioned 
above) which had acted as a collection·agent for. 
the sale proceeds. Incident to the Agency's dis-
engagement from support of the foundation, the 
foundation was allowed to keep all proceeds from 
subsequent payments on the purchase price for the

This travel service proprietary \'1as sold in 1975 
to an Agency employee at the time of his retirement. 
This individual had ostensibly owned the firm but 
.in fact only managed it for the Agency. No agree­
ment was negotiated for the continued use of the 
travel service by the Agency1 however1 the Agency 
was using the travel service at the time of sale

Nevertheless, WUPESKY continued to provide cover 
for the Agency Employee until 1973.

programs in support of Government sponsored 
reconnaissance programs. In 1966, the Agency 
decided to terminate its proprietary relationship 
with. the entity arid it was detennined that, 
because of the charter of non-profit organizations, 
any proceeds from the liquidation would have to 
be given to other non-profit organizations or 
foundations. Accordingly, the plant and equipment 
were sold to a profit making corporation which 
created a subsidiary around the assets purchased. 
The proceeds of the sale were distributed among
