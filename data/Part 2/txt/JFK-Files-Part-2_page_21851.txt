Q_;_ And at that time, you knew who he was? 
Hedgman 1 I recognized him as an officer of the 
Agency.. I believe he referred to the 
fact that I had received a message and that he 
was the person concerned. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
pp. 15-16) 
The message carried by &-,;ttl~eb, then Science Advisor to 
DDP Richard Bis sell) was unmistakeably clear according to Hedgman: 
Hedgman: It is my recollection that he advised me, or 
my instructions were, to eliminate Lumumba. 
~ By eliminate, do you mean assassinate? 
Hedgman: Yes. I would say that was . my under-
standing of the primary means. I don't think it was 
probably limited to that, if there was some other way 
of doing it. 
~- Of doing what? 
Hedgman: 
threat. 
Of removing him from a position 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 17-18.) 
Hedgman said that he and (c~tt lieb) als~ .may have 
of political 
discussed non-
lethal means of removing Lumumba as a "political threat", but 
he said, "I cannot recall with certainty on that" (Hedgman, 
8/21/75, p. 28). 
however: 
Q: 
tne 
He clearly recalled the discussion of assassination, 
And what did ~r. (co~
0
tl~~b) indicate with regard to 
possibility of phy~ically 'eliminating him? 
Hedgman: It was my understanding that that was 
probably expected of me. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 18.) 
And again: 
Q: I take it that once you started discussing these 
lethal agents, there was no doubt in your.mind that 
the kind of elimination he was there particularly to 
discuss was killing Lumumba?
