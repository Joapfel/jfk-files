change was not being used for that purpose, but rather 
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

Most of the problems and differences between the 
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to· 
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always 
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any 
work through the legislative process. 
The independents stated that they were tired of 
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef­
fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards 
in the streets.
