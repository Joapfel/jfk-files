the man's fears ~ere well~founded and had promised to seek a 
,- * pistol. 
Although there is no direct evidence linking any of these 
pistols to the assassination of Trujillo, a June 7, 1961, CIA· 
memorandum, unsigned and with no attribution as to source, 
states that two of the three pistols were passed by Owe-n to 
Lorenzo "Himpy" Berry, a United States citizen who was in direct 
contact with the action element of the dissident group. It 
should also be noted that the assassination was apparently con­
ducted with almost complete reliance upon hand weapons. Whether 
one or more of t.hese . 33 caliber Smith ci Hesson pistols 
eventually came into the hands of the assassins 
and, if so, whether they were used in connection with the 
assassination, remain open questions. 
Both Dearborn and Owen testified that they regarded the oistols 
as weaoons for self-defense purposes and they never 
considered them in any way connected with the then-current 
I 
assassination plans. (Dearborn 7/29, p.70; Owen, pp.38,73) 
However, none of the Headquarters cables inquired as to the 
purpose for which the handguns were sought and Owen's cable 
stated only that Dearborn wanted them for passage to dissidents. 
(Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61) Indeed, the March 24, 1961, 
*Dear-bor-n is clear in his recollection thu.t he asked-Owen--to-­
request only one pistol. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp.30,31) Owen, 
on the other hand, testified that if his cabl~s requested three 
pistols for Dearborn then Dearborn must have asked for three 
pistols. (Owen, p.72) 
The pistols were, however, apparently sent in one package 
(HUS to Station cables,3/21/61 and 3/24/61) and Dearborn testi­
fied that, what he believed to be the one oun, came ''wraooed 
up" and that he passed it. (Dearborn,-7/29,p.30) _,
