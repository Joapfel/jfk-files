When Harvey later received Lansdale's August 13 memorandum, McCone 
spoke to Harvey in Elder's .presence, and "McCone made his views quite clear 
in the same language and tone ... that he used with Mr. McNamara." (Elder, 
p. 25). Elder testified that Harvey did not tell McCone that Harvey was 
engage in the Castro assassination effort at that time. (Eldei, p. 25). 
Elder also described a meeting he had with Helms in Elder's office 
shortly after the August 10 meeting to convey to Helms McCone's views re­
garding the subject of assassinations. Elder stated: 
( 5) 
"I t~ld Mr. Helms that Mr. McCone had expressed 
his feeling to Mr. McNamara and Mr. Harvey that 
assassination could not be condoned and would not be 
approved. Furthermore, I conveyed Mr. McCone's 
statement that it would be unthinkable to record .· 
in writing any consideration of assassination 
because it left the impression that the ~ubject 
had received serious consideration by governmen-
tal policymakers, which it had not. Mr. Helms 
responded, 'I understand.' The point is that 
I made Mr. Helms aware of the strength of Mr. 
McCone's opposition to assasination. I know that Mr. 
Helms could not have been under any misapprehension 
about Mr. McCone's feelings after th.is conversation." 
(Elder Affidavit, 8/_/75, p. __ ).
