November 27, 1967 
TO ALL AMERICAN \VOMENj 
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress_ 
\Vas a Yote against war. It was the first opportunity for a 
woman to vote because I \Vas the :first woman to be elected 
to Congress. 
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones \Vho 
must be concerned wit.h the needs and development of the 
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all 
human beings -- for those of the present as well as those 
of future generations. 
I will continue to struggle as long as I live. 
I hope all \Ydmen will respond to the following CALL, and 
join me in Washington on January· 8, 1968, the opening 
day of Congress. 
Q With highest hopes,
