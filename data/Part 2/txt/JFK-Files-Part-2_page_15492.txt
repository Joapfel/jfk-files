According to articles'~ri the.7/9 and 19/64 issues of '~he 
New York Times, " the· Japanese Government. is not· as strong now as in 
prece~ing years. Prestige of its .Premier, ·Haya to Ikeda, re-elected 
to a third term 7-10-64, has been damaged by inflationary ~rends that 
have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three years. His new 
cabinet has been called "weak 11 and "lightweight" due to his attempts to 
achieve balance aniong feuding elements in his own Libera"1 Democratic· • ., 
Party.

OBSERVATIONS: 
Industrially, Japan is the:'leading power in Asia and it wields 
con~iderable influence on lesser Asiatic countries. Capitulation by 
Japan to pressures of Communist Cnina could have significant effect on 
such countries,·possibly hastening· their own recognition- of Communist China 
and also the ultimate admission of Communist China to UN. We should do 
what we can to make available to State Department and other interested­
agencies. any information which would enable them to take appropriate 
steps. It is, therefore, recommended we secure State clearance for the 
development of live sources in Japanese official establishments in the 
U.S. This matter will be handled by Washington Field and New York Offices 
whose agents are expe~ienced in such.matters and can be relied upon to 
conduct themselves discreetly so as not to impt::~ril cordial relations 
\ presently existin& between U., s. and Japan., As a further safeguard, only
