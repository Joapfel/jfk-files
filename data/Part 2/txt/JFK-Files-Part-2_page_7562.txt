Dr. Durhin proposed a collaborative effort with .two of_)k.•. Hoskalev's 
• colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton weights~ but .. 
now do not have the time or interest to write up their material. Dr. 
Durbin has collected all of the 19th century and early 20th centnry 
human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material 
to ·the set. ~J1~it.~,~±esY-agreed to propose a joint article with his 
colleagues looking towards publication in an international. journal. He

as it could be copied. 
In the late afternoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided 
by Ralph Thomas; the californium scpnra t,ion facility guided by Fr.inc is 
1-icCarty; and the Hi-lac guided by Al Ghiorso. Dr. Moiseev, who is a

Services croup. Mrs. Low-Beer tried to fill them in on the duties and 
routine of that group. 
Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on ti1111;, 
such as cornrn.i ttees, etc. ran thoour,h all of the conversations. Dr. Ncnot.

such tools. 11It, is·coming", they said,
