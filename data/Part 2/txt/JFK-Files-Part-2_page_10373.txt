Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
• 
He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's 
office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding 
a review of this file by,FBI personnel. 
Not hearing from Mr. Latimer by the late morning 
of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. H,e was 
not available and I asked his secretary to have him return 
my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my eall 
and expla.ined that he had discussed my request with 
Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense. 
It was La.timer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to 
the White Ho~se to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen, 
Counsel to the President. Latimer promised that he would 
telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish 
contact with Hoffman. I again reiterated to Latimer that it 
was imperative the Bureau have access to the Shamrock file 
in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to 
its contents hoping to clearly-demonstrate that both the 
then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President 
Truman himself were aware of certain information contained 
in the Shamrock file. Mr. Latimer said he understood clearly 
what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as 
soon ~s possible. 
At 1 :·50 p.m~, 7 /25/75, I again called Mr. Latimer' s 
office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had 
stepped out of his office and that she would give him a 
message to call me as soon as he returned. • As of 4: 00 p_. m. , 
7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer .

ACTION:
