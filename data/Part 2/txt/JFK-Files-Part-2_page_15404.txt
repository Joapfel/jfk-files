' Df this total estimated-monthly cost, $126 covers cost 
of leased 1 ines in New York_ City .and the balance, $20,413,. the 
,prorated salaries of _personnel working the _plants.- Over one-half 
of the·estimated monthly expenditure covers techni9al surveillances 
which the Bureau would desire to maintain for its own intelligence • 
and investigative requirements, even in the absence of_ requests by 
State De_partment for the coverage . . The only two which do not qualify 
• in this res_pect are the French_ .Chancery and German Embassy coverage. 
J. 
During the _past six months two technical. surve i l_lances 
maintained under this _phase of captioned _program were discontinued. 
The coverage of the Cuban Consulate in Miami_ which was instituted 
5/20/59 was discontinued 7/15/59 because it was not _particularly • 
_productive.· From 10/5/59 t_o 10/12/59 technical coverage was main-_ 
.tained on the Iranian Embassy in Washington to supplement special. ~ 
coverage of General Timur Bakhtiar, head of Iranian Security Police, 
at s_pecific request of lvfr. Robert Murphy of State Department.
