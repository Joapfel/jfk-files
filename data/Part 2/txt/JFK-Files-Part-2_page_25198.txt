OCCURRENCE: COLBY testified as to the events surrounding the cable. from Saigon of 5 Octo­
ber 1963 which reads as follows: 11We do not set ourselves irrevocably against the assass­
ination plot since the other two alternatives rrean either a blood bath in Saigon, or a pro­
tracted struggle which could rip the army and the country asunder." And the response on 
6 October 1963 which COLBY wrote for MC CONE as follows: "MC CONE directs that you withdraw 
recorrrrendation to Ambassador concerning assassination plan under MC CONE instructions as we 
cannot be in a position to actively condone such course of action thereby endangering our 
our responsibility, therefore COLBY explained that this second rressag-e he drafted was to 
ellrn:lnate assass:ination as an alternative. COLBY stated that the assassination of DIEM's 
other br•others NHU and KAHN, NGO DlliH KAHN, were to continue. A reply was sent on October 7 
from Saigon in response to the MC CONE cable saying that action was taken as directed, rrean­
ing that the Arrbassador had been so inforrred to withdraw the recornrendation."
