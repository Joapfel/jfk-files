Dv.ring initial ." ·tages of dev·elopment and on occasion acti-v-e info:cma!!-ts 
may raise a perJonal question concerning their own position if it 
becomes known p-ablicl y that ·!;hey are affiliatecl with a subversive 
organization. In the ev~n·l; a potential informant or informant inquires 
as to what oan be done for him in such a case, he may be ·!;old that 
his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
ar,ises concerning his loyalty we vrill consider making the fac·t;s of his 
cooperation with the FBI known to his employer or to the responsible 
indi -vi duals. I·l; should. be pointed ou.t that ·\;his action mr-.y make it 
impossible for him to continue on behalf of the FBI and the service 
which he is performing fo:,,:· his country may be terminated. Before 
·baking stnps to advise i.i,nyone of a potential i:a-f'orma,11'1;1 s or inform~~nt 1 s 
oooperation, prior Bu:i.•eau authority inust be obtained. 
Specd.fically advise. each potential informan·h that he is no·i:; and cannot 
consider h:imsel.f a Bureau employee or ''undercover Agent 11 of the FBI. 
In this regard~ the seriousness of violating the impersonation statutes 
must be impressed upon the informant. 
Advise potential informant that his coopera·hion must be strictly confi­
dential at all times and if he should feel he cannot maintain this 
confidence he should so advise, There should be no doubt left in the 
mind of the informant that his relationship must remain on a confiden~ial 
basis and if he viola·tes i:;he confidence he will .be of no value and '- · 
so doing the Bureau's investigative activity may be jeopardized. ~- ·1 
re-, .. st be thoroughly h.~pres sed upon the informant before you accept h:::.,~ 
as such. If the informant has a special problem which wou.J.d require 
his revealing his relationship to his wife, etc., this should be learned 
from him during i:;he in:i.tial interview and a recommendation made to the 
Bureau when the results of the interview are furnished. The speed al 
circumstances will be taken into consideration by the Bureau. 
If i?, prospective informant is connected in any manner with a l, 
union, inform him that the Bureau is not interes·t;ed in employe~ 
employee relationships as such and is only concerned wi_th obtaL 
information on the infiltration in labor unions by subversive ele; ~s. 
"If ·!;he po·!::ential informant is a student, teacher, or has any simi.• ; .. 1.~ _ 
reiations with a school, college,.or university, in his initial i: ter7iew 
and subsequent handling~ be sure ·i;o follow current instru.ctions concern­
ing investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities. 
From the first interview with a potential informant through his develop­
ment and until he is discontinued, ext~eme caution should be used at 
a~l times to be certain he is not a p~ • nt, 
When po·tential informant begins to f,; ,lsh ·current information and 
otherwise qualifies for designation a~ informant~ assign permafient
