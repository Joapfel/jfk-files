SUBJECT: CSI Resource Request regarding JFK 
In Brian Latell's absence, I am providing the following response to the Exdir's questions regarding the 
request for additional resources for review of JFK documents: 
• 1. What is the size of the JFK declassification problem ? How much work remains to be done ? 
- An additional 40-50,000 pages of CIA records remain to be reviewed by 30 September 
1998. • 
- A large volume of documents are being referred to CIA by other agencies for review, 
including the FBI, State, and Presidential Libraries. The documents are either CIA-originated 
or contain CIA information. No figures are available, but we estimate at least 40,000 pages. 
- The JFK Board has also asked CIA to re-review approximately 130,000 pages of material that 
we released earlier to th~ National Archives. The reason is to determine whether 
information deleted earlier can now be released. 
2. How many people do you have working on the JFK project now ? 
- Following are dedicated to the JFK project: 
- - One staff officer (Project leader Barry Harrelson) 
- - 13 independent contractors (work 3/4 days per week) 
- The DO unit detailed to CSI to coordinate the review of JFK records rec~ntly added two 
contractors and may add more. 
3. What difference would X more make ? 
- The additional resources requested would allow us to increase the pace of the review of 
CIA documents and third agency referrals. Unless the pace is increased, it is highly unlikely 
that the Board's requirement to complete the review and declassification of all JFK-related 
records by 30 September 1998 could be met.
