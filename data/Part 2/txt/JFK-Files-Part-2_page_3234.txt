other evidence of the need to have someone with Spanish 
language capability immediateTy available at Radio 
Swan, were the following: A machine-run of Agency 
employees faifed to surface ·anyone with sufficient 
Spanish language to undertake an announcer's job; 
inability to exploit the fatal shooting of a Venezue­
lan child by a pro-Castro goon, could not be turne·d 
to US advantage; and by mid-November 1960 WH Division 
was requesting that a requirement be laid on to the 
Department of Defense for a serviceman with native 
fluency in Spanish who could be used as an announcer 
at Radio Swan.* 
* In the instance of the death of the Venezuelan 
child, the pro-Castro Cuban press was able to get the 
story out before it could be broadcast from Radio swan. 
The pro-Castro press claimed that the death had been 
caused by a counter-revolutionary. (Sources for the 
foregoing discussion related to the lack of Spanish 
lari'guage capability are listed in reference 22/.) 
The lack of Spanish language capability was felt 
throughout the project, not only in the propaganda ef­
fort. As late as January 1961, for example, the train­
ing facility in the Canal Zone was pushing Headquarters 
for the.services fora t¥o week period of·an Air Force 
sergeant who was fluent in Spanish. The training base 
wanted the sergeant to assist in briefing and debrief­
ing an infiltration team. The request was denied, how­
ever, because there was a greater need for the man's 
services·as an instructor at the air training base in 
Guatemala. 22a/ In another instance, a request from 
COB Miami for promotion of a clerical from GS-4 to 
GS-5 was based on the fact that "her services as a 
translator have been of the greatest importance to the 
Base since her arrival." 22b/
