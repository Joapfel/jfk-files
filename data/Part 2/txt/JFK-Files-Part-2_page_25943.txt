536 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS 
The C1urm,uN. \Vhat period is con.ired by the 23 gangland slayings 
that you make reference to'/ 
Mr. BnowN. From Ul28 through the present day. 
The CnArn:\L\X. In a period of about 30 years. 
::\Ir. Bnowx. Yes, sir. • 
. T)1e qn,rnnr,,x. And yon identi_f.\'. them as g,tngland slayings as 
rl1st.1ngmshed from the nsnal hom1i:1dc cases that yon hnve? 
.:\fr. BnowN. Yes, sir. • 
. The ~IUIIDL\N. On those, according to yonr testimony, it has bern 
1rnprif's1plc-or you lmvc !wen 1ms1w1:cssf11l, at lrast, in solving any 
of t\wm except ~lie_ onr that appeared so oln·ions 1 ai1rl it wonfa n~t 
possibly come "';thm_ the category of "gangland slayings"? 
:\fr. Hi:ow:-.. -Yes, Sil'. 
The CnAIR::'IL\N. But yon have included it as being the only one 
that w:ts solved. 
Afr. Tii:owx. That is rorrect. 
Senator Mns1rn,:. \Yhat arr the rl1:iradrristics of the gnngland slav­
i11gs that nrnkPs it so diflicnlt to :-olve them as contrasteclwith yo{ll' 
excrlk11t record in other homicidrs? 
~[r. BuowN. Of ro11rse, primarily it is because of witnesses who arc 
reluctant to girn the law enforcement anv information whatsoever. 
In some of oiu· killings-I recnll one whe1:e m~ had nine witnesses in 
the ro<:Hn and 110hody netnally saw the murder or knew anythin!! 
wasgomgon. 
~enator_ l\frrsmE. So this fact has a direct hen ring upon the question 
of 11nm11111t.y statntes, for cxnmple. 
Mr. Bnow:-.. That is right. That is correct. . 
. '.l'he CnAIR1\rA:'.',. This, in otlwr wonls, emphasizes the rigid disci­
plnw, the code of nmlcnrnrhl law, that cannot. he violated withont 
suffering the pc yofdeath. 
~fr. RnmvN. tis correct. 
The CnAIRl\L\N. In ollwr words. the nine who were in the room when 
the murder was committed, poss1bly every one of them knew what 
happened. . · 
::\[r. BnowN. Yes, sir; I wonld think so. 
The CnAinMAN. I would doubt that somebody did not knmv it. 
Rut, anyway, they know that the penalty :for them talking would be 
death. 
Mr. BnowN. Yes, sir. 
The CnAIR:'IL\N. Ev~n if they were inclined to, and I do not mean 
to s:i.y they were inclmed to, even if one of them "·e.re inclined to 
talk, he knows what the penalty wonlcl be. And thnt mnkes it 
diffic'.llt. That is whv yon ]rn~·e the ~rouble in the gangland slnying.,i, 
the silence, the threat, the mt.1m1dat10n of a denth sentence, of their 
being executed hy their underworld government if they talk. 
~fr. BROWN. That is true. -
Senator UusmE. Then, Chief, just to nail t.ha.t point down, they 
seem to be more than conrerne(1 and clearly are more concerned for 
themselv_es and for their allies than they are about immunity ngainst 
prosecnt10n. . 
Mr. BnowN. Yes, sir; that is true. They are n.fraid :for their lives. 
The CHAIRMAN. Very well. You may proceed.
