First, it assumes that Dulles himself knew of the plots, a 
matter which is not certain. Second, it assumes that Dulles 
went privately to the two Presidents--a course of action 
which Helms, who had far more covert action experience than 
Bissell, testified was precisely what the doctrine of 
plausible denial forbade CIA officials from doing. Third, 
it necessarily assumes that the Presidents would understand 
from a "circurnlocutious'.' description that assassination was 
being discussed. 
The chain of assumptions is far too speculative for the 
Committee to make findings inplicating Presidents who are not 
able to speak for themselves. Moreover, it is inconsistent 
with Bissell's other testimony that "formal and explicit" 
approval would be required for assassination,,., and contrary 
to the testimony of all _the Presidential advisors, the men 
closest to both Eisenhower and Kennedy. 
* If the eviden~.e concerning Pre1,i_9:ent Eisenhower's order 
to assassinate Lumumba is. correct, it should be weighed against 
Bissell' s testimony concerning ci1-cu.,,loc:utious briefings of the 
Presidents in the Castro case. First, the Lumumba case would 
imply that President-Eisenhower and Dulles did discuss such 
matters bluntly and not circumlocutiously. Second, the Lumumba 
example indicates that the President would discuss such matters 
openly in an appropriate forum, and would not need to be 
approached ... privately. Third, it can be inferred from Bissell's 
testimony in the Castro case that if President Eisenhower had 
told Dulles that he approved of the plot, Dulles would not have 
told anyone else of that fact ... ___ )'et Gottlieb' s testimony in the
