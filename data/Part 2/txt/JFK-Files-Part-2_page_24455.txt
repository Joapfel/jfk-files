Helms testified that he did not recall ever having dis­
cussed the assassination plots with McCone while the plots 
were continuing.; When asked whether McCone was aware of the 
assassination plots against Castro, Helms testified: 
No, it isn't my impression that I told him, 
at least I don't have any impression, unfor­
tunately .... Mr. McCone is an honorable 
man. He has done his mm testifying, and all 
I can say is that I do not know specifically 
whether he was aware or not. (Helms, 6/13/75, 
pp. 90, 101-102) • 
Helms further testified: 
J 
Q.: I believe Mr. McCone testified that he 
never heard of any of these attempts when he 
was Director. Would you have any reason to 
disagree with his testimony? 
Helms: Sir, I have always liked McCone and 
I don't want to get.into an altercation with 
him. He had access to Harvey and everybody 
eise just the way I had and he had regular 
access to the Attorney General. 
Q.: If you were a member of this Committee 
wouldn't you assume that Mr. McCone was un­
aware of the assassination attempts while 
they were underway? 
Helms: I don't know how to answer that, 
Senator.Mondale. He was involved in this up 
to his scuppers just the way everybody else 
*Helms testified that he first told McCone about the plot 
using underworld figures in August 1963. See discussion supra
