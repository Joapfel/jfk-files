together. Women are marching against the Pentagoh ,on April 
10~ With dignity and rage we march against the American

partnership between police and organized crime, which makes 
heroin a big business-----silently endorsed by those who 
'govern us'.· we march against politicians, hustlers and 
kickback men, whose corruption and crimes are paid for by the 
people. we march against the injust court system, and for the 
freeing of all political prisora-s. 11
