Mr. Wides. And what was their relationship to the Agency 
through you?

Mr. Sarno. They were paid a.gents. 
Mr. Wides. Some of tham received a fairly sophisticated 
training in tradecra.ft, in some cases communications,~·· • -
operations with regard to a station in Florida, and so forth, 
is that not correct? 
Mr. Sarno. Sophisticated equipment, yes, sir. 
Mr. Wides. And tradecraft, general tradecraft trainir.q? 
Mr. Sarno. General tradecraft ·training, yes, sir. 
Communications.training -- well, most of them ·weren't 
communicators, so they requirad very little if they did 
receive training. 
Mr. Wides. Would that put thsm in a little bit more 
official status of some sort, whatever the category is called, 
than simgJ.y being a paid informant? 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. They were just like paid infor"!!'l4nts 
excapt we provided them funds to operate with. 
They are no more -- they are not contract, we did not 
; 24 have them undi!r contract . ., 
25 Mr. Wides. But they would still get traininq?
