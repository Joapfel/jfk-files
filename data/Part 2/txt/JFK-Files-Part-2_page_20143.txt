Individuals known to be involved in lhe women;s 
liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis 
.. and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months, 
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the 
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement 
have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of 
the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active 
participation in the affairs of this group. While the 
May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by 
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be 
due to individual interest in the ~bortion issue .

• SWP INFLUENCE 
The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor 
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic 
of gene~al interest and concern to the membership of the 
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is 
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued 
interest.
