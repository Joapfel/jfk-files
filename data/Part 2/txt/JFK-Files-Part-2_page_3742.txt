Subject has additional growth potential as an intelligence 
officer and as.a ftrst echelon supervisor of individuals doing 
a basic intelligence t~sk. Ethnic origins, foreign language 
fluency and experience acquired to date generally dictates a 
career for Subject in the general arena of Greek operations. 
While the major thrust of Subject's career orientation should 
be geared toward Greece and its related problems, it is believed 
that :it is essentia.!: "tl,l~t.~.-011 a periodic basis, Subject be directed 
into non-Greek a:rea:s·0f interest, in order that the continued 
challenge of new horizons will stimulate Subject to develop to 
his full capacity. In practical terms, this means that out of 
any eight-:-year time cycle, at least two years should be spent 
by Subject on non-Greek or even non-European aff~irs. This 
officer has the potential to be a broad-gauged officer but he 
must be stimulated and led in that direction which will fully 
harness the totalitr of his potential. 
The rating officer would be pleased to have Subject work· 
with him at any other Field Station that might be entrusted to 
the rating officer.
