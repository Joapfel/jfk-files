T P SECRET 
you have any knowledge of it? 
Mr. Osborn. The first time I ever saw the Huston .Plan 
was in the newspapers. 
Mr. Wallach. Didn't Mr. Helms know that mail was being 
opened in New York in 1971? 
Mr. Osborn. Of course he did. 
Mr. Wallach. Did you know why Mr. Helms would h~ve asked 
the President for authority to open mail in 1971, then? 
Mr. Osborn. I have no idea. 
Mr. Wallach. Calling your attention to a memorandum dated 
February 16, 1973, captioned "Visit to Headquarters re~ 
~ ... " I will ask you to quickly read that over. 
Mr. Osborn .. I must have been Iden 18: 
Mr. Wallach. The first question would be, do you recall 
a meeting in your office at which you notified Mr. Issaeff 
I .. 
that the project would be terminated? 
Mr. Osborn. I don't think I dealt with Issaeff. I think 
I would have dealt with one of my people. But it could have 
been Issaeff. I don't know. I remember suspending it. 
Mr. Wallach. And do you remember telling Mr. Issaeff in 
words or substance that he should not tell anyone on the CI 
Staff that you wanted to tell the Director of the CIA Staff 
yourself'? 
Mr. Osborn~ I very probably would have. I had very close 
relationships with Jim Angleton professionally.
