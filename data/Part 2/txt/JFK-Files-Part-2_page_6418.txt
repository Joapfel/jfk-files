to expeditiously process these documents for declassification in oollaboration 
with agencies which have equities, and then aa:eision the declassified 
documents to NARA. Currently the Joint Staff is awaiting guidance from ARRB 
staff on which of the tabbed Colden we desire to have placed in the collection; 
upon receipt of that guidance, they will commence tleclassification review.
