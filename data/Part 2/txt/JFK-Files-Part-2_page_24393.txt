The Concept of "Plausible Deniability" 
Non-attribution for U. S. Government covert operatjons was the 
original and principal purpose of the so-called doctrine of plausible 
denial. ' 
' ! ' 
Evidence before the CommiFtee clearly demonstrates that this con-
I cept, designed to protect the U. S. and its operatives from the conse-
1 quences of disclosures, has been significantly expanded to: (1) mask 
not only Presidential decisionl but those of his senior staffeFs~ (2) i ' ' 
. I 
support less than complete advice to such persons regarding these op-
! 
erations. I . . 
The quest for "plausible denial" has shal'ted the processes of the 
U. S. Government for approving and evaluating covert actions. The 40 
Committee and its predecessors can serve as "circuit breakers" for a 
President, placing the locus of consideration of ccivert action at sev-
1 eral removes from the Oval office. One consequenc'e of the doctrine of 
I 
plausible denial is an incompl~te documentary record. 
The quest for "plausible l:lenial" has also led.to the use of cer-1 ' 
. I 
tain techniques, including euphemism and circumlocution.
