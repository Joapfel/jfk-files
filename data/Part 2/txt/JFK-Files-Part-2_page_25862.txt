the nbClrlive rebel invasion at 
the Uay uf Pigs in April, l 961. 
An equally bizarre episode 
months later gave the Justice 
Department its first clue to 
Giancana's negotiations with 
the CIA. 
The figures in this incident 
were a male night-club enter­
tainer and Giancana's girl 
friend, Phyllis McGuire, one C>f 
the singing McGuire sisters. 
At !he time, in Giancana':; 
opinion, the entertainer was 
overly allrnliv(' to l\-liss Mc-
Guire. . 
At Las Vegas, Nev., in 1961, 
sheriffs police seiz"J a prowler 
in the enlertainer's hotel suite. 
For hours, the intmder refused 
lo identify himself or say he 
was rifling the entertainer's 
rooms. 
Persistent questioning by 
sheriff's deputies, according to 
federal authorities, led to an 
admi~sion by the prowler that 
he was 011 the payroll of a pri­
vate detective agency in Flo:­
ida. 
Florida· authorities sought a:, 
explanation of the incident 
from the 0perator of the detec­
tive agency. At first, the opcr• 
a tor ref usc<l 10 uiscuss -l he 
matter. Finally, however, he 
Io I cI investigators to get in 
touch with !lie CIA. 
The inquiry then shifted 
from Florida to Washington 
and revc:ilcu Gi:1ncana's nego­
tiations ·with CIA, it was dis­
closeu. 
Government sources reported 
Thursday that the private in-
v::-,tir~alor's mission in the Las 
Vegas suite o~ ;i1e c1: ·~: ::i>~r 
was another riddle of Cii:mca­
