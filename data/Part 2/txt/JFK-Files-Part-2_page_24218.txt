accomplished without revealing ownership by CIA, CIA approved 
exploring the sale of SAT to its previous owner and current 
. nominal President, Mr. Stanley Williams. 
The CIA took reasonable precautions to assure that a fair 
market price was received for the sale of SAT, and that no short 
term windfall profit would ensue. The CIA was mindful of conflict 
of interest problems; and obtained independent professional advice 
and guidance prior to executing an agreement for sale. The sale 
price finally received by the· CIA exceeded the parameters estab­
lished by this independent study. 
In retrospect. it is possible that open competitive bidding 
for sale of SAT as a going concern could have achieved as much or 
more return to the U.S. Government for the assets of SAT. Howevert 
such assessment is only conjecture since this market was not fully . 
tested. Also this method of disposal had the potential for greater 
publicity and revelation of intelligence sources and methods.. In 
retrospect, the alternate.solution of dissolution of the corporation 
and sale of assets probably would have created less publicity but 
again this is only conjecture, since the SAT employee law suit may 
well have been forthcoming in any event. 
In conclusion. the CIA obtained a fair market value for the 
sale of SAT as evaluated by an independent professional appraisal. 
The legality of the disposal of Southern Air Transport by the CIA 
has been tested in court and has been shown to be fully within 
the statutory authorities and responsibilities of the DCI. The
