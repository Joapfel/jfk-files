ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN OUR FALSE IDENTITY PROGRAM. THIS 
PROGRAM ORIGINATED WITH OUR WEATHFUG ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, 
THE FRAUDULENT USE OF DECEASED INFANT IDENTITY PAPERS HAS 
EXPANDED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SECURITY WORK. SEVEN OF THE 56 
AGENTS ON SECURITY ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN FUGITIVE 
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ORIGINATE WITH SOME DEMONSTRATION OR 
ACT OF !ERROR, ETC, BUI AT THE PRESENT THEY ARE CLEAR CUT 
CRIMINAL FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE OF THE 56 IS INVOLVED 
FULL TIME IN THE HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION 
MATTERS WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AN APPLICANT-TYPE INVESTIGATION, 
BUT THE 163 'CLAS·$,I:FICATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY 
CLASSIFICAT?ONS. ~SUMMARIZING THESE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A TOTAL -. OF 23 AGENTS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO SECURITY WORK BUT ARE, IN 
FACT, NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTlGATIOfvS, 
LEAVING ONLY 33 AGENTS DEVOTING THEIR FULL TIME EFFORTS TO 
INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS PLUS, THE ABOVE MENTIONED 35 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENTS.
