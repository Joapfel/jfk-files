been released. 
The board has also been aggressive in identifying and acquiring significant 
assassination-related records that have been in the hands of private citizens 
and local governments. Just a couple of examples: • 
The papers of J. Lee Rankin, who was the chief counsel to the Warren Commission, 
have now been released through the efforts of the review board. Virtually all 
of the records of the prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw was also released. 
And I'm announcing for the first time today that the review board has just 
acquired the original personal papers of Clay Shaw. He was the individual 
prosecuted in New Orleans in 1969, the only individual prosecuted for the 
assassination of President Kennedy. That will add another dimension to this 
story. This is an example of his diary, which the board has just obtained, and 
will be released as soon as we can process the materials. It's very 
interesting. It's his diary from the day that he was arrested, on March 1st, 
1967 and his feelings about Oswald on that particular day.
