I had discusse.d his po,Jb:ible testimony before the Committee 
ij! r . 
with Chief Counsel, F~iii Schwart, and Staff Director, William 
11 • 
Miller. It is my reco~iection that we agreed that I should I .: 
attempt to contact Gi;h~ana for· the purposes of interview-
ing him in order to dei1rmine ~ether he would.have suffi­
cient information to warrant an appearance before the Commit­
tee as a whole. It is)ty memory that we did decide that 
'T he was • of sufficient i:~i·ortance to be interviewed by the 
Staff, i.e., for me to:interview him. 
During this same .p,~riod of time, I discussed with 
I .. 
Messrs. Schwarz .and Mi~ler wheth~r we should consider 
issuing a subpoena fo~.~r. Giancana while he was in the 
I,'· 
hospital. I made this:): suggestion because of an impression 
I had that Giancani wi~ ~ifficult ·to locaie. I should add ·I I 
'i: 
that I see absolutely rothing prejudicial or improper or 
'' 
discourteous in the is~uing of a subpoena, but rather ',· 
"I 
regard a subpoena as ~;valid method of obtaining testimony 
before a Congressiona~!committee. In any event, mt dis-
.. 1, I cussion with Messrs. ~qhwarz and Miller resulted in a 
1·,. 
decision to have me cdritact Mr. Giancana over the telephone

voluntarily and to ha~d me interview him if he so agreed. , 1·

If he did not agree, we would then take it before the Com­;'
