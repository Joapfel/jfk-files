American officials offered encouragement to the Vietnamese 
generals who.plotted Diem's overthrow, and a CIA official in 
Vietnam gave the generals money after the coup h~d begun. 
However, Diem's assassination was neither desired nor suggested

offered encouragement to the Chilean dissidents who ·plotted 
the kidnapping of General Rene Schneider, but did not desire 
or encourage his death. Certain high officials did know that 
the dissidents planned to kidnap General Schneider.
