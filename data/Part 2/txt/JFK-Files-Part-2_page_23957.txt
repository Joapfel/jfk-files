ton at least from May 10 through Hay 13, 1961.

Department personnel and with Richard Goodwin and Arthur 
Schlesinger of the l'lhite House staff. \'/hen testifying before 
the Commi tte·e, he was unable to recall the substance of

Goodwin cir Schlesinger concerning ·arri1s, either those which had 
been passed to the dissidents or those which were being sought.

White House, however, with the firr:1 impression that Goodwin had been 
reviewing cable traffic between Washington and the Dominican 
Republic and was very familiar with events as they then stood.
