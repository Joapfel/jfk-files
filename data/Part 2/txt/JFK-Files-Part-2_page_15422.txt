It is important-that we should select only those 
individuals Jor development as con,Jidenttal sources and possible 
subsequent interviews whDT!Fz.: we can anticipate from our invest i­
gat ions will be responsive to our requests for assistance. 
The Bureau feels that contacts with persons with other· than 
American citizenship and who have not displayed any loyalty -
to u. S. Government nor indicated sympathy with our • t nvest i gat i ve
