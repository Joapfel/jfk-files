the true name of his wife, (This photograph was brought back by 
RODRIGUEZ and returned to AMLE0-3). RODRIGUEZ then reportedly agreed_ 
to lead the infiltration mission, and personally contact AMLE0-3's 
family and the family of Jesus.GOMEZ Calzadilla in Guines, Cuba and 
take them to the exfiltration point. RODRIGUEZ also planned to bring 
out his fiancee, and the other boat crew members had agreed to bring 
out one or two relatives each, the total number of passengers was not 
supposed to exceed 15 persons. 
C. A~mando BLANCO Lorenzo, Romelio LOPEZ Sosa, and 
J\MBIG-4 wer.e recruited bY-RODR.I.GQ!ra.,fQr the mission, and supposedly 
AMLE0-3 did not have contact with them prior to"-t°he mission, nor were 
they witting that he was one of the sponsors of the mission. AMBIG-4; 
was to bring out his father, mother, sister, younger brother, and his 
own and LOPEZ's fiancees; BLANCO his wife and daughter; RODRIGUEZ, 
his fiancee, and the ·wives and children of AMLE0-3 and Jesus GOMEZ 
Calzadilla. AMLE0-3 has never been informed by his C/0 that AMBIG-4 
was ·a KUBARK asset, and AMLE0-3 has never indicated in any way that he 
knew AMBIG-4 was a KUBARK asset. Since the boat in question, the M/V 
ADA, was not equipped with a radio set, AMBIG-4 was obviously not 
desired for use as a radio operator by the group. 
4. AMLE0-3 informed the C/0 that he had previously warned his f 
wife that somel1iing was to happen the weekend of IU7!'!ay--"196~ana-tliat \ 
someone would be coming to see her with bona fides from him. ~s. 
AM!Jl:d-3 also was instructed to supply this contact man with all the 
pesos she had at her disposal, since the infiltrees reportedly were 
able to take in only $170.00 worth of pesos with them. SJ.pc.e_th~

trenches between the highway and the coast line, but the group could
