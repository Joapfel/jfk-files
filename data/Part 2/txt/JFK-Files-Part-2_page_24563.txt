to set out in full because of the manner in 1vhich it cap:t,urcs the di lern:i:1n posed 
by the evidence on tlic question of authority: 
''The Chairman. We also have r~ceived evidence from 
your '.;enior associates that they never pnrticipated in 
the authorization of an assassiriation attempt against 
Castro nor evet directed the CIA to undertake sGch 
attempts. 
We have much testimony establishing the chain of 
commjnd where covert action was concerried, and all of 
it has been to the effect that the Special Group or 
the Special Group Augmented had full charge of covert 
operations, and that in that chain of command any proposal 
of this character or any other proposal having to do 
with covert operations being directed against the 
Castro regime, or agiinst Castro personally, were to 
be laid before the Special Group A11gmented and were r:10t 
to be undertaken except with the authority of that 
group and at the direction of that group. 
Now, at the same time we know from the evidence 
that the CIA was in fact engaged during the period 
in a series of attempts to assassinate Castro. • -~~ 
Now, you see what we are faced with is this dilemma.,.-,:;)¾\''
