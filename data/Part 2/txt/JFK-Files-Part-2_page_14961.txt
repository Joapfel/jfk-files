Florida, (all in connection with organized crime matters} and 
the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters). 
Details concerning these installations were set forth in a 
summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the 
prosecution of Baker. dated 1/10/67. 
3 
'Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on 
Black, the F remont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to 
the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge 
who ordered that they be made available to the defense. These 
logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during Nove~ber, 1966, 
following which the judge ruled that there was no causal 
relationship between the information in the logs and the 
charges in the indictment. 
Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted 
on the Dominican Embassy installation.were similarly furnished 
to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a 
protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis­
cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers. 
Information as to the existence of these logs has been 
leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams 
to cause some action favorable to his client. His reporting 
to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak 
is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.
