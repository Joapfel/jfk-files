The primary recipient of Cuban assistance for 
armed revolution against the Belaunde government is 
the Movement of the· Revolutionary Left (MIR), a 
militant pro-Castro organization composed of some 
1,000 members and 3,500 sympathizers. ~~tween ,d.50

for initiating anti-government action, but th~ move­
ment is well-financed, well-armed, and well-organized. 
It has the potential for carrying out a subversive 
campaign of considerable disruptiveness. Luis de 
la Puente, the leader of MIR, has visited Cuba on 
several occasions, and is on good terms with Castro. 
Cuba has assisted other pro-Castro groups of 
lesser importance, but such assistance has been 
limited to guerrilla training. One such group, the 
Army of National Liberation (ELN), organized by 
Peruvian extremist students in Havana, has isolated 
bands of guerrillas operating in remote areas of 
the country. The National Liberation Front (FLN) 
is openly pro-Castro, and has sent members to Cuba 
for subversive training. Principal FLN leader 
Salomon Bolo visited Cuba last September. 
Castro-inspired extremists have exploited re­
curring peasant unrest in Central Peru for the past 
several months and they have been behind much of 
the illegal peasant land incursions which have oc­
curred there.
