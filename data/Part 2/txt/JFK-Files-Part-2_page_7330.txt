MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION 
DATE AND PLACE: 17 June 1975 1000 - 1100 
Room 2E-45 
SUBJECT: Conversation by Mr. John Waller, SA/DOO with 
Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's 
staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed 
Trip to Europe 
1. According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary, 
while not yet fixed, will be along the following· lines: 
a. 30 June - 1 July: London 
b. Monday, 7 June: Vienna, for one day 
c. Paris and Bonn. Although the order has not yet been 
determined, the Bonn stop would be two days and the 
Paris stop, one day. 
In the period between London and Vienna, the party intends to visit 
Oslo and Helsinki. The purpose of this part of the trip, however, 
has nothing to do with the SSC and the party does not want or need 
Sta ti on contact. 
2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the 
party should not get into specific operational cases. They want to 
discuss "more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations 
with the Embassy, problems, scope of liaison, operating conditions, 
etc. Their basic interests are related to "command and control". 
It had occurred to Aaron that Vienna would be a good example of a 
Station which concentrates on "East - West" operations ( read third 
country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations). He recognized London was a 
liaison station. Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to Cord Meyer.
