Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of it, are we 
correct that this is a document that was sent from the CIA 
station in Santiago to CIA headquarters purporting to come 
and purporting to be directed to Lieutenant 
General Bennett? 
Mr. Phillips. That is true. 
Mr. Schwarz. In the ordinary course to whom would 
such a cable go? And the second question, who would have the 
responsibility of passing information on to General Bennett? 
Mr. Phillips. In the ordinary course of events this cabl 
would have come to me where I was working in the sense of an 
info copy and this, that and the other. 
The action on this cable would have certainly have gone 
at least to Mr.Broe, and possibly higher, because it says, 
this is his message to the head of another government 
service. And so it would have gone to that level. 
Mr. Schwarz. And in the ordinary course it would have 
come to you first, and then it would have been passed on to 
19 either Mr. Broe or someone higher to take action? 
20 Mr. Phillips. For action -- not always. Sometimes a 
21 cable will come in and there will be more than one copy. 
22 And right away the action copy will go to the other fellow, and 
23 then you get the information copy, and so forth. 
24 Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of this cable 
25 whether there would have been more .than one copy?
