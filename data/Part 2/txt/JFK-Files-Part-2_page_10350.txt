-c. Tclephqne Intrusion Study - The objec-. 
tive of this current program 1s to aevelop a 
means-to utilize foreign telephone systems as 
a communication link without the kno,,·lcdge of 
the.host system. In order to carry out this 
objective, it .is necessary to learn the com­
plete supervisory s:j.gna.lling and· sequencing 
control system hierarchy for the various foreign 
telephone systc~s. Many of these arc patterned 
after the U.S. system and, for this reason, 
limited monitoring to test the operation of 
intercept equipment· in the United States is 
planned. The data to be collected would be 
merely the signal tones from which supervisory 
codes can be extracted. Message content is 
of no interest and will n,<;>t be recorded. ·over­
seas_ testing i~ plnnncd at a subsequent date. 
To date, some domestic testing of this concept 
has been carried out at the contractor's plant. 
No recordings hnve been mode of such data. Ex­
tremely brief tests cxer~ising U.S. and foreign 
telephone systems through supervisorj tone sig­
nalling have b6en carried out to verify initial 
concepts. The duration·of testing was less 
than one-half hour. 
d~- Other Sensor Testin~ - Examples of 
engineer1ng develop~ent tests of special sensors 
within tl1~ Uni tccl Stat'cs include infrared .and . 
high-altitude photography, forward-looking IR 
(FLIR) flights, laser scanners, industrial efflu­
ent sampling for isotopes, and airborne magne­
tomcte~ surveys for metal (rifl~s and trucks). 
In all these cases, the data o"utput of such 
.testing hns been used for engineering develop-: 
rnent rind the content has been restricted to 
dissemination to those in Government involved 
with the engineering de~ign.
