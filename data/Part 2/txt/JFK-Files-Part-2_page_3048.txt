former DDP responded to questions concerning J.C. 
•, . 
King in the following manner: 
Question: I.would like to clarify at 
this point J.C. King's relationship 
to the Bay of Pigs project. I have 
heard it on both sides -- that he was 
involved and that he was deliberately 
end,..run. 
Mr. Bissell: There.is no doubt in my 
mind that that was the case. I was 
going to say that both of the-things 
that you have heard have an element of 
truth in them. There was a deliberate 
decision fairly early in the game --
I doubt if it was as early as March 
• [1960. In fact,] I am pretty sure 
that it wasn't, [but] I am reasonably· 
sure that the decision·! speak of was 
made by some such date as June [1960] 
-- [that] Esterline would take charge 
.of this.Project and Esterline would 
have direct. • access to . me. He would. 
not be under the usual requirement of 
all the cases going through J.C. King. 
Now, as the scope of the scale of this 
operation increased, and with the passage 
-of time, Esterline's direct channel to 
me came to be more exercised; and there 
was frequent interchang·e between Ester­
line and myself that didn't go through 
J. c. King in the qense of a command 
channel. On the other hand, J.C. 
was brought into· all the consultations 
and was fully informed from the very 
beginning about this operation. His 
advice was sought arid given, and I 
. usually found it very good and followed 
it.· I remember no specific case where 
either J. c. King's specific advice or 
general attitude toward the operation 
was inconsistent.with, or in conflict 
with my own.
