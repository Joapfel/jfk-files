such a kind and of such magnitude that CIA proprietaries should 
be retained regardless of their competitive impact? Generally, 
the CIA believes that CIA operating proprietaries do not compete 
with U.S. private enterprise because they tend to do things which 
the latter are not equipped, motivated, or staffed to perform. 
For example, CIA proprietaries purchase weapons and foreign arma­
ments and technical devices; conduct security clearances; purchase 
real estate; insure uninsurable risks; train foreign policy forces; 
run airlines in remote areas or on connnercially unattractive 
routes. Would private enterprise do any or all of these things; 
It is true that private enterprise does a lot of ·similar activity 
under contract to the Government, including highly sensitive con­
tracts for CIA in technical intelligence collection and research 
and development. If CIA scrapped its proprietaries and coopted 
private firms, suitably cleared, would this be more desirable in 
policy terms? In economy? In .. operational flexibility? 
c. Relative scarcity of commercLal and official cover. The 
continuing push of CIA for nationals reflects the scarcity of U.S. 
Government official cover in many areas of the world, the develop­
ing desire of U.S. companies not to cooperate. 
Some question concerning profits have been raised. Does pro­
prietary profit constitute a sigµificant add-on to the resources 
available to·CIA? How is such profit treated in the budget? How 
is it controlled? How can the Congress.(or the President, for that 
matter) be sure that proprietary profits are not siphoned off to· 
accomplish projects not countenanced by the regular CIA budg~t?
