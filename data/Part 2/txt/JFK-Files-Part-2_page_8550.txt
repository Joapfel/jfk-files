(U) NE Division has highlighted this item. 
(S) The qeleted item is "The CIA quickly made contact 
with the Dalai Lama and a close relationship was establish~d. 
Financed and advised by Agency covert operators, he was .. ·." 
(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's .Secret 
Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean war was 
winding down, the CIA began sending intelligen~e agents 
into Tibet to ass~ss the situation and see what could be. 
done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the 
offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched 
by air and m~de contact with the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, giving 
him a channel of communication with the West. 
"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to 
avoid capture by the Chinese_ forces in 1959, he was 
• accompanied ori his flight by a CIA-trained radio operator 
who was able to keep Washington posted on his often 
hazardous progress." • 
(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA 
"close relationship" with the Dalai Lama and his being 
"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different 
from Rositzke's statement about CIA trained radio operators 
being with the Dalai Lama. These are two diff~rent 
comments with the first being properly classifiable and 
classified.
