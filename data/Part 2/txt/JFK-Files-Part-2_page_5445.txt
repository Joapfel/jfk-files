SECRET - WORKING PAPER 
New ARRB Review Process 
Marwell and I spent some time discussing how a new 
process would work. He would like to test the process for 
the April meeting. The following is a rough outline with my 
comments: 
1) HRG reviewers would review the documents the same 
as they do now (postponements would be blue highlighted). 
[no change in our procedures] 
2) ARRB staff would review the blue highlighted 
document. 
a) If they agree, they would stamp the document 
"ARRB approved" and return it to HRG to process 
for NARA. 
b) If they disagree they would highlight in 
yellow (creating green highlighting). If the two 
staffs cannot resolve the issue, then the document 
would go before the Board. 
[Major change: ARRB staff would no longer record all the 
proposed postponements, no DO damage review, no detailed 
determination letter requiring HRG reviewers to use the 
"grid" to determine what happen.] 
3) Non-issue documents would be sent to the ARRB 
staff when ready for NARA. At that time the ARRB staff 
would prepare a simplified final determination notice and 
letter to the Agencies. 
[ No action would be required; HRG would file the final 
determination notice with the document]. 
4) "Green" highlighted documents that go to the Board 
would be handled the same as today. 
[The expectation is that a lot less documents would require 
Board action. ] 
Comments: With some fine tuning, I think this process could 
work, and we would be able to complete the re-review of 
documents released in 1993 and 1994 by Oct. 1998. 
Completing the entire project will depend on how quickly the 
"non-related" material and the "addition records" are 
reviewed by the ARRB staff.
