In accordance with instructions received from 
the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750000 
from the J.aw :firm of Kantor, Shaw & Davidoffo Mr. Herbert 
Kantor is an attorney who a~ted as my counsel during an 
appearance by me before th~~te Select Committee on 
Intellig~nce Oper~tions in washing~ust12, 
1975. 
ATter notification by the Committee and the Bureau 
that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the 
Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have 
an attorney accompany me during my appearanceo I was also 
advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department 
of Ju~tice could provide me with counsel due to a possible 
conflict o:r interest on their pa:r·t o 
The matters to be discussed before the Committee 
involved onJ_y my prior official duties in the counter­
intelligence fieldo At this point, I strongly believed 
that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and 
the Bureau 1 s overrid5.ng interest, the most prudent course 
of act:i:on would iudicate the retention of' an attorr;1ey. I 
would like to advise you that much thought was paid to the 
selection of an attorney si::-ice conf'idential Bureau activities 
would have to be discussed wi.th him and it was felt that the 
person selected 1-,ould> in effect., be representing the Bureau
