MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of C~ntral Intelligenc~ 
Overflight of Cuba on l May 
l. Although it may, in fact, have little substance, the thought occurs 
that if Castro is seriously considering a "shoot-down" of a U-Z, from 
a propaganda standpoint he could not select a better time tha11 l May, 
.. • the t.raditional Communist holiday, and more significantly the Fourth 
;.•Anniversary of the "infamous" Francis Gary Powers incide11t. • 
Z. From a psychological viewpoint, identification of a new U-Z 
shoot-down with that incident on May Day four years ago might have 
considerable appeal to Fidel and might. conceivably influence his judg­
ment. in reaching a determination. to take su.'ch action. • 
3. Recognizing that this as~ociation is rather tenuous, it might 
still be worth considering a stand·-down of U-Z overflights on that one 
•. day. This would not seriously impair our intelligence effort and it· 
• would deprive Castro of the opportunity to exploit this rather unique 
circumstance should he .hav~ anyinclination to do so.a J<-r
