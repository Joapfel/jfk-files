COURSES OF ACTION 
(1) Continue the COAS/oc in being·under the Rio Treaty but 
take no further action at pryselit. 
Considerations: 
The Rio Treaty was invoked and the COAS/OC brought into being 
for the specific purpose of considering the October missile crisis. 
If the purpose is considered fulfilled, the COAS/OC shoulq. either 
be terminated or its authorization enlarged to deal with changed 
circumstances. 
(2) Under the Rio Treaty seek·· a ~resolution in COAS/OC which 
condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to endanger the peace, 
deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns the presence of 
Soviet troops and recommends continued surveillance and continued 
vigilance against subversive activities. 
Considerations: 
This would promote U.S. objectives vis-a-vis Cuba and would 
represent one feasible, approprite, immediate step following the 
conclusion of the U.S.-Soviet New York talks. 
Although the language would have to be negotiated, it is 
believed that unanimity or near-unanimity could be obtained. 
Recent statements by Cuban leaders calling for armed insur­
rection in Latin America would be exploited in this connection. 
It could be criticized for not constituting sufficiently 
vigorous action on the problem of Soviet troops, but it would put 
the OAS on record against their continu~d presence in the hemis­
phere and dramatize Castro 9 s continued military subservience to 
the Sorlet Union. 
( 3) Terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This 
would still leave COAS with its r ilities under Resolutions 
II and VIII of Punta del Esta ich provided for a Special Co 
tative Committee on Security and a Special Committee to study 1 the 
further suspension of trade.) 
Considerations: 
This step could be_ considered· logical, since the COAS/OC was 
called into being to deal only with the October missile crisis.
