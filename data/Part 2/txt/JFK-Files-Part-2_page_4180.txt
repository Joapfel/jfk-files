1f [&~o.-of ~~ bi~ jobs \lill be to ·pe~~uadi}our colleagues in Europe to 
~o do a better job themselves. If we maintain six divisions in Europe 
and they only maintain a force which will permit them to fight only two 
, ?for t.hree days - if we have sufficient force to fight and supply for 
ninety days and those around us can ohly fight for two or three days, 
then we should take another look. France carries their burden abroad, 
but not in Europe. \le should consider very hard the narrow interests of 
the United states as• well as the interests or t.he Free Vorld. If w 
grow weak economi'cally, our influence will grow less m.d less and if 
that happens, our Free World's position will grow weaker. De Gaulle 
is basing his whole position on the position or the United states. He 
can do this.because he feels we vlll maintain our military pover in Europe

in protecting Asia. If the Test. Ban Treaty is successful. it. will inhibit 
the Russians from starting a nuclear war end if so we should make every 
effort to conclude the treaty. But if the nuclear test ban includes only 
t.he Russians and the U.S. it is not worth very much.. We should support 
Foat.er all we can until we see where 1 t. is going. Ir we . get a successful 
treaty, we will fight it through if it vlll help us. (On the Hill~ 
Thanks for your cooperation. All worked well together and harmoniously~ 
Hope we can maintain the mutual relat.ions which have been so good in this
