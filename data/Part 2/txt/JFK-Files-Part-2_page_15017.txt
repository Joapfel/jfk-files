M.A. J·ones to Bishop Memo 
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
(3) .. On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and 
Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the A.dministration' s "Safe 
Streets and Crime Control Act''}-but with considerable changes. One amend­
ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police 
training--thU:s duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This ·matter 
has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine 
their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and 
add this to H.R. 5037. 
/ 
(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized 
\
crime field during this fiscal year. -~s?} 9-7-6_7~ a total~~ 38~!n~_~duals i!l

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith, 
former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well 
as their political affiliations, and the n•eed j:or electronic surveillances to cope 
with organized crime. Smith has extensive backg;round and contacts qualifying 
him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons 
as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime 
Section of Department. 
(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and 
Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker 
r,..,·,-.:.,.·c,,-~ 
Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs 
Frvice that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's 
activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys 
and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over" 
entire investigation. "Task force" was so inept that it "blew" the case against 
Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinha~t and 
associates. Although Reinhart' s gambling activities were across state lines from 
New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were 
brought to AG' s attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requesteq that "task force" 
be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction .
