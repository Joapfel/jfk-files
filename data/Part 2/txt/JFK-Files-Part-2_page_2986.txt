The Mexico City Station de,voted a major part 
\ 
\ 
-of its time to running or supporting operations 
against Cuba; 47 percent of its cable traffic con­
cerned Cuban operations. Mexico was the only ~atin 
Arneri~an country maintaining diplomatic relations 
with Castro and had the only direct air link to Ha­
vana. WH Division assigned top priority to recruit­
ing agents in plac.e in Cuba, and Mexico City Station 
not only ran its own operations but supported the 
tentative plans of other stations. 
The variety and volume of technical operations 
\ 
created a heavy work.load managing safehouses, listen-
1ng posts, and veh-i cles. - For photography_ alone tlle 
stat ion had six base houses commanding the en trances 
to target embassies, two mobile photosurveillance 
trucks, and three agents trained in photosurveillance 
on foot.• It was such projects that provided informa­
tion on the visits of Lee Harvey.Oswald, .President
