--The person who brought the letters to ~alaris, the 
supervisor of the summer employee who actually found them, 
vas known to be an Angleton loyalist, and Kalaris could see 
a trap unfolding in front of him if he mishandled the 
matter. The deliverer could be expected to tell Angleton 
just what was done with the letters, and Al\qleton to find

initial memorandum on this subject, the DCI &ent the mail to 
the Postmaster General under cover of a letter explaining

his own, to each addressee. The Postmaster General's letter 
referred to "apparent interception and acknowledged 
retention of this tnail by the CIA," and described the matter 
as "a serious violation of your rightia;" and "abuse of the 
lllails."* In due cou.rse some of the re.eipients wrote lett,ers

he had stumbled upon an overlooked vein of 
counterintelligence gold, brought the matter to Kalaris•s 
attention. HORINR.in fact had not been overlooked by 
Angleton, but this was not apparent at the time. The 
discovery of this folder led to a me~orandum to Nelson a few
