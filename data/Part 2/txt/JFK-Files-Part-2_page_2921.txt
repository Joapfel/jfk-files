General. It was during this meeting, which approved intensifying 
MONGOOSE operations, that McCone first shared outside the CIA his 
fear that the soviets might introduce offensive missiles into Cuba. 
His statement had little immediate impact. The experts unanimously 
and adamantly agreed that this was beyond the realm of possibility. 
McCone's conclusion that the USSR might put offensive missiles 
into Cuba was set in motion by the continuing influx of Soviet 
military equ'ipment. It was intensified by the arrival of Soviet 
personnel~ then brought to a.head by re~orts which suggested that the 
Soviet Union was preparing to install surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) 
there. 
Why, ask-d McCone, would the soviet Union place SAMs in Cuba? If 
the United States were to launch a military attack, the SAMs could be 
easily and quickly destroyed. The SAMs were not being put there to 
protect Cuban can~cutters; therefore, McCone argued, their real 
purpose was to blind the United States by deterring further U-2 
overfli~hts. This action would then permit the Soviet Union to take 
further steps which they could reveal at a time of their own choosing. 
McCone then asked himself what he would do if he were in 
Khrushchev's shoes. The United States and Soviet Union were balanced 
in nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems, but the USSR had a 
decided edge in intermediate-and medium-range missiles. These 
missiles could not, however, reach the United States from soviet 
launch pads. The USSR had not deployed these missiles outside its 
borders, presumably because they could be redirected against the
