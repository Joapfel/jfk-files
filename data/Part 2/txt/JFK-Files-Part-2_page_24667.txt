He ""classified 11the act of taking the kit to the Congo. . . as still 
·in· the planning stage'' (Bissell, 9/10, •P. 49). Bissell acknowledged, 
however, that the dispatch of poisons and paraphernalia with which 
to administe-r them was an: extraordinary event: 
. 
Tt would indeed have been rather ti.nusual to send 
• such materials -,- a specif.ic ld.t. . of this 
sort.-- out to a relatively small station, unless 
planning for their use were quite far along. 
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 37). 
Nonetheless, Bissell said that he "probably believed" that he 
had sufficient authority at that point to direct CIA officers to 
move from the stage of planning to implementation (Bissell, 9/10, 
pp. 60~61). In light of his absence of a specific re6ollcction of 
these events, he stated that "if it be taken as establishe.d that Mr. 
Gottlieb took specific instructions 'to implement,' " Gottlie1, 
would not have been acting beyond the mandate given to him by 
Bissell and it would show that the assassination plot "had then passed 
into an implementation phase" and that· "authorization was given" 
(Bissell, 9/10/ pp. 39, 41, 49).
