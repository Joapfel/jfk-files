(4) Poison Pills Are Prepared and Delivered 
to Cuba 
The Inspector General's Report described 
convi:::rsations among Bissell, Edwards, and C~Roosevelt, A/tcf7J ~ : 
Chief of the Technical Services Division (TSD), concerning 
the most effective method of poisoning Castro (I.G., pp. 23-
24). There is some evidence that Giancana or Roselli originated 
the idea of depositing a poison pill in Castro's drink to give 
the "asset" a chance to escape (I.G., p. 25). O'Connell 
recalled Roselli's request for something "nice and clean, with­
out getting into any kind of out and out ambushing", preferably 
a poison that would disappear without a trace (O'Connell, p. 116). 
'l'he Inspector General's Report cited O'Connell as stating that 
the Agency had first considered a 11gangiand-style killing" in 
which Castro would be gunned down. Giancana reportedly opposed 
the idea because.it would be difficult to recruit someone for 
such a dangerous operation, and suggested instead the use of 
poison. (I.G., p. 25) 
Edwards rejected the first batch of pills 
prepared by TSD because they would not dissolve in water. A 
second batch, containing botulinum toxin, 11did the job expected 
of them" when tested on monkeys. (I.G., pp. 25-26; O'Connell, 
p. 43) O'Connell received the pills from TSD, probably in 
February 1961, with reassurances that they were lethal,* and 
* Records of the TSD still extant in 1967 indicate that the 
pills were tested on February 10 and delivered to O'Connell 
sometime thereafter.
