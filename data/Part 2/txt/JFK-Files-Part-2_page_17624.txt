You pequ<;stecl an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct 
domestic intelligence investigations. 'The question .of the jurisdictional 
basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic 
Intelligence Division and ,.vill not be discussed .here. 
• It is fair to say_ that the domestic intelligence program is one 
of the more controversial areas of the· Bureau's activities. For one thing, 
an intelligence invcstigatfon casts a broader net than inquiries that are

is collected, much of \'1hich has no immediate bearing on potential offenses 
or offenders. But see1ningly trivial infor111ation may later become impo:::t2..nt 
in the dete·ction and p1·ev.m1tion of vi.olence or civil disor.cler. ·Th~re are 
also fears that these investigations m::ty eventually touch upon one's 
·political beliefs, habits or associations; or th'1!t information ~ollected for 
proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Goverrunent. 
Each is a legitimate concern. The notion of Governn1ent prying into the 
personal lives· of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a 
strong sense that the Government 1nust acquire necessary intelligence 
information if it is to 1neet its responsibilities in connection with the 
national security. 
One of·the n1ajor concerns about our domestic intelligence 
activities is that they are not supervised or monitor·ed by any outside 
agency. The claim is made that tho Executive Branch has beeh Jeft ,vide 
discretion to define its mvn authority, and to choose the directions, mct!·10ds, 
and focus of its invcsti~;ations.- For one thing;, the law has never made 
clear what facts and circtm1stanccs must be present to authorize an 
intelligence invcstig::ttion, nor how far such an investigation may lawfully 
proceed without being directed tov-lard proof of a specific offense .
