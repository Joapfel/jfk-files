c. Testimony of News Reporters as to Lansdale's Comments on 
the August 10 Meeting 
During the Committee's investigation, news reports concerning the 
August 10 meeting and Lansdale's request for a Castro assassination plan 
appeared in the press. Two of these reports were based on statements made 
by Lansdale to David Martin of the Associated Press and Jeremiah O'Leary 
of the Washington Star-News. In view of the apparent conflict between 
Lansdale.'s testimony to the. Committee and what Lansdale was reported to have 
said to Martin and O'Leary, the Committee invited these reporters to testify 
as to Lansdale's statements to them. Martin testified under a subpoena 
issued by the Committee pursuant to Senate_Resolution 21. O'Leary appeared 
voluntarily but stated the policy of his newspaper with regard to disclosing 
news sources precluded him from any comment going beyond that contained in 
a prepared statement he read under oath. O'Leary's statement declared that 
his news report "represents accurately my understanding of the relevant in­
formation I obtained from news sources." (O'Leary, page 5). 
We discuss below Martin's testimony and the news reports as they compare 
to Lansd~le 1 s testimony. 
(1) The Martin News Report 
Martin's news report stated, in its lead paragraph: 
"Retired Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale 
said Friday that acting on orders from 
President John F. Kennedy delivered 
through an intermediary, he developed 
plans for removing Cuban Premier Fidel 
Castro by any means including assassination." 
(Ex. 2 to Martin Affidavit) 
Martin testified that this lead paragraph was accurate and that it was 
a conclusion which he drew based upon the totality of his interview on ... , 
May 30, 1975 with Lansdale. (Martin, pp. 19-20) In contrast, Lansdale
