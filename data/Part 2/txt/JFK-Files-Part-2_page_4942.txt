DECLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS, AND OUR STRONGLY-WORDED • 
RESPONSE DENYING PERMISSION AND ARGUING THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE WOULD 
BE A BREACH OF TRUST. 
* 4. IN ORDER TO BOLSTER OUR POSITION WITH THE<JFK>BOARD 
REQUEST 1$TATION·! OBTAIN A HARD COPY OF THE (AUSTRALIAN_ DEMAR~ ON 
THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE MEMO. 
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE FROM~us~J WILL 
BOLSTER OUR ARGUMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE 
ACTUAL TEXT OF THIS(DEMARCHE)IN HQS. 
5. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT EVEN TO 
APPROACH THE~USTRA!'I~S]ABPUT DECLASSIFYING.THE AFOREMENTIONED 
DOCUMENTS. WE-HOPE OUR MEMO CONVINCES THE BOARD THAT, IN LIEU OF 
RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS, SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALL REFERENCE 
{p.USTRALIA) WILL SUFFICE. • . • .. 
6. FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF-THE BOARD TURNS.DOWN THE 
CONCEPT OF SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE 
1-\;USTRALIAiiJ DOCUMENT, EVEN IN .REDACTED FORM, WITHOUT [AUSTRALIAN] 
PERMISSION; FURTHER, THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND 
THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATIO!l, 7T WILL 
HAVE A .TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH.THE 
[AUSTRALIAN_S:ERVICESi IN SUM, OUR GOING-IN POSITION IS WE WANT TO 
• AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER WITH THE [AUSSllaJ THAT THE AGENCY MAY 
HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS. IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN 
OUR. INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEK~~ PERMISSION TO 
DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO so~ IN SUCH AN EVENT,_::Q_UR_LEGAL PEOPLE 
BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THE~USTRALI~ REFUSING 
PERMISSION WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT-TO-RELEASE THE 
(AusTRALiruiJDoCUMENT. • WE wILL KEEP You ADVISED oN ilow rnis Is -
PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS
