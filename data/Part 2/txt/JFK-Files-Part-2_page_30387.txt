Mr. Goldsmith. The r1!sponse that was provided to the 
Conunittee indicates that ~:he CIA had no standard precedure 
debriefing- returning US de::ectors. What was the basis for

that! 
Mr. Tovar. I don't k11ow. I can speculate only -- not 
having been there and.not having any involvement -- I don't 
know what mentality of thoi;e in charge was at that time. 
Mr. Goldsmith. What Hould your specilation_be? 
Mr. Tovar.. I would speculate that the contact with and 
debriefing, in effec·t the :;upervision of -Americans in that 
category would be FBI' s pr,~rogative and the Agency as a rule 
would not. have. had any bas:_c interest or reason to be involved~ 
unless there were a specif:_c counterintelligence concern .
