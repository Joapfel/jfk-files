ordinating and organizing group in support thereof, 
titled the 'Citizens Committee for Constitutional 
Liberties, are communist fronts. Created, dominated 
and controlled by members and officials of the Communist 
Party, the National Assembly f6r Democratic Rights and 
the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties were 
organized as propaganda devices for the conduct of 
'mass activity' in support of the avowed objectives 
-of 'reversal or nonapplication' of the Supreme Court 
decisions of June S, 1961, which upheld the constitution~ 
ality of the registration and disclosure provisions of 
the Internal Security Act of 1950 as applied to the 
Communist Party, and the Smith Act membership clause 
making punishable active and purposive membership in 
the Commun i.st Party."
