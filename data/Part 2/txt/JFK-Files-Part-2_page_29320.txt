photo and completes the visa application, 
'.stating that he would like to leave in three 
~t1Ve., days. He asks Azcue about how long it will 
take to get the visa. Azcue explains his 
• misconception to him, . an argument results and 
c;;v/7,,;;> Azcue throws Oswald out. \Duran feels sympathetic 
to Oswald, gives him ~CF '3'i:tdress) and promises \JJ/l,.

to help in any way she can..:¥ -she feels that 
\ Oswald should have been granted the visa with 
no problems and that Azcue's actions are wrong. 
Oswald calls the Soviet Consulate in an attempt 
to find out what has gone wrong with the arraing­
ment he thought he had. In Spanish, he asks for 
the Consul. He is told that the Consul is out 
and that he can 'be contacted between four and 
five on Mondays and ~days. G'his call may have 
been from Duran's pho~ . If it was he then told 
her that he could get hold of the Soviet he had 
his deal with and would she be kind enough to 
talk to him .. She said that she would and to 
come back at four o'clock. If the call was not 
made then Oswald got this message to Silvia and 
the same arraingments for Silvia's four o'clock 
call were made. 
Silvia Duran calls the Soviet Embassy. She 
tells the~ the American citizen, the one who 
wants a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia, is 
-~ 4 _:i:, there. She asks who he talked to at the Soviet 
, 1 I Embassy when she sent him there to get a Soviet 
\ &, t~..., visa so he could get an in transit visa to Cuba. 
She tells the official she is speaking with that 
the man seeking the visa wants to know with whom 
·he spoke because he had been assured that there 
7 
would be no problem. The man at the Soviet 
Embassy puts another man on the phone and Silvia 
goes through it again. He tells her that her 
call will be returned .. 
A Soviet Official returns Silvia's call. The 
situation is explained to Silvia. She realizes 
that she cannot give him a visa because of the 
delay on the Soviet end and the fact that he 
does not know anyone in Cuba. What does Silvia 
tell Oswald who is still setting there waiting? 
In light of subsequent events it was probably 
something that would keep his hopes up. 
Oswald goes to a party at Rubin Duran's with 
Silvia and two American friends. This may have 
heen, more iikely was, the night of the 26th.
