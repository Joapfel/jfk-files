I think it is . . likely that it might have been . 
the beginning of this whole idea on the CIA's part that 
they should develop such a capacity. And maybe they 
didn't have it then and went to work to develop it be­
ginning in August. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 61) 
Dillon said that it was unlikely.that formal notes .were taken at the 
meeting or preservedbecause it was a small "ad·hoc" group rather 
than an official body (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 18). Such interdepartmen­
tal meetings were 
11
not unusual," according to Dillon (Dillon, 9/2/ 
75, p; 20). 
The only officials Dillon. named as probable participants other 
than the CIA representatives were Deputy Secretary of Defense James 
Douglas and Assistant Sec'retary of Defense John N. Irwin II (Dillon, 
9/2/75, pp. 19, 21). Dougla~ stated that it was possible that he 
attended such a meeting at the Pentagon, but he does not recall it 
(Douglas affidavit, 9/5/75). Nor does he recall the question of 
Lumumba's assassination ever being raised in his presence (Douglas 
affidavit, 9/5/75). Likewise, Irwin stated that it was

that he attended the meeting to which Dillon referred; but he.did 
not remember whether he was present "at any meeting at the Pentagon 
where the question of assassinating Patrice Lumumba was raised" 
(Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, p. 3).
