To help maintain the discreet natu+e of the visit, it would be 
preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be· 
given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No 
deliberate contact should be made with the local press~ nor 
should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating 
officers are contacted by the· press. Local press publicity 
.pertaining to an SSC investigatio~ abroad would in almost all 
cases be distasteful to the host government.

discreet arrangements can be Diade for SSC visits to certain U.S. 
intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with 
senior officers within .the covering embassies. Such visits are
