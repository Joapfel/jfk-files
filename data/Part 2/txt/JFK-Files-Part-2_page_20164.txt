"A nucleus of about eight feminists 
, have formed FOCAS, Feminist 
Organization for Communication, 
Action and Service. FOCAS evolved 
from the Women's Strike Coalition • 
(WSC), which the Socialist 'Work~rs 
Party abruptly abandoned on May 
25th in order to form the committee 
for WONAAC. Since that time a
