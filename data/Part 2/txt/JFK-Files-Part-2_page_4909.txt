E. WHAT DO I DO NEXT? 
IF RELEASE OF YOUR NAME IS NOT A PROBLEM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO 
ANYTHING. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR NAME RELEASED, YOU NEED TO 
ADVISE US OF THAT FACT AND EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY RELEASE WOULD BE 
HARMFUL TO YOU AND NATIONAL SECURITY. WE HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST 
RELEASE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COVER MECHANISM WITHOUT SUCCESS TO 
DATE, AND WE WILL CONTINUE THE EFFORT. THE BOARD HAS NOT BEEN AND 
IS NOT LIKELY TO BECOME SYMPATHETIC TO A PRINCIPLE BASED 
ARGUMENT. 
F. IF MY NAME IS RELEASED, WHAT ABOUT MY COVER STATUS? 
THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOUR TRUE NAME 
AND THE AGENCY WILL HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY TO DETERMINE 
THE VIABILITY OF CONTINUED COVER PROTECTION.
