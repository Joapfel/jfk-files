SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
CIA-IR-34 -- Files of CIA officials/offices 
(U) IMS/ESG/HCS ran a computer search for 'OPI 40" 
files. This computer run was then made available to 
ARRB staff member Michelle Combs for review. Her 
review encompasses some 42 boxes from a variety of 
retired DDP files. The identified folders were gathered 
in an aggregate of seven boxes (including one that is 
exclusively microfilm and microfiche of so-calletj 
Registry logs) . 
(U) The ARRB staff member's review is about half 
completed. She has so far selected some 44 records 
totaling 123 pages to be included in the JFK 
collection. When the ARRB staff member's review is 
completed, the selected records will be copied and 
subjected first to a duplicate check by DA/OIM/JFK 
reviewers, then reviewed by those reviewers, then 
reviewed by HCS reviewers. 
(U) We have been unable to locate any "operational 
diaries" by William Harvey. 
CIA-IR-35 - Oswald related Information 
• (S) The surfacing of a report in the continuing 
Oswald 201 file attributed to IJDECANTER prompted the 
ARRB to request a review of that defector's 201 file. 
Certain such reporting records will be in~luded in the 
JFK collection as records in Oswald's 201. A Board 
request for an updated search of records for Oswald 
related material generated some 128 hits, which were 
reviewed by Ms-. Michelle Combs of the ARRB staff. 
Three records, selected by Ms. Combs and sanitized with 
her concurrence, were selected for inclusion in the JFK 
assassination records collection.
