CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION: 
The Cuban Government may have instituted new controls 
on fishermen, by eliminating night fishing along the north 
coast and by restricting fishermen to three and one half 
miles from the coast. A Florida law enforcement officer was 
informed by the former administrator of a fishing coopera­
tive at Isabela de Sagua that on 12 November it was rumored 
that no night fishing.would be allowed on the north coast 
of Cuba after 17 November. Reportedly, those who were fish­
ing at sunset were to anchor their boats or risk being 
fired upon. Another source received information 
I 
thirdhand • 
from an unidentified fisherman that in late November, Cuban 
fisherm~n were ordered. by the Cuban general staff to do 
their fishing between three and thre~ and one half miles 
from the coast. No confirmation has yet been received of 
these reported changes in fishing regulations. (CIA TDCSDB-
