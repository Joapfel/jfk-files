ment for heavy air support for resupply and possibly 
for military support as well. Indicative of the con­
fusion which surrounded this ·period when the concept 
was changing were Jake Esterline's remarks shortly 
following the_ collapse of the Bay of Pigs when he 
testified before the Taylor Committee. It appears 
as though Esterline had been informed -- incorrectly 
as it turned out -- that in his testimony of 1 May 
1961 Lt. Col. Frank Egan had indicated to the commit­
tee that the strike force concept has been in being 
since his EOD in June 1960.* 
In rebutting what he thought Egan's testimony 
had been, E.sterline reported: 
My recollection·'is that Lt. Col~ Egan, 
came to us about June 1960 and that he 
*. Egan h~d actually testified that following the 
Guatemalan revolt .he had been sent down to organize 
the brigade, and he stated that the number of Cuban 
trainees had been on the order of 420 on 20 November 
1960 and had risen to nearly 600 by the first week 
of December. 20/
