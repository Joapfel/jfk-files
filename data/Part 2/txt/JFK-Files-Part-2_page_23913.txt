Goodpaster and Gray: The responsibility for national s_ecurity 
affairs during the latter part of the Eisenhower Administration.was 
borne by Andrew Goodpaster and Gordon Gray. However,- there.was no 
evidence which raised the name of either man in connection with the 
development of an executive action capability. Both Goodpaster and 
Gray testified to having no knowledge of it. (Goodpa~ter, p. 11;• 
Gray, p. 56.)

by UCl 
Richard Bisse11 ·saiJ he was "q,uite certain" that Allen 
Dulles had full knowledge of the executive action project for two 
reasons: first, it "would.have come t_o the DCI's attention" at the. 
time of the transfer of William Harvey between components of the 
Agency to work on Cuban operations; 1' and second, llissell ''would 
imagine" it was. mentioned to Dulles at the initiation of the project 
(Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 35).· Bissell anu.llarvey briefed llichard He~ms 
on Project ZPJUfLE when he became-DDP (ll_issell, 6/11/75, p .. '.i3;' Harvey, 
7/11/75, p. 63) .. But Bissell did n6t recall briefing John MiCone'. 
about the project when McCone took over. as DCI (!Hssell, 7/17/75,: 
p. 11). McCone testified that he had no knowledge;of such i project 
(McCo_ne, p . • 43) .

within the parameters permitted by the DCI. But Harvey testifi_ed 
that officially advisihg the DCI of the existence of the prpject 
,·, Harvey's transfer to Cuban operations was no·t completed until 
late in 1961.
