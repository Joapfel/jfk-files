TOP SECRET 
untile that day, and announced both of us at once. So I was 
announced as of the middle of December as the future Secretary 
of the Treasury. 
That rather limited my capacity in the State Departraent. 
But I did continue for two or three more weeks to wind things 
up and make a proper turnover. 
And then I resigned from the State Department in January 
and continued that preparation for the new job. 
And that is how that happened. 
Mr. Baron. So you left the State Department -- you said 
earlier to me on January 2nd or 3rd?-
Mr •. • Diilon .. Or" 4th:>or·,5th- ,:,sometime oin the' first four::, 
or fiv: e or ·.six days~ ·_And after.:that one thing I ought to 
make clear is that President Kennedy had a great interest in 
the authority of the Presidency in foreign policy. And I 
think he was under the impression that Secretary Dulles had 
probably dominated President Eisenhower in some asptects, 
which I don't think was an accuare description of what 
happened at all, but it was a generally held one at that time. 
So he wanted to take over this very much himself. And so he 
put in some new people there. 
And we came to be very close, and worked very well 
together. And I had the greatest admiration for him. 
He never at that time or later ever asked me anything abou 
my experience at the State Department or any foreign policy
