I, think the meeting of September 15th has to be 
seen in the context of two previous meetings of 
the 40 Committee on September 8th and September 
14th in which the· 40 Committee was asked to look 
at the pros and cons and the problems and pros~ 
pects of a Chilean military .coup to be organized 
with UniteQ States assistance. 
(Kissinger testimoi:iy_, p. 5) 
AcCor_ding to the summary of the 40 Comrtti.-t tee meeting on Sep temb~r 
8, th~ following was discussed: 
... all concerned i;ealtzed that previous plans for 
a Phase II would'have to be drastically redrawn .... 
The DCI made the point,_ however, that congressional 
action against Allende was not likely to succeed 
and that once Allende was in ·office the Chilean 
opposition to him would disintegrate and collapse 
rapidly. While not advocating a specific course 
of a~tion, .the Director further observ~d that a 
military golpe against Allende would have very 
little chance of success- unless ·undertaken soon. 
Both the Chairman and the Attorney General supported 
this view .... At the close of the ... meeting the 
Chair_man direc_ted the Embassy to prepa_re a 11 cold­
blooded assessment" of: 
1) the pros and cons and problems and pros­
pects involved should a Chilean military 
_coup be organized now wit_!l U.S. assistance, 
and 
2) the pros and cons and problems and pros­
pects inVolved in organizing an effective 
fut_ure Chilean opposition to Allende.

Ambassa_dor Korry responded to the 40 Committee's request for a 
'"cold-blooded assessme_nt" on September 12. He stated that ''He Lthe 
·Embassy/ believe it now _clear that Chilea_n military will not, repeat 
not, ·move to prevent Allende's accession, barring unlikely situation 
of national- chaos and widespread violence.
