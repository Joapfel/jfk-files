did not inform either General Lansdale or the Special Group 
Augmented of.the assassination operation, either when he was 
explicitly requested to report to McCone, General Taylor, 
and the Special Group on his activities in Miami in April 
1962, or when the subject of assassination was raised in the 
August 1962 meeting and McCone voiced his disapproval. 
The Committee finds that the reasons advanced for not 
having informed those responsible for for,mulating policy 
about the assassination operation were inadequate, misleading, 
and inconsistent. Some officials viewed assassination as 
too important and sensitive·to discuss with superiors, while 
others considered it not sufficiently important. Harvey 
testified that it was premature to tell McCone about the 
underworld operation in April 1962, because it was not 
sufficiently advanced, but too late to tell him about it in 
August 1962, since by that time he had decided to terminate· 
it. On other occasions, officials thought disclosure was 
someone else's responsibility; Bissel~ said he thought it was 
up to Dulles·, Harvey believed it was up to Helms, but Helms 
remarked that Harvey "kept Phase II pretty much in his back 
pocket".
