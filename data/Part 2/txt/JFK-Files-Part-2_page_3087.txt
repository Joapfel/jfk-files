With reference to his action of 17 March 1960, 
President Eisenhower subsequently wrote: 
this result." Merchant then went on to review the 
bidding that had already been done, particularly in 
the Special Group, on the question of how to handle 
Castro, emphasizing, -of course, that State was very 
much concerned that precipi'tate action against Castro's

another s~t of proposals for QS action in Cuba to both 
Gordon Gray,. the Special Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs, and to Allen W. Dulles. 
Burke's· comments on the transmittal sheets to these

Dear Gordon: Enclosed is my copy of a

Arleigh Burke. 
To the Director of Central Intelligence he wrote: 
Dear Allen: Enclosed is a memorandum 
my Staff prepared containing some sugges­

work. Naturally, I do not agree with 
quite all the comments contained in the 
memorandum but I know that you will for­

uncovered. Warm regards. Sincerely, 
Arleigh Burke. •
