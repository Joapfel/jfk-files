Q And this particular Station, then, was under the 
supervision of the group we have been discussing? 
A 
Q 
Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations. 
\</hen did the \vestern Hemisphere Division resume 
responsibilities for the Miami Station?

Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western 
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Is there presently a Miami Station? 
Oh, yes. 
And how large is it at the present time? 
Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the 
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present 
time because we are in one of these periods where•we-are 
reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year 
there·'are going to be between 11 and 14 people. 
Q When you joined the group in 1963,_ what functions 
were being performed by the Miami Station? 
A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I 
think I have lined them out at one time -- collection of 
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this 
type of thing. Covert action. 
This is the list of things you gave me earlier in 
the deposition? 
A Yes.
