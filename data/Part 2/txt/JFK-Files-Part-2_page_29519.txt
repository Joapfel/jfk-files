attention did nqt have to do with the request f~r operational 
action, but because Oswald's contact was considered impor­
tant enough to merit his att~ntion: 
Q: Why would someone as 1igh up in the organiza­
tion as Karamessines iSk to be the releasing 
officer of this parti:ular cable? 
A: I can only surmise no1 that I might have thought 
or what several of us ciight have thou~ht _at 
the time, that since it involved somebody of 
this nature ~ho had tried to renounce. his citi­
zenship, whn was in· the Soviet U~ion, married 
to a Soviet, gqt out dith ·a Soviet wif~ pre­
sumably, which is very strange, and now the con­
tact with the Soviets, we could have a security, 
a major security problem. This was one way of 
informing· him and _gett.ing attention at the 
higher level. 593/ • 
Even though the CIA denies such an agreement (if it 
was in writing) that covered the CIA's investigation of 
American citizens in Mexico, this Committee is cer~ain, 
dn the basis of the above detailed evidence, that such· 
an agreement existed·, either formally_ or informa·lly. 594/ 
Hence, the assertion in the 1977 IG report that "Oswald 
. was not an· investigative responsibility of the CIA" 595/ 
is seemingly inaccurate and mislea~ing. 
This Committee has attempted to determine what 
action~, if any, were taken by the CIA's Mexico City Sta-
• tion after ·Headquar_ters res~ond.ed to the initial report
