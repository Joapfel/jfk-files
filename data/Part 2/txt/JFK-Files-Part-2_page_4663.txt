MR. HALPERN: I don't know if they were Vietnam veterans as such. I think 
they did not like what was going on in Southeast Asia. And the so-called 
Secret War wasntt a secret in Laos. It wasn't a secret war, for God's 
sakes. How could it be ~ecret if the press was writing about it? 
INTERVIEW: Sure. 
MR. HALPERN: It was the press that ~av~ it the name Secret War. The Senators 
and the Representatives, they knew what the hell they were appropriating·. I 
mean, at least the committee members did when they put down money into the 
budget, .and al 1 the budgets and al 1 that money was cleared by Co~gress. The 
CIA d9esn't print its own money for God's sakes. Somebody had to appropriate 
the money, and it was there. And as a matter of fact it was (what the heck is 
his name) Saltortstall. I think. 
INTERVIEWER: Symington? 
MR. HALPERN: Symington. I'm sorry. Symington was the guy who later got Dick 
Helms in trouble in '73 in front of the Church Multinational Corporation 
Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee and not his own committee. It 
was Symington, Christ, he reviewed the troops out in Laos. Bob Jantzen who 
was then Chief of Station, Bangkok, arranged for (I forget who the heck was 
Chief in Laos and ·vietnam>, but anyway, he went up to the Meo tribes and 
reviewed them and then he goes, "I never heard of .things like th i s . " What 
you going to do with them when they do when they do that? So, but that is 
much later. I mean, earlier than the Church Committee itself, the one we 
know about. But this was all background·in terms of, I think, it was the 
Vietnam war basically that·got people upset, the problem of the war.
