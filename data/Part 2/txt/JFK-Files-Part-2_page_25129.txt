OCCURRENCE: 
In SNIE, 53-2-63, on 10 July 11the situation in South Vietnam" the 
following quotation appeared: • "if -- as is likely -- Diem fails to 
carry out truly and promptly the commitment he has made to the Buddhists, 
disorders will probably flare again and the cn~~LL:..S of coup or assassina­
tion attempts against him become even better, . . . \re do not think . . . 
the commw1ists would necessarily profit if he were overthrown by some 
combination of his non-t'ommunist opponents. A non--t!ommunist successor 
regime might be initially less effective against the Viet Cong, but, 
given continued support from the U. S. , .C.Ql11cl. provide reasonably effec-
tive leadership for the government and the war effort." (1-2)
