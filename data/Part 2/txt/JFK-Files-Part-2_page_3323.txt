1. Articulation and transmission of opposition views has already begun .. 
Private opposition broadcasts (i.e. purchase of cor:L>nercial time by private 
individuals)' have occurred in Miami (medium. wave) and arrangements have 
been made with Station V{RUL for additional broadcasts from Massachusetts 
(short wave) and Florida (broadcast band). Presidents Betancourt and Ydigoras 
• have also agreed to the use of commercial stations for short wave broadcasts 
from Caracas and Guatemala City. CIA has furnished support to these efforts

through encouragement, negotiating help a~d providin.g some broadcast 
material. 
2. As the m~jor voice of the opposition, it is proposed to establish at 
least one "gray" U.S. -controlled station. This will probably be -on S\van Island 
and will employ both high frequency and broadcast band equipment of substantial 
nower. The preparation of scripts will be done in the U.S. and these ,.e __ ill be 
transmitted electronically to the site for b:roadcasting. After some e~-perience 
\ 
and as the operation progresses, it may be desirable to supplement the Swan 
Island st2tion with at least one other to ensure fully adequate coverage of all 
parts of Cuba, most especially the Havana region. Such an additional facility 
m.ight be installed on a U.S. base in the Bah2.:::nas or te1nporary use might be 
made o~ 2.. shipborne station if it is desired to avoid 11gray 11 broadcasti:i.g from 
Flor-ida.
