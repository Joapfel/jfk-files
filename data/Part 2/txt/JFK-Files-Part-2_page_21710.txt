title designation rather than the name of the individual because, 
so much time has passed, I have simply forgotten who it was 
in that particular era. 
who at that time was a member of the 'German 
branch of the Western Europe Division, he has since retired 
e.: 
and is running his famil~' usiness in New York. Certainly 
the then Chief of Western Europe Division, of which Germany 
was a functional part and the Chief of Operations of Western 
Europe should know. 
I would think that Jim Angleton, who would have had 
direct knowledge and always was the Chief of the CI/CE staff. 
The Chief of base in if in fact Pash conducted any 
activities in that area, certainly the Chief of base in 
would have been knowledgeable about it. 
/ 
Also, the Chief of base.a. hich was where we 
had 
Bill Harvy, 
Operation .• • 
peration goirig"'·on. I don't know whether 
s William Harvy 1 at that time was Chief of 
r whether he was simply running the 
tunnel, but Harvy might well have some knowledge of Pash. 
I would certainly assume that when we're talking about 
liquidations and that sort of thing that the Agency's overall 
Office of Security somewhere within it must have been involved, 
such German Division personnel as might be available today, 
West German, and I would also suggest that General Cushman migh~ 
I 
be knowledgeable for this reason. i
