The.Chief of Station concluded this cable with the following 
.,,,, 
cryptic.recommendation, reminiscent of his testimony that he 
_may have "~uggested" shooting Lumumba to Gottlieb as an alternative 
to poisoning (lledgman, 8/21/75, pp. 27-29): 
_IF CASE OFFICER SENT, RECOMMEND HQS • 
POUCH SOONEST HIGH POWERED FOREIGN MAKE 
RIFLE WITH TELESCOPIC SCOPE AND SILENCER. 
HUNTING GOOD HERE WHEN-LIGHTS RIGHT. 
HOWEVER AS HUNTING RIFLES NOW FORBIDDEN, 
WOULD KEEP RIFLE IN OFFICE PENDING OPENING 
OF HUNTING SEASON. (CIA Cable IH 289.36, 
10/17/60.) 
The first sentence of Hedgman's recommendation clearly refers 
to sending a.sniper rifle to the Congo via diplomatic pouch. The 
rest of the message is probably an oblique reference to the 
possibility of·shooting Lumumba at the "OPENING OF HUNTING SEASON" 
in other words, at the first ·opportunity to find Lumumba outside 
the residence where he remained in UN protective custody. This 
interpretation is bolstered by a report sent the next month by 
the Chief of Station through the PROP channel for Tweedy '.s "EYES. 
ALONE." lledgman' s cable describe:~d the s talerna te which prevailed from 
mid-September until Lumumba's departure for Stanleyville on 
November 27; Lumumba was virtually a prisoner in UN custody, but 
inaccessible to CIA agents and the Congolese:
