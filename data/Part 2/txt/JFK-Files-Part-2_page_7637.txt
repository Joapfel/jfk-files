Comment 
Mr. Wallach mentioned that Mr. Proctor (DDI) is a 
family friend and he wanted to make contact by phone. 
At the end of the day the reviewers returned the 
three files of other agency documents and offered their 
notes for review. It was agreed they would return on 
Monday to start reviewing files and that we would have 
at least 15 volumes ready for them. Mr. Wallach was to 
call on Friday to confirm our readiness.
