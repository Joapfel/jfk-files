1. Our reading your thoughtful 20 63 leads us to believe a 
significant difference of shadi_ng may exist on one crucial point (see

no power to delay or discourage a coup. In your paragraph 12 you say 
that if you were convinced· that the coup was ·going to fail you would of

any operation which, in your best judgment, does not clearly give 
high prospect of success. We have never considered any betr~yal

high prospect of success~ you should communicate ·this doubt to generals 
in a way calculated to persuade them to desist at least until chances are
