Today is august 2, 197u. _ am in u-;e city ·or ·neb-oi~, .. 01....1E-i; ... tth the 11:c .• C.!~.-. . 
here. A lot of us will be dead ~oon-very soon. The chief of Pigs in this city--· 
. . 
hurphy has conspired with the head of the F.B.~. 1 J. Edgar Hoover (Pig) to attack 
and destroy the me:nbers of the H.C.C.F. 4ere. At .this very mooent the 10th precinct 
.. l' • • . . • 
~ is and has been for two weeks-stock piling weapons, and when I say weapons, I mean 
ta11ks and half tracks and. all the conventional weapons of modern warfare to c!t tack 
\lhat they call the !'Panther Complex"--not ~ffice but complex. They (the pigs) have 
been tryi:ig hard to create an incident. First the news media co:nes ou~ with a'.lie 
that we have over 200 weapons and ove~ 100,000 round~ of ammunition.at this.office . . 
1 alone. This statement was made a week_after a mi.~or rebellion ~ent do'dll ·in an~rea 
know as Highland Park where the .Mayor stated after _occupying. the c6:l:!!lunity, shoot-. . :• . . . . 
ing and·beating ·Black people-uI don't know why the Black Panthers ".ant to pick on 
my little- city.fl When in actuality :i,t wa~ the people_ responding to _the racist mur­
d~r.=; of 2eop~~ at"_ th~ Kozy Korner ~r. ~'h-~ J?F.qt_her vas_ ~ho( a]te_r: an argun:~t en.sued_ 
·I _pecaus~. -~~-e· br?ther __ didn 't_ have,_ -f:ho ~oney_ for c!-~qr~.: The _brother was ~j.ac~-:-the 
f · Durderer was \../hite--the brother was unarmed. The people's response was; the b;ar waa 
; ... o~diately burn~ dow~ and niggas hit the streets. The Panthers _were the scapegoat.· 
,~ Lnen ¥.~ ~ent· i13:to the area to educate the people to the pigs tactics ¥.e Here immed­
iately arre5ted. 
About fom:- days ~go the people -around the office ·here on L-ldiandal~ b.U!lg-·poa..: •• -r 
ters and \1hen th; pigs attempted to tear them dow th.ey wer~ run a~ay; Then· ·the. pe~pi°~ 
got really uptight and began saying that this is their community, and they have_a 
1 ! right- to do '<lbe.t they want to do. So they changed the street" from Indiandale f.i 14th 
H to Panther. Ave. and Free R~d. They sang revolutionary'. SC?~&.S a!ld_ rapped ~~out.how -they_ 
-. le;ould li!:e thlll:gs to be for everybody. The fol101d.ng roorn~g a pig r1as shot at, try-: 
~S to S!leak up and pull down the sign. The N.C.C.F. \-:as blamed ir1!mediately, a few 
~: hours later a channel .50 news car was fired on in the same neighbo;rhood, asain the· 
·f : :?: .c.c .F. .:as blamed -- irnmcdia tely the area was surrounded by _pigi; of the 10th pre-
, cinct. They did this without pcr:nission from Pig Chief Hurphy. Th~y were about to 
attack t<hen_ 9rd1;!n. cam<;· ruid. they were ·:4ls~ruct~d no_t __ to ~ak_e _ a mov~ be~~l.Use _they_ i.cre: 
~ :tot equipped to handle -t:he situation. That they verc in reality about to be ·barbequed

because it just so happens th.at the people here relate to the Black Panther Party • ,; . . 
s.!.d.:~t°,uould be impossible to m~ve on. ~s_.without mov~& on•th!; "-'hole•\:Jei:;t Side."·•.Tbzl.Ps-
: \."r:y .:the 10th Precinct riz;ht now hao tanks and half tracks and .5-0 cal. machine guns--.

l to kill niggas. That's why today AugUGt 2nd, pig; have been going door to door tell- . 
. iI:3 people where to lay in: th.cir house llhen the attack comes. 'foey also stated that-. r . 
• if they were to come out on the street that they ~ould be killed: 
So this is no joke, thiG ie ~ar in the truest sense of the.word. ·Thin.-.is l;.be··:
