Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS 
On the afternoon of May 20, 1975, I briefly 
examined the Justice Department files on the Kennedy assassi­
nation, ranging from Febr~ary 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971. 
According to Mr. Keeney atjd his secretary who has reviewed 
these files in detail, they contain no memo from any State 
Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963~ Basically these 
files consist of lette:rsfrom citizens, some referred from 
congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination. 
Mr. Keeney's secretary referred me to several 
entries in these files re~pecting allegations by people who 
claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination. 
One claimed to have been a CIA agent. There are also many 
letters from assassination "nuts." Other documents relate 
to court proceedings to ·force FBI agents to testify in the 
Clay Shaw trial in Louisia.na. 
One document is an FBI report, dated February 2, 
1972, stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the 
FBI claiming he had information on. the John F. Kennedy 
assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in 
the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963. Kleist was not 
a State Department employe:e. . He appeared to be a free-lance 
magazine writer. •
