Dear Senator Scott: 
In accordance with your letter of 10 June 1976,,. we have 
ex-tended the period of the moratorium on the destruction of certain 
records which \'rere the subject of your letter of 27 January 1975 
in connection with S. Res. 21. The moratorium will expire on 
10 December 197G. • 
In acldi.tion, before any such records are destroyed., we 
shall transrni.t to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence copies 
of the record schedules which are submitted to the Natlonal Archives 
and Record StTvice for their approval prior to the destruction of any 
records. Tlte same will be done with respect to those routine 
administrative records which, although not involved under S. Res. 21., 
were ''-'ithheld from routine destruction during the life of that Resolution .. 
I am confident that suitable arrangements can be made for review of 
. document's before they are destroyed if this is the desire of the Select 
Committee. 
It is hoped that these arrangements are fully responsive to 
the wishes of you and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
as outlined to me in your letter of 9 June and Chairman Inouye's 
letter of 8 June to you. 
cc: Chairman Daniel Inouye
