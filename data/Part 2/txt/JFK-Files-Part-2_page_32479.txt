\ On J-~riua;y_ 31, I was visited by thetwo top Arn~rican ex-
! . , ecutives of a Braziliansubsidiary of a large Am.erican corporation.§ 
J They said that their firm, following a practice instituted some years 
! ago of periodically sampling worker sentiment in their plants•· had 
! just finished a small survey conducted very informally by trusted 
j BraziJian employ~es amo~g 55 or 60 of their semi-skilled workers 
_ i to discover how the latter would feel about the establishment in Brazil 
I of a communist system of government. The result of this survey was 
i so shockingly duferent from that of earlier pulse-taking that these • 
l executives th~ught the Consulate General should know about it. Eighty 
I percent of the wor_k~rs approached had indicated that while they'·. did not ; 
! pretend. to know much about communism, they thought they would be 
l better off under a communist regime than they are at present. Among.
