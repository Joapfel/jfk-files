~ Much more can be done with fuef­
co.ntaminants, particularly on jet and diesel 
fuels. Crews aboard Western tankers offer 
real opportunity for more vigorous program. 
Prime targets for hit-and-run teams based 
outside Cuba are CMQ TV and the Czech radio 
transmitter (believed now used to jam U.S. 
broadcasts). Attacks mounted only when 
operationally feasible. The G-2 micro-wave 
net should be dealt with when there are suf­
ficient assets inside to make sabotage coincide 
with a critical need, in August-September. 
This should be a concerted attack, as feasible 
in J~t, on power plants at Havana, 
Santiago, Cinfuegas, Vicente, Santa Cla.ra, 
Cuatro Caminos, Matanzas. It is of a type 
req.uiring detailed planning and special equip­
ment, and can be mounted from outside Cuba.
