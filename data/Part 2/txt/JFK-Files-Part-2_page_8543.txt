(U) b. There is no comprehensive readily 
available record of precisely what information 
has been declassified and released in accordance 
with the Freedom of Information Act and the 
Privacy Act; there are separate collections 
with a limited capability to retrieve some such 
information; • 
(U) c. There is no available record of 
the information that officials of the Executive 
Branch of government~ wiih authority to 
declassify information, have said or ·written 
in public either before Congressional 
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows, 
college symposiums, the general lecture 
circuit, other public forums, etc. 
In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee 
that those items which are still classified bf the' 
.DDO components have not been deliberately or 
inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as 
"official. public disclosure." 
(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A 
lists those items of the DDO deleted items which have 
been declassified by "official public disclosure." 
These thirteen complete and parts of four other items 
can therefore be released from the court injunction. 
(S) 4. Attachment B (seven parts) contains 
eleven deleted i terns (seven subjects) which are still 
classified but about which there may be some possible 
question. These are highlighted here so that 
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with 
due regard for all legal and poiicy aspects. 
(U) 5. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining 
items which the DDO components advise are still 
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amended and· 
cannot. be released from the court injunction.
