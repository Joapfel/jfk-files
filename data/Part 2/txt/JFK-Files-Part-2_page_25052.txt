Mr. Dillon. I don't really know. I do ~now in regard, 
to the U-2 flights, which had a very special procedure set up 
whereby a piece of paper had to be signed in each case by the 
Director of Central Intelligence, the Secretary of State, the 
Secretary of Defense, or Acting Secretary of Defense, and then 
taken to the President and approved by him before the flight 
could take place. And that Wci.S handled by General Goodpastor 
rather than -b'-lrough Vir. Gray . 
Mr. Dawson. Did that change after the U·-2 crisis? 
i·lr. Dillon. Ho, that was the procedure.

any more U-2 flights, and that procedure came to a sudden end. 
Mr. Dawson. In other intelligence operations which you 
brought up which were required to be brought before the 
Special Group --
Mr. Dillon. I don't recall that tl1ere were any. But if 
it was needed, I don't know who would do it, but it would be 
through the person who would know the most about it. And
