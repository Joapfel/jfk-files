------occuinffi"NCE: On 5 October there was a Presidential meeting on Vietnam, The only CIA participant was ~-
McCone. He provl.dcd the followl.ng .record, '111e meeting was held to discuss matters that 
became the subject or' nITTEL 5;311 (See later entry of 5 October.) r:cI said it was the 
opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, C11ief Fareast Division, that fiddJ:lng with 
the corr;noditY import progeam as a political lever would be much rrore likely to create 
an economic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu into a rrnre 
cocperative attitude, because it would seriously affoct the confidence and planning 
of the Vietnamese business conmunity and quicklY engender JnflatJ.onarY measures at lar•ge of a irorc serious nature. It was the concensus of the meeting that some neanine;ful 
political nnverrents had to be nude but exactlY what they should be was not determined.
