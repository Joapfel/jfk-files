. The article states the thesis that: the Middle East 
is· :;of paramount strategic importance to. this Country;: beca.use 
the Per~ian Gulf produces 27% of the world's petroleum ~nd has 
. proved global rese~ves of 60%;. In addition the Midea~t: is the 
·trade crossroads between Asia and Europe and an important· cultural 
·bridge between Africa and Asia and the center of the Islam world. 
The article expl~irts that,·21% of th~ oil used through­
out the world comes from the Middle East- and; since oil is in.;;· 
dispensable to ihdustrial and military pot~ntial it is no wonder 
th~t continued control of this resource is a majo~ focus of the 
Heste~n.powers .. It ad~s that if control of t~is oii_is irnportarit 
.to the West it is absolutely critical to the Ar2bs, since it is 
the only source of the cash needed to. break out of· the c:y,,~le oZ . 
underdevelopment.and poverty in which their countries are. trapped. 
• It po:i.hted out that .the profits frpm the qil go t;o .the ?1wr·ong·~,

two years with t_he oil removed • from Arab wells except for t:he ,
