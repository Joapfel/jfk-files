.in the Navy and Air Force versions,, and by use of common equiprpents 
and structures. 
To avoid any doubt as to the objective> I asked Deputy Secretary 
of Defense Gilpatric to write to Boeing and General Dynamics explai~ing 
fully my position 11 and asking both of them to rework their proposals in 
accordance with our requirements. That letter of July 13,. 1962,. 
explicitly established three conditions that had to be met before any 
contract would be awarded. These were: 
11 1. Satisfactic:m of both Navy and Afr.·:Force that a significant 
improvement to their tactical air capabilities is represented by the 
winning design. 
11 2. Minimum divergence from a common design compatible 
with the separate missions of the Air Force and Navy to protect the 
inherent savings of a joint program. 
11 3._ Demonstrably credible understanding of costs both for 
development and procurement of the complete TFX _weapon ·systexn,>.which 
\ 
costs must be acceptable in view of the capability added to our military 
strength by the weapon system. 11 
These three conditions are vital. They are the yardsticks I used 
in judging and weighing the two proposals -- Boeing and General Dynamics. 
They were constantly in my mind as I review~d the Fourth Evaluation 
Report. Rather than ignoring its advice, I relied heavily on its 
comments and conclusions.
