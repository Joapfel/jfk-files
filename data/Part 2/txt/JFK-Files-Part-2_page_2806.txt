Section D - Comments of Revfewfng 0ff1cfa1 !Continued~ 
ability to act on his own and get things done, he al~o has a decided capacity for working as a team member. 
While the Outstanding rating necessarily must be assigned spar­ingly, I believe ft 1s merited 1n this case. Mr. Kent d1d a really 
superb Job 1n the tens1on-f111ed days leading to the Chilean coup. Hfs performance and intellectual ab111t1es pl1ce hfm a~ong the top 
1oi of SA officers 1n the D1v1s1on and probably 1n the Agency. 
As far as future assignments are concerned, I believe Mr. Kent I/} 1s best qua11f1ed by expertence and personal 1nc11nat1on to handle 
staff jobs calling for a large measure of po11t1ca, and economic 
astuteness. The new Job he fs taking over 1n the economic section 
of WH D1v1s1on will test hfs talents, but I believe he has the growth potent~al to rfse to pos1t1ons of even greater respons1b111ty.
