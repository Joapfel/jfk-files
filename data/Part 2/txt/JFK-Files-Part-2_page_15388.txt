During past s.ix months potential weakness developed in thi.rd~ategory of this

deve.Iop live sources in official establishments of cer·tain defined friendly 
co_untries we found such officials reluctant to approve interviews with 
• persons we desired to approach in this· connection, often citing as reason for 
refusal the fact that a friendly country was involved, which of course was 
known at outset. On 6-2-59 we discussed this problem with Robert Murp~y who 
said he did not know we had been having this problem. tind would appreciate our 
contacting him on these matters and, depending on each individual case, he 
would make the determ.i nat i ono We a.r·e .now handling these matters directly
