(4) In all instances there must be clear showing, by overt acts or 
statements or other evidence, that there has been continuing 
sympathy for aims a.ml o'b.jectives of Cuban Governmon·t since 
10-1-60. Citizenship status must be clearly established. 
c. Pro-Cuban activity 
All individuals in security index under basic criteria (item 3a, 
abJve) should ba tabbed "Pro-Cuban" if by their activities and sym­
pa.thie s they warrant sp,3cial cons.ideration in event of limi tcd emer­
gency involving Cuba ana U. s. This tabbing includes Cubans and non­
Cubans who have engaged in activities in. s·a.pport of Cuban Government 
or pro-Castro groups. For this tab':>in,'t, submit FD-122 to Bureau with 
notation "Pro-Cuban" typed opposite words '~iscellaneous (specify)." 
Attach page containing concise summary of facts supporting recommen­
dation. Security in1ex cards sent to field on such subjects contain 
letter "C" en left side of card at baginning of second line. These 
cards are not kept in "Cuban 11 special section but are tab'!>ed with 
metal tabs . 
d. Evaluating interviews for security index status • • • 
(1) Positive statem-ant to interviewin.i Agents clearly indicatin.~ ad­
. herence to doctrines, aims, or purposes of revolutionary organ~ 
ization or front organization shall be considered overt act. 
(2} Other than above, interviews are not factors in making determi­
nation as to security index; e.g., lack of cooperation or partial­
cooperation are not factors. 
e. Effect of resort to fifth amendment· 
Depa.rtm-ant has ad·v-ised resort to fifth.amend:nent by witness appearing 
before goverlinantal body should be considered overt act within security 
index criteria (1) when subject was asked ·directly concerning present· 
membership in subversive organization and (2) when que~tion calls for 
response as to past membership in organi;z;a.tion in those cases in which 
available information would se-am to bring subject within criteria ex­
cept for overt act within required period. 
f. Activity in Nation of Islam and other black nationalist extremist 
groups 
Departm,ant has ad-v-ised Nation of ];slam constitutes potentially danger­
ous inst~umentality in event of national emergency; statements and 
activities of individuals in Nation of Islam indicating anarchist and 
revolutionary beliefs should be considered in making judgment.as to 
whether or not member should be in security index. Give particular 
attention to developing and reporting such statements, including vio­
lent and revolutionary statements made by -other members in subject's 
presence. Statements should be reported in detail. Apply these in­
st~uctions to other black nationalist ext~emist groups. 
Recommendations for and preparation of security index cards 
a. SAG must personally recommend inclusion in and removal of any name 
from seaurity index except in offices having more than 1,000 s~curity 
index sub,jects, where recommen1ations can be made by SAC, .A.SAC, or 
Bureau-approved security supervisor. 
b. Where potential dangerousn,ess of subject has been established, office 
of origin is to submit recommendation to B0.1reau on form FD-122, in 
triplicate. Forward original and copy to Bureau, and place copy in 
s-abject' s file. Nothing should appear on FD-122 which is not in sub­
ject Is file. FD-122 has two uses: (1) to recommend subject for 
security index and (2) to submit changes for existing cards; Submit 
abstract when recomm,3nding; subject for security index but no abstract 
for additions, deletions, or changes. 
o. When FD-122 is sub:nitted to r!lcommen-1 subject for security index, attach 
a.dd.itional page or pages setting out succinct su·.:nmary of facts on which 
recouun-:?ndation ba.sed. Facts must be in sufficient detail to support 
recommendation, including justification for designated priority leve_l 
for apprehension. Statements of conclusion arc not enough and origi11al 
sources must be characterized as to reliability. Su;nmary must show 
pertinent data of subject's activities.
