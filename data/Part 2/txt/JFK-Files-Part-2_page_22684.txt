the FDI. 
So I called Bill's house, and I asked his wife, is Bill 
around? 
And she said, no, he is out to dinner·tonight. 
And I said, look, we have some very serious trouble. 
Would you please tell me where I can locate him: 
And she said, he is at Duke Zeibert's. And I called 
Duke Zeibert's and I managed to get him. And I turned the 
phone over to Papich, because I did not want to be on the 
record showing that this was Angleton, et cetera. 
And Papich talked to Bill, and actually I didn't hear 
the discussion. It was something about, I ~ill see you 
tomorrow. 
And Sam told the surveillance and all the other people 
to forget it, and the Headquarters would take over. 
And that is my knowledge, direct knowledge of what 
Anderson and everybody else has stated. 
Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Angleton, to your specific knowledge 
did Bill evei attempt to use the excellent contact he had in 
Havana to carry out the mission of eliminating the leader down 
there, or try to get any help out of him in that regard? 
Mr. Angleton. He knows that I would have cut his throat. 
Mr. Kirbow. That would have jeopardized your entire 
contact with the Israeli's? 
Mr. Angleton. Yes sir.
