that would be General Goodpastor, because he was very close 
to the President, although he was a relatively junior officer 
at that time, he was a young colonel -- I think he may have 
even been a major when he started there in the White House. 
But he was sort of Staff Secretary to the President on all 
those relations with the Pentagon and the CIA and the State 
DeparLLlent. If you wanted to see the President on something 
important, it was generally through General Goodpastor rather 
than through Gordon Gray. And Gordon Gray handled most of 
the detailed mechanics of setting up meetings, and that sort 
of thing. He was not as much a personal assistant to the 
President. And that job was held by General Goodpastor. 
Mr. Dawson. But in circumstances where the President was 
going to be made aware of attempts to overthrow a government, 
in front of a number of people like the Special Group of the 
National Security Council, were you privy to some of those 
occurances? 
Mr. Dillon. I don't ever recall one. 
Mr. Dawson. You don't recall instances where an attempt 
or discussion to overthrow a government or anything more 
sinister than an assassination was brought up? 
Mr. Dillon. No, except the discussion of ppeparing a 
capacity to invade Cuba. That was considered. And we have 
the minutes on that. That was considered a number of times 
and reported a nuBber of times.
