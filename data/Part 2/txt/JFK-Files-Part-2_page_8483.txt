. Classified SECRET; describe. intelligence sources and

CCS files, in April 197~ the DCI was asked by ~n NBC 
reporter about CIA spontorship of Fairways Corporation 
in connection with a pl~nned TV documentary on Agency 
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but 
there are indications that the DCI may have responded 
to the question in a manner which could have be~n con­
strued as admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways.

sponsorship of Fairways was considered still cl-ssified 
as recently as December 1976. NOTE: The DDA/Air
