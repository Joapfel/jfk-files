RE: ·DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNI rrD S'.: ~\·::t, PG1.,ICY 
IN VIETNAM; WASHJN~~:N, ~: , JANUARY 15, 1968 
CONFIDENTIAL 
TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self­
critical about not working for the programs the younger women 
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long 
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January 
20th at Mt. Zion Bapti.st Church in Seattle at which the 
Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation, 
however, that the women working on the program were all very 
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a 
satisfactory programo 
On Monday, January 15, ]968, the delegates including 
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in 
Washington, DC, It was learned here that the instructions 
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were 
evidently for the California group only, because many California 
people had been badly beaten in pre~ious demonstrations and 
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The 
official pattern was differento Mimeographed sheets headed 
"Jearre-i-te Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were 
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions. 
A rPpr2duction is at~ached.

·.,,..., • , The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a 
Mrs~UP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money 
usually received from wealthy c~~:t_;j..butors had been collected 
by Mrs. BACYUP. Reverend HAROLIY'BASS of Tacoma collected ·, • · • ~

(STUDAMIRE)~ RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized 
her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months 
,,,..pregnant. 
After the demonstra~!on, HEALY and RADER spent much 
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some­
thing about the sraTus of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from 
New Yor.k did inc}ude a paragraph rrom the ·paper the Washington 
Sta:te delegation submi tte·d ·to Congress. This was entitled, 
"American Indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been 
prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom i~ carried the 
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation 
from Washington State)." 
RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the 
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING, 
Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.
