(AIOU) The Board has meetings scheduled for 13-14 
March, 2-3 April and 23-24 April. I recommend that we begin 
discussions with ARRB staff as soon as possible with the 
goal of having the memo ready no later than the.2-3 April 
meeting. It is important that the DO continue to develop 
evidence on the individuals who are scheduled for review in 
May. The worst possible scenario is not succeeding with the 
new proposal, and then not being ready to defend those 
individuals who truly need to be protected.
