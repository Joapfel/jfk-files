By letter dated 5/14/7 5, with attached app~n, i, es·•; ~­
the SSC requested certain information and documents from ,;;, 
the FBI. ~ 
Appendix c, Item number 10, requested all memoranda 
and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison 
Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late 
1972. 
.Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney 
General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for foFwarding 
to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt, 
7 /14/72. On page 2 there is information that 11our close • 
association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top (l·t: .·;;. 
officials has resulted in that agency providing support in ,·1:,,,/~ 
some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking ~~Jt 
to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence ~ 
activities in this country. it This ,c.ould possibly be construed 
to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening 
of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC reque·st and 
future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will 
address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector 
Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings 
in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on 
,6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about. ~"7
