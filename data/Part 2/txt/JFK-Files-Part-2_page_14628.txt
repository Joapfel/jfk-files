ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 
ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN 
Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested 
I 
the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individua.ls 
reportedly associated with the boxing industry. Severa.I 
of these names were duplica,ted on ~- prior request· for a. 
name check by Sena.tor Kefauver' s Committee. It a.ppeared 
tha.t the Committee might .be conducting a. fishing expedition 
• 
' 
by submitting such a.n extensive list.· Accordingly, the 
matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's 
request. 
On Ma,y 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief, 
Orga.nized Crime a.nd Racketeering Section, Crimina.l • 
Division, telephonica.lly advised that .following a. contact 
with the Kefauver Committee on tha.t date the origina.l 
request for name checks on 304 individuals ha.d been 
reduced to a ~equest for name checks on 30 individuals. 
Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out tha.t where a.ny 
individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such 
as Fra.nkie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau 
to sea.rch its files concerning tha.t individua.lo Mr. Hundley 
also advised the Committee representatives tha.t it would not .. 
be possible in every instance to make name checks on a.n 
expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted 
inasmuch a.s the time fa.ctor in making the name checks would 
. depend upon the nu.111be·r of references involved. Mr. Hundley 
is sending a. memora.ndum to the Bureau in the immedia.te 
future listing the names which the Committe~ has now 
requested be checked. 
Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing 
the names, the names will be checked·and appropriate summaries 
prepared. •
