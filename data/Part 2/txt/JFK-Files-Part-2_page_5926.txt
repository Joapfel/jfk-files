SUBJECT: ARRE Request for Access to Indices to CIA 
Histories 
R:::FERENCE: A. JFK Boa::::-d Reaues t No . CIA· 7 , 
dtd 9 Nov 1995, item# 6 
B. CSI -0307 /05, dtd 20 Feb 199 6, same subject 
1. Per your request, I have reviewed the list provided to 
me of all histori.es produced unde:r the CIA History Program for 
release to the Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRE). 
?..egarding equities that concern the Office of the DA, r reviewed 
pages 38 through 48 and pages 51-54 and have no probla~ granting 
access to the list except for those noted on page 40, 42, 46, 
and 48. If this list is to be provided unclassified, then the 
station names as marked would need to be redacted. If this list 
is to be provided classified, _.t.he DA pages may be passed without 
sanitization. 
2. Is the ~~~RB allowed to request access to any Agency 
document if unrelated to the JFK Assassination? We could be 
setting a precedent if we grant the ARP~ access to see this 
entire list. Potentially, the ARRB:could request access to any 
nu.-nber of Agency documents totally unrelated to the JFK 
Assassination (i.e. 201 files). 
3. If you have que·s tior.s, I may be :::-eached on ex tens ion 
30554 secure.
