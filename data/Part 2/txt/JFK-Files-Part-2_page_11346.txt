SECURITY INVESTIG.11.TIOI. 
Thus, in discharging o~r ~asic respnnsibilitie; in the internal 
security field, it :i.s ilaperative tl -:.t inform<1.tion concerning members¥ 
of the military service6 be reforrc1 immediately to the anpro- \ 
priate branch having primary responsibility for its personnel. 
This proced~re is mandatory, eve~ tbough the security aspects of 
the data have not been fully resolved or verified. It should 
be ipocifically pointed out in such instances that the infor-
m~tion has not been verified. 
Section 87D Sb of this manual instructs that if it is determin~d 
a security subject is a member of the armed services the in~esti~ 
gation must at·that point be discontinued immediately and reported 
to the Bureau. The basis for such instruction lies in the fact 
that the subject is no longer withip our investigative juris­
diction. In addition, dissemination of pertinent reports must 
be made locally in the field to the appropriate intelligence 
agency. 
Our responsibility with re.gard to military personnel is not con­
fined to thoGe who have been the subjects of security investi­
gations. It extends to· any subversive derogato:r·y data <levriloped 
against a member of the armed services du:ring any of our investi­
gations of either individuals or organizations. For instanc~, 
if it is determined that a meober of the armed forces has been 
fn contact with a security subject or with any iridividu~l or group 
raisi~g security implications, the appropriate intelligence 
service. should be immediately advised locally. This s.houl.d be 
done even though the security aspects of the contact iave not been 
resolved, so that the mllitary services may be in a position to dis­
charge their .responsibilitieso It must be pointed out to them 
specifically in such instances that the data are unverified, 
. and· pertinent developments must be transmitted to them thereafter 
immed~ately upon re_ceipto 
Section 87D 6b (1) (h} provides that during the course·or security 
investigations ·it must be determined w.hether the subjects have 
any.close relatives in the armed forces. Our responsibilities 
. -require. that such ass~,ciati'ons be called to the att_e.ntion of ~he 
appropriate military intelligence services, together with per­
tinent data, including reports, on the security subjects involve~. 
The ev?,luation of thes~ associations lies entirely within the 
. province of the intelligence services, but for the reasons stated 
• previously herein it is incumoent upon the Bureau to disseminate 
this information immediately upon re9eipt 0 
Any.subversive .contacts or information developed concerning 
military personnel must be set out in a letter to the Bureau, 
together with a statement as to thEl local dissemination r.iade in 
the field.. Such,,.let·ter ·should be accompanied hy a[lett.erhe'.l.d]
