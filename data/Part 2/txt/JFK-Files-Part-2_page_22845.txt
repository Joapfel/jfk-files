The Chairman(,;:!'. What ·1s ,' the', qu~stion? • •• 
Mr. Smothers·~· •• ·4~.,~uestio~"·1s who in the White House 
provided Mr. B,undy with documents relevant to this investigati n. 
And I believe his position is that he would prefer not to 
disclose that matter, or that that is a matter for the 
Committee's determination. -, 
Mr. Bundy. Let· me explain, Mr. Chairman, because you 
were out of the room, .that I have always taken the position· 
that decisions of the White House are for the White House 
to discuss. I always asked permission to see documentation 
and permission was given. I looked at the document, but I 
would rather not discuss it, because I think it is for the 
White House to discuss it. 
The Chairman. What is the document? 
Mr. Bundy. I just described it, it is National Security 
Action Memorandum No. 1, we!!howed us the National Security 
Action file, which I believe your staff has. 
Mr. Schwarz. We have it here. 
Mr. Smothers. My question was, who had the request been 
made to, and showed him the document? 
Mr. Dundy. My point is that I have tried historically 
not to discuss this kind of question when it is something 
that concerns the White llouse, but to leave it to the White 
House to discuss it, and I would prefer to hold to that 
position.
