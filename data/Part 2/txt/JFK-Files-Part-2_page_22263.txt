TOP SECRET 59 
quoting a cable concerning the asset WIROGUE, wpo was sent 
to the Congo in the fall of 1960. 
The Chairman. Mr. Bissell, the memorandum to which 
counsel has referred reads as follows: 
"In recommending the agent or asset ROGUE!, {Ihe ·Chi,ef-J 
I 
~ Station, Leopoldville, the Chief of the Agenpy's African 
I Division, probably Bronson Tweedy, wrote in late 1960: 
I 
'He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, 
but if he is given an assignment, which may be morally wrong 
in the eyes of the world,but necessary because pis case offi­
cer ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he 
I 
will dutifully undertake appropriate action fo~ its execution 
I without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can1 rational~ze , , 
all actions'". 
Is that fairly representative of the philosophy that 
applied to such matters at the time? 
Mr. Bissell. Well, it certainly 
range of matters that would have come 
Coul~:r:say, Mr. Chairman, that 
applied 7ithin the 
under SRlHFLE. 
I 
I 
I 
I know of no way in 
I· 
I 
which it is possible to operate a secret inte11iigence agency 
i or a secret service unless it has at least a number of 
I 
employees who are willing to and can be dependJd upon to 
I 
carry out orders involving acts of this sort. 
The Chairman. That assumes, of course, that the 
I 
United States ought to assassinate foreign leaders .
