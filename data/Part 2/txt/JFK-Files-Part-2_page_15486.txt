Memorandum to Mr.: Sullivan 
Re: INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE OF•· •• 
FRIENDLY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.· 
65-63113 
It is noted that our request of State involving 19 African 
countries was based on the needs of USIB. Since·that time, we have 
had no further indication from·USIB of its interests in the African 
area. However, based on current.critical conditions presently . 
existing in various African countries; it is believed that we should 
institute programs to develop sources in the diplomatic establishments 
in the ·u. S. of the following African countries: SomatJa,· Sudan, 
So~th Africa, Dahomey, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, _Senegal and Nigeria. 
ACTION: 
It is recormnended Liaison discuss this matter with State 
and_·• obtain.its approval for a program for us to develop sources and 
informants in diplomatic establishments of the above African countries 
with the understanding that State· cl~arance will be obtained prior 
to our actually approaching any potential source or informant involved.
