hearings to date, the committee concludes that the 
National Assembly for Democratic Rights and a co­
ordinating and organizing group in support thereof, 
titled the 'Citizens Committee for Constitutional 
Liberties, are communist fronts. Created, dominat-ed 
and controlled by members and officials of the Communist 
Party, the National Assembly for Democratic Rights and 
the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties were 
organized as propaganda devices for the conduct of 
'mass activity' in support of the avowed objectiyes 
of 'reversal or nonapplication' of the Supreme Court 
decisions of June 5, 1961, which upheld the constitution~ 
ality of the registration and disclosure provisions of 
the Internal Security Act of 1950 as applied to the 
Communist Party, and the Smith Act membership clause 
making punishable active and purposive membership in 
the Communist Party."
