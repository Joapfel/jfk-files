did not implicate CIA initially but instead said he had 
been asked by a Los Angeles attorney to arrange investi­
gative work in Las Vegas. Maheu declined to name the 
attorney. 
Maheu first mentioned CI-A connection in an FBI interview 
on April 18, 1961 [after the Bay of Pigs] (detailed in an 
agent report of April 20, 1961, transmitted by a memo to 
Assistant Attorney General on April 25, 1961). He said 
he was working with CIA and the Las Vegas bug was ordered 
to determine if Sam Giancana was leaking information. 
(Maheu did not tell tBI about nature of activitie~ he 
undertook for CIA.)
