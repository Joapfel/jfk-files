John Peter ·Grady, a close associate of the Berrigan 
\·brothers, accordi!!g to several sources, claims to have planned and 
t participated in the Media burglary. He was allegedly assisted by 
l Fathers Joseph Or Rourke, ,Peter Fordi, and Edward McGowan. In 
addition, at least three other alleged associates of the Berrigan 
group are believed to have participated. Through information 
·/recently developed, Grady has been pinpointed as the individual 
fwho masterminded at least 14 of the 18 break-ins of various 
\Government facilities during the past two years. He currently 
. heads up what is termed the 
1
:action group 11 and is reported 
I 
reliably as being a staunch advocate of 11hits 11 on Federal 
facilities as a·means of embarrassing the Federal Governme~t. 
During the past several weeks, we have been successful 
\in inserting a·highly productive source into a group led by Grady 
~ich is presently planning a break-in of the ~raft board office 
~\7ith alternate targets being r-'lilitary Intelligence and the FBI 
t:Resident Agency, all located in the Post Office B:q.ildi~1g at Camden r 
iNew Jersey, a Government reservation. The early morning hours of 
isunday, July 18, 1971, was the original target date. However, 
l
thiladelphia has now reported that, in all probability, the 
init would be delayed until July 25, 1971, in order to allow elements 
. tfrom the Newark, New ,Jersey, area to participate. Under the 
\
1 direction of SAC Roy K. Moore, on special Medburg assignment, with 
·,,. I the cooperation of SACs: Philadelphia and Newark, arrangements have 
\ 
be<§;n perfected aimed at apprehendi~1g these individuals· red-handed. 
Hopefully, O'Rourke, Fordi, and NcGowan will participate i~ the 
{ 
Camden break-in as well as others involved in the Media burglary. 
Precautions have been taken to cover our Resident Agency a.t all 
tim~s. I~ additiotif!Y~~~~onnel are on_~o~tinual al:rt to swi~g into
