General Mr. Kennedy,.he had a direct meeting with him. 
Mr. diGanova. And what, if anything, happened? 
Mr. Angleton. Ohly encouragement. 
Mr. diGenova. Could you amplify on that? 
Mr. Angleton. Well, the Attorney Genaral handled him 
very well {ndeed, but nothing.further came out of it. 
Mr. diGenova. Out there was no commitment on the part of 
the Attorney General to see if he could budge; Mr. lloover to 
assist the Agency? 
Mr. Angleton. Well, the issue didn't come up in that 
fashion, just the general, the general agreement that he was 
prepared to work for the United States at the hight:"!st level, 
because the intelligence he had went far beyond simply KGI3 . 
It went into Soviet policy. It went into Soviet reorientation.; 
It went into Soviet Bloc. It went into Soviet defense matters .. 
It went into some of the major secrets. And therefore it wasn't 
simply counterintelligence. It had to do with policy or 
political action. 
Ue k1_1ew, for example, the identity of a Prime Minister 
who ~as a Soviet agent, who at that time was trying to get us 
to go into several political arrangements, and he knew 
exactly how he was recruited and how he was being used as an 
agent of influence. 
So these were matters that went beyond simply intelliqen,:,' 
scope.
