Other Eisenhower Administration officials who were active 
in the Special Group in late 1960--Assistant Secretary of 
Defense John N. Irwin II, Undersecretary of State for Political 
Affairs Livingston Mercrcc.r,t, and Deputy Secretary of Defense 
James Douglas--stated that they did not recall any discussion 
about as.sassinating Lumumba (Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, pp. 1-2; 
Merchant atfidavit, 9/8/75, p. 1; Douglas affidavit, 9/j/7~). 
(c) Richard Bissell Testified That, D • e His Lack of 
a S eci ic Recollection, In errect 
That the Assassination E 
Richard Bissell's testimony on the question of high-level 
authorization for the effort to assassinate Lumumba is prob­
lematic. Bissell insisted that he had no direct recollection 
of receiving such·authorization and that all of his testimony 
on this subject "has to be described as inference" (Bissell, 
9/10/75, p. 48). Bissell began his testimony on the subject 
by asserting that it was on his own initiative that he instructed 
0ustin O'Donne11/ to plan the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 
6/11/75, pp. 54-55). Nevertheless, Bissell's conclusion--based 
on his inferences from the totality of circumstances relating 
to the entire assassination effort against Lumumba--was that an 
assassination attempt had been authorized at the highest levels 
of the government (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 32-33, 47-49, 60-62, 
65) .
