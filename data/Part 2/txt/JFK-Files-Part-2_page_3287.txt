I bave read the ~ortions of Mr~ 
Nixon's book with regard to the intel­
ligence briefings which he understood 
Senator Kennedy had been given by me 
with respect to Cuba during the campaign. 
I have also seen the White House state­
ment issued today on this subject. 
There has. been here,. I believe, an 
honest misunderstanding. This was 
probably due to the nature of the mes­
sage Mr. Nixon writes he received as to 
these briefings. The Cuban situation 
was, of course, dealt with in the 
briefings I gave to Senator-Kennedy. 
The last briefing I gave . him was over a 
month before the debate . ...,.in which the 
issue arose. 
My briefings were intelligence brief­
ings on the world situation. They did 
not cover our own Government's plans or 
programs for action -- overt or covert. 31/ 
As previously noted, however, by 1964, if not earlier, 
Mr. Nixon had accepted the fact that he had made an 
error in assuming that Kennedy had received a more 
detailed briefing than in fact he truly had. 
By way of· c·oncluding this segment on Richard 
' Nixon's involvement in the Bay of Pigs activity, it 
should be clear that by _no stretch of the imagination 
was Nixon "the architect of the Bay of Pigs."* 32/
