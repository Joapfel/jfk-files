This incident indicates that the- CIA was aware that there was 
some Congolese support for the assassination of Lumumba, but that 
the moderate President of the Congo still respected Lumumba and 
refused to consider assassination. 
On August· 25, 1960, Allen Dulles attended .a meeting of the 
Special Group -- the National Secur.ity Council subcommittee re­
sponsible for the plahning'of c6vert operatiohs.* In response to 
the outline of s·ome CIA plans for political actions against 
Lumumba, such as arranging a vote of no confidence by the Congolese 
Parliament, the Special Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs reported that the President 
had expressed extremely strong feelings 
on the necessity for very straightforward 
a~tion in this situation, and he wondered 
whether the plans as-outlined were sufficient 
to accomplish this. (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60.) 
After this discussion, the Special Group 
finally agreed that planning.for the Congo 
would not necessarily ·r.ule out "consideration" 
of any particular kind of activity which might 
contribute to getting rid of Lumumba. 
(Special Group Minutes,· 8/ 25/ 60.) 
* This Special Group meeting and the testimony about its 
significance on the issue of authorization is discussed in detail
