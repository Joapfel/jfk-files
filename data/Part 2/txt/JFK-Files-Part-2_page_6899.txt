Activities -- the Rockefeller commission in 1975; the third by 
the Senate Select Committee,to Study Governmental Oper~tions with 
Respect to Intelligence -- the Church Committee -- in 1975 and 
1976 as part of its investigation of CIA assassination plots 
against foreign leaders; and finally, the extensive investigation 
of-the House Assassinations Committee in 1978 and 1979. 
Each of these investigations, particularly the Warren 
Commission and House Assassinations Committee investigation, 
produced long, detailed public reports concerning the Kennedy 
assassination .. In addition, literally hundreds of books and 
articles have been written on the subject. 
Yet still, almost 30 years later, the questions remain. 
The recent release of the controversial film "JFK"- has rais~d 
them anew, ~µ~gesting that answers may well lie in the 
assassination records and other materials that remain sealed by 
our Government. Even prior to the release of "JFK," in fact, 
~ 
there were diligent efforts made by researchers as well as 
concerned legislators to open thes• files for public review. 
Mr. Chairman, I do not know what all of these files contain. 
Specifically, I do not know whether they contain information that 
would call into question or undermine the findings of the previous 
investigations or not.
