On December 20, 1972, LONNIE DARDEN, BPP-NF 
leader at Detroit, was interviewed under suitable pretext 
by a Speciat Agent of the FBI and DARDEN made the following 
statement regarding ELDRIDGE CLEAVER: 
"Eldridge Cleaver will not be allowed back 
in the BPP. We're (BPP-NF) not saying that 
there is a peaceful co-existence that will 
exist between the BPP and Eldridge Cleaver. 
We're saying that the court systems are 
responsible for the execution of poor _and 
oppressed people and we in ·turn are exposing 
the court system in this particular racist 
attitude against poor and oppressed people 
and riot trying to build a peaceful co-existence 
with a particular element that had defected 
from the Party."
