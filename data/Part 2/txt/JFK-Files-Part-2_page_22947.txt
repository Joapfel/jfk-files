me and it was cl~ar; that I had become responsi-
bl'e fur knowing what was in the document, but I have to say that 
as I r~read it I have no recollection that I ever, in fact, did 
read it at the time. Whether that was because of the flow, the

Mr. Bundy. Yes, I would -- and my own guess on this, and 
it'~ not much better than that, is that the decision which had 
been taken only a week befora th~ new Administration came in~ 
in the Special Group, was partly reviewed in some fashion, with 
the Special Group as reconstituted after the change in 
Administration. So I would have to say that I suppose I knew 
that weapons were being introduced into the Dominican Republic
