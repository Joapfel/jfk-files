ACTION COALITION ('WONAAC) 
SPONSORED DEMONSTRATION 
November 20, 1971 
Washington, D. C. 
The WONAAC is self-described in its literature 
as being forQed by the national co~ference of 
more than 1,000 women held in New York City, 
New York, in July 1971. -At that conference, 
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came 
together to unite their efforts in the oational 
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and 
for the corollary demands of no forced _sterilization 
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference 
called for a massive show of force for these goals 
in a march on Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, 
California, November 20, _1971. WONAAC is based 
on a program of legislative, judicial, and 
mass de~onstration activities on a local and 
national level, and seeks to unite all women in 
the fi~ht for the right of abortion.
