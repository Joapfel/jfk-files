Cuba because they needed me. 
Mr. DeMarco. t'lha:t foreign country were you transferred 
from? 
Mr. Sarno. I don't think that I should ~tate that. 
Mr. DeMarco. I insist that you answer that. 
Mr. Wides. Let's go off the record. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. DeMarco. For tha record, I think I should explain to 
you that we are highly interested in the sort of activities 
that you were involved in in Cuba in 1960 and '61, but our 
investigation has to a certain point been slowed down by the 
inability to obtain the right kinds of documents and that 
being the case, and your insistence here on not answering 
certain questions, will require us to simply have you come 
back once wa have cleared this up with your superio~s at the 
Agency and once they have been more forthcoming with documents 
that were long ago requested about your activities. 
I don't want to pursue just suspicions with you, I'd 
rather talk to you about specific dates and facts. 
Wear~ going to pursue this very vigorously, and the 
reason I'm interested in it is the gambling background, and 
I would like to know your training in that area, your experienc 
in that area and the reasons why you were down there. 
Now if there is anything you want to tell me no~, or do 
you want to come back --
