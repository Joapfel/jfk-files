CIA - 16 - Oswald Pre-Assassination Files 
(S) The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO 
records to determine if there were any additional files 
containing pre-ass·assination records relating to 
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald 
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The 
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian. 
CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were 
incorporated into the 201. 
(S) Prior to establishing a 201, any documents 
received would have been placed in an operational 
interest file. We found no reference to the existence 
of an operational interest file. If such a file had 
existed, however, it might not have been registered in 
the central index. It was standard procedure that 
upon opening a 201, the documents from an operational 
interest file would be transferred to the 201. 
(S) Given that Oswald was a subject of the 
HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that 
there was a file on him. We destroyed all of the 
HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was 
made of what files existed. We did not review all of 
the DO record system to destroy all copies of material 
which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material. 
We know, for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items 
related to Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection. 
(S) In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the 
information we are aware of that we had prior to the 
assassination.
