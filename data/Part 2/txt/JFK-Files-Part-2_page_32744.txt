1. Develop the force structure necessary to our military 
requirements without regard to arbitrary budget ceilings. 
2. Procure and operate this force at the lowest possible 
cost. 
Following this gwi.da.nce, we have made substantial increases in 
both our nuclear and non-nuclear forces. The additions to our nuclear 
forces have been designed both to strengthen our strategic retaliatory 
forces<~nd t0 increas:~.their f!exibil:ity by" sh:ifting the e~phasis to those 
weapon systerns which have the best chance of riding out any kind of 
nuclear surprise attack. 
At the same time, we have substantially expanded our non­
nuclear forces -- ground, sea, and air -- so that we can cope with the 
many and varied threats confronting us around the world. To insure 
that our non-nuclear forces are properly equipped and supplied, pro­
curement of weapons, equipment, and ammunition has been vastly in­
creased. 
Concurrently with these increases in our fighting strength we have 
attacked the problem of costs on a wide variety of fronts. Because of 
the great technical complexity of modern-day weapons, their lengthy 
period of development, their tremendous combat power and their 
enormous cost, sound choices of a limited number of major weapon 
systems in relation to military tasks and missions have become the key 
decisions around which .much else of the Defense program revolves.
