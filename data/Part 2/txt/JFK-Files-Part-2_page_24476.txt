Bissell·said circumlocution would have been 11sed "to protect 
the President" in accord with the concept of "plausible deniability".* 
As noted above, Bissell testified he had no personal knowledge 
that Dulles informed President Eisenhower of the Castro plot. On other 
specific occasions invol vi_ng sensitive covert operations, Dulles had told 
Bissell he had used the "circumlocutious" approach with President 
Eisenhower. (Bissell, 6/11, p. 10.) But with respect to the Castro 
assassination attempt, Dulles did not so inform Bissell. (Bissell, 6/11, 
p. 11.) As 3issell testified: 
"I still want to be quite clear, I do not have a recollection of the 
Director telling me that on this specific operation he had made 
such an approach and received assent, approval, tacit or otherwise." 
(Bissell, 6/11, p. 11.) 
As to whether Dulles knew of the plots and informed Eisenhower, we 
) have discussed above the fact that in January 1960 Dulles had told the Special 
Group that the CIA "did not have in mind a quick elimination of Castro." 
(Hemorandum of Special Group meeting, January 13, 1960, p._). And in July 
1960 an instruction by Bissell's deputy to attempt to kill Raul Castro, which 
also stated that "possible removal of top three leaders is receiving serious 
consideration at headquarters" had been countermanded. The CIA officer 
who drafted this instruction testified that he had heard at ·the time that 
that assassination was not to be considered." (Hinkle, p. 
* Bissell explained the "plausible deniability" practice as follows: 
"Any covert operations, but especially covert operations ... that 
if successful, would have very visible consequences, it was of course 
an objective to carry out in such a way that they could be plausibly 
disclaimed by the U.S. Government." (Bissell, 6/11~ p. 5:·) 
,._ _ __,,, Bissell apparently assumed that a corollary to that doctrine required the 
use of "obliquell, "circumlocutious" language.
