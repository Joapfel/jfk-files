NOTES 
A. South Vietnam Plans are riow afoot to shuffle 
South Vietnam's Corps commander·s so that General . 
Khanh 1 considered by General Harkins to·be the best 
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV 
Corps) area. General Dinh, the ambitious Minister • . 
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin­
quish command of the III Corps area, and is not in­
volved in the current shuffle . 
. B. Cuba-USSR There are about 81 000 Soviets in Cuba, 
5,000 of these military, according to a bloc offi­
cial in close touch with Soviets .in Havana. The 
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to 
7,000. Some withdrawals continue.
