that he would side with the Treasury unless the thing was 
serious enought to lead to a parting of the ways. And one 
commitment that he wanted from me \ilas that if there was that 
it would not be a silent parting of the ways. And that was a 
very easy thing for me to agree to. 
And on or after I had come back from a final meeting of 
the OACD in Paris at which the Convention was signed, at 
which I had been a leading negotiator, early in December I 
had a call from him when I got back that morning saying that 
he wanted me to come over to his place, that he wanted to do 
this if I would agree. 
So I went to President Eisenhower and told him of my 
meeting abroad and told him I was going to see Senator 
Kennedy -- which he didn't like very much. And I saw him. 
And we talked about certain financial things that might be a 
problem, which I told him about, which they turned out not to 
be. 
And he then right away, that morning, much to my surprise, 
went out on the front stoop of the house in Georgetown and too 
me out there with Robert Kennedy, whom I had never met before
