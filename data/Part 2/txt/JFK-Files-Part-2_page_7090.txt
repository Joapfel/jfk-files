MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Grant P. Harmon 
Unit Chief, JFK Taskforce 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
FROM: Barry Harrelson, Senior Reviewer 
Historical Review Group 
Center for the Study of Intelligence 
Central Intelligence Agency 
SUBJECT: Authenticity of Document 
1. This is in response to your request to this office 
to review the attached document and advise if it is a valid 
Agency document or something made up using an Agency reports 
format and information either entirely made up or from other 
sources. The 3 August 1962 document purports to tie Dorothy 
Kilgallen, Marilyn Monroe and former Attorney General, 
Robert Kennedy, together with knowledge of an number of 
matters, including the plot to kill Castro. 
2. Those Agency offic~r~ who have reviewed the 
document consider it to be fra(iulent. While the format 
resembles a "reports" form used in the 1960's, the 
substantive iqf_ormation and presentation is foreign to 
normal presentalon or collection efforts. Also, the control 
stamps and other administrative items are not typical of CIA 
reports written during the 1960's. 
3. If you have any further questions in this regard, 
please call me directly at (703) 351-2909.
