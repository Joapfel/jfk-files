Re: _.,,, Final Search for all Original CIA Records Rerated to the Ass~sination of 
President John F. Kennedy 
Dear Barry: 
__ .,. 
,. 
- This letter is in follow-up to our meeting of June 26, 1998, where we discussed the 
. ) compr~ensiveness of CIA~s search for assassination records. _As we expr~d in the 
meeting; the Assassination Records Review Board-is extremely concerned as to whether 
all original records held by the Central Intelligence Agency, particularly those 
controlled by the Directorate of Operations, have been identified in previous searches 
for records relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . 
) 
. 
The Review Board is aware that the fo~er Chief of the Historical Review Group, John 
Pereira, ordered a search of all CIA records in 1993. Since that date, however, we have 
identified at least three ~amples of r~rds dearly relevant to. the assassination that 
hav.e _been identified through the efforts o( the Review Board staff and that were 
subsequenfly located by CIA. These recorcfs·were not identified through the 1993 CIA 
search. 
In order to comply with the strictures of the JFK Act and to ensure that all original CIA 
records relevant to the assassination are identified, the Review Board requests the 
following: 
1. CIA conduct a new search of all Office of Security and Directorate of 
Operations (including all counterintelligence-components), for any documents 
relevant to the assassination, Particular care should be taken to examine-possibly 
relevant documents dated shortly before and any time after the 1993 search.
