Mr. Dawson. I know that you have indicated you 
won't bo able to· put a precise date to this conversation 
with Bissell or conversations with Binaell, but maybe we can 
narrow it do-.m a little bit. 
Would you assume that it would be after the proclama­
tion ol the Congolese independence on June JO, 1960? 
Mr. Tweedy. Oh, yceo 
Hr. Dawson~ Would you assume it would be before 
Lwnumba's being put into U.N. protective custody on 
SeptemberlS, 19607 
Mr. Tweedy. I think it must have been, yes. I 
didn't realize he had gone into custody that early, 
So then it would be sometime during the 
swnmer or early fall of 1 607 
Mr. Tltleedy. What happened to Lumumba aft.er that? 
Mr. Baron. He was in protective custody· at the United 
Nation6 force from mid-September until late November and 
it was in late November that he left .to_go tra_veling 
towards Stanleyville and he was captured by Mobutu's troops 
At that point in very early December and from early December 
until mid-January he was in the custody of the Congolese in 
prison and then it wae in mid-J4nu4ry 1961 that he was 
flown trom a prison in Tysville to Katanga where his death 
was announced shortly thereafter. 
Mr. Tweedy. That I recall. I have got to assume it
