a. Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade 
Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilh:ies by 
flights on Habana-Moscow route. These efforts achieved a 
temporary withholding of permission for future regular flights, 
at least until such time as the Soviets develop their own 
refueling facilities at Conakry. 
b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian 
authorities to express our deep concern at the growing 
frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request 
their cooperation in curbing them. Also instructed our 
Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with CIA 
station chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those 
countries travelling on these flights to local authorities 
and urging them: (1) to institute tighter controls on their 
own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their 
concern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil 
as a way station for transporting subversives. 
c. As a result of representations made to the 
British ~overnment about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands 
carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed 
an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the 
use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit 
points for passengers. The British intend to require transit 
visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to 
reject applications· for such visas except in certain special 
cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from

opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to
