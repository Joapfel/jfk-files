The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Mexican officials is found in 
CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19, 
1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the 
Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivi of sources and methods involved,

of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government
