Oct. 30, 1978 
Dear Tom: 
I recieved your letter of Oct. 16, 1978 and agree with 
your last figures which indicate my base nay as $1,273.00 
per month. The W-2 form includes overtime and uniform al­
lowances that are not subject to Committee ·consideration·., 
This still leaves me paid until Feb. 15, 1979. This is not 
accurate due to insufficient data given to you. 
The following will explain my present position. 
The City of New Orleans allows employees to accrue annual 
leave at the rate of 21 days per year (1 3/4 per month). This 
annual leave can be accumulated for a maximim.of 90 days and 
be carried from one year to the next. In 1977 I ended the year 
with102 days of which 12 days was dropped from the .rolls due 
to committee employment • .- These are all working days, for each 
five tot~led I recieve 2 days ?ff, similar to a week e~d~_In 
1978 I will lose 21 days (workingJ from the rolls. This is 
33 working days or 6 weeks and 3 days (33JI~ 5= 6 X 7 + 3 =45). 
"'c""'-;' 
The 33 days from the City amounts to $1,.937.66 at $7.34 
ner hour" This amount does not take into account the number 
of weeks nor the 14 days annual leave that the committee would 
allow. The total consecutive days would be 45 + 14 = ·59. 
This would .be one day short of two months at $2,000.00 per 
month from the Committee" You can see that this could get 
into an accountant pr6blem. 
I am suggesting that the Committee not pay me anything 
further in salary but that I be given the above stated time 
off. I would like to be off from Nov. 15 thru Dec 31. 1978. 
I would still be avialable to get needed information to help 
write the report (if the Committee continues my phone service) 
I am not an accountant and would rather not g;et into the 
dollars and cents involved" The time off would be~oractical 
solution in my opinion •. 
L will talk with you and Cliff further about this matter. 
S~ely In Christ
