Al\1ERICAN WOMEN constitute 51 % of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. • 
It is time fo~women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi­
zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and 
economic direction of the nation. WE HA VE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our 
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States. 
We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American llfe. We shall meet in Washington 
on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following: 
1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE 
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL 
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS. 
2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME. 
3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED 
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM. 
4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SA YING AND 
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL 
COMPLEX. 
After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position 
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and 
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a 
position of honor in the community of nations. 
On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11 :30 A.M., and walk behind 
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. C~ngress. • 
On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begih implementation of these demands by 
presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.
