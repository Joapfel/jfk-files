MR. HALPERN: Straight jacket. He looked at me and he knew me well enough and 
I knew him and he says, "Okay, Sam, what do you want to send?" "I want to 
send.back we got 18,000. You know, and tell them how we got it. And give 
them the facts. I'm not trying to make policy. I'm just here to get the 
information. We're the intelligen~e officers, that's what our job is." He 
said he can't send 18,000. I said, "What is this? Some kind of a Persian rug· 
merchant bargaining or something? What do you want to send? We can't go with 
10 anymore. That's _gone. We've got 18 .. " Well, to make a long story short, 
we en~ed u~. just like Sam Adams later, many years later, but he was in the 
hundreds of thousands, I was i.n thi tens of thousands, and so we ended up 
whereby, I think we said something like -- we compromised, no question about 
that -- something like 14, 15.effectives, plus support troops, just like Sam, 
it's exactly the same play as Sam Adams except mu~h smaller figures and much 
earlier. This was 1961. But the total figure, if yo_u add it all up, you 
ended up wi{h an 18,000. That much I got through. But again it was a 
stretched-out thing. So when the.message finally went out, it went out i_n 
several channels;· I mean, to CIA, the military and to State Department: 
Everybody got it. When 'it got to CINCPAC I'm told that almost like a bomb hit 
the place. And the next thing we knew was a message saying, "Colonel so and 
so from CINCPAC Staff is arriving to discuss this latest nonsense," or 
something like that. It was just, you know, crazy. And this Colonel had been 
on the Vietnam desk for CINCPAC, but he served in Vietnam -- with the French 
when they were there. And he was the expert as far as CINCPAC was concerned. 
So when we were saying 10,000, we were in effect flying in his face. We were _ 
becoming idiots. It was off base. We didn't know this guy from Adam. And to
