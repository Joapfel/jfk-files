ous action." The Station was directed to try to "stop ill-considered 
action at this time." (Headquarters 585, 6 October 1970)

supporting his recollection with the fact that the CIA memorandum of 
an October 10 conversation between Karamessines and Haig (see below) 
makes no mention of any previous plots. (Ki singer testimony, p. 24)
