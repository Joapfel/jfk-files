Friends, / · ;, ':\ 
In the name of the people of Palestine, in tl1c name cf tl1c

•• .The major victim of this aggression was the J\rab Palc:.tinian people 
who ,,,ere forced to evacuate their homes and land under a rci[;n 
of terror and oppression. . 
We therefore refuse to consider the 1967 _aggression ·as a
