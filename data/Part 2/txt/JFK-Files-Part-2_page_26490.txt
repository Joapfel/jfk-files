. 1. There is no firm evidence on legal or 
illegal tr·avel from Hai ti to Cuba. The traffic, 
if any, is probably small. We believe there is 
clandestine movement by small boat between the 
two countries. 
2. More than 50,000 aaitians live in east­
ern Cuba, concentrated around Santiago. Most are 
employed as cane field laborers. 
3. Exile sources claim that 400 of these 
workers have been trained for subversive activities 
and that some of the trainees have already returned 
to Haiti. We have no supporting evidence, however, 
have detected no returning,trainees, and know of 
no pro-Castro paramilitary groups in Haiti. 
4. There are two clandestine Communist parties 
in Haiti, The leader of one of them, Rene Depestre, 
is in Cuba and reportedly works on Cuban propaganda 
beamed at Haiti. 
5. The only known incident involving Communists 
was an attempted demonstration at the U.S. Embassy 
on 31 October. Advance warning from a clandes_tine 
source witfiin the Communist party, who said the 
instructions for the demonstration came from Cuba, 
enabled police to forestall the incident. Several 
of the youths involved may have been detained briefly 
by the police. 
6. No Haitian occupying any position of in­
fluence is known to have received any training in 
Cuba.
