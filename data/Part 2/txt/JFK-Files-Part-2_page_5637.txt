MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Interview with John Whitten (S) 
1. On 22 April 1996, from approximately 1000 to 1600, _ 
Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of the yFK Revi~oard, and I spoke 
with Mr. John Whitten at the U.S. embassy i~~ruiy Gunn . 
conducted the interview by showing Whitten various documents and 
'his prior testimony before the HSCA. Mr. Whitten was eager to 
help the Board in any way he could and even offered to come to 
the US if need be. Gunn concluded that it would probably not be 
1
useful to take_Whitten's deposition at a later date. Although 
Whitten had in general a good memory, Gunn felt he did not add 
.anything of significance to his prior testimony before the HSCA. :After the interview, Mr. Whitten took us to his apartment and then later to a restaurant with his wife. We left Mr. Whitten 
• about 1900. (S) 
2. Mr. Whitten was extremely worried and upset about the 
release of his name and on several occasions in the interview was 
on the verge of tears. Although I was expecting him to be angry 
with CIA and.the.Board, instead, he clearly felt hurt and 
betrayed. His obvious physical problems add to this feeling of 
b~ing vuln~rable. • Physicall¥ h~ is. not we_!l; he· is paralyzed· on
