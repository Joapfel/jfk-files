· f The Arab military chiefs 
wpo met in Cairo in mid-December 
apparently decided that direct 
m\1,litary ~ttacks are not feasi­
bfe. The chiefs reportedly 
ugreed, however, that the states 
~ordering on Israel should 
nibunt independent and uncoor-
J
inated clandestine operations. 
The Arab League Defense 
. ouncil, which meets in January, 
probably will approve this rec­
ommendation, but its implementa­
tion is another matter. Egyp-
.tian,Jordanian, and Lebanese 
dfficials have indicated pri­
yately that their go~ernments 
lave no intention of taking 
-~ggressive action of any kind 
tigainst the Israeli project. 
:/ Nasir, however, told the 
states with a dilemma. • Damascus 
will be under strong pressure 
to fulfill it• threats against 
the Israeli scheme, particularly 
in view of the close proximity 
of the Syrian border to Israel's 
pumping station on Lake Tiberias .. 
Nasir's wariness about be­
coming involved in a war with 
Israel over Jordan waters was 
also evident in a speech he 
made on 23 December. He empha­
sized that the problem is polit­
ical rather than military in 
nature and that the chiefs of 
staff cannot solve it. He 
called for a summit meeting of 
Arab presidents and kings to 
seek a solution. 
Israel, according to the 
• chief of Israeli military in­
telligence, considers there is 
an outside possibility that 
Syria might bomb or shell the 
pumping facility's transformer 
station. However, the Israelis 
believe the prima~y threat stems 
from former Palestinians now 
living in Syria, Jordan or 
Lebanon,who might make a dra-
matic effort to sabotage the 
project even though they prob-Canadian ambassador in early 
~ecember that he was worried 
~hat Syria might act unilater­
a~i and present the_ other Arab 
ably could not cause serious 
damage. (SECRET NO FOREIGN
