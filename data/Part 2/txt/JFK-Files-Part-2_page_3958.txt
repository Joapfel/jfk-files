ECAllSE , AM AN AltAH I was able· to 
breuk through· the bnrrier of sus­
picion thut hud stopped other 
journalists cold and obtain the first in­
depth interviews the Sirhun family has 
given since the assassination. From their 
comments and rrom what Sirhan has said 
to them, a picture or the man and his 
motives begins to emerge, replacing the 
misleading portraits which have swamped 
the U.S. press. 
The fact 1ha1 Sirhan has not ·publicly 
discussed his 1rial is ,w an:ident. It is his 
own stratc~y. -s,in1c1hing he developed 
urter thinking abnui it for long hours in 
• his }pt.•ciall_v made jail cdl. In_ fact, he 
has nmlided In his fa111ily that he will 
ncn·r make am· s1atc111cnt unless spL'l.:iul 
prov1si,ms 11re made for the courtroom 
proceedings. What Sirhan wants is, 
quite simply; publicity. He wants the 
major television networks to. be allowed 
to.broadcast the entire trial. If they do 
this, he says, he will tell all. '·And if they 
refuse'!" hi:-brother Adel recently asked 
him. "Then I ~hall go 10 the gas chamber: 
:::silent," Sirhan replit~d.

College educated, articulate and a 
···--- ------------------------------
voracious reader, Sirhan is confident 
about his own ability to cope with his 
predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif, 
told me that Sirhan studies the intrica- -
cies of his case ns mnny as_ ten hours 11 
day in his cell.Shereifrc..-calls thnt Sirhan 
recently said IQ him, ''I do 1101 need 11 
lawyer. I understand my case und know 
how to defend myself.•~ But even so, 
Attorney Russell Parsons is defending 
his client, and doing it on Sirhan's own 
grounds. "The main issue," Parsons told 
me, "is_ t_o answer this question: why, for 
-what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert 
Kennedy? There· are 100 witnesses who 
saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but 
no one seems to know why he·did it." 
,, Sirhan and his attorney hope that the 
defense-presuming that the television 
networks are allowed into. the court­
room..,..will show that Sirhan did not 
have _ "malice aforethought" in shoot­
ing Kennedy because the act was a polit­
ical gesture, and thut Kennedy, to Sirhan 
at least, wns merely a symbol. His 
brother Adel notes that "if Sirhan w11s 
just an assassin, he could have done itin 
another way, just by having a gun witha 
telescope. He went to the Ambassador 
Hotel expecting to get caught; that is 
why he left his notes at home. I believe 
that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that 
he could say what he believes." 
W
HEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with 
the Sirhan family, . I was re~ 
fused. Security is extremely 
heavy ar9und them, and they are under­
standnhly wary of new faces. Later, when 
1 • finuily obtained an invitation to meet 
wiih • them, Mrs. • Sirhan 11pologized, I 
believe for ,having been inhospitable to 
a fellow Arab. 
This family, which fled Jordan to seek 
greater safety and security than it had 
known, is now living in terror. They are 
somewhat at a loss to understand the 
events which have suddenly catapulted 
them into history. None of the four 
brothers goes to his job; they all feel that 
death follows them everywhere, and they 
rnovc curcfully, with a heuvy guard, • 
"Why don't you just leave this rnuntry?'' 
I ush.cd Shercil'. ·"Where ·1,l,11II wc go'/" 
he unswen~d. "Tu whom shall wc lenve 
our brother'! Our land is under lsrud's 
occupation." Shereif clarified his state­
ment: "Our brother is in jail; we have to 
stay." 
I sensed not only the Sirhans' con­
fusion, but also some bitterness. They 
. have not.,received any aid from the Arab • 
countries, as they originally thought they 
might. Par:.ons is also somewhat sur­
prised; he had hoped thi1t tlw v11riOU!1 
locnl Arub cqnsulnlcs would help defroy 
court costs. 1 - _ ·• • ----
Indeed, Lqs Angeles' Jordanian con­
sul, who visit~d Sirhan in jail at Sirhan's . 
request, indic::ated to me that the accused 
asS11ssin had i expected the Arab people 
to treat him "s a hero. However, except 
for some Paiestinian extremists, his act 
has been universally repudiated by the 
Arab world. -Orie Arab newspaper ha~ 
said editorially, "We don't feel any 
responsibilitx for this. It is the societ)' _ 
that fed him with hostility, the society 
• • thaf gave him the gun, that is responsi­
ble." Memb~rs of the Arab Students' 
Association, !or which 'Sirhan was once 
-_ an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy 
was u terrible mistake. One of them said 
to me, "Whet 11rc we going lo do with 
the re.-.1 or the Americun candid11les'! Kill 
them 1111 hccause they wnnl lo help • • 
Israel'!" 
Still, the Sirhans' friends are prim11rily 
Arnh, and they live in an atmosphere 
that is more Arab than American. The 
entire fumily spent a good deul of time • 
discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The -
mother says that Sirhan was the mosl 
sensitive and the most involved during . . 1 ·"' : .·c .... : ...:· ... --'"--' _;_,-_._._, .• ·~.--: :_.-._·:. ,·.. :.:•,.;..-_,. 
• these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan 
once saw a television report of Robert - • 
Kennedy addressing th~ mt;111bcrs of the 
Neveh Shal<m1 Teinple in Portland, • 
Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken­
nedy, wcuring u yarmulke, <k·darcd that 
the United Stutes must help Israel 
against aggression from whatever source. 
"Unlike the South Vietnamese/' Ken­
nedy Sllid, "the Israelis have shown they 
are willing to fight for their own survival. 
• Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of 
Vietnam: the Israeli government is very 
democratic, ~ffective and free of corrup­
tion. Its people arc united in its support."
