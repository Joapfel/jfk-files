my boss. When I askad whom he meant, he replied, Dick Helms. He 
said he had knowa Helms for years and further that he had seen 
him that: Thursday in order to find out his position on the new 
organization the General was 1n which was holding its first rally , 
. the next evening 1n New York. (This organization has something 
to do with rabid anti-communism and support for the U.S. iri the 
Vietnam war.) The General said Helms' position was one of go 
ahead; he had no· strong feelings.supporting or condemning such 
a group ..

war. Our waitress overheard and mentioned that she was leaving

this vein tor some time, he finally quit. Also,. he stated at the 
beginning of the evening that he did not drink and then proceeded 
to have a combination of drinks fairly fast. He did not appear 
drunk, but with each drink he got louder and louder. _The other 
diners paid little attention, however, due to music and other 
covering noises. • • .•
