discussion of executive action with Bissell, which, h~ said;· 
might have transpired in "early January" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 
52). When Bissell was shown these notes, he agreed with Harvey 
about the timing df their initial discussion (Bissell, 7/17/75, 
p. 10).

The Inspector General's Report connected Silver an<l Gottlieb to the 
early s~ages of the executive action project as follows: • 
Harvey says that Bissell had already discussed certain 
aspects of the problem·with Arnold Silver and with Sidney 
Gottlieb. • Since Silver was already cut in, Harvey used 
him in developing the Executive J\ction .Capability .... 
Harvey's mention of him [Gottlieb] in this connection 
may·explain·a notation by :Dr. Gunn that Harvey instructed 
Gunn to discuss technique~ with Gottlieb without associa-
tinr; the discussion with the Castro operation .. (I.G. 
Report, pp. 37-38). 
It is evident from the testimony of Harvey and Bissell. that :the turn­
over to Harvey of the Roselli contact in No~ember 1961 was discussed 
as patt of ZRRIFLE (see Section (d), infra). Thus, their initial 
discussion of executive action can, at the lGast, -be dated before 
November 1961 and the "25/1" and "26/1" notations would have to 
refer to January 1961. •
