what you mean?

i' 
Mr. Bissell. No, sir. ' ' ' I 
The Chairman. Would you lie to this committee?

i 
suggest that. ~e ask the witness and whatever S~nators that 
can return· to. come back- this afternoon on TruJ· illo.

The Chairman. We have a Senate order that there will 
be no further committee meetings this afternool.
