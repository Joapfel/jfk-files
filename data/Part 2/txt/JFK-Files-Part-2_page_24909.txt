himself had not been straight-forwardly told about the operation.* 
The failure to either inform those officials or to make 
certain that they had been informed by Dulles was particularly 
reprehensible in light of the fact that there were many occasions 
on ~hich Bissell should have informed them, and his failure to 
do so was misleading. In the first weeks of the Kennedy Adminis-
tration, Bissell met with Bundy and discussed the development 
of an assassination capability within CIA--executive action. 
But Bissell did not mention that an actual assassination attempt 
was underway. Bissell appeared before the Taylor-Kennedy Board 
of Inquiry which was formed to report to the President on the 
Bay of Pigs and the Cuban situation, but testified that he did 
not inform the Commission of the assassination operation. As 
chief of the CIA directorate concerned with clandestine operations 
and the Bay of Pigs, Bissell frequently met with officials in 
the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations to discuss Cuban 
_;._e,JiJ ~?~ ~ r-­
operations, and l-iis advice was frequently sought. He did not 
/\ 
tell them that the CIA had undertaken an effort to assassinate 
Castro, and did not ask if they favored proceedinr with the 
-,'. Even assuming that Bissell correctly perceived that Dulles 
understood the nature of the operation, it was inexcusable for 
Bisse~l not to have b 7iefed
1
Dulles in plain language. Further, 
even if one accepts Bissell s assumption that Dulles told the 
Presidents, they would have been told too late, because Bissell 
"guessed" they would have been told that.the operation "had 
been planned and was being attempted".
