B. Former officers, status unknown. While the 
heading to this section would seem to suggest the CIA does 
not know the cover/non-cover status of some of its former 
officers, the section does not really deal with this issue. 
Rather, within the section, Mr. Gunn simply recognizes the 
fact that CIA may not be able to find all of its former 
officers to ask if they want to be opened up or remain under 
cover. The test required by Mr. Gunn to satisfy the Board 
and thus continue postponement until 1 June• of this year is 
a "good faith showing that reasonable attempts" were made to 
locate the officer and failed. 
The section contains the additional provision which 
advises the Board may continue a postponement beyond 1 June 
of this year (i.e., until 2010) if the CIA provides the 
board with evidence which satisfies the criteria of either 
category 1 or category 3. Such "additional evidence" must 
be provided by 1 May 1997. 
The requirements or tests of this section for the 
Agency are not onerous but should be set-out as a series of 
uniform actions or check-off's taken in the attempt to 
locate each "current status unknown" officer. The record of 
these actions could then be presented to the ARRB in support 
of a request for continued postponement. The DO Memorandum 
mentions the possibility of asking the (!_RS/or the ~for 
assistance in this regard and this should probably be done.
