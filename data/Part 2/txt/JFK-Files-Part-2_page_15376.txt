desir;/ned to be. elastic and is. tailored primarily to ,neet the intelligence 
needs of our Government in making high-level decisions and in establish­
ing U. S. pol icy to cope with interna ti anal crises. 'That _it has been 
successful in this respect is evidenced by highly laudatory comn-zents 
and e.;~pressions of appreciation made by individuals of other departments, 
principalJ_,y o.f the Department of State. For e.xample, on 11-29-56 
Deputy Under .Secretary o.f State Robert lfurphy addressed a personal_ 
1 et ter to the _Director stating in- part, "I want to e.xpress the 
Department's appreciation to yo"z.t and the Bureau for the special 
coverage which you have been providing. us during these recent weeks.· 
The material has been immensely valuable to us in keeping abreast of 
fast-moving events and developments in the internati,onal situation and 
has been o.f great assistance to us in the formulation of pol icy. I
