STATUS OF JOHM GEORGE LEDES, ET AL. 
• FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNr•IBNT -
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
This case relates to the association between 
Ledes, a former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James Ce Sargent and Joseph 
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation. We 
completed an extensive investigation which determined that 
Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams with several SEC matters 
while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans 
to Ledes -to finance properties which Lades purc~asedo 
The attorney for subject Abrams advised his client 
not to talk to uso The attorney for Ledes, James M. He Inerney, 
refused to make Ledes available for interview unless he, 
Mc Inerney, is present. We informed the Department and suggested 
that they consider calling Ledes before a Federal Grand Jury or 
interviewing him themselves in Mc Inerney 1 s presence. 
On May 13, 1960, Roger Connor, Executive As~istant to 
Assistant Attorney General Wilkey, advised that Joseph Abrar.ns 
had been brought down from Danbury, Connecticut, Federal 
Correctional Institution to Washington., . D. C., for appearance 
before a Federal Grand Jury here. The Grand Jury presentation 
by three Department attorneys started that date and is currently 
continuing. L~ads growing out of the Grand Jury hearings are 
being received and are currently outstanding in Washington Field 
Office, New York., Atlanta and Miami. These matters are being 
given immediate and continuous attention.
