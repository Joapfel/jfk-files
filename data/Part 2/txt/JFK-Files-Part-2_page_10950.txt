Identification orders, wanted flyers, and check circulars are to be 
furnished newspapers and periodicals only upon their specific request. 
Should a compelling reason exist for distribution of an identification 
order, a wanted flyer, or a check circular, such as possible employment 
of a fugitive by a newspaper or periodical, secure Bureau approval for 
such distribution. 
Give consideration to the desirability of circularizing motels. 
Veterans Administration (VA) installations should be circularized on 
identification order fugitives who are veterans. Office of origin 
has responsibility for instructing other offices to initiate distribu­
tion to VA installations in such cases.
