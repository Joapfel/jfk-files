Furthenrore, Bundy testified that he was never told by anyone at any time that 
assassination efforts were being conducted against Castro (Bundy, p. 63) . 
Bundy said that Richard Bissell never informed him about CIA involvement in 
' -~-sassination attempts against· any foreign leader (Bundy, p. 41) . Bundy 
acknCMledged, however~ that he had once been briefed by Richard Bissell on 
the develoµ:nent of an "executive action capability" at the CIA (see Section 
, infra).* 
Walt Rostow, who shared national secur;ity duties with Bundy before mving 
to the Department of State, testified that during his entire tenure in govern­
ment he "never heard a reference" to an intention to undertake an assassination 
effort (Rostow, pp. 10, 12-13, 38). 
Asked if he'had ever been told anything about CIA efforts to assassinate 
Castro, Richard Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, replied, 
''No, .I never heard of such a thing:" (Goodwin, p. 13) .-kk 
* As indicated further below, Bundy also said (i) that the matter of a 
Castro assassination was ''mentioned fran time to time ... as sooiething to 
talk about rather than to consider." (Bundy, p. 73); and (ii) he had a "very 
vague, essentially refreshed recollection" that at sane time he had heard 
about "poison" in connection with a "possibility of action in Cuba" -- what 
stuck in his mind was that it seemed "totally impractical because it was 
going to kill a large nunber of people in a headquarters mess or sanething 
like that." (Bundy, pp. 42-43). Bundy stated flatly, however, that no 
assassination plot was approved and that he was never informed about the 
various plots. (Bundy, pp. 54, 63-64). 
-kk As _indicated below, Goodwin did on two occasions hear questions raised 
about assassination. One involved the President, who said he was opposed 
(seep. ) ; the other involved the meeting of August 10, 1962 (see pp. 
to ).
