1961 Speech 
A few days after the meeting with Szulc and Goodwin, and some six 
weeks after the issuance of NSAM 100, President Kennedy delivered a speech at. 
the University of Washington. In that public address, President Kennedy stated: 
"We cannot, as a free nation, compete with our adver­
saries in tactics of terror, assas:.,.;ination, false 
promises, counterfeit mobs and crises." (Public Papers 
of the Presidents, John F. Kennedy, 1961, p. 724) 
We discuss in the next section the nature of the program which was initiated 
against the Castro regime at the end of Novemberl961 pursuant to President 
Kennedy's instruction, and which continued to the Missile Crisis in the fall of 
1962.
