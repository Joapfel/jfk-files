We have never received a reply to this memorandum 
even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law 
Enforcement Assistance ·Act have· been awarded for the conduct 
. _of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance 
of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the 
Attorney General that we are not asking. for this money for the 
FBI but that the funds would be_ helpful to the agency sending the 
man to the National Academy.·. ·Although we have not conducted 
a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do 
not submit applications to the National Academy because they 
do not have the 'funds to pay the· living expenses of their officers 
while they would be in W~shington. •
