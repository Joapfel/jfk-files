EUROPEAN TRIP, 1970 
Wiley, who claims that the basic reason for the trip 
was an invitation from the German Ministry of Defense, visited 
West Germany, England, Italy, France, Belgium, The Netherlands 
and Yugoslavia. During the German sojourn he visited the 
German Army, Navy-and Air Force installations. He was told 
prior to departure that CIA had no tasks for him to perform. 
The results of Wiley's trip appeared in the American Legion 
magazine for March 1971. Financial and other records tail 
to reflect any approval of and payment for Wiley for this 
trip. 
Circa August 1970, Wiley prepared a report on one 
Benigno Naval from the Philippines, near :Manila._ Apparently, 
Wiley met Naval "enroute to the Bonn Airport." :This informa­
tion was formalized into a report on 25 September 1970 and 
sent to C/ID/1 with the intention it be provided to FE Divi­
sion.
