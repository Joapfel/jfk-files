19741 the arbitrator ruled in favor of Air America. This decision

caused an add_itional $1,304,243 to accrt1e ·to the Agency from the

plus accrued interest, less the.Agency's share of arbitration-costs. 
DECLASSIFICATION OF RELATIONSHIP WITH CIA 
In March 1974 the employees.of SAT retained an attorney and 
brought a class action suit in U.S. District Court for Southern 
Florida against.Southern Air Transport, Inc., and the Central Intel­
ligence· Agency. The employees as plaintiffs sued for injunctive· 
relief and damages. In this suit the employees alleged: 
a. That the· CIA sold the stock of SAT to Mr. Williams 
illegally, 
b. That SAT had embarked on a program to sell off its 
. . 
assets, depriving the plaintiffs of employment,. 
c. That the plaintiffs were entitled to the benefits of 
the C_IA Retirement and Disabili_ty System, and 
d. _That their civil rights had been.violated. 
In view of the publicity arising from the a·llegations made by· 
the other supplemental carriers during the CAB proceedings and the 
publicity arising from.this suit. it was determined that no useful 
purpose would be served by continuing to deny the true ownership 
: ·tu-- -relationship of SAT by~CIA. It is noted, however, that the opera-
. 1f.y 
tional activities performed by SAT on behalf of~CIA were and remain 
classified.· As a part· of the Agency's defense in this suit. an
