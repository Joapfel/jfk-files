DRAFT: Section~, ARRB Requests for Additional 
Information and Records 
1. Unlike most declassification projects, the Agency's 
involvement in the JFK Project was governed by the dictates 
of a Federal statute, the JFK Act, and the powers it vested 
in the Board it established -- the Assassination Records 
Review Board (ARRB). In particular, under Section 7, the 
Act armed the ARRB with the authority to dig for records and 
information, specifically: 
... (1) The Review Board shall have the authority 
to act in a manner prescribed under this Act, in­
cluding authority to 
* * * 
(C) (ii) direct a Government office to make 
available to the Review Board, and if necessary 
investigate the facts surrounding, additional 
information, records, or testimony from 
individuals, which the Review Board has reason 
to believe ·is required to fulfill its functions 
and responsibilities; 
* * * 
(F) hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena 
witnesses.and documents. 
This substantial authority provided the·';ARRB and its staff 
with al~ost unlimited access to Agency records and 
personnel. It also was the basis for a number of specific 
requests from the Board to the Agency for additional 
information, document searches and explanatory papers. HRP 
designated this ARRB activity, "Special Requests." During 
its existence the ARRB sent to the Agency fifty-three 
special requests, CIA 1-16 and CIA-IR 1-37.
