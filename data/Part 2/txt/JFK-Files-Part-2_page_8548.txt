Item No. 54, 236 MSS p. no. so·, 262 
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World 
Features is still classified SECRET because both items 
describe intelligence sources and methods and identifies 
operations based in England. Fo·rum World Fe·atures was 
referred to - but not by name - in Book I of the Church 
Commit tee Final Report,· page 199, as follows: "Another 
example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two 
proprietary news services that the CIA maintairted in 
Europe ... The larger of the two. was subscribed to by 
over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the 
proble~ of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the 
major U.S. dailies aware that t~e CIA controlled these 
two press services." Wh_ile ·Forum World "Fe·atlires was not 
named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be 
protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper 
editors may be considered as "official public disclosure."
