For your information, McCone has found this 
Board to be a constant irritant. This Board was 
established several years ago by the Eisenhower 
administra.tion then continued by President Kennedy. 
It is designed to periodica.lly review foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence activities. 
The present chairman of the committee is Clark 
Clifford and the staff director is J. Patrick Coyne. 
· j Apparently, McCone does not like a group such as 
this Board looking into his operations. There is 
some indication that his irritation arises from 
personal differences.with Coyne. 
WENNERSTROM CASE 
Colonel Stig Wennerstrom, the Swedish Mili ta.ry 
Attache who, a few weeks ago, admitted to his govern­
ment that he had been working for the Soviets. 
Wennerstrom was in the U.S. from 1952 until 1957 
and was collaborating with the Russians while he 
was here. Recently, McCone indicated that a "damage 
report" should be prepared on this case and he 
expressed the opinion tha.t this should be the 
responsibility of the Bureau. With regard to damage, 
he was referring to an evaluation of all information 
which Wennerstrom may have gained from the U.S . 
. W~ have taken the position that we will not prepare 
such a damage report and if one is needed the work 
should be done by each interested a.gency. 
UNKNOWN SUBJECT; KGB.AGENT KNOWN AS "SASHA" 
This is a Bureau investigation predicated on 
information furnished to us by Anatoli Golitzyn, the 
KGB defector who advised that CIA had been penetrated 
by KGB. We have been endeavoring to identify the _J 
\ 
unknown Soviet agent. We do have a suspect ,TJohn S. CS 
Barescul who was born in Russia and who has 'oeen working 
for CI1'i"for several years. McCone may not mentiqn this 
matter but he is very much concerned about the situation. 
We have been keeping CIA advised of all pertinent 
developments.
