Finally, the intelligence community was of the opinion that the Soviets 
would not introduce strategic missiles into Cuba because they believed that sue: 
a development would be incompatible with Soviet policy as interpreted by them. 
The error inherent in this estimate was clearly demonstrated by subsequent 
events. The danger that such pre-conceptions will control the weighing of the 
facts as events unfold is evident. 
The influence of these and other factors resulted in several intelligenc:: 
judgments and estimates which, in the retrospect, proved to be erroneous. A 
few of these will be mentioned. 
The fact that the intelligence community did not accept the fact that 
organized Soviet ground combat units were being introduced into Cuba until pho­
tographic confirmation of this fact was obtained on October 25, and the related 
fact that the number of Soviets in Cuba was substantially underestimated 
throughout the entire crisis have already been discussed. 
It has also been noted that the intelligence community did not estimate 
that strategic missiles would be introduced into Cuba until photographic con­
firmation was obtained on October 14th. It appears that, on this point, the 
analysts were strongly influenced by their philosophical judgment that it 
would be contrary to Soviet policy to introduce strategic missiles into Cuba. 
In retrospect, it appears that the indicators to the contrary were not given 
proper weight. Among other things the discovery of the surface-to-air missile: 
complex in the San Cristobal area on August 29th could logically have led to 
the assumption that they were being constructed to protect a strategic missile 
installation since it was clear that these SA-21 s were not being emplaced for 
the purpose of protecting any existing or known military installation.
