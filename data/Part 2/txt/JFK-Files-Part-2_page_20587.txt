The WONAAC is self-described in its literature 
as being for~ed by the national conference of 
more than 1,000 women held in New York City,

women from 29 states and 253 organizations came 
together to unite their efforts in the Qational 
f'ight for the repeal of all abortion laws and 
for the corollary demands of no forced pterilization 
and repea.l of' contraception laws. The conference 
called for a massive show of force for these goals 
in a march on Washington, D. c., and San Francisco, 
California, November 20,.1971. WONAAC is based 
on a program of legislative, judicial, and 
mass de~onstration activities on a local and 
national level, and seeks to unite all women in 
the fight for the right of abortion.
