Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests 
for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the 
Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after 
consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination 
Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head 
of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the 
Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and 
li
the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. OtConnor concerning these 
proposed interviews. Mr. otconnor said that he had been contacted by 
Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews. 
In this regard, 0 'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed 
draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment 
rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. 0 tConnor 
indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the 
Committee in the near future. 
The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor 
l 
ha¥e caused the Office of Legal Analysis to receive complaints concerning 
this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark 
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular 
problem is resolve9, receiving protests from their superiors on the 
Committee. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
You will be kept advised of developments concerning this 
matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what 
effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.
