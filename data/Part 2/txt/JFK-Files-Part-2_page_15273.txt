State has previously granted clearance for FBI programs to O 
develop sources and informants in the diplomatic establishments in the ~ 
United States of sev~ral Afr~can countries for the purpose of develop~ngij 
needed intelligence information. State clearance for these programs is~ 
limited to our investigating logical persons who may be so developed. 8 
Prior to actually contacting such persons to determine their potential, ~ 
State clearance is again obtained for each person being considered. In?; 
the past, State has indicated it feels that because of the risks involved""'; 
we should only consid~r for development as sources, American citizens • ~ 
i. 
employed at African diplomatic establishments. However, State has· 1 l 
indicated that where there is an investigative need for such a sourc~,
