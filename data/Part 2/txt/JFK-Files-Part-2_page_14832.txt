STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES; 
JOSEPH . ABRAMS . 
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
, This-case was referred.to us by the Attorney.General 
on 1·12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George 
L~des, a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) Commissfoner James E. Sargent, and Joseph 
Abrams, a New York promoter_ of unsavory reputation .... 
We have reviewed volumirious SEC files here and in 
New York and have interviewed numerous persoris in and out of 
SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms. We determined 
I 
that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters 
while Ledes was still with that agency. We are now eng~ged 
in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent 
knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing 
Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other 
records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes 
relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams' 
l
lo~ns may_constit~te p~yme1;t '?f compensation to Ledes ~nd thus 
bring the~r relationship within the scope of the Conflict of 
Interest Statutes. . :· • • . . . . 
. . 
It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and 
'
Abrams were associated with Tony Russo, ex-confidential 
assistant to former Attorney General Brownell. Russo has not 
. beeri alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter. 
The case is being given top priority in handling both 
in the field and at the Seat of Government .
