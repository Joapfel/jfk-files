Later that same day S.\C Shanklin informed the Director 
that the tape of Oswald'; voice had been erased: "It 
should be noted that the :1.ctual tape from which this 
transcript was made has b:en erased." (Teletype from

The confusion about whether or not there wa~ a tape 
·apparently continued for several days after the SAC in 
Dallas •informed the Director that such a tape did not

Cablegram to the director which said: 
There appears to be some confusion in that no 
tapes were taken to tallas· but only typewritten 
transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not· being 
• available because they had~ been erased.

of the voice of an ir.dividual who identified him­
self as Lee Oswald.
