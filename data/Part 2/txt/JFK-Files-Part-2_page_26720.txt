agencies in Miami plus the State government enforcement agencie 
up the wall and, of course, I guess it was around -- the 
Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess 
about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they 
started to tighten up. 
I am sure the AHOTS were in part responsible for proposing 
alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when' 
there was going to he A. raid against Cuba bv one of these 
militant groups. A number of times raids were aborted, picked 
up by the Coast Guard or Florida Coastal Patrol or the Bureau, 
this type of thing. 
~ These people were arrested? 
A. Oh, yes. 
Q. Prosecuted? 
A. Not reallv. 
(l. Any of them American citizens? 
A. Not to my knowledge. 
Q. This would be Alpha 66 .type groups? 
A. I don't know whether this .guy -- well, you know, they 
are still after this Masferrer and this guv Dcinestevez. I don' 
know if they ever did get him in jail but.they had.him up on 
so many charges and he was a Cuban exile that made it big here. 
He was a boat manufacturer, small boats, but whether he ever 
served any time or not I don't know. I know he was convicted 
but he was always walking around Miami when I was there.
