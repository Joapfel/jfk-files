SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
(S) IMS/FAB provided a main index search response 
to IMS/ESG/HCS. A 201 (that dated back only to 1977) 
and a DCD file were located. 
(U) DA/OIM/JFK responded to the ARRB in February 
1998 that the "search determined the Agency has no 
record of any association with George Herbert Walker 
Bush during the 1963 time period." 
CIA-IR-11 - Warren Commission critics (Does CIA 
maintain files or records on specified critics - other 
than press clippings?) 
(U) The DO provided an unclassified response for 
"any files or records on Warren Commission critics 
Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold 
Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher below. In addition to 
these records, our research did surface a reference to 
a file titled "Garrison Investigation of Kennedy 
Assassination" which was opened in 1969 and closed in 
1996. At the direction of the ARRB staff, no material 
in response to FOIA requests or news clippings in 
Public Affairs was included. 
A. Edward J. EPSTEIN - The DO has no identifiable 
information on subject. Our search did surface the 
name Edward Epstein; however, by using additional 
biographic data known about subject, we were able to 
dismiss this name as a false "hit." 
B. Josiah THOMPSON - Subject was _of operational 
interest to the DO circa 1962; therefore, a 201 file 
does exist on this individual. ARRB staff member Combs 
reviewed this file in August 1998. 
C. Mark LANE - Our search produced references to two 
documents: (1) An Agency dispatch from Germany dated 
23 January 1970, and (2) An OGC letter dated 29 March 
1977. Both of these documents are available for 
review. The OGC letter concerns a 1976 FOIA request -­
Mark Lane was one of the individuals requesting the 
FOIA action -- which involves two dispatches dated 1967
