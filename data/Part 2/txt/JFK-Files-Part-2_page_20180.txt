', 
For the information of New York, referenced-Bureau 
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued 
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources. 
·\ The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be. 
conducted in~ most discreet manner and that no action was 
' to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringemK;it 
by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of _Pennsylv· nia,. 
~ l 
1· ., The case file of captioned organization has be n. I 
t • ' reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned • 1
'' .• ·\i organization and it has been determined that while some o 
the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia 
ar~a are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist 
Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance \ 
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be \ 
individuals interested in~social change rather than revolu-3 
tionary political cha.mr4.,~u /· I I . p~ ~~ ... 
In view of the fact £hat WONAAC represents basically 
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of 
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. s. Supreme 
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing 
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a 
____.c.Q!ltinued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not 
··@esis rable.
