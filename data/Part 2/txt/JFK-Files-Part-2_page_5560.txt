Nosenko Records 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
I have reviewed the descriptions of the folders proposed by the ARRB Staff. While I see this as a success to have them support our 
position and have some concern about the detail included within the descriptions. We had an occasion in the past to ask for a legal 
opinion about a former employee's access rights to Nosenko's file and were told he is entitled protection under the Privacy Act. Nosenko 
has already personally expressed (in a letter to the Agency) his concern and objection about potential release of information about him. I 
think we should carefully consider the amount of detail included in the public release and whether it violates his rights under the Privacy 
Act. 
I trust t.he judgment of those that have reviewed these descriptions as to content in relationship to other released material and 
classification but I just want to raise a mild concern about the detail contained in the descriptions of folder content. I will not object to 
the these if everyone feels compelled to accept them to protect the success we have achieved as long as they are determined to not be in 
violation of his privacy rights. 
In future efforts to protect NBR information, I would like to see less detail in the description if at all possible.
