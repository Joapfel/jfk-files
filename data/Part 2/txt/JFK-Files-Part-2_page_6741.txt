Dear Mr. Chairman: 
The ~irector has asked-me co respond ~o your letter of 
6 April requesting certain information regarding CIA holdings 
of records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. 
We do have a significant number of records relating to the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, although many of 
these records were originated by the FBI or by investigating 
conmdttees of the Congress. We believe that a significa~t 
portion of our records could be released if H.J. Resolutin 454 ,.._ 
were enacted into law. A 
I should also pqint out that the Central Intelligence 
Agency i~ cu.rently embarking on its own review of 
aasassination records. I would expect that this review will 
result in the public release of a significant body of 
information. • 
To.help the committee understand the nature and number of 
CIA records pertaining to the assassination, I am enclosing 
the answers to the specific questions you raised in your 
letter.
