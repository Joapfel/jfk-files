'This ha_s been a long 
and cornplicatc;d job, t_he .difficulty of which..has been compou1_1dcd by the neees-eity, 
at least in-part through public events, to plan and projl'ct a total revision of 
instruction in the CA field. As a·result, Mr. Smith.has not yet had the opportunity 
to teach. • This will come 11hortly, however, when a new course. begins on 8 ~fay. 
The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly 
profeaaitJnal approach he has taken in all.of the prl"paratory work he has undcr­
·taken. He has bceri eminently successful in est_ablishi1_18 us~Cul new rcJahonships
