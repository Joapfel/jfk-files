(Note: The courses ot action which follow are a prel1.minary _ 
submission suitable only tor planning purposes. They are 
arranged neither chronologically nor in ascendir>g order. 
Together ifith s11111lar inputs from other agencies. they are 
intended to provide a point ot departure tor the development 
or a single. integrated, time-phased plan. SUOh a plan would 
permit the evaluation or individual projects within the context 
or cumulative, correlated actions designed to lead inexorably 
to the objective ot adequate justification tor US military 
intervention in CUba). 
1. Since it would seem desirable to use legitimate 
provocation as the basis tor US military intervention in Cuba 
a c_over and deception plan, to include requisite preliminary 
actions such as has been developed-in response to Task 33 c. 
could be executed as an initial !!rtort to provoke CUban 
reactions. Harassment plus deceptive actions to convince the 
Cubans ot 1mm1nent·invasion would be emphasized. OUr mi"litary 
posture throughout execution ot the plan will allow~ rapid 
change from exercise to intervention it CU.ban response justifies. 
2. A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned 
·to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine 
appearance ot being done by hostile Cuban rorces. 
a. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in 
chronological order) : -
(1) • Start rumors (many). use clandestine radio. 
(2) Land flt1endly CU.bans in un11'orm llover-the-t~nce" 
to stage attack on base. 
(3) Capture CUban {friendly) saboteurs inside the 
base. 
(4) start riots near the base main gate (friendly 
CU.bans).
