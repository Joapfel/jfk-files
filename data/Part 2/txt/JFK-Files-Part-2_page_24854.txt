October 14 
The 40 Committee met to discuss, among other topics, Chile. In ad­
dition to the 40 Committee principals (Kissinger, John Mitchell, David 
Packard, Alexis Johnson, Admiral Moorer), the meeting was attended by. 
Karamessines, William Broe and General Robert Cushman of the CIA, Charles 
Meyer from State, Viron Vaky, and Ambassador Korry, who had returned to 
Washington from Santiago for a short period of consultation. 
According to the minutes of that meeting, Kissinger asked Karames~ines 
to give a rundown on the latest developments and present situation in Chile. 
Karamessines pointed out that "a coup climate does not presently exist." 
He noted that "the unpredictable General Viaux is the only individual seem­
ingly ready to attempt a coup and ... his chances of mounting a successful 
one were slight." Ambassador Korry agreed with Karamessines' assessment 
and stated that "as of now it seemed almost certain that Allende would 
be voted into office on October 24th.'' Kissinger then observed that 
''there presently appeared to be little the U.S. can do to influence the 
Chilean situation.one way or ~nother.'' Other participants at the meet-
ing concurred. (Memorandum for the Record/Minutes of the Meeting of the 
40 Committee, 14 October 1970, 16 October 1970)
