NOTES ON THE SCHEDULES OF GAIN OR LOSS 
ON THE SAL'E OF MHMUTUAL INVESTMENTS 
The MHMUTUAL portfolio, from which the attached schedules of gain or loss 
, on the· sale of investments Here taken, is not an accounting document in the 
•• sense that it is used to account for funds handled by the Activity. The purpose 
of the portfolio is to provide management with a picture of the investments held 
by the complex at any point in time. The portfolio is not audited per se, and in 
past years no attempt was rr.ade to insure that each presentation tied directly 
back to the previou~ portfolio; that has been done in recent years. Due to the 
lack of audit, certain errors were not discovered, and they were carried forward 
to the present~ One example is on the 1970 presentation of .the sales of stocks 
to date. The total sale price of $2,226,883.29 when subtracted from the total 
purchase price of $2,246,793.93 results in a loss of $19,910.64 instead of the 
loss of $27,802.99 as shown under the co1umn marked gain or (loss) on sales. 
The total gain on sales to date should therefore be $177,437.51. For some un­
known reason, the balance carried forward to the 1971 schedule of gain on the 
sale of equity is stated as $206,314~47 which involves an overstaterr~nt in the 
cumulative gain on the sale of equity in the amount of $28,876.96. This error 
has been carried forMard to the present. 
Note #2 
The portfolio figures cannot be directly tied in with the financial state­
ments for MHMUT1JAL in the case of bonds since the statements reflect an ave-:rage 
cost for all the bonds of a particular issuer; and the appreciation on a dis~ 
counted.bond is'recorded as income each year with a corranensurate increase in the 
book value of tha bond. 
Note #3 
The only bond transaction during 1970 was the sale of $50,000 of U.S. 
Tri~asury bonds. This transaction is found on the schedule titled "Debenture 
In•1es tme;its.
