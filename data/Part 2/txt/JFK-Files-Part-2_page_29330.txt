COMM\TTEE SENSL1lVE 
Phillips, page 7. 
Mr. Phillips was asked if the CIA shared assets and 
informants with the FBI in Mexico. He said that he did not 
know of any such cases but there was coordination and liaison 
with the Bureau on the surveillance operations. 
Mr. Phillips acknowledged that one additional area in 
which the Station and the FBI shared an interest was the 
colony of American expatriates in Mexico. He said that he 
was not sure of who had the responsibility for that area in 
\.. ,::..,f(, 
the Station but that it may sf, been Ms. Ann Goodpasture. Mr. 
Phillips stated that he was not aware of any Agency liaison 
in Mexico City with either Army or Navy regarding counter­
intelligence or counter-espionage cases. He said that he had 
never heard of any arguments that may have occured concerning 
whose responsibility it was to report Oswald's initial contact 
with the Soviet Embassy or about the extensiveness of the 
Station's reporting after the assassination. 
Mr. Phillips does remember Viola June COBB. "Blonde, 
flew an airplane, track record for hitting a lot of beds in 
Cuba, had a twin sister involved in aviation. That's what 
comes to mind." He vaguely remembers messages or reports 
from or about her coming out of his Cuban shop but he believes 
that she was run out of Washington or Miami as an asset and 
that someone from one of those two places would have regularly 
come to Mexico to run her. 
Mr. Phillips stated that he did not recall an officer 
with a hair lip or who spoke with a lisp.
