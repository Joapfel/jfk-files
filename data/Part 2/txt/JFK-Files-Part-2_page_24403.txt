would participate in a plan to 11dispose" of Castro* (Maheu, 7/29, 
p. 8). Maheu had known Roselli since :the late 1950 1 s (Maheu, 7/29, 
pp. 58-60). Although Maheu claims not to have been aware of the 
extent of Roselli's underworld connections and activities, he 
recalled .that 
"it was certainly evident to me that he was able to 
accomplish things in Las Vegas when nobody else seemed 
to get the same kind of attention" (Maheu, 7/29, p. 60). 
O'Connell had previously met Roselli at Maheu's home (Maheu, 7/29, 
p. 8). O'Connell and Maheu each claimed that the other had raised 
the idea of using Roselli, and Maheu said O~Connell was aware that 
- d1d' Roselli had contacts with the gambling syndicate (Maheu, 
p. 8; O'Connell, pp. 15-16)~

Maheu was at first reluctant to become involved 
in the operation because it might interfere with his relationf3hip 
with his new client, Howard Hughes. He finally agreed because he 
felt that he owed the Agency a commitment (O'Connell, pp. 12-13, 
103). O'Connell recalled that Maheu was to approach Roselli 
using a cover story that he represented business firms suffering 
heavy financial losses caused by Castr,o's actions** (O'Connell, 
p. 16). O'Connell testified that Maheu was told to offer money: 
* Maheu testified that he was told that the plan to assassinate 
Castro was one phase of a larger proj~ct to invade Cuba (Maheu, 
pp. 1, 13, 47).· 
** Roselli testified that the story was developed later and 
used as a mutual "cover" by O'Connell, Maheu, and Roselli in 
dealing with Cubans recruited for the project (Roselli, pp. 16-17.).
