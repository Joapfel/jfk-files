a plan would force the USSR .(then facing a shortage 
of tanker bottoms in the world market) to transport 
its own crude to Cuba and. to "provide technicians

to alienate Venezuela and Mexico, norrnal~y among

In addition to petroleum refineries as targets. 
for sabotage, plans were also made ·to disrupt the . ·~ 
Cuban microwave system. Unlike the plans to disrupt 
the Cuban petroleum industry -- which would directly 
involve properties of the international.oil companies 
the sabotage p~ogram for the microwave networks, 
as late as February of 1961, specifically stated that 
attacks should be limited to .the Cuban operated net 
with "hands'off RCA·and Dumont systems, which are to 
remain intact·for later consideration.".40/ Also 
* In fact, the Cuban refinery technicians themselves 
did an excellent job of adapting the plants to t.he 
use of Soviet crude. ·The former manager of the 
Standard Oil refinery commented to this effect after 
reviewing the all source ·intelligence ·materials avail­
able on ·the plant. He ·was pleased -- at least in 
one sense -- to note that Standard's training program 
has apparently been quite successful!·
