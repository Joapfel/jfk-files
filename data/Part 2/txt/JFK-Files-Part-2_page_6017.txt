"(C) **CIA-IR-32 AMW0RLD. The Review Board 
seeks information regarding the purpose of 
AMWORLD and its connection with the Cuban exile 
groups. After a thorough search of the DO

communications with various DO Latin American 
Division officers, we formulated the following 
as a definition of the purpose of the AMWORLD 
operation. The AMWORLD operation was a covert 
Agency effort to provide support to several 
Cuban exile groups. This was an "autonomous" 
operation designed to bring the ex_ile groups 
under the direct control of Manuel Artime 
Buesa. AMWORLD's mission was to cause a popular 
uprising in Cuba through the use of propaganda 
and paramilitary forces to ultimately overthrow 
Fidel Castro. 
(C) The Agency provided direct and indirect 
financial aid and technical advisory support to 
these groups but did not participate directly 
in the day-to-day operations. ARTIME was 
responsible for recruitment of AMWORLD
