For -Jin Braden, whose true iclcn ti ty is Eugene Hale Brading . , 
is a man with singularly awesome direct ties to the highest 
levels of the Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to 
the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities 
of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and 
outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an 
indispensable link - or leader - of organized crime's 
far flung network of "controlled violence" specialists 
and professional hit men. 
Braden's involvement with the Mafia's highest echelon 
"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast 
and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris­
diction. ~ccording to federal authorities working with the 
Justice Department's organized crime stril~e force units, and 
according to other high government sources cited by author 
Noyes, Jim Draden is now serving as personal courier for 
Heyer LansJ<:.y. 
The i~portc1nce of this r..ysterious man who ~-:as picked. up 
under a false name across the street from the Texas Book 
Depository just nomcnts after the shots were fired on 
November 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized. 
Though there were several innocent witnesses or bystanders 
in the area of the assassination who were also arrested or 
brought in for questioning by the Dallas police, all of whom 
were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at 
t1121t precise moncnt docs in fact raise an incredible specter, 
and may indeed huvc been the monumental slip-up that critics 
of the Warren Commission now attest to.
