was a target of opportunity or someone to be debriefed in

tion, if the were to come up with the information, he 
would coma in and report it and I would authorize him to go 
into that city and find him, because the information could 
come in many ways. 
Sae, they were known as the Cuban municipalities and 
operations in the city of Miami, and everybody that came out 
from likd a province or a state would register in it, and 
as soon as they got information, the word would get around that 
Joe Blow cama in or something like that, and th~ word would get 
back.to the , and the would say, w~ll, we should 
discuss with this fellow, and that's it. 
Mr. Wides. You never got any requests for personnel 
to be made available for that kind of task from Washington? 
Mr. §arno. To debrief an individual? 
Mr. Wides. Or to travel in general. 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, yes, they would come down and say, we 
would like a person because Washington would hear of an 
individual and would lik~ for him to go over and debrief. 
Mr. Wides. What office?
