tomorrow to review the cover paper from which this swnmary is 
drawn. I know Eric has some problems with the .cover paper, bot 
editorially, because they view it as overly simplistic and 
harsh beca'use it·· reflects all of the Inspector General's 
judgments, but they have some problems with cover in general,

Senator Huddleston. I have some problem with this page

11 highlights the argument, I think, correctly, but it seems ~o me 
12 it leaves;the impression that here is a case where a fellow's 
13 cover or lack of cover resulted in his death_. 
14 I think the Agency people have specifically said to us

21 and say, well, it is all his fault.· 
22 Senator Huddleston. He didn • t protect his cover., he 
23 didn't do what they advised him to do, and you see down here 
24 \E have another quote which says, referring to international 
25 terrorism and incitement for these kind of people to take the
