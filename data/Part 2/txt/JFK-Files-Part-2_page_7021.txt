Wickham seconded Pereira's assessment that we have a very 
good working relationship with the staff. Under the

Healey and Sheehy, seemed satisfied. Majority staffer 
Eberwein, perhaps reflecting concerns voiced by deputy 
majority director Dupart about protecting Agency sources and

asked her to draft language amending the act. It had not 
been my impression during the briefing that staff had been 
especially concerned about the act to the point of intending 
to modify it, and its also unclear whether Eberwein was 
acting on behalf of senior majority staff or the membership 
in asking OCA to suggest modifications to the act. (S)
