BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be 11liaison or intermediary" 
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS 01DELL. Whether or not 
the IBVISONS and 0 1DELL will maintain liaison regarding 
matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a 
matter for them to decide. In view of IEVISON1 s statement 
with respect to advising M.A..BTIN LUTHER KING independently 
of Party instructions., it would seem that DAVIS may not have 
any success in maintaining liaison with the IBVISONS and 
HUNTER PITTS QtDELL. The IEVISONS and 0 1DELL are aware of 
the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment 
by the Party. 
MARTIN tUTHER KING, according to IBM HARRIS, is 
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL, 
BEN DAVIS., JIM JACKSON and ,::LAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true., 
genuine., Marxist-Leninist f.r•om the top of his head to the tips 
of his toes." In the Party: the report is that MARTIN LUTHER 
KING is following a Marxist--Leninist line. 
NY 694-S* advised that he asked IBM HARRIS whether 
or not, to the latter rs kno1vledge, MARTIN LUTBER KING was 
a member of the CPUSA. LEM. HARRIS replied that he did not~ 
know. . )
