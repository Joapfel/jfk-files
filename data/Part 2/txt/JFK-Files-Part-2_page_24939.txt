EPILOGUE 
Approved by Drafting 
Subcommittee on 9/9/75 
We do not believe that the acts which we have examined represent the' 
real American character. They do not reflect the ideals which have i:;iven 
the people of this country and of the world hope for a better, fuller, 
fairer life. We regard the assassination plots as aberrations. 
We must not adopt the tactics of the enemy. Means are as importa~t 
as ends. Crisis' makes it tempting to ignore the wise restraints tha.t n:i.i!<e 
men fre.'e. l3u I;: each time we do so, each time the means we use .:ire wrong, 
our inner strei1gth, the strength which makes ·us free, is lessened. 
Despite our distaste for what we have seen, we have great faith in 
this country. The story is sad, but this country has the strength to hear 
it and to learri from it. We must rem~in a people who confront our .mistakes 
and resolve not to repeat them. If we do n6t, we will decline; bui, if w~ 
do, our fu·cure will be· worthy of the best of our past.
