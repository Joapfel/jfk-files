in somo sort of cap~r involving a U-Raul truck. 
Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of 
you to supply $5,000 worth of equipment like explosives, 
detonators, .30 caliber rifles, .45 caliber handguns, radios 
and boat radar, would you have supplied that ~quipment to Harvey 
or to anyone he designated without asking him what the purpose 
of the operation was? 
Mr. Halley. Y_es, I would have supplied it to Harvey or 
to his designated representative, deoending on how that person 
identified himself to me with th~ equipment that he requested. 
That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he 
had wanted this material for any op~rational activity, I would 
have seen to it that it was issued to hi~. That is the way the 
Agency functions. 
Mr. Baron. Would it have been standard procedure in a 
paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have 
been traceable to the United States as the Ir. Report indicates 
was done in this case? 
Mr. Halley. It depends. It depends on what was the 
. sponsorship that was trying to be conveyed t.o t.ha paramilitary 
group. 
In other words, let us say there was a Venezuelan business 
man who may have been giving some assistance to a Cuhan exile 
group. If somebody had gotten in touch with that Venezuelan 
busin~ssman and he was saying I brought weapons into Florida
