willingness to respond to follow-up requests more quickly. While there are a . 
significant number of requests outstanding, the increased responsiveness of the .CIA 
bodes well for the completion of these requests in a timely manner. 
Since our December report, the Board's FBI team has reviewed an additional 20,000 
• •• pages of records from the FBI's HSCA files. Included in these files are the names of 
individuals who have a prominent role in the history surrounding the assassination of 
President Kennedy. .Although this page count is higher than last month, we have 
advised the FBI that th~ volume must return to earlier levels to ensure that the review is 
completed in a timely manner. 
As I reported in my January 16, 1998 letter to you, all of the agencies and offices to 
which you aqdressed letters in December have now contacted us and pledged to 
complete their work in a timely manner. In particular, recent meetings and· 
communications with the In~ Revenue Service have been fruitful and provide 
reason to believe that the IRS will fulfill its obligations under the law. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on the Board's 
federal compliance program. The State Department has submitted a draft final 
compliance statement and we expect that its obligations under the JFK Act will be 
completed and appropriately documented by early March. The Joints Chiefs of Staff 
has submitted its final compliance statement, and the Board has agreed that its 
compliance statement is complete. The Social Security Administration also has 
submitted its final compliance statement and has now received notification that its 
obligations under the law are fulfilled. We continue to V(Ork with the other federal 
agencies that have obligations under the JFK Act ~d the compliance program is 
proving to be an effective mechanism to document their progress. 
Again, thank you for your continuing interest in the work of the Review Board and the 
support that you have provided in working with various federal agencies. Please do 
not hesitate to have a member of your staff contact me if you have any comments or 
questions. I can be reached at 724-0088, ext 226.
