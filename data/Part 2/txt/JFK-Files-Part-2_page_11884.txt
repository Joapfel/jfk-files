I, _____ , have voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the 
Federal Bu~eau of Investigation in a matter affecting the 
security of the United States. I consider it a patriotic 
duty to so cooperate and agree to maintain this relation­
ship in strict con+idence. I understand t~at I am not a 
Federal employee and will not represent myself as such. I 
further agree not to make any disclosure or exploit in any 
way information which I may obtain or any activity in which 
I ma.y engage on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
both while I am actively associated with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and thereafter, unless authoriz~d to do so by 
the Bureau.

Execution of party questionnaires 
Informants, particularly in Communist Party, often must execute party 
questionnaires and in doing so should be instructed to be extremely 
careful not to jeoparidze their position as informants. If necessary~ 
each item in questionnaire should be discussed with informant. 
Informant's activity in organizations 
a~ Informants in organizations must be impr,essed with necessity of 
• c.;.rrying on normal activity, such as canvassing, sale, and dis­
trib~tion of literature, leaflets, etc. 
b. When feasible~ informants should be instructed to accept direction 
from leaders; request instruction and interpretation of organiza­
tion's precepts; request leaders to furnish sources for study 
purposes; and enter discussions, not quietly sit back as observers. 
c. Changes in organization's conduct, policy, or strategy should be 
reported on as they occur. Have informants give their opinions of 
motivation behind such changes, but be certain opinions are labeled 
as such. 
d. Informants must be encouraged to increase contacts within their orbit 
in order to gain higher positions, but in such manner as to avoid 
suspicion.
