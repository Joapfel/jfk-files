who cau ■ ed hia death? 
Mr. Tweedy. I muot oay I have a hard time following the 
question. Thia mcane that Lumumba arrivod undor the Congo-
leae auspices in Xutanga and that Elizabathville, the baae at 
Eli~abethville didn't know he was coming, our base, didn't 
know very much, didn't presumably know very much about what 
occurred, and reported very briefly on what they had heard. 
Mr. Baron. Let me put the queation in context. 
On January 17, Lumwnba had beon flown to Kutanga? 
Mr. Tweedy. Yeo. 
Mr. Baron. And later Ufiitcd Nations invoatiqationa co:--.· 
eluded that. it was the 17th or perhaps the 18th that Lu.mumbo 
was actually killed in Kutanga. 
I was asking you before whether this cable would indi­
cate that the United States would have been involved in 
bringing about the death of Lwnumba? 
Mr. Tweedy. I would have thought that it merely in­
dicates that this part of the Agency, i.e., Elizabethville 
had no idea he was coming, knew nothing about his !ate 
except thc9e few phrases that he put down here and would imp:· 
although it certainly doesn't say so, that he was addin~ a 
1 ittle information to what was perhaps an enormously ignoran: 
Leopoldville which, of course, is the fact of the matter. 
we didn't know how all this was occurring and were not able 
to follow the event except ofter the event.
