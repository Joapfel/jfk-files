The' case involves u. s. plane piloted by two Americans, 
Rundquist aru:l Shergalis, which was shot down March 21, 1960, while 
trying to smuggle four Cubans out of that count_ry with resulting 
arrest of Rundquist and Shergalts. FBI source in Miami advised 
March 22, 1960, that incident was staged by Castro agents to provide 
Castro 'with basis for renewed attacks against ll. • So for allowing 
illegal flights to Cuba. On March 23, 1960, this hoax was e.x,posed 
when Shergal is gave statement to ll. s. Ertibassy adrni tt ing role as 
Castro agent and implicating various Cubans in u. s. and Cuba. We 
conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed 
substantial evidence showing that Rurldqu'ist-Shergal is flight was, 
in fact, instigate~ by Castro agents. Miami reports of April 1, April 6, 
April 15, and May 6, 1960, cavering our investigation, have been 
furnished.to Department and other interested agencies. 
On May 3, 1960, Federal Grand Jury at Miami, 1J!hich was 
)
convened on April 6, 1960, returned indictments against Shergalis 
and Hee.tor Garcia Soto (Cuban Air Fo,:ce employee at Miami who served 
as inte~~ediary between Shergalis and Cuban intelligence officials) 
charging'\them wi.th violations of Foreign Agents Registration Act of 
1938, as amended. Indictments were also returned against Shergalis 
and Rundquist chargi,y violations of Federal Aviation Act, administered 
by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plan. 
Shergalis is still in custody of Cuban officials in that country, 
Cuban Government having rejected llo s. request that Shergal is and 
Rundquist be extradited to face charges in this country. At time 
indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore, 
indictments were sealed _and bench warrants were issued for arrest 
oJ Shergalis and Garcia. 
Garcia returned to .Miami on afternodn oj May 4, 1960, and 
I 
was arrested by our Miami Office at .Miami International Airport. , 
Press release was issued SAC, Miami, concerning arrest and subsequently 
on same date Department issued press release concerning indictments 
oj She_rgal is, G-arcia an,d Rundquist._ Arraignment of Garcia was 
originally s~heduled for May 6, 1960, but was postponed. until 
.May 20, at request of defense attor~ey. Bond for Garcia was set 
l
at {?10,000 and on afternoon pf .May 6, 1960, bo-~ posted with
