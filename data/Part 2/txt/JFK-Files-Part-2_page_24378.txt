Because oL our faith in the democratic sys tern, and the paraniount

importance of strengthenin[; the institutions of this country, the Committee 
believes the truth about the assassination allep,ations shoulJ be told. 
Den,ocracy depends upon a well-informed elector a tc. Truth underlies bothS[fL,<((J ;·-r/... f'

the possible injury to our national reputation, the Corm;iittee believes that 
foreign peoples will, upon sober refl~ction, respect the United States Qore 
fo.r keepinz faith <.vith its democratic ideal than they will conden,n us for 
the misconduct itself. 
The fact ci1at portions of tl1e ~tory have already been publicly dis­
closed only accentuates the need for full disclosure. Innuendo and rnis-
l· 
leading partial disclosures are neither fair to the individuals involved, 
nor a responsible way to lay the groundwork for inforn,e<l • public policy . 1 .
