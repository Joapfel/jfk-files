MININT. (SOURCE COMMENT: ONLY ROCA, SANCHEZ AND MARTINEZ-AMORES 
KNEW THAT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN TOLD, AND BOTH SANCHEZ AND 
MARTINEZ-AMORES WERE TRUSTED MEMBERS OF THE CCC.) 
4. CCC'S SUSPICIONS CONCERNING ROCA HAVE GROWN STRONGER IN 
LIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING INCIDENTS: 
A. CCC MEMBER FELIX ((DIAZ)) WAS DENIED A REQUEST FOR 
A VISA TO THE U.S. BY THE U.S. INTERESTS SECTION. THE REPORTED 
GROUNDS FOR DENIAL WERE THAT DIAZ HAD NOT SUBMITTED SUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY THE VISA. ROCA WAS HEARD TO TELL DIAZ THAT 
HIS REQUEST HAD BEEN UNDERMINED BY FELIX ((BONNE)) CARCASSES, THE 
CCC LEADER. BONNE DENIED THIS ACTION, SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE 
HAD NO INTEREST IN UNDERMINING DIAZ. 
B. IN EARLY 1993, JORGE GONZALEZ, A CLOSE FRIEND OF 
ROCA, INFORMED THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT AN AUTHORESS, IDENTIFIED AS 
MARIANA ((BADELL)) (PHONETIC), WAS PREPARING A BIOGRAPHY OF CUBAN 
PRESIDENT FIDEL ((CASTRO)) AND WANTED TO MEET BONNE. THE REASON 
FOR SUCH A MEETING IN CONNECTION WITH A BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO WAS 
NOT CLEAR, BUT THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN GONZALEZ' HOME, AND 
INCLUDED BADELL, BONNE, AND MARTINEZ-AMORES. THE CCC LEADERS 
NOTED THAT BADELL APPEARED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE COURSE 
OF THE MEETING. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD HAD LUNCH WITH AN 
OFFICIAL OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA, WHO WAS ASSISTING HER 
WITH THE BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO BY PUTTING HER IN TOUCH WITH ONE 
CARLOS ALBERTO ((MONTANER)) IN MADRID, WHO WOULD EDIT THE BOOK. 
SHE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE SPANISH OFFICAL, BUT DESCRIBED HIM IN 
SUCH DETAIL THAT BOTH BONNE AND MARTINEZ-AMORES RECOGNIZED HIM AS 
JORGE ((DE ORUETA)), A LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE CCC. WHEN THE 
CONVERSATION WAS RELAYED TO DE ORUETA BY THE CCC, HE RECALLED 
BADELL HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIM BY VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE. HE 
FURTHER RECALLED THE LUNCH AND MENTION OF THE BOOK, BUT DECLARED 
THE MONTANER INFORMATION TO BE SPURIOUS. THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
SUGGESTED TO CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT THERE WAS COORDINATION 
AMONG INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF BEING DIRECTED BY CUBAN SECURITY. 
C. IN 1993 A GROUP OF DISSIDENTS, INCLUDING BONNE, WAS 
INVITED TO THE HOME OF PIOTR ((MIKISKA)) (PHONETIC), FIRST 
SECRETARY AT THE CZECH EMBASSY, TO ATTEND A VISIT FROM THE CZECH 
VICE CHANCELLOR. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS KIND OF CONTACT WAS 
ANATHEMA TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.) THE CZECH INVITATION TO BONNE 
WAS SENT THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE BY WORD OF MOUTH VIA ROCA. BY 
COINCIDENCE, ANOTHER CCC REPRESENTATIVE VISITING MIKISKA WITHIN A 
DAY OR TWO OF WHEN THE INVITATION WAS RELAYED TO ROCA WAS ASKED 
ABOUT THE INVITATION TO BONNE, AS BONNE HAD NOT RESPONDED TO THE 
CZECH EMBASSY. THE CCC REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDED THE QUERY 
REGARDING THE INVITATION IN HIS REPORT OF THE MEETING TO THE CCC, 
GIVING BONNE HIS FIRST NOTIFICATION THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN AN 
INVITATION. ROCA FINALLY PASSED THE MESSAGE TO THE HOME OF 
GEORGINA DE LAS MERCEDES ((GONZALEZ)) CORBO, ONE OF BONNE'S CHIEF 
ASSISTANTS, TWO HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FUNCTION. 
D. IN MID 1995, REINALDO ((ROQUE)) MALHERBE OF CCC 
REPORTED THAT VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE WAS UNDERMINING ELIZARDO
