(U) To date· over~ CIA employee names, mostly DO, 
have been protected and are subject to review by the Board 
in May 1997. Most of these individuals have little or no 
connection to the JFK assassination story. This is far 
more names than had been anticipated when we agreed in March 
1996 to the case-by-case approach. [FYI Note: I estimate 
that approximately /DfOU7 names have been released to date in 
the JFK review]. 
(S) In addition, the decisions made by the Board at the 
May meeting will set a precedent for the potentially 
hundreds of names to come. We have reviewed only the Oswald 
201 file and 12 boxes of the JFK sequestered collection. At 
this point it is impossible to determine the total number of 
· employees mentioned in the JFK collection. [E.or_exam~i!!}

Recommendation 
(AIOU) That the Agency re-visit the name issue with the 
ARRB based on the following considerations: 
* It should be recognized that there are two separate 
aspects of the public interest involved in this matter, 
and that it is necessary to achieve a reasonable 
balance between them. On the one hand, it is clear 
that it is now in the public interest to release as 
much of our JFK collection as is possible. On the 
other hand, it is equally clear that it is in the 
public interest for this Agency to maintain its 
essential security practices in order to be able to 
serve the Nation effectively in accordance with its 
enabling legislation. 
* It is not in the public's interest for one of the 
fundamental principles of an intelligence agency-­
protecting the identity of covert employees--to 
continue to be eroded. While it is not always 
possible to show harm by the release of any one 
individual's name, the magnitude of the JFK release 
clearly has the potential to do harm to the Agency as 
an institution and to national security. There is no 
way to measure the possible effect .of these releases on 
future employees and operations. 
* Since most of the individuals involved .have little or 
no connection with the JFK assassination, the release 
of their true names does not add to the story. The 
substitution of pseudonyms would meet the historian's 
need to track who is saying what, etc.
