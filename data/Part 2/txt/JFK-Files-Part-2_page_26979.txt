Beach where any convention activities were to take place, 
employees of catering services, lir.tosine service, employees 
in -- what do they call it, the Civic Center in Miami. It 
is a big auditorium down there. I forget what they call it. 
Foreign news people and r.iedia, television, radio p~ople. 
Q ;fere these ,oeoole on who:c1 name traces were requested 
all foreign nationals? 
A All foreign nationals. 
·J ·cvas there any check made to deternine whether 
any of them were .'\:nerican citizens? 
A We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement 
that they .have identified these people by nationality before 
we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time 
they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizen 
which we promptly sent Dack to the!'! and told them we could 
not trace~ 
Q And this practice was followed both in 1968 and 
1972? 
That is right. 
Q And where were these names traced? 
,::, They were traced back here and also in Miami. The 
Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check 
here. In the case of Cubans, nrobably the Miami Station had 
more information on the Cubans than we would have back here. 
But the names were traced through Agency files?
