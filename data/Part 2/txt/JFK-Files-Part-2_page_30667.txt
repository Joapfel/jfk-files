travelled through Europe on leave with his family until Spetember, 
1960. He said therefore the conversation could not have taken place 
in the summer of 1960 as the memo states. He said he used the wrong 
in the memo. 
Casasin identified KU~UMP as the Operations Division. He said it 
had a contacts division fot\ debriefing persons. He said the "suitable 
channels" for debriefing referred to in the memo were the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service and the FBI. He said he believed he had 
received maybe one State Department dispatch on the retur. ning American.' 
He· said the dispatch probably originated if Oswald had given up his . 
passport at the Embassy in Moscow and had had to reapply to the embassy 
to be able to return to the United States. Casasin said he believes 
Oswald's contacts with the Embassy in Moscow were initiated by 
Oswald. Casasin said. he only knew whatever appeared in the State Departi 
ment dispatches about Oswald. ,-
He said his statement in the memo that Oswald looked "odd" was the 
CIA's evaluation of Oswald. This was based on the fact that he was ' 
allowed to live in the Soviet Union and permitted to marry a Soviet 
citizen. Casasin said he believed some type of controlled intelligence 
station should approach Oswald; they would be able to contact and talk 
to him in a perfunctory manner for debriefing purposes. 
Casasin said that during the period 1945-60 no more than 10 ~ 
American defectors came to their attention from the State Department , 
and the military. 
Casasin identified the REDSKIN cryptonym as the legal travellers d 
program. It involved using persbns to give information about the p 
Soviet Union who had a "very legitimate" presence in the Soviet Union, 
such as scientists, etc. 
Casasin said the agency which conducted the debriefing of these 
people and defectors would write the information and pass it on. He 
believes therefore that if Oswald had been debriefed he would have 
the information in that form.

Casasin said he believes it is inconceivable that Oswald would 
have been any type of operative of the CIA. However, he also gave his 
opinion that the nature bf KGB operations made it conceivable that Os­
wald could have been a "lay-low" Soviet operative. 
I asked about the CIA interest in Minsk which is reflected in 
casasin's memo. Casasin said it was known that there were some type 
of special design plants in Minsk which were of interest to the CIA.
