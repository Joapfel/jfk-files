Mr. flall~y. No~ 
Now that I read over this thing, I do recall, as I told 
you earlier before you showed me this document something about 
a rented truck and beinq involved with Harvey in providing him 
some logistical support for an activity. I do not recall this 
sp~cific list of equipment bein~•involved,-you know, so~ewhere 
you got this and if I could check it against the files, if there 
arti any files available, I coulrl verify whether this is correct 
or not. 
Mr. Baron. Whether or not the particular list is correct, 
11 you would say that these couple of passages from the IG Report 
12 generally characterize yout' involvt!m,:mt wit.h Harvey in this 
13 Ontl incident correctly? 
14 Mr. Halley. I would want to sharpen this up, because you 
15 have one, two, two paragraphs here. In the first paragraph 
16 there _is a reference to some pills. I had nothinq to do wi t.h 
17 any pills. I have no recollEction of any pills. 
18 Mr. Baron. Let us jump then to th~ very last statement and 
19 let me ask you if this confirms your own sense of your knowledge 
20 The report says: "Harvey says that [Halley)" -- here I 
2l am using your alias ~~-"never knew t.o whom delivery was made nor 
22 for what purpose. [Halley) was merely ca_lled upon to furnish 
23 
24 
25 
support for a headquarters operation from which he was otherwise 
excluded," 
Do~s that generally characterize correctly your point of
