Infermant advised that he has never been a 
member of the American League for Peace and Democracy 
although he has been a member for many years of the Council 
on Foreign Redations. Informant went on to state that he 
wanted to be certain that this would be a matter of recoi.,d 
in Bureau Headquarters as well as the fact that there is not 
one word of truth concerning him in the booko Informant 
stated that he understands that COURTNEY and her husband 
reside in New Orleans, La, and are considered to be erratic 
lndividuals in the area of anti-Commwiist activitYo --V-

NYO indices contain no information concerning 
COURTNEY• .._ (J .. • 
[nformant was told to handle any matters of 
int;erest which he-wished to call to the att;ention of the 
Bureau through the WFO and to refrain from calling the 
NYO in the future unless he was present in NYCt. Informant 
'then said that ho has been in contact with BORIS Go STRELNIKOV, 
Pravda correspondent, in WDC; and he could not understand 
why he has not been contacted by Bureau agents as he would 
like to be of assistance to the Bureau at the present time 
as h0 has been in the past o -....c,-
It is the opinion of the NYO that the American 
Broadcasting Company has not been entirely satisfied with 
informantPs work and he was probably recalled from Hong Kong 
for this reason. The informant~ in turn, has concluded 
that his r~call was·due to some allegation of disloyalty 
in view of a eomment made to him in Hong Kong by a British 
official. The aforementioned book and its contents have 
served to ~onfirm in informant's mind that the reason 
for his r~call from Hong Kong, in fact, stemmed from an 
allegation of disloyalty. -V -
The above information is being furnished to the 
Bureau and WFO for information and the NYO does not contemplate 
taking any further action i~ this matterc -{J-
