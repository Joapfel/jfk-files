aaeannination of Lu.mumba had been diecunoed, this was not su~h' 
a tightly held subject that the DDP would have been circwn­

Mr. Tweedy. DDP as far as I wan concerned waa the 
person with whom the division first diecuaacd tho matter on-

I am sure when I say I am eure I aseumo Bissell dis-
cussed it with Allen Dulles but, this was never a matter 
which wan between the DCI'e office and the Leopoldville 
station insofar as I was aware, and to this day I don 1 t 
believe it ever wan. 
Mr. Baron. Just to clarify something we talked about 
earlier when I think we were jumbling two que5tiona together, 
it is your expert opinion, expert ln the sense of your knowl­
edge of the Agency, and your opinion as a participant dt thftt

instructions to use them in the nssagsin~tion of I.umumba, 
it poaaihle, would be true testimony? 
' Mr. Tweedy. Only way I can answur that (JUcstion, Mr. 
Baron, is to say I ece not the ~lightest r~~son and do not 
believe that you would have been lied to on this point.
