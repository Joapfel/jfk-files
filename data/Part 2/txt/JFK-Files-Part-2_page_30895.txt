Subject: Alleged. "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray 
Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes rT'I Times publicity 
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's wa:r i:l.Ovements from 
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Tiaymont of the Times. 
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez 
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly 
trained. guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "wa:r" is little nore than a:1 
MGN-type New York Times production so far.
