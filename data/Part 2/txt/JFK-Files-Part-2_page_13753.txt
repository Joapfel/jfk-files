(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make 
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found 
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr>. Doar in August 
1964 for infonnation and Bureau-action regarding members of the 
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr>. Doar 
requested certain infonnation from the FBI regarding this dele­
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some infonnation was delivered 
to the DOJ (either to Mr>. lbar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly 
thereafter, in the latter pa.:r:rt of August 1964. 
(2) It is possible that Mr. lbar may be asked about these 
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquey 
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG 
has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed 
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to h:im its 
view as to the. access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation 
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection. 
(3) Im expeditious response to this request will be 
appreciated. REC. JOJ
