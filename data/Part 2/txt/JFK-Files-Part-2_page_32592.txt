1. Travel to and from Cuba 
Chartered ~uhe:m air.lines flights o~tween Cuba and 
Brczil have become a major means of transporting non-Cuban 
I.attn Americans to and from Cuba. The f::."":.re such flights 
since late July have carried nearly 400 non-Gabans. 
The tir:Jt of the recent series -- on 25 July -­
brought 7 l Latin American passengers to Havana for the 
26 July celebrations. The othe~ four flights -- on 15, 
22, 28 and 29 August -- transported over 200 Latin 
Amertcans to Brazil fr.om He.vana. Some of the air.craft 
involved returned to Cuba with smaller numbers of passen­
gers. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers bad 
been delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had 
apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and some had 
probably received training there. Of the passengers on 
these four flights to Brazil, 75 were natives of 
Caribbean area countries. Their circuitous travel through 
Brazil was evidently designed to help conceal ~he fact 
that they had been in Cuba. 
Costa Rica 
Two Costa Ricans were among the passengers on a 
chartered Cubana plane which was turned back to Havana 
at Grand Cayman on 11 July 1963. One was Luz Marina 
Hernandez Salazar, the only Costa Rican woman known to 
have been sent to Cuba for training as a guerrilla 
warfare instructor. She had been in Cuba since September 
1962. The other Costa Rican passenger was Carlos Guillen, 
former head of the Costa Rican Society of Friends of 
the Cuban Revolution, who had been in Cuba since November 
1962.
