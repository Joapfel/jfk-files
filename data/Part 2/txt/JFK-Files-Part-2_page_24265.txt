x:· ISSUES POSED, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
· The preceding sections provide a general picture of the ~nature, 
extent, purpose, function and problems of proprietaries. Not unlike 
other areas of our inquiry, the issues raised were not simply black 
and white. They were, rather, grey in nature. During recent years, 
particularly at the time of the Vietnam War, serious questions were 
raised about this proprietary capability. Much of the accompanying 
criticism stemmed from a lack of understanding of their role in the 
scheme_.of both United States foreign policy and intelligence. Some of 
the criticism stennned from the-suspected entrance of some proprietaries 
into areas where they were in apparent competition with legitima~e 
business interests, such as the airline industry. It is not unusual 
that there would be misunderstanding since much of what would have 
explained the proper role of these entities had to remain secret for 
innumerable reasons. But the Committee has not been stymied by that 
same embargo and has had a broad look into these operations. 
In general, these mechanism have been operated with the utmost. 
concern for legality, propriety and ethical standards. What slippages 
have ·occurred were in the field and generally in the area of air opera­
tors, not management. Moreover, their use and past expansion was a 
direct result of the demands placed upon the Agency by Presidents, 
Secretaries of State and the policy mechanisms of government. This is 
particularly true of the large air proprietary complex which was used 
to support paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia. The oaly 
exception to this is the investment-insurance complex which was 
established on Agency initiative to fill a pressing need.
