Women's Bail Fund 
"I've been real impressed with what women in the 
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they 
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res­
ponsibility affects new members too. This is real 
important. It helps me through the rough times and all 
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through. 
You really have a sense that everyone really wants. to work 
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold 
together because we feel responsible for the worR. Even 
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are 
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to exp,!ain 
why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows 
people's commitment and responsibility." 
.The "Lib~rated Guardian" was created in 
April, 1970, through active and violent 
dissent against the politics and policies 
of the "Guardian". Its major aims were 
to produce a "more revolutionary" paper, 
to operate collectively within it and to 
maintain by design a loose political position. 
The "Guardian"·is self-described as an 
"independent radical newsweekly" which 
takes a strong left position but is not 
identified with any organized group. It 
is considered to be the largest radical 
weekly in America.
