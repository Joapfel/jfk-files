1978 v'rsIT OF PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SECRET 
A TENDENCY TO BLAME THE UNITED STATES FOR VENEZUELA'S CURRENT 
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH 
MIGHT TAKE PLACE WOULD BE f.i.IMED AT PRESIDENT CARTER, BUT 
RATHER THEY WOULD BE STAGED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT 
TO EITHER EMBARRASS THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OR TO 
FURTHER DRAMATIZE THE CAUSE BEING ADVOCfHED. (SOURCE : A 
STAFF OFFICER OF THIS .I\GENCY.) 
3. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES RECOGNIZE THIS 
SITUATION AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE UNPLEASANT, ANTI­
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT INCIDENTS DURING PRESIDENT CARTER'S 
CARACAS VISIT. VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS 
WILL DEAL WITH CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT 
CORRUPTION. THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE ABLE TO COMTROL ANY 
\, 
SITUATION THAT P1RISES, THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE. (SOURCE:
