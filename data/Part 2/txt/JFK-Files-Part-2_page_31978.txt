(NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK) On 24 October 1968, Dominga Ortiz, 
housewife, who resides at 1201 University Avenue, Bronx, New York 10452, 
was interviewed at her residence concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has 
known SUBJECT since 1965 stated substantially as follows: 
Source who is the spouse of the building superintendent at the 
above address met SUBJECT and HIS damily in 1965 when they moved into 
the apratment building, and her contact with SUBJECT has been limited to 
an occasional greeting whenever they meet in the neighborhood. 
Source had no knowledge of SUBJECT'S education, employment, 
previous residence, or personal background. 
SUBJECT and HIS family appear to be very fine, respectable people 
and their conduct in the neighborhood had been above reproach. SUBJECT'S 
mother, name unknown, died in 1967. SUBJECT and HIS family appear to be 
very quiet people and keep very much to themselves. Source knew of nothing 
which would reflect adversely on MARTI'S character, integrity, discretion, 
maturity, emotional stability, financial responsibility or honesty. Neither 
HE nor other membe~s of HIS family have been observed to engage in any 
q.i.estionable political activity and Source had no reason to doubt HIS lgyalty 
· to the United States. SUBJECT was not known to be adversely involved with 
law enforcement agencies during the period of association, and Source had 
no knowledge of any organizational affiliation HE migh:t; have. Source was 
unable to suggest anyone who may have knowledge of SUBJECT. 
Based on the excellent conduct of SUBJECT in the neighborhood, 
Ortiz recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for a position of 
responsibility with the United States Government.
