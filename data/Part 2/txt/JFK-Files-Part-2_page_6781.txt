Fifth and finally, section 6 of the joint resolution, which 
outlines the grounds for postponement of publi~-release of a 
document, makes no provision for postponi~g release of 
documents that may contain Executive privilege or deliberative 
process, attorney-client, or attorney work-product information. 
While such privileges could be waived in the public interest and, 
in fact, are n_ot iikely to arise with respect to factual information 
directly relat~d to the JFK assassination, they would be 
unavailable under thejoint resolution in the rare case that they 
might be needed. 
These are technical problems that I believe can be solved iri 
ways that will, in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing 
on the assassination of President Kennedy. 
But, again, whatever the future course of this legislation, 
CIA is proceeding ·even now to review for.declassification the 
relevant documents under its control. Further, we will cooperate 
fully with any mechanism established by the Congress and the 
President to declassify all of this material.
