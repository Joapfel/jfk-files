the President himself (which, as ~iprianiJdryly noted, tends 
to inhibit appeals.) The act also~spec1£ics very short 
deadlines, with only 30 days for the President to make his 
decision. (This means we have only about seven days to get 
our appeals out of Hqs and to the White House--a practical 
impossibility.) Our only appeal to date involved three _

sensiti~e~elsink~Station, and (iii) the identity of a 
Nicaraguan -source~ In fact our appeal took several months, 
with the Board being very accommodating about the delay, and 
we finally were able to give the Board enough justification 
and explanation that they changed their position and spared 
the White House the decision. Healey noted that the Agency 
declassification team includes a DO team (as noted above,) 
and asked why we hadn't been able to head off the problem. 
Cipriani responded that new information arises for the Board 
to consider in making its determination, and Wickham 
elaborated by noting that the DO is reluctant to reveal 
sensitive current information to protect old material. He 
characterized this as a problem of "DO cul tur_~_. II __ At_ the

We later noted that the only other appeal thus far involves 
the FBI, and the White House has told the Bureau to resolve 
the matter with the Board. (S) 
3. Pereira noted to the staffers that we're dealing with 
very short deadlines involving enormous volumes of material, 
and illustrated by showing the staff a bulky recent Board 
declassification notification which we must review to 
confirm we have no problem with the material involved. In 
response to a Sheehy question, Harrelson reminded staff that 
the original redaction and submission to the Board took 
place in 1992-3, and as noted above, our redaction standards 
and judgements have evolved since then. Further, we have to 
double-check each release to confirm we concur, and in some 
cases compare substitute language. Sheehy asked why we ___ _ 
would object to such a thing as the acknowledgement of CTgkyo/

Wickham noted that the Board is trying to document Oswald's 
travels, and wants to identify stations reporting such 
travel. Pereira said that we recognize the need to report 
the facts, but want to protect details that do not add to 
the story but harm our equities. In response to a Healey 
question, Pereira said we are making progress in giving the 
Board staff the context and framework necessary to 
appreciate and support our concerns. He said the staff 
tries very hard to give the Board necessary background, and
