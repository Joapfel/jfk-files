I do remember sending a message to Winn Scott suggesting 
tha~ right after the assassination, that the Mexicans put in 
a ring of guards around the Cuban Embassy and question everyboqy 
going in and out. I remember that idea coming out of my 
head. 
r·:know • that Sylvia Duran was arrested.. She was fair game 
·• 
because she was a Mexican national and the Cubans -- she did-
not have any Cuban diplomatic immunity. 
I would have thought it would have been a good idea to 
question here very closel~As to whether I said that she 
should be arrested or I had anything to do with that, I do 
not know. I was perfectly capable of making such a suggestion 
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why Headquarters was upset 
about that arrest? 
Mr. Shaw. I have no idea~,

16 :\ Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why Headquarters did not want

!? 
Mr. Shaw. No. 
Mr. Gqldsmith. Do you have any reason to believe that 
Oswald may have been an agent of the KGB? 
Mr. Shaw. I have no reason to believe it. 
Mr. Goldsmith. How about an agent, asset or source of 
the CIA? 
:~ Ii Mr. Shaw. I would think that that would be completely
