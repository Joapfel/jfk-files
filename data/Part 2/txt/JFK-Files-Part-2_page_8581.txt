FROM: H. G. Bean 
DDA 77-2412 
2 8 APR 1977 
Acting Executive Officer/DDA 
SUBJECT: Fairways Corporation 
REFERENCE: Attached memorandum from Central Cover Staff 
1. With reference tb paragraph 4 in the attached memorandt.D'Il 
from Mr. Latta, to the very best of our knowledge the CIA sponsorship 
of the Fairways Corporation has not been officially placed in the 
public domain.. There has been at least one newspaper article relating 
to Fairways and, in addition, at least one short television news 
item on the same subject. However, official confinnation of the 
allegations of a relationship which was made in these media presentations 
has been carefully avoided. 
2. There has been official acknowledgement of the fact that 
CIA's Office of"Training runs a proprietary to provide executive 
transportation. Such a statenent appeared in the report of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. However, here 
again there has been no acknowledgement that such an entity was 
identical with or related to the Fairways Corporation. 
3. The DDA concurs with the position of CCS as expressed in 
paragraph 2 of Mr. Latta's memorandum.
