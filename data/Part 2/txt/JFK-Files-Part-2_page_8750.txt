U.S. Embassy Foreign Service Dispatch, Havana, 
#1614 dated 9 May 1960 (837,432/5-2460) 
Reported that the Revolutionary Government has 
skillfully maneuvered Rolando OJBELA, the President of 
the FEU, and his pro-Cornnrunist cohorts into a position 
of power. First, on May 7, it was OJBELA who was given 
the task of inciting the mob and bruiting the fact 
that the powers-that-be disapproved of Aureliano SANa-IEZ 
Arango. Cornnrunist "goon-squad" tactics had become so 
vicious that even many students who had heretofore been 
circumspectly apolitical are afraid to attend classes. 
The Vice-Secretary of the School of Agronomy asked how 
it was that if CUBELA leadership so deplored violence 
that it had remained impassive in the face of the 
physical violence perpetrated against his person by 
members of the Cornnn.mist Youth from the Instituto de la 
Habana, who had entered the University grotmds completely 
anned. CUBELA and Angel QUEVEOO, went about the campus 
carrying arms, in direct violation of the University 
regulations.
