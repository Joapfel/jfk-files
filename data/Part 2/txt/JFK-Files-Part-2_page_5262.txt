Memo .for DCI fr C/HRG, dtd 13 June 96, 
Same Subject 
(U) This memorandum provides background information for a 
meeting between you and the JFK Assassination Records Review Board 
(ARRB), which is scheduled for 16 October 1996 in your office 
between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. The meeting was requested by ARRB 
Chairman, John Tunheim as a courtesy call. 
(U) Background: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a federal 
judge in Minnesota, asked that he and the other four Board members 
have an opportunity to provide you with a brief description of the 
Board's purpo~e and activities. The Board's Executive Director, 
David Marwell, and General Counsel, Jeremy Gunn will also parti­
cipate. The)IBRB members were appointed by President Clinton in 
1993 as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to 
ensure public disclosure of all government records related to the 
assassination of President Kennedy. 
(FOUO) Topics the Board May Discuss: The Board probably 
will discuss their concern about whether they will be able to 
complete their work by the congressionally-imposed de.adline of 
October 1997. This concern ~elates to the very time-consuming 
process that the ARRB and its 30-person staff is obliged to use 
in reviewing all of the thousands of relevant documents that are 
redacted, which for CIA comprise the bulk of our documents. 
(FOUO) The Board may also seek your personal commitment to 
continue the Agency's dedication of resources--people and 
computer capability--to the review of JFK documents. CIA has 
worked closely with the Board and its staff from the beginning.
