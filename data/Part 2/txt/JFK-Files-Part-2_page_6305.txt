Sixth, Capture of Previously Released Information: We are trying to complete the job of 
populating a data base of previously declassified and released information. 
It is not acceptable that those outside the Agency know better than we do, what we have released. 
Our MORI database, once fully populated will allow us to: 
Satisfy many requesters from information we already have declassified. 
Speed up our declassification by knowing what decisions have already been made. 
Increase the consistency of our decisions. 
And most importantly, avoid wasting resources and embarrassing ourselves fighting to protect • 
what already has been released. 
And seventh, Classification Policy: The world is changing. 
I ~ 
The overall budget figure was never released, but now it is. 
It was forbidden to mention the existence of the NRO; that has changed. 
All NRO contractors were under cover; now a two page listing of those contractors has been 
published in the media. 
We tightly protected all overhead imagery program, but we now are declassifying product 
· from early systems. 
On the other hand, we still have policies that are outdated and may no longer make sense - [Farm, -
defectors, psychoanalysis, bios, Woi:ld War II liaison information.] 
A small effort can inject fresh thinking, and can staff issues for peri9dic and systematic validation by 
senior management. 
This can pay dividends by k~eping us from wasting time and resources protecting and defending what 
senior managers believe can and should be released. 19
