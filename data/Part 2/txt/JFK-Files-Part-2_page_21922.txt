discussion of executive action with Bissell, which, h~ said,· 
( might have transpired in "early January" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 
52). When Bissell was shown these notes, he agreed with Harvey 
about the timing of their initial discussion (Bissell, 7/17/75, 
p. 10) . 
llarvey had also testified that, after receiving Uisscll's initial in­
structions to establish an executive actio11 capability: 
the first thinr, I did ... was discuss in theoretical 
terms witlt a few officers whom I trusted quite in1plicitly 
the whole subject of assassination, our possible assets, 
our posture, p;oing back, if you will, even to the funda­
mental questions of/\, is assassination a proper ,,.;capon 
of an American intelligence service, and 13, even if you 
asswne that it is, is it within our capability within 
the framework of tl1is government to do it effectively 
iln<l properly, securely and <liscreetly. (Harvey, 6/25/75, 
pp. 37-A, 38).

The Inspector General's Report connected t:J.tv.e,: and)Go-ttlie~ to the 
early stages of the executive action project as follows: 
Harvey says thilt Bissell had"'~lread discusseu • certain 
aspects:-,of the problem with CBB0 1 S • ll,M,;; and with l§..idney _1 
Gottlieb~ Since&f*\Vj''-'•r1?.ras a rea y cut 1.n, l!<1rvey used 
him in aeveloping t e Ex~utive /\ct ion Capability .... 
Harvey's mention of him/LGottliebil in this connection 
may explain a notation by-Dr.\Gunn tltat~!arvey instructed 
Gunn to discuss techniques with[2ottlieb...lwithout associa­
ting the discussion with the Castro operation. (~.G. 
lteport, pp. 37-38) . 
It is evident from the testimony of Harvey and, Biss~ l I tl,;1 t • the turn­
over to Harvey of th~ Roselli contact in :,ovember 1961 was discussed 
as part of ZRRIFLE (see Section (d), infra). Thu::;, their initial 
discussion of executive action can, at the least, be dated before 
Noveinber 1961 and the "25/1" and "26/1" notations would have to 
refer to January 1961.
