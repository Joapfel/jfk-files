ance of its assigned mission. W;l thin the Task Force, selected • • 
officers have been designated to·assist, advise, and coordinate . 
on all phases of Cuban intelligence operations with the various· 
geographic division-desks. This arrangement has provided for a 
continued, increased coverage capability of the Cuban target by 
insuring a regular review of current, developmental, and planned 
intelligence operations of all available Agency intelligence 
assets which could be directed against Cuba.

has been a substantial increase in the recruitment and training 
of agent assets. There has been an extensive increase in the 
establishment and use of clandestine communications methods and 
channels. The use of SW, one way voice radio, and WT as methods 
of communicating with agents ins~ Cuba has been greatly-expanded.
