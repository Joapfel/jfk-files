Other Eisenhower Administration officials who were active 
in the Special Group in late 1960--Assistant Secretary of 
Defense John N .. Irwin II, Undersecretary of State for Political 
Affairs Livings ton Mercb.E.nt, and Deputy Secretary of Defense 
James Douglas--stated that they did not recall any discussion 
about as.sassinating Lutnumba (Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, pp. 1-2; 
Merchant affidavit, 9/8/75, p. l; Dougias affidavit, 9/5/7':J). 
(c) Richard Bissell Testified That, Despite His Lack of 
a Specific Recollection, He "Strongly Inferred" 
That the Assassi.nation Effort Against Lumumba Was 
Authorized by President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles 
Richard Bissell's testimony on the .question of high-level 
authorization for the effort to assassinate Lurnumba is prob­
lematic. Bissell insisted that he had no direct recollection 
of receiving Eiuch authorization and that all of his testimony 
on this subject "has to be described as .inference" (Bissell, 
9/10/75, p. 48). Bissell began his testimony on the subject 
by asserting that it was on his own initiative that he instructed 
Justin O'Donnell to plan the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 
6/11/75, pp. 54-55). Nevertheless, Bissell's conclusion--based 
on his inferences from the totality of circumstances relating 
to the entire·assassination effort against Lumumba--was that an 
assassination attempt had been authorized at the highest levels 
of the government (Bissell; g/10/75, pp. 32-33, 47-49, 60-62, 
65).
