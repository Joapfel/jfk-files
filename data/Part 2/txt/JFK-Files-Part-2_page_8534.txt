Item No. 54, 236 MSS p. no. 80, 262 
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Fciruni World 
Features is still classified SECRET because both items 
describe intelligence, s_ources and methods and identifies 
operations based in England. Fo"rum World ·pe·attires was 
referred to - but not by name - in Book I of the Church 
Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows: "Another· 
example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two 
proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in 
Europe~ .. The larger of the two was subscribed to by 
over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the 
problei of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the 
major U.S. dailies aware that the CIA controlled these 
two press services." While For·um WorTd Fe·atures was not 
named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be 
protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper 
editors may be cons.idered as "official public disclosure."
