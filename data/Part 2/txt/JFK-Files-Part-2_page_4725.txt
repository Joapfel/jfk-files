MR. HALPERN: And I said, in those days, I said, "Well, why the hell don't we 
just absorb them, m~ke them part of us,.-you know, as part of our command?" 
And that led to another big hoorah, but we never did get command. But they 
did. Eighty~five percent of their activity was for us. 
INTERVIEWER: Did you, at the time B111 Colby was talking about on~ big 
Agency. . . 
MR. HALPERN: '73, '74. 
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, why? 
MR. HALPE~N: Well, because of what we were talking about before. The 
difference of views, the different cultures involved, in both what the. 
collector and the analysts. And then of course you had. the new thing called 
technicians -- technical people -- which is a totally different aspect, even 
for us in the DDP. Our technicians were our TSO types or the commo-types. 
And we did some SIGINT of our own and that kind of stuff, but with the use of 
the commo guy, the operators of the machines. We weren't into overhead 
reconnaissance and things like that, for God's sakes, and other black box 
actt~ities, except even the black boxes, they asked us to deliver in many 
.. 
parts of the world. We had to do the drops, we had to get them in either by 
hook or by crook and things like that into the right locatio_n and all that 
kind of stuff. So there was a marriage_ there. But ·basically, as I said, each 
one of these three Directorates could honestly, and you could come up with 
good rationale for making separate Agencies of each one of them. And so when 
Bill talks about One Agency, one big family, he was trying to merge us all 
together and make us, like lurner says in his book, he wanted to make 
everybody be able to do everybody else's job. Wel.1, that is kind of silly.
