Request of JFK Assassination Records 
Review Board for Courtesy Visit with DCI 
1. Action Requested: Paragraph 4 below contains a 
recommendation for your approval. The Chairman of the JFK 
Assassination Records Revi~w Board (ARRE), John Tunh~im, has 
requested that you meet with him and the other four Board 
members at Headquarters Building some time in the next several 
months. He asks that the meeting be arranged to coincide with 
one of their monthly session~. which are held in Washington. 
(The schedule of their meetings is attached.) The Board 1 s 
Executive Director, David Marwell, would also participate . . ·~r 
2. Backgiound: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a 
federal judge in Minnesota, would like to provide you with 
a brief description of the Board's purpose and activities. 
The Board has paid similar visits to the FBI, where they 
met with Director Freeh, and to NSA and the Secret Servi.ce. 
The ARRB members were appointed by President Clinton in 1993 
as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to 
ensure public disclosure of government records ielated to the 
assassinat~on of President Kennedy. The statute grants the 
Board full access to all documents that are related to either 
the assassination or past investigations into the assassina­
tion. 
3. CIA has worked closely with the Board and its staff 
from the beginning. The Board's Executive Director and we have 
worked out cooperative arrangements for resolving differences 
~f opinion as to what information can be released to the public 
and what should be withh~ld because of sensitivities. We have 
released approximately 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records
