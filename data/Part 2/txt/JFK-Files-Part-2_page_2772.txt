Mr. Kent has sustained the same high degree of competence, imagina• 
tion and conscientious application to his duties noted in the last fit-
ness report. He is unusually well qualified for his present job by 
reason of experience, knowledge and sensitivity to the Latin American 
culture and mentality. Although he is a person of strong convictions, 
not always tactfully expressed, it is to his credit that he has adapted 
to the role of a staff officer with admirable self-restraint and self-
discipline . 
Were it not for the fact that Mr. Kent cannot accept a permanent 
overseas assignment at this time for family medical reasons, he should 
now be coneidered for assignment to a senior position at a country desk 
preparatory to a Field Station assignment. Under these circumstances, 
Mr. Kent is making a valuable, perhaps even indispensable, contribution 
to the covert action mission of WHD and should remain in his present 
position for the immediate future. 
No further training is recommended at tbis time. He completed tbe 
Midcareer Executive Development Course No. 4 during tbe reporting perio1 
Mr. Kent bas no supervisory functions in his present position, 
but be appears to be cap~ble of performing such duties. His security 
record is excellent and his cost consciousness is good.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFF"ICIAI. 
I agree with the rating of Mr. Kent. He has been energetic, 
imaginative and professional in his work, The only thing that l can add 
to the assessment is that Mr, Kent speaks excellent Spanish which has 
been an essential ingredient in his critical abilities in the handling of 
media operations for Latin America .
