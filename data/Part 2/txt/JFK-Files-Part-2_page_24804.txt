Between October 5 and October 20, 1970, the CIA made 21 contacts 
with key military and Carabinero (police) officials in Chile. Those 
Chileans who were inclined to stage a coup were given assurances of 
strong support at the highest levels of the U.S. Government, both be­
fore and after a coup. 
One of the major obstacles faced by all the military conspirators 
in Chile was the strong opposition to a coup by the Commander-in-Chief 
of the Army, General Rene Schneider; who insisted the constitutional 
process be followed, As a result of his strong constitutional stand, 
the removal of General Schneider became a necessary ingredient in the 
coup plans of all the Chilean conspirators. Unable to have General 
Schneider retired or reassignea, the conspirators decided to kidnap 
him. An unsuccessful abduction attempt was made on October 19, 1970, ~;if 
by a group of Chilean military officers whom the CIA was actively sup- ~~ 
porting. A second kidnap attempt was made the following day, again un-
successfully. In the early morning hours of October 22, 1970, machine 
guns and ammunition were passed by the CIA to the group that had failed 
on October 19. That same day General Schneider was mortally 
wounded in an attempted kidnap on his way to work. The attempted 
kidnap and the shooting was apparently conducted by conspira-
tors other than those to whom the CIA had provided weapons earlier 
in the day.
