SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
November 1963; .many others are dated 23 November 1963 through 
December 1963. 5 . ✓ 
9~ (S) This is one of the most complex requests because of 
the following facts: 
• at one time, there was a tape of Oswald in existence but it has 
since been lost or erased; 
• the relevance of these tapes is argued to be only to prove that no 
tape in existence today contains the Oswald-con~ersation; 
• ~hi~ was not ~nunilateral operation but rather a jo&t· 'Opfr~.tion 
f'\ith th~_Mexican Government; 
• there is a confidential request from the ARRB{1:o the Mexican / 
fGovernment}for any@opies of the actual]Oswald conversation they 
may possess; and, 
• quite obviously, the sensitivity is not so much the mere fact that 
we possess such tapes but our confirmation of the extent and our 
release of the actual conversations captured. 
10. (S) The good news, qt least at this time, is that the 
ARRB staff has agreed to postpone Board consideration until May 
and, in the interim~ the Agency will have an opportunity to 
review (i.e., listen and transcribe) and determine the 
sensitivity and provide detailed arguments in this regard.
