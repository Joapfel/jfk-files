c. The Betancourt government 
has struck back hard. Its new uni­
fied command over the security forces, 
set up at US urging, passed this 
initial test with flying colors. 
d. At least 500 extremists 
were arrested and the round-up is 
still going on. Their removal will 
hamper the Communist drive against 
elections in major cities like Caracas. 
e. We now expect the elections 
to be held on schedule, a consider­
able achievement under the circum­
stances. The elections will be fol­
lowed, however, by a Communist ef­
fort to prevent the March inaugura­
tion of the victor. 
f. The rub here is that none 
of the presidential candidates com­
mands President Betancourt's con­
siderable assets for dealing success­
fully with the harsh realities of 
Venezuelan politics. The constitu­
tion prevents Betancourt from suc­
ceeding himself. 
g. In the background, as 
always, looms the military, which 
could intervene if the president­
elect shows signs of being soft on 
communism.
