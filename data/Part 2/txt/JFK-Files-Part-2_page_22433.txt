~ur?oses other than recruitment? 
A. h'ell 
~ For exannle, let me ask you this. Were any of these 
files on Cubans who were suspected or thought to he a possible 
internal security pr.able~? 
~ No. No. They didn't keep those types of files. We 
would .simply task them with through your sources what do you 
have on so and so. ~hey would not be told the reason why we 
wanted the information on anybo<ly. 
O Well, I guess with several million fiels or several 
million cards and tens of thousands of files it is difficult to 
make generalizations about the kind of information that is in 
those files? 
~ Well, that is right. 
Q. So I guess I won't ask you ·to do so, but I want to as}i 
you this. I trust th2t there is the possibility that some of 
these files do contain what you in the trade refer to as deroga 
tory information? 
~ I would assUMe so. 
~ And that so much of them may -- some of the subjects 
of those files may now he American citizens? 
~ Right. 
~ And finally I take it that no effort has been made to 
study that particular situation?
