ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 
ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN 
Recently Senator Kefa.uver's Committee requested 
I 
the-Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals 
reportedly associated with the boxing industry. Severa.I 
of these names were duplica,ted on a. prior request for a 
• 
name check by Sena.tor Kefauver's Committee. It a.ppeared 
tha.t the Committee might be conducting a. fishing expedition­
. I by submitting such a.n extensive list .. Accordingly, the 
matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's 
request. 
On May 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief, 
Organized Crime a.nd Ra.cketeering Section, Crimina.l 
Division, telephonica.lly advi.sed that following a. contact 
with the Kefauver Committee on tha.t date the original 
request for name checks on 304 individuals ha.d been 
reduced to a. request for name checks on 30 individuals. 
Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any 
individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such 
as Fra,nkie Ca.rho, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau 
to sea.rch its files concerning tha.t individual. Mr. Hundley 
also advised the Committee representa.tives tha.t it would not 
be possible in every instance to make name checks on a.n 
expeditious basis while the hearings· were being conducted 
inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would 
depend upon the number of references involved. Mr. Hundley 
is sending a._ memorandum to the Bureau in th~ immediate 
future listing the names which the Committee has now 
requested be checked. 
Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley'-s memora.ndum listing 
the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries 
prepa.red. •
