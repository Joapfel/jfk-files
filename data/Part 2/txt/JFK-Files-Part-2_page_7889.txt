/ • received a very cryptic telegram from Kramer. In reviewing 
Kramer's file, they noted a photograph which bears a 
very strong resemblance to recent pictures of artist 
drawings of the killer which have appeared in local papers. 
The likeness was so striking that Mr. Helms thought it· 
should be brought to the attention of the FBI immediately. 
ACTION: 
Senior Resident Agent Jesse Hall, Alexandria, 
Virginia, was telephonically contacted and instructed to 
obtain full details from the files of CIA Headquarters 
at Langley, Virginia, together with all background infor­
mation on Kramer, as well as a photograph, so that this 
matter could be thoroughly checked out.
