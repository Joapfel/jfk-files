TOP SECRET 
President Eisenhower in March 1960, Nixon was put in 
a Catch-22 situation; for as he said: 
President Eisenhower had instructed 
All~n Dulles, he~d of the CIA, to brief 
the Democratic candidate on ail opera­
tions, including Top Secret operations. 
I knew that Kennedy had already received 
two briefings from Dulles. I immediately 
had a meinber of my staff call the White 
House on the security line to ask if 
·these briefings covered Cuba. A member 
of the White House Staff indicated they 
had. (Several months after the election, 
Allen· Dulles· was to state. that his brief­
ing of Kennedy ·hc,;d included Cuba but not 
the training program fo·t1::, Cuban exiles.) 
At the time of the debate, however, and 
after checking with the White House, I 
had to proceed with the assumption that 
Kennedy had -been briefed on the secret 
program. 
I was faced with the heads-he-wins, 
tails-I-lose proposition. If in the TV 
debate I were to reveal the existence of 
the training program and point out that I 
had been one of its strongest advocates, I 
would pull the rug out from under Kennedy's 
position. But if I did so_, the project 
would be doomed, and also the lives of the 
brave men, both inside and outside of Cuba, 
who were receiving training and assistance. 
I had only one choice: to protect the 
security of the program, I had to oppose 
Kennedy on his position of advocating that 
the United States openly aid anti-Castro 
forces inside and outside Cuba. 26/ 
It is interesting to observe that Nixon became 
more philosophical about the impact of the. final TV
