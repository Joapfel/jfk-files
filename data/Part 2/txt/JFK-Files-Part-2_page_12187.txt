12. During initial s.tages of dev-eJ.opment and on occasion acti Ye informants 
may raise a personal question concerning their own position if it 
becomes known publicly that they are affiliated with a subversiv-e 
organization. In the event a potential informant or informant inquires 
as to what can be done for him in such a case, he may be told that 
his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
a~ises concerning his loyalty we will consider making the facts of his 
cooperation with the FBI known to his employer or to the responsible 
individuals. It should be pointed out that this action may make it 
impossible for him to continue on behalf of the FBI and the serv-ice 
which he is performing for his country may be terminated. Before 
taking steps tq ad-vise anyone of a potential inf◊-rmantts or informant's 
cooperation, prior Bureau authority must be obtained. 
13·. Specifically adYise. each potential informant that he is no·t and cannot 
consider himself a Bureau em9loyee or "undercov-er Agent" of the FBI. 
In this regard, the seriousness of violating the impersonation statutes 
must be impressed upon the informant. 
14. Advise pote•ntial informant that his cooperation must be strictly confi­
dential at all times and if he s:. ·,tld feel he cannot maintain this 
confidence he should so advise. :here should be no doubt left in the 
mind of the informant that his relationship must remain on a confidential 
basis and if he violates the confidence he will ~e of no value and by 
so doing the Bureau's investigative activity may be jeopardized. This 
must be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you accept him 
as such. If the in~ormant has a special problem which would require 
his reyealing his relationship to his wife, etc., this should be learned 
from him during the in:i.tial interview and a recommendation made to the 
Bureau when the results of the interview are furnished. The special· 
circumstances will be taken into consideration by the Bureau. 
15. If a prospective informant is connected in any manner with a labor 
union, inform him that the Bureau is not interested in employer­
employee relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
information on the infiltration in labor unions by subversive elements. 
16. ·If the potential informant is a student, teacher, or has any similar 
relations with a school, college, or university, in his initial interview 
and subsequent handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern­
ing investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities. 
17. From the first interview with a potential informant through his develop­
ment and until he is discontinued, extreme caution should be used at 
all times to be certain he is not a plant. 
18. When potential informant begins to furnish current information and 
otherwise qualifies for de$ignation as informant, assign perman~nt 
symbol number and advise Bureau. This communication must be personally 
initialed by SAC or ASAC acting in his absence; indi~idual 1 s background 
must a1s·o be thoroughly re-viewed at this time, keeping in mind possibility 
of using informant as a potent.ial witness. If individual has any 
weaknesses, set forth safeguards being followed to insure security and 
to prevent embarrassment to Bureau.]
