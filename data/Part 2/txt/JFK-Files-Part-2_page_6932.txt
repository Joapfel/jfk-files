FBI supervisor named Long had kept a tickler on the King 
assassination. A tickler is a file containing extra copies of 
documents kept at hand so it can be immediately retrieved. The 
FBI first denied that such a tickler file had been kept. Then it 
claimed that it could not locate it. After a long period of 
resistance, the Justice Department finally located the Long tickler 
exactly where Weisberg had suggested they look for it. When 
finally located, most of the file had been gutted. 
Weisberg's suit for the King assassination documents lasted 
15 years. He obtained approximately 60,000 pages. If the same 
suit were filed today, I believe that he would get about one-fourth 
of what he obtained in the late l970's and early 1980 1 s. 
These stories that I have related are unusual only because the 
requesters actually went to court to fight the CIA and FBI. Most 
requesters cannot afford the time or the money of litigating their 
FOIA requests, against these agencies. You might be tempted to 
conclude from the absence of litigation that the FOIA is working 
just fine. The opposite is true. The FOIA has been severely 
damaged by the 1984 amendments eliminating access to CIA 
operational files and by the 1986 amendments to Exemption 7, which 
applies to law enforcement records, as well as by a string of 
decisions in the Supreme Court and the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Dis~rict of Columbia which have greatly expanded 
the amount of material which can be withheld from the public. 
Let me add.that while it is important to have obtained the 
public pledges from CIA Direc~or"Gates and FBI Director Sessions
