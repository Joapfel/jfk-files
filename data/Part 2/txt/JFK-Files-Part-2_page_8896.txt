(PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY) 
Comment: (Continued) 
After NOSENKO's defection was publicized, 
Sovj.et Naval defector ARTAMONOV volunteered 
to CIA that he had known the son of the 
Minister NOSENKO in the naval school in 
Leningrad from 1944 to 1946. 
NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Ship­
building Tekhnikurn in June 1945, and he successfully passed 
the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to 
the Moscow Institute of International Relations that summer. 
Birth to 1945: --- -- --- Summary and Conclusion 
NOSENKO is Virtually the sole source of information on 
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed 
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where­
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time of his 
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the 
schools he claims to have attended. 
Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics 
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and 
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of 
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's 
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO 
and the substance of his claims about his life until 1945 
are accepted as true.
