SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
division summary, much as it is today. The RMDs from 
year-to-year could and often did change with the 
operational requirements the Agency was expected to 
fulfill. As such, the RMDs for each station had value 
only as data to the larger examination of how the 
Agency performed its intelligence mission in a given 
year and what trends or changes this review would 
suggest for the ensuing year. 
(U) Statiqn reporting of the type described above 
would be treated as transitory information and as such 
meet the definition of a temporary record. It is 
entirely possible and quite probable that these 
facilitative reports were systematically destroyed. 
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) 
authorized the Agency to destroy facilitative reports 
in 1954 (NARA Reference: II-NNA-1057); the destruct1on 
of intelligence. collection requirement files in 1962 
(NARA Reference: NN-163-1), and operational management 
objective files at the subcomponent level (which would 
include reports from.Stations and base) in 1977 (NARA 
Reference: NCl-263-77-10). The 1977 authorization 
rem~ins in force today.
