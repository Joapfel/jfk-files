On the afternoon of August 19 , 19 7 5 , 1h;. Ell if of the [i!"

decided to def er on its pending request for the identity of l~J.; "I! ;_

to the Attorney Ge1;1eral for possibly ll_lisstating the grounds \ J.J~.A._

Finally, I noted to _John Ellif that I continue to have 
difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they 
need further witnesses to establish any possible

damage

to 
the targets of the COINTEL prbgrarn. Ellif-finally agreed 
,, I 
that since they do know the names and identities of the targets, /J',J -c~J 
the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue 
in any event. Nonetheless, Elli£ did stress that it .is possible t_.l/ , ,( 
that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose 'K.,./ 
to come back and press its demands for the right to interview _,,,,,,.-.~~_.,,, 
the recipient-source witnesses.
