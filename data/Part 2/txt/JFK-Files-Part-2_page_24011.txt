assured Colonel Wimert that the military was now prepared to move. (Task 
Force Log, 20 October) The second abduction attempt on the 20th also 
failed and the Task Force concluded 
Since Valenzuela's group is apparently having 
considerable difficulty executing even the first 
step of its coup plan, the prospects for a coup

now appears remote. (Task Force Log, 22 October) 
E. The Killing of General Schneider 
In the early morning hours of October 22 (2 am), Colonel Wimert 
delivered the three submachine guns with am=inition to the Army Lt. 
Colonel in an isolated section of Santiago.* 
''Although Colonel Wimert' s testimony and the cable traffic do not 
clearly establish the identity of the group to which the Lt. Colonel 
was affiliated (see page 31) two CIA statements on Track II tie the 
weapons, and therefore the Lt. Colonel, to the.Valenzuela group: 
... The only assistance requested by Valenzuela 
to set the plan Lof October 12_7 into motion 
through Schneider's abduction was several sub­

decided the Presidential election and···_the Valen­
zuela group maintained some hope they could still 
carry out their plans. \; ',
