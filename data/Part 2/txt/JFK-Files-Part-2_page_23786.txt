Administration is at this stage, to extend the operational 
prohibition on 1·,the part of CIA to use American ;..._ Americans in 
the media --
Mr. Kirbow. Wherever located. 
Mr. Bader~ Where they are using them undercover, at this 
l

Senator Huddleston. Even if they are in foreign media? 
Mr. Bade~. Yes,. sir. 
Senator Huddleston. And even though all of their

Ame:cican news services.

to the intelligence collection processes 6f the CIA, and it 
singles out a specific agency-which is not doing any harm to
