brought on to perform the MAC and MATS contracts with planes 
leased from Air America, which included 727 1 s. Southern Air 
Transport actually owned one 727 and leased two from Air America. 
Houston noted that it was at this time that an internal de­
cision was made "we probably couldn't justify this major airlift 
with the big jets, and so we started giving rid of them. See, they 
had no utilization to speak of down in Southeast Asia. A couple of 
supply fl_ights went into India, and I think we used prop planes for 
that. to my recollection." S_o the Agency began to phase out the 
727
1
s. This, of course, led to _the decision to divest the Agency 
of Southern Air Transport and eventually of Air America. 
Internal management problems were assisted in 1963 by the 
establishment of an executive committee of the board of directors 
of the Pacific Company, Air America and Air Asia. The overt board 
of directors in New York City passed a resolution organizing an 
executive committee, which included Mr. Doole and two other directors. 
Covertly, the Agency put with that executive committee some of its 
representatives. This. resulted in management and the Agency being 
represented on the executive committee of the Board, and permitted 
the viewpoints of management, Agency and the operators to meet in 
this executive committee to consider policies and make actual deter­
ffiinations and give guidance to the company. Houston indicated that 
this mechanism was extremely effective in controlling the company.
