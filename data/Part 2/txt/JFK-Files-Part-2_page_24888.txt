Two documents which have been supplied to the Committee 
graphically demonstrate attitudes which car. lead to 
tactics that erode and could ultimately destroy the very 
ideals we must defend. 
The first was written in .1954 by a special committee form­
ed to advise the President on covert activities. The United 
.States may, it said, have to adopt tactics "more ruthless than 
[those] employed by the enemy" in order to meet the threat from 
hostile nations. The report concluded that "long standing 
American concepts of American fair play must be reconsidered.",'<-
Although those proposals did not involve assassinations, 
r 
the attitudes underlying them were, as Director Colby testified, 
indicative of the setting within which the assassination plots 
were conceived. (Colby, 6/4/75, p. 117) 
* The full text of the passage is as follows: 
another important ~equirement is an aggressive 
covert psychological, political, and paramilitary 
organization far more effective, more unique, and, 
if necessary, more ruthless than that employed by the 
enemy. No one should be permitted to stand in the 
way of the prompt, efficient, and secure accomplish­
ment of this mission. 
The second consideration, it is now clear that we 
are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective 
is wprld domination by whatever means at ~hatever 
cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto 
acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply. If 
the U. S. is to survive, long standing American con­
cepts _of Ameri.can fair play must be reconsidered.
