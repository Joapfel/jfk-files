d. 1HE QUESTION OF WHE1HER ASSASSINATION EFFORTS WERE DISCLOSED 
IN VARIOUS BRIEFINGS OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. 
(i) BRIEFING OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. 
After the election, in the latter part of November, 1960, Dulles 
and Bissell jointly briefed President-elect Kennedy on "the most important 
details with respect to the operation which became the Bay of Pigs." (Bissell, 
0/9/75, p. 34). Bissell testified that he did not believe the ongoing assass­
ination efforts were mentioned to the Presiclent-elect, and that to the best of 
his recollection they were not. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 27, 35-36). Bissell 
sunnised that the reasons he and Dulles did not tell Kennedy at that initial 
meeting were: (a) "apparently" they had not- thought it was an important

about an ongoing attempt to assassinate Fidel 
Castro? 
~1r. Bissell: I think that in hincl;;ight it could 
be regarded as peculiar, yes. 
"The 01airman: ... (I)t just seems too strange 
that if you were charged with briefing the man who 
* This was subsequently repeated by Bissell in response to examination of 
his asslUTiption that Dulles probably told President Eisenhower about the assass­
ination operation: 
" ... the Mafia operation was not regarded as of 
enonnous importance and there were much more . 
important matters to talk about with the 
President." (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 25).
