JEANNETTE RANKIN 
HELENA, MONTANA 
November 27, 1967 
TO ALL AMERICANWOMEN, 
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress 
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a 
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected 
to Congress. 
I believed then as I do tod~y that women are the ones who 
must be concerned with the needs and development of the 
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all 
human beings -- for those of the present as well as those 
of future generations. 
I will continue to struggle as l~ng as I live. 
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL,. and 
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening 
day of Congress.
