the . saw. a ... s~i:;o•tag:e. which 
involved, I think, oil fa~iliti~s, trancport~tion facilities, 
and a couple of other categories -- exfiltration was a 
frequent problem. I don't recall that·we worried so much 
about getting the agents in, but there seems always to be 
a great problem about getting them out. And that sort of 
thing that I mentioned, propaganda, there was the one island 
enterprise -- was Florida doing much good, and how much 
does it cost and things of that sort. 
Mr. ·schwarz. J\t ahy MONGOOSE meeting did Mr. Harvey 
state that he had taken steps to assassinate Fidel Castro? 
Mr. Dundy. I never heard anything from Mr. Harvey in 
any context in any meeting at any time on that subject. 
Mr. Schwarz. And it was clear that the President was 
the person basically in control, perhaps not of the details, 
but of the general program; is that right? 
Mr. Bundy. The President had worked it. The day to 
day operations where in the hands of different departments 
for different categories of programs. The coordinator was 
General Lansdale, and· the Chairman of the Committee was Genera] 
Taylor. 
Mr. Schwarz. Would you turn to Lansdale Tab 38, please? 
Where is the J\ugust 8 document that transmits the new 
guidelines for MONGOOSE? 
Mr. Kelley. That is Lansdale Tab 20.
