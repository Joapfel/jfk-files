27 March 1963 
NICARAGUA 
1. About 75 Nicaraguans have traveled to 
Cuba during the past 18 months. Nicaraguan 
security authorities list 22 as known to have 
received guerrilla warfare training there. 
2. Of the 22, eight were arreated when they 
returned to Nicaragua to carry on anti-Somoza ac­
tivities. Two have been sentenced to prison and 
the other six were released after interrogation. 
3. Cuba has dealt with, financed, and sup-_ 
ported a succession of Nicaraguan exile move­
ments, but Guevara recently told visiting Cen­
tral American Communists that none of these had 
developed a satisfactory level of popular sup­
port. Nicaraguan exiles maintain small guer­
rilla bands·across the borders in both Costa Rica 
and Honduras, making sporadic incurions, but to 
date they have evoked no internal support and 
have been effectively rounded up or driven back 
by the Nicaraguan National Guard. 
4. Eight Nicaraguans were tried in June, 
1962, for conducting terrorist training. They 
were caught while studying the manufacture of 
bombs under an instructor trained in Cuba. Nic­
araguan authorities seized arms, ammunition, ex­
plosives, and 700 pounds of propaganda. A Nic­
araguan found with an arms cache in April 1962 
reportedly told interrogators the arms had come 
from Cuba. A Nicaraguan who had gone to Cuba 
in mid-1962, ostensibly for a surgical opera­
tion 1 was caught shortly after his return with 
supplies of explosives intended for terrorist 
bombings. 
5. Altogether there have been five major 
subversive-incidents in Nicaragua since 1 Jan-
uary 1962, four of which involved individuals 
known or believed to have received training in 
Cuba. Perpetrators of the fifth incident are un­
known. A total of 41 persons were arrested. Nine­
teen were held for an appreciable time, and 14 
were tried and sentenced. Seven of the total 
41 are known or believed to have been trained in 
Cuba.
