do much about it - we cannot settle all the disputes, but ve want to 
keep them free from the Communists. We cannot permit those 'Who call

hope we can tie this whole concept or aid to the safety or the United

, States. This is the reason we give aid. The test is whether it will 
serve the United states and it we can equate it to that. AID is not 
a good word. Perhaps we can describe it better as Mutual Assistance -
though this is anold term. Some countries can go it alone, but we 
must do all we can. We must make every effort to keep a count.ry out 
or the· communist bloc. It is more ditfic'Q).t .to get a country out or a 
communist bloc once it is in. It sometimes seems hopeless •. The Congress 
may cut the heart out of Foreign Aid and this is a great danger to the 
safety or the United States. Even the French give more aid than we do 
on a per capita basis. Ve will probably take a cut, but ve do not want 
to hurt our Defense effort. We would not like four or five countries to 
suddenly turn communist just because we did not. give a certain amount of 
aid. We must look this over very carefully and put aid on the basis it 
will best serve our own interest.:]
