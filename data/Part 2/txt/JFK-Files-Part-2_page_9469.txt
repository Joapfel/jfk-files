LARRY POi'TBLL, member of the Detroit l~CCF, conc.ucted 
the political education classes on July 5, 1970, at ·which time 
the to:_:>ic of discussion was the centef page of the July 4, 
1970, issue of 11 'rhe Bl2.ck Panther" news9aper. Those in 
attendance were instructed.as follows: 
Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it. 
Put your words into action. Use the slogan "all power to 
the people" as the pi;:1s -think they are th'3 powe~. • Now we 
have to aad to our slogan 11 death to the pigs, 11 so stop 
talking and start putting your words into action. The pigs 
are plannin9 genocide against us. The reason there are more 
pigs in the com:nuni ty this y~~ar than last year is because 
they are planning to get rid of all blacks, and they war1t all 
blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to 
do is put a fence around it and give them just enough money 
to get food. They want to take everything away from us, but 
we still have the·power to destroy and there is no ·way the 
pigs can destroy the BPP. If they kill us off, our strugg.le 
will be taken up by the people in the com,'Uunj_ty as we are 
the people's pa;t"ty. If we d5m_1 1:, go to the people then ·we 
are not serving the people. Our· strugglG is not confined 
and exists also in the South in the field of Civil Rights. 
We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression 
and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed peoples.
