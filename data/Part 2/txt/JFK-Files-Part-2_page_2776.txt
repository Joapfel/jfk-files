There is but little which can be added to the comments made in 
the fitness report covering the period 1 January to 3 December 1965; 
Mr. Kent is an excellent officer in his specialtyi he holds strong 
opini~ns on cerWn issues, but • over the years - has learned to 
bend. His projected nnn-official cover assignment will utilize 
his talents Jor deaLiliig with Latin Americans and for translating 
ideas and conce;pts into meaningful action. .We wish him well.
