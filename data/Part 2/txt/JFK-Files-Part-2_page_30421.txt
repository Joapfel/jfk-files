you are making, let us say you adduced a nu~ber of analysts 
who examined this thing thJroughly and were in a position of

these analysts talk to my ~nalysts because I am not in a posi-
tion to make that kind of judgment." 1 
I 
Mr. Goldsmith. First of all, I am nc;,t making the statemert 
that Nosenko's story on Osi/a~d is inaccurate in any w~y. 
Secondly, even if the.story is inaccurate, I don't want· 
to suggest that because of that anyone on this Committee has 
any feeling that that means Nosenko is not bona fide. My 
question is really· very li.nited. A, if it were demonstrated 
that the story on Oswald is inaccurate, what impact would 
have on your overall assessme·nt?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes. 
I

Mr. Tovar. It would t'lave to be examined. It would have 1 
to be examined the full panoply of the whole Oswald issue. 
. :{·,wou1d say welwill get this team of analysts and we will 
_fight it out. We are talking about hypothesis.

the posture of making a fighting issue out of it. l

I no longer have any questions. I.will have questions 
ask whoever on your staff participated in the preparation of
