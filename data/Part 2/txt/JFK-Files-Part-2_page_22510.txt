Shortly after Wiley signed his contract with this 
Agency, he became involved in the l'forld Youth Festival 
(WYF) held in Vienna during July 1959. 
A memo dated 19 February 1959 to the Acting Chief, 
SRS, from Helene Finan (SRS) reports on a meeting between 
Finan and Wiley at which i'Iiley furnished inforr.:ation rela­
tive to the forthcoming \ffF to be held in Europe in mid­
summer 1959. According to this memo and an acco~panying 
one, Wiley said that Herb Romerstein (ex-Communi~t and 
HCUA employee), with the aid of Alfred Kohlberg (NYC 
importer and long-time anti-Communist activitist) and 
Colonel Archibald Roosevelt, has a project extant to send 
a delegation of 10 or more people to the WYF in Vienna in 
July, along with the left-wing American delegation.

an overt manner. Wiley t0ld Romerstein the project was 
his and Wiley shotild not be given any prominence. Wiley 
and his •vife will sign up next week. Don Sweeny (sic) of 
the American Legion a:id several individuals from various 
state police will also be among the group witting of the 
project. The group, probably no more than 10 in all, will 
attempt subtle propaganda, will sit singley throughout the 
hall and interject controversial or embarrassing topics 
into discussions. Wiley will play the role of the typical 
ll 
American with his ever-ready camera. Wiley wi 11 also work 
on behalf of the I&NS in gathering names and pictures. 
Helene Finan reported on 12 March 1959 to the AC/SRS 
that Wiley will attend the WYF in Vienna in summer of 1959 
for us (SRS). A 17 March 1959 memo states Wiley will leave 
New York with the delegation on 20 June 1959. After the 
Festival, the group (less Katina Wiley) plans to spend three 
weeks in the USSR as members of the U.S. delegation to the 
Festival. Wiley later changed his plans to include a visit 
to Europe and the Middle East before and to Europe and Eng­
land after the Vienna and USSR phases of the trip.
