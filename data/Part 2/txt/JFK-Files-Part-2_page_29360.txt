ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE# 614 OF "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE CIA 
AND MEXICO CITY. 
Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question 
of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass­
ination due to a memoranaum from J.·Edgar Hoover to the 
head of the Secret Service which said~ 
The Central Intelligence Agency advised that 
on October·l, 1963, an extremely sensitive 
source had reported that an individual iden­
ti:f:ied himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the 
Soviet ·Embassy in Me><ico City •inquiring as to 
any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau, 
who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,· 
Texas, h~ve observed photographs of the indi­
vidual referred to atove and have listened to 
a recording of his vcice. These Special Agents 
are of the opinion that the above-referred-to 
individual was not Lee Harvey O~wald. 
(Memorandum from Hoover to James J. Rowley, 11/23/63, 
pp. 4-5.)' The HSCA has aetermined that this statemert 
was probably. bas~d on ancther FBI memorandum which said: 
Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who. listened.to the 
·tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald 
from the. Cuban EmbasEy to the Russian Embassy in 
Mexico and examined the photographs of the v.isitor 
to the Embassy in Me><ico and were of the opinion . 
that neither the tape nor the photograph.pertained 
to. Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediately 
send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.
