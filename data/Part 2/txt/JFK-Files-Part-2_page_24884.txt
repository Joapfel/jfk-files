6. CIA Officials Made Use of Known Underworld Figures 
in Assassination Efforts 
Officials of the CIA made use of persons associated 
with the criminal underworld in attempting to achieve the 
assassination of Fidel Castro. These underworld figures were 
relied upon because it was believed that they had expertise and 
contacts that were not available to law-abiding citizens. 
Foreign citizens with criminal backgrounds were also used· 
by the CIA in two other cases that we have reviewed. In the 
development of the Executive Action capability, one foreign 
national with a criminal background was used to "spot" other 
members of the European underworld who might be used by the CIA 
for a variety of purposes, including assassination if the need 
should arise. In the Lumumba case, two men with criminal back-
grounds were used as field operatives by CIA officers in a 
volatile political situation in the Congo. 
B. Conclusions Concerning the Plots Themselves 
1. The United States Should Not Engage in Assa~sination 
We cannot condone the use of assassination as a tool 
of foreign policy. Aside from pragmatic arguments against the 
use of assassination supplied to the Committee by witnesses with 
extensive experience in covert operations, we find that assas­
sination violates moral precepts fundamental to our way of life.
