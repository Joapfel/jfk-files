Dear Secretary Baker: 
The Senate Intellfgence Committee, as part.of the annual 
• budget authorization process, will hold a hearing on U.S. 
counterintelligence and security programs on May 10, 1990, in 
Room SH-219 of the Bart Senate Office Building. We request

Selin, Undersecretary of. State for Management. Other 
witnesses invited to testify are FBI Director Williams.

Gardner Hathaway as CIA Associate Deputy Director for 
Operations and head of the CIA Counterintelligence Center, 
and Mr. Rich Haver, Special Assistant to the Secretary of 
Defense for Intelligence. 
We are asking all witnesses to .be prepared to discuss 
with the Committee the results of the Administration's review 
of·counterintelligence and security programs for the 1990s, 
whether recent changes"in the threat and operating 
environment require modifying objectives in the 1990s, and 
the implications for NFIP and non-NFIP resource allocation, 
program direction, and possible legislation. The hearing 
will also consider issues identified in testimony from a 
group of prominent citizens scheduled for March 22, and.we 
will be in touch with you further on those matters. 
We woul4 like Mr. Selin to address in his written 
testimony and ~e prepared to discuss the following questions: 
(1) To what extent has political change -in the soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe ~ffected their intelligence threat in the 
1990s and the requirements for •CI operations and security 
measures against. that threat? (2) To what extent do other 
traditional threats, such. as t'1e PRC and Cuba, r·equire 
greater attention in·the 1990s? (3) What are the emerging 
threats in the 1990s from third world and "friendly• . 
intelligence services, as well as narcotics traffickers -and 
terrorists? (4) What new challenges do technological _ 
advances and transfers to criteria countries and terrorist 
~groups pose in the .1990s? • (S) ·what are the consequences of 
th.ese changing threats for embassy security. priori ties -and.·.
