On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special 
Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams 
and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss 
any amendments the Bureau might request. I asked Mr. O'Connor who had 
approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they 
had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House. 
I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and ' ,, 
he said that they had been approved by Mr. Buchen (Counsel to the -~ 
President). r: 
Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mr. O'Connor 
and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of 
page 2A that the word ''use" useq in subparagraph (d) should be further 
defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be 
provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons 
to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor 
agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated 
with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-
paragraph (d). REC l 1 .A // ~ Q/'' - 02 V/ ~ .,,, ~ 2 'T) _. ~&I--ii 
Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI wa§ no'?agr·eeing '"

to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the 
Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the 
proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee. 
Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John Elliff that the 
Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment 
described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to 
proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreem.entas toj:h~!E:.et 
of the prop__osed procedures. The draft of the procedures is attached for the
