--State· clearance was ·obtaine.d on 6/2/58 for the FBI to develop ,-s 
sources and informants at Israeli .diplomatic establishments. Our request A 
for this .clea.ra.nce wa.s ba.sed upon our need to combat the activities of ~1 
. Israeli intelligence agents operating out of the Israeli Rmbassy, t,: 
!]ashing-ton, D. C~, and the Israeli United Nations Delegation, New York Ci.ty;~ 
.At the same time, as a result of the Suez Crisis j_n 1957-1957, the ·~~

··After instigating this program, we de-,.reloped an extremely valuable 
informant.who was an American citizen and who was employed at ·the Israeli 
ErAbassy. This informant was used for several years and furnished valuable

Israeli diplomatic establishments in the U. s. and persons who have 
operated in the past for the Israeli Intelligence Service. Some of these , 
persons continue to have contacts with.persons in Isra~1i establishments;· r

of the p?"ogram; . the fact that tb.e. Israel· Security Servt·ce is extremely i:
