Is essential for completing its work. 
Third, the legislation should Incorporate a statutory provision that, at a certain 
point In time, records will presumptively be opened unless the agencies are able to 
articulate specifte and persuasive reasons for continued redactions. Although it would 
be sensible to provide agencies with the benefit of the doubt regarding declassification 
for an initial period (e.g., between 10 and 25 years), once this period has passed the 
presumption should shift decisively In favor of releasing the lnfonnatfon. 
Founh, agencies should be required to do more than provide mere. •detailed 
Justifications• (see, e.g., S. 712 § 4(c)(2)(A)) for classifying and refusing to declassify 
records. The written explanations must be more than iustiflcatlons," they must be able 
to convince a skeptical reader who has sufficient information to evaluate the merits of 
the writing. 
Fifth, It would be hlghly advisable to provide the declassification entity (the 
National Declassificatl9n Center), with the authority to make binding requests to 
~gencies to search out records that may have been misplaced or misfiled. 
Finally, there is one additional recommendation that I would ~ake that 
presumably goes beyond the scope of today's hearing and so I will raise It only in 
passing. I believe it would be advisable for future Executive Orders to break dow11. the 
•sources and methods• exemption, Inasmuch as itis-used too casually and It covers a 
multitude of very distinct issues. To the extent that the Committee Is lnt~rested, I would 
be willing to submit addltlonal comments at a later point to develop this Issue.

I would like once again to tha.nk the Committee for taking seriously the right of 
the American people to better understand how their government functions. I would be 
pleased to answer your questions.
