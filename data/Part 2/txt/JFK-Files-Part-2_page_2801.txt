of twenty years of operational experience in the Latin American area. 
He also possesses an unusual degree of fluency in the Spanish language, 
ID addition to directing the Branch's overall covert action 
program, Mr. Kent personally handled the majority of the propaganda 
effort conducted by the Brancl1. He turned in a very strong performance 
in originating and coordinating propaganda guidance:s on the Chilean 
situation for use in the Western Hemisphere as well as other areas 
such as Europe. He showed a real flair for spotting propaganda 
vulnerabilities and then coming up with fresh ideas for the exploitation 
of these vulnerabilities. He particularly excelled in staying on

COMMENTS Of' RE\IIEWl"'tC, OF"P'ICtAL 
There ie little that I can add to this performance rating and 
narrative comments. I agree with the rating officer's judgment. 
Mr. Kent is a self-starter with a very imaginative mind, I have 
closely obs~rved his work on an effective propaganda operation in 
the economic field and found it highly successful and effective. 
His tenure as Acting Deputy Branch Chief left nothing to be 
desired. I was·also personally associated with him at the hemi-
sphere-wide publishers' meeting in late 1971. His profess iona 1 
conduct and good judgment during this meeting undoubtedly was
