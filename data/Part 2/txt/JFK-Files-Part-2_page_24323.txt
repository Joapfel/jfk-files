1. • Reference A recommended that there be returned to the Agency 
• Reserve starting with calendar year 1973 that portion of MH!-,tUTUAL annual 
profits not required for Project needs. The Director approved the basi.c 
paper on 8 February, but noted "surplus funds from MHMUTUAL earnings 
will be returned to the Treasury rather than the Agency Reserve." 
Reference B recorded a telephone decision by the Director that 11 [wJhen 
• funds are withdrawn from proprietaries, they will be transferred to the 
Contingency Reserve .... 11 
2. .'rhe purpose of this paper is to examine the legal aspects of these 
policy decisions. The concept of the Reserve was established -in 1952 as a 
means by which the Agency would have flexibility to fund projects or 
activities which had not been contemplated in the normal appropriation . . . 
. request. Its purpose was. to create a mechanism to provide fonds for· 
unforeseeable requirements which would be -more rapid and secure than 
. the supplemental appropriation procedure employed by other Government 
agencies. The Re.serve has been funded by direct approp~iation and by 
transfer of unobligated appropriations at appropriate times afte1· the close 
of the fiscal year. Funds were and are released from the Reserve only with 
the approval of Oi'vIB \vith subsequent notice of each Reserve withdrawal 
furnished in writing to the two appropriaHons committees.
