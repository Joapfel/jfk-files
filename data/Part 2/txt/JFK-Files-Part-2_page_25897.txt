"The genuine Cuban rer; elution -- because it was against the tyran­
ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and 
concepts were noble. .11 . 
"But that hope for frfedom and progress was destroyed. 
"The goals proclaimeJ in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana. 
"It is important to )~state what now divides Cuba from my country 
and from all the American !tountries: It is the fact that a small band 
of conspirat~rs has stripp
1
~d the Cu~an people of their fn~edom and hand­
ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces 
beyond the hemisphere. To,
1
ey have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial­
ism, an instrument of the !policy of others, a weapon in. an effort dic­
tated by external powers t6 subvert the other American republics. This, 
and this alone divides us ;·tr As long as this is true nothing is possible. 
Without it everything is p~ssible. . 
Ready and Anxious
