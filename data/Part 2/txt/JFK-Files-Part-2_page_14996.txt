JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; Fr ALo 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
. 
Hoffa and three others are presently serving 
prison terms as a result of their conviction in Chattanooga 
Federal Court 3/4/64, on charges of obstruction of justice. 
The only legal ·issues presently pending are two motions in 
the Circuit Court of Appeals, Cincinnati, ·on which 
arguments were heard 2/7/67, and a motion for new .trial 
filed in u. s. District Court, Chattanooga,2/28/67 alleging 
the.Government's use of wire tapping and electronic 
eavesdropping against Hoffa, his attorneys, and others. 
These charges, ·so far as the Bureau and its personnel are 
concerned, are completely false and the Government filed 
its response to this motion on 3/10/67. The Chattanooga 
court is expected to rule on this motion in the near 
futureo Although Hoffa is now in prison, his attorneys 
have continued unsuccessfully to shop around the Uo So 
Supreme Court in an effort to have one of the Justices 
release Hoffa on bail pending disposition of the pending 
motions.
