Several other subjects were discussed but none 
that I'· think. are worth roting at this point. Significantly 
enough, he did not rais·e any questions about the sugar 
quota nor did he engage in any specific discussions with 
regard to e::on.6mic. assistance. His primary concern seemed 
to be to convince me that he was sincere, that he was not a 
Connnunist and.that hi:.s policies· had the support of the great 
majority· of "the Cuban people. • • 
My· own appraisal o:f him as a man i$ somewhat mixed. 
The one fact we can be sure of is th.at he has those inde­
finable qualities· which :make hi1ll a leader of men. Whatever 
we may· th.ink of bi:m he is going to be a great factor in the 
development of Cuba and· very: pos·sibly· in Latin American 
affai.rs generally.· He s-eenjs to be sincere.. He is either 
.incredibly· riaive about Communis111 or under Communist discip­
line -,..-. my guess f's tlte fonner, and as I have already im­
plied his ideas as to how to run a government or an economy 
are less developed than those of ai.most any world figure I 
have met in fifty countries. • 
' • ' ' 
But because he has the power to lead to which I nave 
referred, we rave no choice but at ·least to· try to orient him 
in the right direction.
