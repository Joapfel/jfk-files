BACKGROUND 
• • The Attorney General on Saturday, 1-20-62 advised . 
·1 Assistant Director Evans he would like to receive this-..,·week the 
_ J?ire~tor•s·view~ as to.what add~tional t':chnica~ coverage should 
1nst1 tuted on d1plomat1c establ1shmeµts 1n 1'lash111gton, D. C. 
be 
. - Regarding the above tl1e Attorney General had previously 
·1 indicated on 1-11-62 he was thinking in terms of extending coverage on the smaller countries rather than the "Iron Curtain 11 countries. He 
fel.t coverage of the Iron Curtain countries was essential· but their 
·;representatives.were more alert to such coverage and he felt . 
. representatives of the smaller countries might talk more freely. He 
indicated he did not want coverage of our true friends, like the 
British.· He hinted at possible coverage of the Indonesians. On 1-20-62 when Evans sooke with him.he indicated he felt additional 4 . . . 
coverage of the African countries might be worthwhile. 
In analysing proposals .for increased coverage· we have taken 
a look at what we already have o We have tech11ical coverage in 
ilashington and/or New York 011 eight countries of the type being _ 
son~~dered? as.follows: Cub~, Dominican Rep?fblic, rrance, Ghana, f._;5rael, 
!:>aua1 Arabia (1n Boston), United Arab Republic and dest Gennanyo 1ne 
Saudi Arabian coverage, on King Saud, will be discoatinued this 1v,,eek. 
since King Saud is leaving Boston en route to Florida and then i~\go1ng horne .. State Department has advised it does not desire he be covered in 
Florida. • · . ·. . )\, . 
PROPOSED CQYERAfiB - . -.. ., (\
