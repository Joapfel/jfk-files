your experience in the State Department and the Treasury 
Department, and also your recent service on the Rockefeller 
Commission. But I wondered specifically, in reference to the 
assassination area, where we faced the need to tie up our 
investigations as soon as possible, and perhaps make some 
recommendations as soon as possible, do you have any specific 
suggestions? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't think so. I think that the recor 
has shown that this is the type of thing that the US 
Government or any of its branches cannot and should not engage 
in. And I doubt very much that there will be any repitition 
of this sort of thing that took place in the early sixties, 
which I guess was predicated on the belief that something like 
that could be done in exceptional circumstances without its 
being surfaced and being connected with the US. And I think 
even those who believed that such action was·morally proper 
and might have been in the best intersts of both the US and 
the world would think that the costs were too heavy if it was 
ever traced back to the US. And the record seems to show that 
it does get traced back. So I think that there will be a 
general agreement among those who are the type of people who 
would ordinarily think that such a thing should not be though 
of as US Policy. 
Mr. Baron. Are there any institutional changes that you 
would suggest to prevent the use of assassination as a tool
