3. Covert Economic Activities. 
a) Intensify covert activities directed against 
critical commodities destined for Cuba with resort, if 
necessary, to carefully conside~ed and controlled preclu­
sive ·buying.-
b) Make it known discreetly through the press 
that we maintain careful records of the companies dealing 
with Cuba, suggesting without saying so that these records 
constitute a potential "blacldist. 11 
c) Form a group of responsible and qualified 
Cuban exile businessmen to maintain pressure on firms 
trading with Cuba by indicating that such firms will have 
no future in a post-Castro Cuba. 
4. To the extent possible, encourage dissidence 
among different factions in Cuba - Peking, Moscow, 
National1st -- by spreading rumors, internal and 
external sabotage designed to accomplish this purpose 
(such as actions against homes of leaders, etc). 
Actions Against Cuban Subversion in Latin America 
1. Develop a list of vulnerable Cuban agents in Latin 
America against whom a concentr~ted program of bribery, 
blackmail and coercion can be instituted~ 
2. Carefully select key Latin American members of 
the Havana-Peking school and institute a program of kidnapping, 
and personal and physical harassment, while attempting to 
-attribute these acts to rivals who support Moscow. Institute 
the reverse 'p-:rocess as a retaliatory program against Moscow 
supporters. 
Any of the foregoing activities would be conducted against 
a background of l.J. s. propaganda (blac!-c, white and gray) and 
political activity designed to ·increase _internal dissension within 
Cuba, to support economic isolation of Cuba, to avoid splitting • 
with our allies over the Cuban issue and-to reduce, and perhaps 
eliminate, Castro subversion of Latin Ainerica. In addition, 
surveillance activities should be significantly stepped up.
