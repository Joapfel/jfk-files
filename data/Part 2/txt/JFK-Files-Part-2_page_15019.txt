M.A. Jones to Bishop 
RE: LUNCHEON-WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
Civil Service Commission, and sponsor a one-day seminar on law 
enforcement managed by Federal Executive Board groups. 
Kern was told that it was, of course, desirable to have 
U. S~'Attorneys participate in civic affairs but that U.S. 
Attorrieys should not attempt to sponsor one-day seminars on the 
subject of law enforcement inasmuch as this would only promote 
confusion and chaos. Kern was also told that the FBI is already 
sponsoring such seminars and conferences and that in some instances 
representatives of the U.S. Attorneys'. offices were invited to 
'l
participate in these conferences. The subject of discussion this 
year is Legal Problems involving Law Enforcement Officers and 
the National Crime Information Center ..
