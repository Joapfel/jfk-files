: l. : The good of Lzle O. Kelly. _ 
-·_In the SllDIDler of .1950 QKStair was in the ridiaal.ous position of'·.­
being tmable ·to : do an;ytbiDg because the alien support on which it • de- • 
_ pended; allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr·. Glantz, w.s not 
-• forthcoming. In a bit of a tiz:157, amd.ous to get cracking, we picked -• 
up Lyle O. K~. • We suspected at· the time that he was not the mv .-••·· ____ -
-.. "white hope•, but· we needed someone. through whom we -could obtain bodies. 
• We obtained bodies ~ Kelly and actu.al.17 have accomplished some _

2. .The bad of' Lyle 9 I Kelly. 
• -Kelly, tmf'orttmatel.y, is of an assent~ irresponsible 
Irish nature. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to 
be equa.µy stupid. F.arl.y in our relations vi.th Kelly, bef'ore I left • 
LCDrink in October, ve foresaw the need to curb Kell.Jr or to eliminate 
him.from our operations. Since, however, hevas still necessar., to t1S, 
we tried to use ·him, reatraining him and teaching him the while. --

. Kelly, ,mf'ortunately, did not learn - h~ go~ worse. • He nbor- • 
_roved" and stol~_ money f'rom JIISJ:lY sources. He. lied· ta ma.Jl1' people~ -in­
cluding us, ·and he developed an infantile megalorna:i:da in which he per­
sisted in considering himself the forthcoup,ng Minister-President of 
·_ DreaDiland.
