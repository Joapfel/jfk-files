Item No. 49 MSS p. no. 71a. 
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily 
American is still classified SECRET because it describes 
intelligence sources and-methods as related to newspaper 
publications. CCS file~ contain a newsclip from the 
September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia 
Journalism Review which states; "Landon K. Thorne, Jr., 
the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA, Benjamin Shute, 
then a partner in the prestigious Wall Street law firm 
of Cravath, Swaine~ and Moore, now acknowledge that the 
fourth partner· [ih the purchase of the Rome Daily American 
in 1956] was the CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrange~ 
ment 'atypical' of what the Agency was doing, 1·a bad • 
example'." It_is questionable whether the remarks made by 
Mr. Bross,who retired from the Agency in 1971, arid Mr. Shute, 
who left the Agency long before that, can be considered 
• as constituting-official Agency disclosure of- this· 
information. • •
