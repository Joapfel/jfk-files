RICHARD KENNETH KAUFMAN-VI9TIM 
EXTORTION,· 5-26-60 
Richard Kaufman, a student ·at Syracuse University, 
New York and son of Federal Judge· Irving Kaufmari, who 
presided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums, on 
3-1~60, received an anonymous threatening phone call. The 
unknown caller.made reference to victim's father and.threatened 
"Just wait until we get hold of you.ft Kaufman received another· 
call of a similar nature on 4-4-60 and on 4-5-60 received the 
first of 4 threatening letters, all.postmarked Syracuse, 
New York. The last of these communications bore an April 12, 
-1960, date. 
AUSA Kenneth R~y of the Northern District of New Y0rk, 
ha~ indicated letters coupled.with previous phone calls 
constituted a violation of the Federal Extortion Statute and 
his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960. 
Extensive investigation has been conducted by our 
Albany Office in an effort to identify and locate th~ extortion­
ist .. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and 
no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the 
I 
fact that the rumors pervail_~- among f_ ellow students, faculty 
members, and·advisors of the victim that he prepared the . 
communications .i1l question. While no direct evidence cor­
roborating these rumors has ·been uncovered, wri.ting paper and 
envelopes similar to that used in one of the communications 
~ound in the victim's room~ 
The Department has requested copies of all investig·a-
l 
tive reports.· Judge Kaufman will be confidentially· advised of the 
facts developed by our-investigation, after which the reports will 
be disseminated to the Department.
