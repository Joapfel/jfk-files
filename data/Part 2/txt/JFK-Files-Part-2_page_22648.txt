Senator Daker. And did McCone accept your advice? 
Mr. Angleton. He did, except that I understood that

Elder and I asked him, and he said, who in the Agency ever

And I said, he is an old man and doesn't think too

And I never heard from him since. Dut McCone was a man 
whowould not have made this statement. He has total recall.
