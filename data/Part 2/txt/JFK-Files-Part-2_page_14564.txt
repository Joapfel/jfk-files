previously obtained State Department clearance for investigation and 
inteririew o.t the individual considered as a potential s.3ource without 
revealing to State the purpose of same. Recently State declined clearance 
for interviews with individuals employed at three embassies although 
clearance had earlier been obtained from State to investigate these· 
individualso In order to eliminate wasted investigative effort on 
source development in an establishment at which State will not give 
clearance for interview, since JLay, 1958, we have cleared our intentions 
with State Department before authorizing Field to expend investigative 
effort in developing sources in a particular field. (J,i'emorandum Donahoe , . 
to Belmont 5/16/58). That memorandum also stated that we should concentrat_ :· , 
in this regard on a controlled selection of specific "trouble-spot" '· 
countries where a program OJ source development ts warranted. ,'"cc,c<e.SC• 
In this regard the existing critical political situation in 
the Far East definitely warrants that we continue our efforts to 
develop saurces at all official establishments in the UoS. of lvationalist 
China.
