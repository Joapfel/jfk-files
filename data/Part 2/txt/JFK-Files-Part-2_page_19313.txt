' A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his 
understanding that the Natio.nal Lawyers Gui_ld (NLG) was 
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicag0 
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the 
national group in -New York, was formed shortly theres.ftex· :­
pos~ibly-in 1937 by a gioup of liberal progressive lawyers 
in protest against activities of the American Bar Assoc~~tion 
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive 
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters tut 
occasionally uses the return address of its official~ in 
literature.
