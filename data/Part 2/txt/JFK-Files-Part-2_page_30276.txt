Soviet citizens with foreign. f . s . I A oreigner can marry a ov1et~ 
I 
citizen, by the law. There is not a thing that KGB can in an} 
way try not to give, not to make it possible, but this is in I 
cases when the person who is marrying a foreigner worked in 
some sensitive place, let's say, in missiles, rocket 
industry production, was in process of any plabe of his work 
ing seeing classified material. In these tases, KGB will try 
to put different type of fence~. But it is unlawful~ In 
accordance with Soviet law, marriage is allowed; he doesn't 
I 
need to ask permission of Soviet Governmerit or anyone. And h~s 
wife, Marina~ wasn't working in any place which was sensitive 1 
from the point of view of Soviet security. 
Mentally unstable it doesn't mean that he is raving

mad; it is•mentally·unstable.
