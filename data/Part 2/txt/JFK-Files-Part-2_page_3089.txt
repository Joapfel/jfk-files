leader whom we could recognize as the

* In preparing this comment, the former President ap­
parently had to .call on his own memory, on the memory 
of Gen. Goodpaster~ and.the memory of Gordon Gray. 
Based on his own recollections Eisenhower said that 
neither his own· nor Goodpaster's records contained 
anything about the 17 March 1960 meeting. Similarly, 
Gordon Gray wrote to Eisenhower: 
You may .recall that not so very long 
after I becaine your Special Assistant, in 
a meeting yo~ had with Allen Dulles and 
. me you gave instructions that activities 
of the so-called ltSpe6ial Group~ should 
not be recorded. iii any place except the 
files of the Director of the Central Iri­
telligence Agency. You did not •'wish that 
there .be other copies. It was for this 
·reason.that I did not seek a copy of the 
March 17th paper for.my files,·nor did I 
make notes at.that meeting. 
Subsequent to March 17th, I began to 
make memoranda of every meeting on that 
particular subject.because i had a hunch 
that someday these might be important, and 
I intended to put them in your hands at the 
appropriate time;-understanding, of course, 
that you might wish to have them destroyed. 
Incidentally, there. were no carbons or 
other copies, made of these memoranda. By 
not making copies, and by planning to put 
t}:ie documents in your own hands for what­
ever. disposition you.wished to make of 
them; I sort c;:,f rationalized my violation 
of your instructions about not making such 
memoranda. I hqpe I need ··not ·.as.sur~ you 
that it was not my practice to violate 
your instructions and this .is.the only 
instance ·of 'such :that I can recall~~/
