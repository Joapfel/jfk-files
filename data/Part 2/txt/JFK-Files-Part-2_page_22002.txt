of operation. This would include training of exiles in cross-border 
operations with a long-range objective of establishing a clandestine 
organization and building an effective opposition in Haiti."

keep the Cuban security forces busy. 11 Note further that the Minutes 
of October 3, 1963, state that higher authority (President Kennedy)
