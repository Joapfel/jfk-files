severely dam.age the morale and moti·vation of anti-regime Cubans 
both inside and outside of Cuba, which will make it increasingly 
difficult for us to recruit agents, maintain agents already 
recruited, and continue or intensify our intelligence and other 
efforts against Cµba and the Castro-communist regime. 
F. Despite the above factors, Higher Authority probably 
will continue heavy pressure on the CIA for a maximum effort 
against Cuba and may even continue to contend that the ultimate 
objective is the overthrow of the Castro-communist regime. 
This is an unrealistic objective, however, except on a very 
long-term basis as the United States Government, we believe, 
will be unwilling in the immediate future to commit troops 
to support such an overthrow. The United States Government 
in its overt dealings with the Cul;Jan exiles probably will not 
express the above factors to them in the context or with the 
bluntness stated here. 
G. In view of these factors, the so-called "Track Two" 
course of action, i.e., unlimited support of Cuban exiles 
and exile groups with no real control or objective purposes 
in the hope that these groups will be able to shake the 
Castro regime will, although unrealistic, become increasingly 
attractive at various levels in the United States Government. 
H. As a matter of policy, political pressures and 
economic pressures short of blockade, raids, and aggressive 
sabotage against Cuba will be continued.
