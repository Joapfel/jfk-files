Mr. Baron. Would it surprise you if that were the case? 
Mr. Halley. The. Tony Varona thing would surprise me·, 
frankly. I think I would not -- I would be surprised, yes. 
Mr. Baron. Why is that? 
Mr. Halley. Well, because here is a case where the guy 
was a prominent exile figure,.~ssentially residing in Miami, and 
I knew of no contacts or had ·:no reasons to suspect any contacts 
with this kind of an exile figure, though once it specifically 
appeared, I was aw~re of and it was discussed. This was done 
lO under FitzGerald's stewardship with the Task Force. I was 
11 aware of that. I would be surprised if sombone was in touch 
12 with Tony Varona and I did not know about it. If you told me 
13 that is what happ.,,?1c::d, that is what Harvey has testified to,

ship with him .. As to the nature of the project, you know Artime 
ran·from the -AgenGY, from other people who actually worked with 
·J\im on a fi'.:."st time bas is.

Mr. Halley. Let me make sure We are talking about the same 
thing.
