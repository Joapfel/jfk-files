Warren Commission staffers who were in Mexico wanted to talk 
to Duran. He said that he knew Clarence BOONSTRA well, that 
the last he heard he was in North Florida, but that he had 
never discussed the assassination or Oswald with him.

safe after he died but that he has heard a vague story that 
someone went out and found a lot of documents that Scott had 
kept.
