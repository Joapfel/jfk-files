• • In connection with the above authorizations it was 
explained that as soon as Mr. Gray was named as the new Director Mr. Felt brought bim ·to the Director's office to afford him an idea of the office set-up; that Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest 1n the files in my offiee; that.their contents were ex­plained t~ him and that he was invited to· view the· contents. He did glance thru a drawer.and obviously 
was satisfied that they contained person~l correspondence 
anly, and ~as also satisfied that the Bureau ma·terial had· been delivered to Mr. Felt. One or the questioners 
remarked tha~ there -appeared t~ be more· o.c. files than had been indicated; that a larger number had been gi~en to Attorney General Le&'.i~-•. I remarked that I would not 
know whether other files had been added to the lJroup after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstetn

To questions rega.eding the destruction of personal oorrffspondence files I explained that up until the 
time l left the Bureau I continued to tear up and de­po~it the contents of these files in the "confidenti~l tr~·~hn' waste baskets;. (Mr. Mohr here explained this . method of disposal.) that I had-asked Mr. Gray.if, in 
order to vacate the office as soon as possible fQ~ hi~ 9onv~hienoe, I could have his approval to ·send t9 
Mr. Hoover•.s house files which could not be disposed of before-my date of retirement and finish the tasktilere. 
He did not hesitate to give me this pei\mission. (.Mr. Felt, who was present when I spoke with Mr. Gray (in my office) 
suggested that a locked room on the fifth floor, with a 
key only I would have, could be made available so the files would be disposed ofi. without moving. -;--7 , • • i -said that 
would not be necessa~y and Mr. Gray agreed. At this point Mr. Gitenstein asked me if I thought I might not be the only one with a key. I asked him what he would haYe thought and he smiled and said he would have thought that.
