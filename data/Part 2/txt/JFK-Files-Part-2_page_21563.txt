Mr. Madigan. Did Maheu set that up? 
Mr. O'Connell!. Yes. 
150 
Mr. Mdigan. Both the original contact and the later party 
in San Francisco? 
Mr. O'Connell. Yes. 
Mr. Madigan. And were those the only two times now that 
he was involved in the operations field? 
Mr. O'Connell!; Oh, no. Be did a lot of other things. 
Mr. Madigan. Let me ask you this question. 
When Maheu was having his problems with the authorities, 
was there any reference back to his involvement in those kind o 
activities, or was the only discussion about his role in 
the so-called ~ssassination plot? 
Mr. O'Connell. Well, I am not even so sure that they got 
into that aspect of it. It was just that he was involved 
to the extent that he had set up the operation against Rowan, 
or he was the one that got in touch with DuBois to do it. 
Mr. Wides. When did you come back from overseas? 
Mr. O'Connell. July of 1965. 
Mr. Wides. ·After you came back did you learn of a time, 
either after you came back or very shortly before you came
