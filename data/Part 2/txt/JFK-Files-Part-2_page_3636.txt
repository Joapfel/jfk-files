a. According to press reports, 
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped 
out two of the government's strategic 
hamlets in the central highlands about 
250 miles north of Saigon. 
b. More than 1,000 inhabitants 
in the hamlets--who are minority 
tribesmen--are missing and possibly 
have fled into the mountains. They 
abandoned a significant quantity of 
weapons to the Viet-Cong. 
c. These attacks not only sug­
gest continued erosion of the govern­
ment's programs to win over tribal 
support, but also signal that stepped­
up Viet Cong pressure against the new 
regime is spreading to the north.
