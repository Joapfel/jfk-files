for the proprietary are compatible and consistent with normal practices 
and requirements for the type of instrumentality being established. 
The Director of Finance representative is the Chief of the Connnercial 
Systems and Audit Division, a position normally occupied by a certi­
fied public accountant. 
The initial and all subsequent passages of funds to such proprie-
• taries are from the current year Agency operating budget. Receipts 
of funds by the proprietary are documented as appropriate ostensibly 
to appear to be from a source usual to a commercial enterprise of 
similar type, e.g., capital stock, paid in capital, income from 
ostensible sales, etc. 
The Agency treats all disbursements to such proprietaries as 
current year budgetary expenditures and concurrently establishes as 
a control mechanism a fully reserved investme~t account which is 
reconciled periodically to reported net worth of the proprietary as 
reflected in required financial statements received from each proprie­
tary. Each such statement is reviewed to reconcile the approved 
financial activity of the proprietary to reported changes in net 
worth before adjusting the Agency investment account to conform with 
the reported net worth. 
All control documents evidencing Agency equity or interest in 
the proprietary, e.g., executed stock certificates. irrevocable stock 
powers, declaration of trust, etc .. are held in safekeeping by the 
Commercial Systems and Audit Division/OF provided that when such 
documents need to be retained by the proprietary. a report will be 
made to identify the documents retained, location, name of custodian and 
reason for the retention, and copies of the documents, if appropriate.
