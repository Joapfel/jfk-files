Hed6man testified that all of his cable traffic about the 
assassination question would have been sent with the same 
extraordinarily stringent security precautions --: presumably re­
ferring to the PROP channel -- which concerned 0o~~lieb '~ visit 
and the confirmation of authorization for his instructions: 
I would have sent in a special ·channel 
anything dealing with Lumumba, at least 
that would touch upon his removal in one 
way or another. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 62.) 
The ~hief of)station also testified that sometime before 
leaving the Station, he destroyed all cable traffic relating to .. 
the assassination missio~ (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 89). Hedgman's 
best recollection was that he had received instructions to destroy 
those cables (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96). Hedgman said he had never 
before in his tenure as ~hief of)station in the Congo destroyed 
cable traffic b~cause of its sensitivity (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 91). 
But he stated _that the cables relating to assas·sination were 
destroyed because of their extremely sensitive nature.* He said 
* It is pos~{ble that copies of cables deiling with such a 
sensitive operation were also destroyed at CIA headquarters.
