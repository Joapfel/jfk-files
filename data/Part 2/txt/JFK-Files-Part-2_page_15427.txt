We are requesting State to grant clearance ·for us to conduct > 
a program to develop sources and_ informants at diplomatic .. establishments.·,·· 
in the United States oj the Government of the Republic of.·the Congo • 
in view of political crisis existing in that country and in view of. 
Soviet support and support of other African and pro-Sovt:e,:t countries 
of procommunist political group- in the Rep_ubl_ic of the Congo. 
The Republic of the Congo obtained its freedom from Belgium 
in 1960 and since that time has been involved ina political turmoil 
,!;. between opposing factions. The procommunist - pro-Soviet faction was 
represented by Patrice Lwn_umba who was killed in the Republic of the· 
Congo during _.February, 1961. As .a_ result of his death, procomrnunist -·'.'. 
and anti-iYestern demonstrations were held in the United States and in __ _ 
many countries of the world. Lumwnba 's Lieutenant Antoine Gizenga, - :.~ ... __ 
who is pro-Soviet, has assumed -Lumumba 's position with the dissident .- ~-• -
group. In view of critical political situation existing in the Republic~~-
of the Congo and the fact that. S9viet;.Russia and other pro-Soviet - • - \ · 
African countri.es (Ghana, Mali and Guinea) are supporting the ·'. : I 
pro-Gizenga faction in the Republic of_ the Congo, it was believed t 
desirable in late 1960 that we should endeavor to establish sources in ·o• 
diplomatic establisr,.,ments of the Republic of the Congo in the United C-' , 
States. Through such sources it· was believed we c~d" obtain A:_ I 
intelligence information of value to the United States,s~{J._overnment and f.d\ 1 
be in a position to promptly institute investigation of any matter 8\ 
•. coming within our jurisdiction_ through such coverage. Both New York ~~ 1 
and WFO have made inquiries in the past and were unable_ to ascertain ~~ 
: that the Republic of the Congo had set up any diplomatic establ ish,m~ts ~-- l 
in the Un~ted States. The New York Office has now determined that-~ 
temporary officefor its United 1Vations .Delegation has been set up • I 
at 145 East Forty-ninth Street,· New York City, and New York has.· I.
