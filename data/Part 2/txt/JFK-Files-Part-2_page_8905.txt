(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
NOSENKO's Information 
SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex­
traction, a Russ~an speaker, and a university professor 
in New York City. SHUBIN, who had visited the Soviet 
Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1958 
or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of 
duty in the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN 
was the target of Seventh Department case officer 
A.A. VETLI'l'SKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was 
placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance 
observed SHUBIN as a passenger in a I1inistry of Defense 
automobile, the GHU was asked about the American. "They 
very furtively said that they were interested in him," 
from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent. 
In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign 
visitors to the Soviet Union and he noted SHUBIN's name 
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent. 
NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office 
and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according 
to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by 
others). SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for 
having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's 
interest in SHUBIN. 
a sensitive source 
Comment: Earlier, - identified ai. 
agent apparently identical with SHUBIN 
and Fl3I sources reported SHUBIN's travel 
to the USSR in summer 1961 and in 
September 1963. 
SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport 
between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited 
the Soviet Union during that period it was 
not as an American tourist under his true 
name. Consequently, he could not then have 
been the tourist target of the Seventh 
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed. 
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring 
to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further 
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have 
noticed his name while reviewing tourist 
lists in the Seventh Department, because 
he claims he was in the American Department 
at the time.
