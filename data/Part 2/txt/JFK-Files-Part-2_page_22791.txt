•Mr. Dundy, That is what I don't know. I cannot 
recollect who it was. And I think it inapproprate to guess 
when I have no recollection. 
Mr. Schwarz. What time? I don't mean what time of day, 
but what time? 
Mr. Bundy. As I say, sometime I think in the early 
months of l9Gl. And searching memory is an uncertain busi­
ness, but it sticks in my mind that I heard about it in the 
rooms of the Executive Office Building. And that 
would place it in time, because I moved from.the Executive

Office Building to the \-lest Basement of the \'lhite House· 
after the nay of'Pigs, perhaps in May. 
sometimd I 
Mr. Schwarz . So based on that fact you place it in 
time sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs and sometime after--
Mr. Bundy. After my arrival in l'.1ashington. 
Mr. Schwarz. And when did you arrive in Washington? 
Mr. Bundy. About the 10th of January. I would place 
i~ more closely, because I think it was after I was in the 
Office of the Special Assistant, which, of course, was occupied 
until the 20th of January by others. 
Mr. Schwarz. So you place it after the 20th of January, 
but before the Bay of Pigs, which was April 14 or 17? 
Mr. Bundy. That is right. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did it come up in a context where you 
urged that such a capacity be created?
