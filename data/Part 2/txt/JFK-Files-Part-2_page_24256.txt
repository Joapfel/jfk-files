turning to Nyrop and saying, Don, you ought to be 
glad that you don't have a really good, reliable 
·competitor in there.· He said, If you were being 
competed with by private business, you'd have real 
headaches. You ought to be real glad that it's not 
worse than it is. And that's the end of that. 
Houston conceded that some passengers were going on basically CIA 
planes instead of Nyrop's Northwest planes. The impact, however, 
was minimal. Moreover, the CAB in this proceeding was- advised of 
the-dilennna. They did participate in discussions with' both the 
Agency and the particular·business entity that was making the com­
plaint, and the CAB, after hearing both sides, "came down on the 
side of the Agency after making a reasoned judgment.'.' 
By this time the airline's commercial international business 
was not making money. A maintenance contract work, which was being

aspects of this operation. This originally_ stemmed from the fact 
* The LST and barge which 'had previously been used for maintenance 
purposes became inadequate. Therefore the Agency built a plant 
in Taiwan 11that is now there but has been recently disposed of to 
E Systems, and a very good plant it was." E Systems' role in the 
acquisition of proprietary assets is detailed later.
