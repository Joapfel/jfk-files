It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel 
Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning 
COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are 
below the level of Section Chief. The prior procedure and policy 
of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below 
a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or ,,_ __ 
~o~. ( 
F. A.O. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was 
contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he 
wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent 
personnel included in the report under the title of Section Chief. 
He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utili­
zation of the identity of Agent personnel will be consistent.with 
the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report. This 
report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the 
identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan. 
No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact, 
Dick did not identify SACs ~µ:s,:9lved in this operation.tit/~
