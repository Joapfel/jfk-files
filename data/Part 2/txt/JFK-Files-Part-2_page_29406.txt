The Station. feels th:it it would be helpful 
to summarize at this time informatio~ 
previously report~d to Headquarters (see 
. paragraph 3, reference B) concerning the photo 
basehouses under this project and thereby 
give Hea~quarters an updated frame of 
reference in whi·ch to view the roles of the 
various basehouses. 
The LIMITED and LILYRIC basehouses 
provide co~erage of front of the LIMERICK 
•installation. Although on the surface it may• 
appear that these t~o basehouses provide 
duplicate take, thi5 is not the case. It has 
been the Station's experience in ruhning the 
unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900 to 
evening· workday, which wbuld be requir~d of 
a single basehouse in order to cover the· 
LIMERICK target effEctively, is j~st too long 
for any pair of ager ts to remain effective. 
This is- especially 1.rue when it is considered 
that· these basehous1·· operators are essentially 
unsupervised during their workday. It would 
also ~e impossible ~·or a single ·bas~-house to 
providi the _kind of coverage this station needs 
on the target insta· lation., especi·ally during 
the peak h·ours of activity, nainely late 
morning and early. a ·'ternopn. • For these 
reasons_, the LILYRI1; basehouse. general-ly 
operatts from 0900 ·:o 1400 or 1500 weekdays. 
LIMITED operates fr1>m 1200 to 1800 or dark 
(as the daily situa·:ion dictat~s) on weekdays, 
arid 0900 to 1400 on S~turdays. (These hburs 
are subject to chan-1e to fit Station needs.)· 
Special coverage fo· Sunday is arranged on a 
need basis; however, past ~xperience has shown 
regular c~verage of Sattirday afternoons and 
Sundays is not rewa.~ding. This schedule 
provides for both b1sehouses to be in action
