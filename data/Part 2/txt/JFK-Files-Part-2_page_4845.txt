INTERVIEWER: Okay, what about th1s one, Sam, and you"ve really 
been very, very patient. I really appreciate ,it. What are the 
lessons that you think are to be learned from the Church and 
Pike investigations? Either institutional lessons, that is the 
Agency or .. 
MR. HALPERN: I think first of all you need one, I think if you 
are going to have an ov~rsight it should be one joint 
committee, a small oversight comm1ttee, not very many numbers 
either in staff or in Representatives and Senators. The 
Director has to be honest with these guys. He has got to tell 
them lots of things that he normally wouldn't tell them, I 
think. And what he tells them has to be cleared with the 
President before he tells them, except for the normal mundane 
things like normal budget stuff and normal personnel fiiures. 
No President should get involved 1n that. It's silly. But in 
terms of specific activities, whether intelligence collection 
or counterintelligence or covert action, don't dummy up with 
Congress. On the other hand, you've got to build a rapport 
where there are certain things they are not going to ask you 
about -- they shouldn't ask you about~- such as identities of 
agents; and that kind of thing. Such,as the kind of liaison 
arrangements you make with foreign governments. Yeah, they 
might consider it as a treaty and, therefore, it comes under 
the treaty making power. It's advise and consent powers of the 
Senate. But I think they've got to bite the bullet themselves
