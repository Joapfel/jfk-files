Fingerprints of Congressmen 
(10) The files of.the Identification Division 
<;:ontain the fingerprints of an unknown number of S_enators 
and Congressmen. Some of these relate to their having been 
arrested for violations of Federal, $tate, or local laws. 
Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to 
their having served in the Armed Forces or having been appli­
cants for various positions. These fingerprint cards have 
been submitted to the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as·by 
local, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout 
the United States. 
Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's 
Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate 
and apart from all other files and records of the FBI. 
HOW INFORM..~TION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN' REACHES FBI FILES: 
There are two basic types of information regarding 
Congressmen and Senators in FBI files: 
(1) Information whlch the FBI has solicited during 
investigat.:i.ons involving the Congressman or Senator as either 
a subject or a victim. This includes information of 
pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has 
furnished to the FBI. 
(2) Unsolicited Information. 
There are many sources of the unsolicited information 
that is included in FBI files: 
\ . 
(a) It is volunteered by citizens who are being 
interviewed during inves~igations of matters 
having no relationship to any of our Nation's 
lawmakers. 
(b) It is volunteered in communications sent to the 
E'BI by individuals and organizations. 
(c) It is included in news articles and other reports 
publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media 
which come to the FBI's attention. 
(d) It is received from FBI confidential informants 
and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not 
directed at a Congressman which have been 
installed with authority of a Federal Court 
and/or authority of the Attorney Generale
