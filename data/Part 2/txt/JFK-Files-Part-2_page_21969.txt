Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint." It was concluded that Viaux 
did not have more than one chance in twenty--perhaps less--to launch a 
successful coup. Kissinger ticked off the list of negative repercussions 
from an unsuccessful coup. The CIA record of the meeting continues: 
5. It was decided by those present that the 
Agency must get a message to Viaux warning him 
against any precipitate action. In essence our 
message was to state: "We have reviewed your 
plans, and based on your information and ours, 
we come to the conclusion that your plans for a 
coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, 
they may reduce your capabilities for the future, 
Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. 
The time will come when you with all your other 
friends can do something. You will continue to 
have our support.'' 
6. After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux coup 
plot, at least temporarily, Dr. Kissinger instruc­
ted Mr. Karamessines to preserve Agency assets in 
Chile, working clandestinely and securely to main­
tain the capability for Agency operations against 
Allende in the future, 
8. The meeting concluded on Dr. Kissinger's note 
that the Agency should continue keeping the pres­
sure on every Allende weak spot in sight--now, 
after the 24th of October, after 5 November, and 
into the future until such time as new marching 
orders are given~ Mr. Karamessines s~ated that 
the Agency would comply.
