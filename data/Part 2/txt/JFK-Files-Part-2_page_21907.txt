WIROGUE only as a CIA officer would "normally do ... when you 
speak in a derogatory manner of an asset." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 101) 
The ~hief of}Station maintained that WIROGUE's proposition 
to QJWIN to join an "execution squad" could be attributed to 
IHROGUE 's "freewheeling" nature. Hedgman said: 
I had diffi~ulty controlling him in that he 
was not a professional intelligence officer 
as such. !le seemed to act on his o,m without 
seeking ~uidance or authority ... I found 
he was rather an unguided missile ... the 
kind of man that could get you in trouble be­
fore you knew you were in trouble .... 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 96-97). 
But Hedgman did not disavow all responsibility for WIROGUE's actions: 
[I]f you give a man an order and he carries it 
out and causes a problem for the Station, why 
then as (chief of)Station, well, you accept 
responsibility., (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.) 
In sum, the ~hief orj Station testified that despite the fact 
.• 
that the CIA was interested in the assassination of Lumumba durinf, 
this. period, agent WIROGUE 's attempt to form an "execution squad" 
was an unauthorized, maverick action, unconnected to the CIAassassi-
nation plan. 
Nonetheless, the fact that WIROGUE was to be trained in "medical 
immunization" (I.G. Memorandum, 3/14/75) raises the possibility 
that he was connected to the plot to assassinate· Lurnumba by means 
of lethal biological substances. The 1975 report on HIROGUE's case
