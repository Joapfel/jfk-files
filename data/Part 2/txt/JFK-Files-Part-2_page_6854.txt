Gcit~s, ·1s that everything that can be released should be 
released? 
GATES: Absolutely, Mr. Schiff. 
REP.· SCHIFF: Thank you very much. I yield back.,. Mr .

REP. CONYERS: Thank you, Mr. Schiff. 
The chair recognizes Mr. Thornton. 
REP. RAY THORNTON ( D-AR ): Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman. 
And thank you, Director Gates, for a very forthcoming 
and positive testimony before this committee .. _ I think that it 
is important to emphasize that we share an--interest in --
disclosing all of the information related to the substance of 
this without jeopardizing the capacity of your agency to conduct 
its business. ~ 
And in fact, Section 6 of the proposed resolution says 
that disclosure to the general public of assassination material 
or particular information in assassination material may be 
postponed if its release would--and there's a whole list--but 
among that list is, if an intelligence source or method which is 
currently utilized or reasonably expected to be utilized by the 
United States government is involved. 
And Director Gates, I believe that you're telling us, 
and I want to ask you directly, that if the standards that are 
contained in this resolution were adopted, and the CIA's records 
as you have suggested they should be, were released, with those 
safeguards, do you believe that any sensitive sources or methods 
would be revealed or compromise by the information which is 
released? · --··-
GATES: I think that the provisions that provide for 
the protection of spurces and methods and that allow us 
ultimately the president to have the final say would provide 
adequate safeguards. -.::;-
REP. THORNTON: The protections in the bill for 
intelligence-related information then are sufficient? 
GATES: Yes, sir. I've•~ndicated in my testimony we 
would ask the Congress to consider I think two additional 
categories of information. I mentioned executive privilege, or 
deliberative process. Attorney-client kinds of information. 
Again, we think that there would be very little 
information that would be withheld under those circumstances, 
but without mentioning it, that recourse would be denied. 
The second is, I think it would be useful to pick up. 
on the same protection that the Congress has granted in separate 
legislation in terms of not revealing the names of covert 
employees of U.S. intelligence agencies. 
. REP. THORNTON: I appreciate those suggestions. But 
in summary the release of the CIA records in accordance with the 
general outline contained. in this resolution would not damage 
any current CIA operations; is that correct?
