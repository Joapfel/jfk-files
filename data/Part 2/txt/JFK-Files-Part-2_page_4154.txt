1. Overflights of South Vietnam O.K. 
2. Overfly that part of Norfh'Vietnam which is within 30 miles 
of South Vietnam or of the coast line .. 
3. That part of Laos which is within 3 0 miles of the South

from South Vietnam.

purpose of the flights was to survey border activity and the 30 mile shot

proposed CIA operation out of Takhli should be abandoned. This raised the 
question of whether civilian or military planes and pilots should be over 
North Vietnam to the extent which could not be explained as being "off

limited as outlined .above or should cover the· entire country. It was

no objection to SAC's overflight of North Vietnam but merely took the 
position that if they went as far north as proposed by McMillan, they 
~hould cover 'th~ entire country ,;J.. 
2. The program of infiltration and exfiltration of Cuba was approved 
with the exception of one operation -- operation #434 -- about which 
Mr~ Cheever explained tha~ ·he thought the agents we were resupplying were 
under Cuban control and the resupply operation was for the purpose of 
deception. It was agreed that the resupply should be confined to money and
