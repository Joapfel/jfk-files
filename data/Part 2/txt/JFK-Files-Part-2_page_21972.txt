In a cable on August 25, CIA )~hief of\station J:!ohn Richardso~ 
reported the result of a conference among himself, Lodge, True­
heart, General Harkins (Commander, Military Assistance Command, 
Vietnam (MACV) and General Weede (Chief of Staff, MACV). They 
accepted Deptel 243 "as a basic decision from Washington and 
would proceed to do their best to carry out instructions", (I. G., 
C; pp. 7-8) but believed that Diem would refuse to remove his 
brother from his position in the government. 
Early in the morning of August 26, 1963, the Voice of America 
in South Vietnam placed the blame on Nhu for the August 21 raids 
and absolved the army. The broadcast also reported speculation 
that the United States contemplated suspending aid to the South 
Vietnamese Government (Pentagon Papers, p. 212) .* Later on that 
same day, Lodge presented his credentials to Diem. CIA officers 
(- Cone in and ~_Per~ were told to see Generals Khiem and Khanh, 
respectively, and to convey to them the substance of Deptel 243, 
but to remind them that "we cannot be of any help during initial 
action of assuming power of state. Entirely their own action, 
win lose" (tAIG -~ 8/26/63). or 03041,

A m~ssage from the White House on August 29 authorized 
Harkins to confirm to the Vietnamese Generals that the United 
States would support a coup if it had a good chance of succeeding, 
but did not involve United States armed forces. Lodge was autho­
rized to suspend United States aid at his discretion.(Deptel 272, 
8/29/63.) A cable from the President to Lodge on the same day stated: 
* In a cable to Harriman, Lodge cor.1plained that t:ie VOA broadcast 
• had "complicated our ~lready difficult problem'' by eliminating 
•· the possibility of the generals' effort achieving· sur?r ise." 
Lodge Eurther warned that ''the US must not appear publicly in 
the 1:iatter, thus c;iving the 'kiss of <leatll' to its friends" 
(Caule, Lod~c to ,:arrirn,:rn, 8/2G/G3).
