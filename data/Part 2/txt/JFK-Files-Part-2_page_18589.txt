heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "exPenses necessary for the, 
detection and prosecution of crimes agamsf the United States" and 
more specifically for the "payment of rewards., " J 
At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth 
as part of the testimony on 11Investigative Accomplishments, " a 
paragraph detaillllg the statistics achieved by the use of confidential 
informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without 
objection to the use of money for upayment of rewards" or for the 
informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the 
appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the 
use of informants. 
• The use of :informants does not violate the defendant's 
rights under the Fourth A!!l~nrlment. Hoffa v. United States 2 385 
u. s. 293 (1966). ] •• - ·- · •• 
"Neither this Court, nor any member of it has 
ever expressed the view that the Fc~th .A . .mer1d­
ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief 
that a person to whom he voluntarily confides 
his wrongdo:ing will not reveal it. Indeed, the 
Court unanimously rejected that very contention 
--.-in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---" 
Id. at 302

The Court also held that the use of an :informer did 
not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, 
,. cit:ing United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 224, (1950), which 
said, 
"Courts have countenanced the use of informers 
from tiine immemorial; in cases of conspiracy, 
or :in other cases when the crime _con9ists of 
preparing for another crime it is usually necessary 
to rely upon them or upon accomplices because 
1 • the criminals will almost certainly proceed 
covertly." .
