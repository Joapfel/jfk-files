• • DOMESTIC TESTS FOR 
AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOP~IBNT EFFORTS 
1. ·-As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the 
research and developr::ent 9f equipr.ient and techniques 
for· Agency applic~tions in foreign intelli~ence, we 
conduct experiments and tests in the United States. 
Clearly,.the design and dcvelop~ent of our intelli­
gence .equip~cnts can be done more ecqno~ically and 
more securely in this country. Although nost of 
the tests of our R&D equipmc~ts arc perforncd in 
closed laboratories or in secure areas simulating 
the foreign environment, some of the tests and experi­
ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information. 
2. A review of the surveillance cquipraent or 
techniques which have at some time or other been 
exposed to domestic testing is as follows: 
.~. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser 
probe dcvelopca oy ORD was tested by TSD in 
San Francisco under very closely controlled 
conditions. The ORD Project Officer witnessed 
portions of the test. Recordings that ,-:ere 
made of laser probe output were carefully 
controlled as classified material and it is 
believed that the tapes have long since been 
destroyed. (Wood/TA) 
b .-- Microwave Interceot System - About 
1968, this system was :cs :ea 1n a light ~ir­
craft near the Naval Ordnance Test Station 
in Identity 127:, California. This systera is 
d~signcd to pcrrait intercept of microwave 
telephone communica~ion channels of systems 
such as Identity 130 ,, It 
works equally well against th~-Bell Telephone 
TD-2, as they are generically the same. Re­
cordings of these telephone intercepts were 
carefully controlled and were destroyed several 
years ago.
