the mere writing of this kincl rJf pr'Jp::n:ul is a reprehensible first sLcp 
toward the worst kind of foreisn policy mischief. I find it even more 
repugnant thun ccintingency plans for assassinotion. These are n':lt the 
kinds ':lf recommendaU.':lns which shciuJd filter up to the vfhite H':lu.se from 
the intelligence c".>mmunity. The agencies must have a better sense of 
what is accep 1~able policy, legally and morally. As in the Huston Plun, 
the White House was confronted here with a series of illegal and un­
ethical opLions. The reSLllt of SO,Ul,RE D/INCE would have been parasitic 
death for the major plant and animal life in Cuba. The feeble efforts 
of the CIA to direct assassinati':ln attempts against Castro pale by 
comparison with this Army proposal. for covert action. 
I believe S('.UARE DANCE dese:rvcs our attention. If assassinaticm 
is unacceptable, surely t::)o is the wides1iread destruction of plant 
and animal life thr::mgh covert germ warfare. Someh':lw (probably through 
hearings □ nd restrictive legislation) the Congress must drive home the 
point trwt theJ:e are lecal and m'."lral limits to American f0reign policy. 
These limits may not be easy t0 define, but we must try. 
l'hte: On the third p3ge 0f the second at Lachment (a "Mem0randum f0r 
Discussi0n 0f Covert Program Ai:;uinst Cuba" written by Bundy) reference 
is made to "possible adrHLion 0f contaminating elements to sensitive 
Cubon imp0rts (not f00d)." The cover memo from Gord::m Chase (NSC 
staffer) indicates that·this prop0sal received Presidential backing.
