The Honorable William V. Roth, Jr. 
Ranking Minority Member 
Committee onYGovernmental Affairs 
United States Senate 
Washington, D.C. 20510 
Dear Mr. Roth: 
I am writing to correct for the record two statements I 
made when I testified before the Committee last Tuesday on 
the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act. 
I testified that there were 33 documents, amounting to 
approximately 110 pages, in the Oswald file that was 
declassified and released to the public. A subsequent count 
by my staff revealed that the file actually contains a total 
of 34 documents, amounting to 124 pages. I gave the correct 
numbers when I testified last Friday before the Subcommittee 
on Legislation and National Security of the House Committee 
on Government Operations. 
In addition, I was asked at your hearing by 
Senator Cohen whether the State Department or the CIA had 
had any contact with any Soviet officials concerning KGB or 
GRU files relevant to the Kennedy assassination. I 
answered that there had been no contact between the CIA and 
the Russian KGB on this matter, and I added that the State 
Department might have requested those files, but I was not 
certain. At the time, I believed that that was an accura~e 
answer. I have since discovered, however, that in January 
1992 an Agency official did ask the new Russian internal 
service (MBRF) for any information related to the Kennedy 
assassination. The Russians advised us, after reviewing 
their file holdings on Oswald, that they had nothing that 
would add to our knowledge or to the 22 November 1991 ABC 
television special on this issue, which they termed 
"detailed and objective."
