intelligence by whatever means, yea, ab■olutely, 
Mr. Baron. Would it be aurpriaing to you that QJIUN mig~t. 
have been used in some manner in connection with an assassina­
tion plot against Lumwtlba and have been directed or supervised 
by William Harvey without your knowledge? 
Mr. Tweedy. It would have aurpriaed me exceedingly and 
wculd today. To put it differently, I am sure it didn't occur. 
Hr. Baron. After reading this memo, you told me a 
moment ago that you thought this might indicate that QJWIN 
was being recruited for ZRRIFLE activiti~•-
Mr. Tweedy. Well, you mentioned ZRRIFLE, which fran~ly 
I hadn 1 t heard before. This sounds as if he was going to 
have some kind of generic assignment. I merely put those 
two together but I know nothing about it at all . 
Mr. Baron. The dispatch says, •1n view of the extreme 
sensitivity of the objective for which we want him to perform 
his task, he was not told precisely what we want him. to do.ff 
Do you have any knowledge of what it was precisely that 
OJ'WlN was asked to do? 
Mr. Tweedy. 
Mr. Baron. Then, on page 3 of the dispatch it says: 
"The operation we ho.vein mind is too sensitive 
to risk blowing it in this phase and the search for assets 
must be conducted with truly" -- which is underscored --
"minimum risk".
