Occasionally ~perational interest in projects requires that· certain 
financial info1Ti1ation be obtained from the instrumentality. This 
.. •• information ordinarily consists of data: regarding the use of· funds 
·.·-··.·that·indicates that such use is, in general, consistent with the 
purpose of the proj_ect .. Although these data are of accounting 
significance, the format, arrangement, and objective of the reports 
may be in a fonn that is not susceptible ·to technical treatr.lent and. 
recording in the accounts of the Agency. In such cases the fiscal 
annex should indicate that the financial report is required for 
... operational but not accountability purposes.
