The case officer later recalled that AMLASH-1 did not "think much 
of the device,"land complained that CIA could surely "come up with 
something more sophisticated than that" (I. G., p. 93a).

The case officer recalled offering the pen 
to AMLASH-1, but could not remember whether AMLASH-1 threw it away 
then or took it with him (Case Officer 2, pp. 105, 110). He did 
recall that AMLASH-1 said he would not take the pen back to Cuba, 
but did not know what AMLASH-1 in fact did with the pen '(case Offi­
cer 2, pp. 110-111) . 
An entry in the CIA files on AMLASH dated 
March 29, 1965, states: 
"Although Fitzgerald and the case officer assured AMLASH-1 
on November 22, 1963, that CIA would give him everything 
he needed (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he 
wanted) the situation changed when the case officer and 
Fitzgerald left the meeting to discover that President 
Kennedy had been assassinated. Because of this fact, 
plans with AMLASH-1 changed and it was decided that we 
could have no part in the assassination of a government 
leader (including Castro) and would not aid AMLASH-1 in 
this attempt ... AMLASH-1 was not informed of (this de­
cision) until he was seen by the case officer in Novem­
ber, 1964."
