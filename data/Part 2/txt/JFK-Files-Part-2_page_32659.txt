October 14th. The evidence before the Subcommittee leads to the conclusion 
that such charges are unf'ounded. 
6. The news reports of an alleged conflict between the Central Intelli­

high-altitude reconnaissance flights prior to October 14th were also closely 
inquired into and found to be without merit. No evidence was presented to

based on skepticism, if nothing more, there is reason for grave concern.about 
the matter. 
8. There are literally thousands of caves and underground caverns in the 
Island of Cuba and many of these are suitable for the storage and concealment 
of strategic missiles and other offensive weapons. Refugee and exile reports 
continue to insist that they are being so utilized. Military-connected activi­
