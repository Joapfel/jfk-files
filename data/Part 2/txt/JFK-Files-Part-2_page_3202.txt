to be made if strike operations were to be conducted 
against the Castro government. In the course of his 
eight page memorandum, Hawkins reiterated the need 
for resolution of the problem that .had particularly 
bothered the Special Group that.was whether the 
Kennedy administration was interested in following 
through on the plans that had been made. Assuming 
that the Kennedy administration did intend to follow 
through on the program which had been initiated, 
Hawkins suggested that considering the rapid build 
up.of Castro's military forces the strike operations 
be conducted not later than 1 March 1961. The ques­
tion of air strikes was basic to Hawkins's planning 
-- on this he was quite firm. In discussing the 
general question of air operations Hawkins said: 
It is axiomatic in amphibious operations 
that control of air and sea in 'the objec- • 
tive area is absolutely required. The 
Cuban Air Force and naval vess.els capable 
of opposing·our landing must be knocked 
out or neutralized before our amphibious 
shipping makes its finai run in to the 
beach. If this is not done, we will be 
courting disaster. 
Then, by specific recommendations, Hawkins urged 
the following: 
1. That the air preparation commence 
not later than dawn on D minus 1 Day.
