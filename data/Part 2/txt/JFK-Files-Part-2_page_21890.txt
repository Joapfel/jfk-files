in Leopoldville (CIA Cable (rI-l 38052), Leopoldville to Director, 
11/4/60). \Chief o~ Station •• lledgman testified that he had been 
made aware by cable that(O"Donnelywas coming to the Congo 
(!-ledgman, 8/21/75, p. 40). Hedgman said it was "very possible" 
that as a new ~hief of) Station he took the dispatch to the Congo 
of a senior officer like (?'Donne11)as a signal that CIA headquarters _ 
was "dissatisfied with my handlil}g" of (Go.ttl,_i_eb;' s instructions 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 42). 
Hedgman had a general picture of.(O'Donnel~'s mission: 
I understood it to be that -- similar to 
mine, that is, the removal ·or neutrali­
zation of Lumumba ... I have no clear, 
recollection of his discussing the assassi­
nation. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 54.) 
Hedgman said that he had no recollection of(i}
1
Donnel1/ indicating 
one way or the other whether he was considering assassination as 
a means of "neutralizing" Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55). 
Hedgman said, "in view of my instructions, I may have assumed that 
he was" considering assassination (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55). Gen­
erally, however, Hedgman perceived ~'Donnel3/ as being unenthusiastic 
about his mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 56, 88-89). 
When~'Donnel~ arrived in the Congo, he met with the (chief 09 
Station, who informed him that there was "a virus in the safe" 
((p'Donnel~, 9/11/75, p. 7-A; 6/9/;.5• p. 16). (o'Donnel~ said he 
assumed it was a "lethal agent" <\O'Donnel~i, 6/9/75, p. 37), although 
Hedgman was not explicit: 
I knew it wasn't 
shot up to date.
