6/10/75 ~F:glw 
Intelligence Division strongly feels Exhibits A through E should not 
be made availableo These constitute work papers prepared on an expedite 
basis by Special Agents operating under the understanding their effort was 
of a :r-0ugh draft nature which would be utilized by .a committee of the Justice 
Department and FBI for an in-house investigation; The Agents preparing. 
the documents never conceived that their effort would be subject to review 
outside· of the D3partment and particularly outside the Executive Branch. 
By letter dated 4/21/7 5 to the Attorney General it was pointed 
out these exhibits related to the internal deliberations of the Department 
and FBI representatives, some of the material in these summaries is 
classified and relates to sensitive operations and they should not be revealed. 
Also, D3puty Attorney General L1wrence 'Silberman in testimony before the 
Civil 'Rights ~nd Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (Edwards Committee) 
on ll/20/74 indicated as regards these documents, "If we had thought it was 
approJJriate to release the full discussion we would have done so at the time. 
There are a lot of internal working documents which go into the making of a 
final .report. tr: • 
Further, il these documents are released to the ·ssc, or il the 
Committee is allowed access to them, w~ would not then be in a position to 
deny ac~e:ss to them by the Edwards Committee or the House 'Select Committee 
on InteJJ.igence (:Nedzi)o Should they be released and come within the public 
d01nain, we could then be in a posi:ion of violating individual rights of privacy 
and compromising sensitive investigative techniques and Bureau sources .. 
We feel we should fir:=:t go through these work papers and excise such items 
to a.void any such complication.
