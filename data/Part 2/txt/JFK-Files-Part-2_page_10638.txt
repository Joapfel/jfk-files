At 5:14 p. m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special 
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received 
a call from John Elltlf of the Senate Select Committee complaining of 
what he described as an attempt to interfemwith the Committee's investi­
gation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been 
furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because 
of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elltlf claimed that a journalist 
, who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had 
I 
information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been . / 
furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were .,.tf'") 
used to finance. Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, US4/·' 
and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato" . • 
and that the information also indiuateli that "King laughed all the way to the 
bank." 
0' Connor said that Elltlf protested the apparent disclosures 
by the Justice Department b9 the press and claimed that it appeared an 
effort was being made to interferewith the Comn;iittee's work. O'Connor 
told Elltlf he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing 
any such information to the pness and further, h~ told him that he did not 
believe that ~ormation con£erning CP funding qf J&_ig.g ... h~,ct ~e~,~~d 
to the Comnnttee. r.$"£-\O't SJ!C!a'l.8 ti; J - // C,.;; 'lC- ,i{ _~ 
0' Connor said that he did not believe t?'at ill'J-t~I 1 iad furnished 
such information to the news media but he wanted ~heaaw,aF&,©,f">llElltlf' s 
complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted 
by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that 
Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any docu­
mentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as yet. a)~ I
