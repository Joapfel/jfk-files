Mr .. Mann would continue to raise questions co~­
cerning the feasibility of discontinuing the training 
in Guatemala, and,in on-going meetings with Agency 
representatives including the DCI, the DDP, Chief, WH, 
as well as Chief, WH/4 and others, Mann continued to 
raise questions about the effect on Project JMATE 
should all .the American trainers and Cuban trainees. 
be pulled out of Guatemala immediately. Mann also 
questioned the exact timing fbr Project JMATE. As 
he raised such questions, the Assistant Secretary for 
Latin American Affairs was informed by CIA that they 
would much prefer that the training o·f the Cuban 
exiles take place in US bases, bQth for purpo~es of 
security and for efficiency. But they also pointed 
out that it had been the decision for the Special 
Group and the "highest levels" that such training 
should take place in third countries, rather than in 
the US. ~Mann persisted, however, suggesting that 
th~ question of maintaining the training base in 
· arid total bust, the supplies being dropped to the 
guerrillas fell into the hands of Castro's forces; 
and the aircraft itself made a forced landifl.g in 
Mexico and.was not recovered. See Volume I of this 
history, Air Operations.
