l I cannot remembBr a specific date, you know, some time at 
2 which that was discussed, and you know I never received any

Mr. Daron. Again, I am not trying to unfairly pull these 
kinds of :;conversations out of their historical context. Before 
we flesh out the historical context, do you have any recollectio 
of the mann~r in which assassination might have come up between 
yourself and Helms? 
Mr. Halley. Again, I put it in this overall context of 
10 thtS times. We ,·were •. rurinincf1:F'oreigrr ·.tn·tenigcirl6e·,collEl"C'tf6ri" • -:,:.~:

the Cuban penchant for it had to come up; I cannot pinpoint 
Mr. Daron. You do not recall any reference ·of means to

Mr. llall-ey. No. Ev~n such things as discussions of 
various kinds of weapons, you know, people, as you probably 
know from this experience, every.individual who deals with 
23 weapons has a different view on what is the ideal weapon. If 
24

you took a squad of ten men and gave them the free choic~, I 
am sure all ten of th~m would come up with a different weapon.
