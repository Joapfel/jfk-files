A CASE 
BACKGROUND 
Southern .Air Transport Incorporated (SAT) is a U.S. Air Carrier. 
incorporated in the State of Florida on October 31, 1949. From its 
inception until its purchase in 1960 by the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA). it was privately owned by Messrs. Fredrick C. Moor

gencies throughout the Far East area. Loss of the MATS contract 
would result in under utilization of aircraft and air crews and the
