Mr. diGenova. The John Mccloy exceptions to that rule, the 
are the only ones that are protected. 
Mr. Aaron. That justifies Charles' view that there are 
some similarities between Ford Foundation and.Government 
sponsored act_i vi ties. 
Mr. Bader. ·where our.discussion was left before ·1unch 
was on the question of the covert use of U.S. journalists and 
media institutions, and as it was laid out, it was indicated 
that the CIA's intended internal prohibition on the use of the 
media extended to the internal prohibitions on the use, op,ra- _ 
f 
tional use of individuals, American and foreign, who were\_.: :i: ·., 
accredited to American media organizations. 
As I heard it this morning, what we were discussing and 
moving to was to extend that prohibition to cover all American 
individuals and media organizations, and that the question then 
was ·whether this would be recommended to be something done in 
law or a recommendation, or an insistence, if. you will, to the 
Agency that it further amend its internal directives, its 
50..;.10, _to put all media personnel, American media personnel on 
the prohibited list, and that is I think where we were. 
Senator Huddleston. I think that's an accurate statement. 
That's where we were. 
I had expressed a thought that I thought that it ought to 
be expanded to include all, but we should hold off on the 
statute business for the time being.
