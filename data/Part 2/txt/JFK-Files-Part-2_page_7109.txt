A F~ench-language transmission is aimed at the 
educated class and a broadcast in Creole is beamed 
tD the masses. The spe~ker has been identified 
as Rene Dcpestre, a top-ranking Haitian Communist 
exile in Cuba. The content of Depestre's broad­
casts is consistently pro-Cuban and anti-Duvalier. 
Some Haitians may have received guerrilla train-
ing in Cuba, but we have no firm evidence that any 
such trainees have returned to Haiti, The long­
time presence of many hundreds of Haitian nationals 
in eastern Cuba provides Castro with material for 
sizable infiltrations into Haiti if he should so 
desire. ~--------· .. _________ _

13. Honduras • 
Much of the pro-Castro activity in Honduras 
appears to be directed toward support of similar 
activities in neighboring Nicaragua and Guatemala. 
The country's rugged terrain, the absence of an 
effective internal _security force, and the presence 
of long-est~blished routes for smuggling into 
neighboring countries make Honduras well suited 
for sch a role. ,

Two recen c andestine sources report the 
Cuban government is dissatisfied with efforts of 
the Honduran Communist Party to establish an ef-
> fective guerrilla movement. Cuban leaders are 
f said to favor the establishment of a new organiza­
tion with no direct ties to orthodox Communist 
groups. The Cubans are said to have selected 
' Mario Sosa to organize the new movement, and to 
begin making contacts with "liberal" leaders to 
investigate their readiness for armed action
