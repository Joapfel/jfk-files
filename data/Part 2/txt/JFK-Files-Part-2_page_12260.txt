[After designation as a Bureau-approved pate,•: :;_al security informant, the 
- following ma,tters should be ma.de clear to ], : • : ] 
[a.) His assistance is strictly voluntary a:ri • '·e is to understand that there· 
is no coercion or intimidation involved. 
[b.J He is not and cannot consider hi:nself a Bureau er:-iployee or "undercover 
Agent" of the FBI. In this regard, the seriousness of violating the 
impersonation statutes must be impressed upon him. 
[c,) His cooperation must be strictly confidential at all times and if he 
sbould feel he cannot maintain this confidence, he should so advise. 
There should be no doubt left in the mind of the informant that his 
relationship must remain on a confid.entia1 basis and if he· ~olai;es "!;he 
confidence he will be of no value and by so doing the Bure. s investiga-
ti v:e activity may be jeopardized. If he has a special pro .. • .. m which nould 
require revealing his[assistance]to his wife[or other perti:ent individual,] 
this should be[ascertained and an appropriate recommendatior,. made to the 
Bureau.] The special circumstances will be taken into consideraiion by the 
Bu:reau[and you will be advised accordingly.) 
[d.) If the potential informant is connected in any manner with a labor union, 
inform him that the Bureau is not interested in employer-employee 
relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining inform~tion 
on the infiltration of labor unions by subversive elements. 
[e,) If the potential informant is a student, teacher, or has any similar 
relations with a school, college, or university, in the initial interview 
and subsequent han4ling, be sure to follow current instructions c~n~ 
cerning investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities.

necessary and all such interviews in their residences should be co&ducted 
by two Agents after specific approval of the-superior in the field 
office responsible for developm0··. ~--of ir: ormants. This instruction :.is 
not applicable where active inv· ~~igation has established that the 
potential informant is of good 1 • ·, "acter, there is no indication of 
affiliation with subversive grou?~, and there will be no embarrassment 
to the Bureau. 
5, Except in espionage and foreign nationality matters where contact is· 
maintained on a periodic basis dependent ·on the circumstances of the 
case, poten",;ial informants should be contacted personall"y at least 
once every two weeks in the same manner· as informants. • 
6. Advise Bureau of progress being made at least every four mon·ths. Let:l:;ers 
concerning ·potentip,l informants who are n.ot being paid on Bureau 
authorization should be submitted on a TTACB basis, should contai 
informative summary of information f~~nished during past four m hs, and 
must include certifications regarding potential informant's sta~ ity 
and relaibility and his indoctrination aga~nst disclos~r~. Thes letters
