MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 11 July 1963 
PRESENT: Mr. McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Johnson, ~ 
Hr. William Bundy and Mr~ McCone • 
Colonel Steakley was present for Item 1. 
Mr. R. Jack Smith was present- for Item 2. 
Mr. FitzGerald was present for Items 2 and 3. 
Mr. Colby was present for Items 4 and 5. 
The Group approved the agreement reached last week between 
State and the JRC on the handling of certain possibly sensitive 
operations during July. Specifically, REX land 2 were approved 
with the understanding that the nearest point to the Kuriles would 
be 15 miles. instead of 14, at the northern end of the track. URBAN 
and RAY wer'e approved, in light of the fact that overt flight plans 
will be filed. 
It w,as noted that the Chiefs had already deferred operations 
YANKEE PASHA, VERNE and THOMAS at least until after completion of 
the Harriman mission. 
Of the three new missions presented by JRC, RED DOG/HAWKEYE and 
the special photographic operation in European Turkey were approved 
as presented. Mission RAINHAT-Track 2 was approved with the stipula­
tion that the nearest point to the target country will be 12 miles 
rather than 10. 
The British note concerning proposed reconnaissance of the 
· Soviet Northern Fleet (British name, Operation BARGOLD) was discussed. 
Colonel Steakley stated that the standard British restrictions o~ such 
op~rations are that no aircraft will approach closer than a qu~rter of 
a mile or will go under 500 feet, but he said_ that we have been·unable 
to determine whether the current restrictions, mentioned in the 
British note, are more stringent than this. _He told the_ Group that 
U.S. rules provide for no harassing action and for no flights below 
2000 feet (this height limit being primarily because of flight safety, 
in view of the expected presence of British aircraft at a lower level). 
The Group felt there is no objection to overflying Soviet vessels . 
under these conditions, despite the apparent British ban on this for 
their own aircraft.:]
