SUBJECT: Reconsideration of Releases in Scelso 
Testimony and Lopez Rep~o~r~t~---=-------c---~~---____,, 
Presrdent, and his testimony was taken under oath, with the · -~ 
.-----Rnowledge-of--t-he-Agency-, -and-±n-a-cl"as-srf_i_e_d-sect:ing. ~-
Furthermore, the attached letter to Louis Stokes, Chairman l 
of the Select Committee on Assassination from former Acting ! 
DCI Frank Carlucci also indicates that Scelso was acting as j 
an official of the CIA. The DCI states that any classified ,, 
testimony made by Agency staff before the Committees would \ 
be considered "authorized provision" of the information. :i 
t This was to ensure that "all persons respond fully and 
truthfully" to the Committee. Carlucci's letter, especially 
taken together with the first few pages of Scelso's 
testimony, make it clear that Scelso was speaking as an 
official of the CIA. 
7. (S) A court would, therefore, probably find that 
Scelso's statements were not just merely speculation by a 
former Agency employee, but in fact, were official 
confirmation of the political action program. Anything 
suggesting official confirmation of classified information 
would lead a judge to the conclusion that the information at 
issue had been declassified by the CIA. This would make it 
very difficult for CIA to continue to protect this 
information from unauthorized disclosure. When confusion 
arises as to the classification status of information, it 
could lead to complicated legal proceedings and protracted 
and unnecessary litigation at great expense to all parties. 
II. Liaison with Mexico 
"We did not have any source of Cuban employees. We only had 
Mexican police" ... We had a whole reporting set up there with 
that, two of them, who watched things like that. (Scelso pg. 
185) . 
8. (S) Release by the Board of Scelso's comments about 
the Mexican police in conjunction with surveillance coverage 
of the Mexico City airport could similarly have a chilling 
effect on our current liaison relationship with the Mexicans. 
The Station has worked, and continues to work, with liaison 
against compatible targets, including tracking the arrival 
and departure at the Mexico City airport of targets of 
interest. Although the targets have obviously changed since 
the time· that Scelso is speaking of, these surveillance 
operations are ongoing. The success of these current joint 
operations could be threatened by any revelation today of 
Mexican cooperation with the CIA in the past. 
9. (S) CIA objects to this release on similar grounds ) 
as stated in the p~tor section - disclosure of the Scelso \ 
comments would constitute official acknowledgment by CIA of "'.l 
the assistance provided by Mexican liaison to the Agency. • ··-1
