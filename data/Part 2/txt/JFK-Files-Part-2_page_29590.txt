Scott's manuscript may provide a clue when he writes that 
during his first contact with the Soviet Embassy, Oswald 
"gave his name very slowly and distinctly." (Foul.Foe 
Manuscript, p. 267.) If Oswald used his middle name at 
that time it would explain why Scott wrote "sic." by 
"Henry." But it should be noted that Oswald's name 
~oes not come up in any of the transcripts made available 
by the CIA until 10/1/6], and Oswald~·rniddle name is 
not given in that transcript. It is possible that 
there is one additional transcript, possibly of the con­
versation that Scott, or page 267 of his manuscript, 
refers to as Oswald's "jirst contact:which, if in exis­
tence, has not been madE available to this Committee.
