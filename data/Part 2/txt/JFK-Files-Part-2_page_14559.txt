WF'O on 8-8-58 advised that since the revolution in i~>},1J.-~yc·.-f_) 
Venezuela in January, 1958, the country has been ruled by a Junta.\':;~~ ~ 
Newspaper media since the revolution have reported periodically that 
individuals who were political exiles rluring the regime of Marcos P~ __ rez 
Jimenez have be-en allowed to return to Venezuela and .:pursue their "'··.,._ 
former political activities. "'·\ 
It has become apparent from daily news stories that 
Venezuela is presently in a state of political upheaval. Although 
the leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated ~e has no 
political aspirations it has been pointed out by correspondents that 
he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and 
"wooing" the support of the communists. This re,portedly has been 
done by statements attributed to LarrazabaJ- tha/t he'. could not conceive 
of a Venezuelan communist being controlled :by the l.lS~~ since all l'. 
Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and ldyal to Venezuela. It has '.:_·-,-·, t,•-:_:,:_i_-_:_y_-••:~·'--__ 
also been pointed out that the communists of Venezuela are being :., t 
played up as the heroes of the recent revolution in that country. r·· i~" 
Some correspondents have stated that· it is feL.t there will possibly : _ ' 
be a mi.J. itary coup if the politicians of Venezuela do not soon set up. ; 
a government acceptable to the _military leaders. It is further ;- ;t; 
noted that the Vice President and lvfrs. Nixon e.xperienced insults - f 
during their tour of Lat in America, the most vicious of which :~.:: i:~ 
occurred in Venezuela. :') V: 
r ·t i.~.'~-:.:; r,.,. 
From the above, it appears that we should t-ry to place f-:: :~ 
\ 
ourselves in a position to obtain current inte 11 igence data /: :'. 
concerning the Venezuelan political situation. It is pointed out . • , 
that there appears to be a possibility of the Venezuelan communists • 
gaining more and more influence and power in that country and, ~ 
therefore, shifting Venezuela to alignment with the Soviet Bloc. VfFO 
noted that a confidential source has reported on several occasions f ,,· r· 
a strong interest in Lat in America by the Soviet Embassy. FIFO has v}\/\ 
requested the Bureau obtain State clearance for 11/FO to initiate a J ,1. j 
program, looking toward the development of informants and sources_ •
