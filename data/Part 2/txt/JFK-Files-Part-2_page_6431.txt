as an .individual bo6m at sel~cted spots "or a·ci>iiti.iiuous boom aiui'perfor1ned 
at either high.or low altitudes. It will cause not only apprehension bU:t 
varying degrees of malicious damage as well, i.e. break all the windows 
on a street in Havana. 
4. The "sonic-boom" eHect can be maximized by planning missions 
for execution during the early morning hours when .t)ie populace is sleeping,
