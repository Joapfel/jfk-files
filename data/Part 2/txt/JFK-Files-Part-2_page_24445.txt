James O'Connell, who was the case officer for the 
operation involving underworld figures, testified that when 
he and Edwards discussed the matter in 1975, prior to giving 
evidence to the Rockefeller Commission, he was sure that 
Edwards had told him Dulles had approved the plot (O'Connell 
Tr. 5/30, pp. 58-59). He added that he was "reasonably sure" 
or "knew" in the "back of my mind'' that either Edwards or 
Bissell had also told him of Dulles' knowledge when the plot 
was underway in 1960-62 (O'Connell Tr. 5/30, pp. 33-34; 36; 
60). ·k

December °1960 showed no meeting involving Dulles, Cabell, 
Bissell and. Edwards. ;'o'- Of course, such a meeting c.ould have
