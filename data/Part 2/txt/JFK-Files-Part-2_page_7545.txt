G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of 
the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin. 
3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are 
usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle. 
With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned 
photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional 
photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality, 
are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.
