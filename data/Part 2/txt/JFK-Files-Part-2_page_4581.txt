.MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Interview with Dave Morales, GS-14, Chief of CI Section, 
Miami Base, 25 May 1961 
l. Morales, who was born in Arizona of Indian and Spanish 
parents and is bilingual in Spanish and English, former football 
player, arrived in Miami ·in October 1960 after spending two years 
.at the Havana Station. He appears to have done a unique CI Job 
in organiz:lng,within the Frente, the future intelligence service 
for the new government of Cuba that the invasion force expected 
to install. He also organized two other groups. He did this with 
the help ~an structor that was supplied by headquarters, 
and with~terials training that WH/4/CI Section, Mr. Simmons, 1 
sent down to him. 
2. The principal group were 39 selected, highly educated 
Cubans, who were trained as case officers to form the future 
intelligence service. They are known as the "AHYrS". After being 
trained they were employed by Morales in doing a series of highly 
important tasks for the good of the station. These were as 
follows:· 
a. Penetration of the local anti-Castro organizations. 
b. Penetration of the pro-Castro organization in Miami, 
the so called 26th of July organization. 
c. Preparation of biographical information on all 
prominent persons in the Frente. 
d. Carding some 200,000 Cubans in the period of three 
months. 
e. A special section of the AMOI'S monitored all radio 
transmissions coming from Cuba. This amounted to eight stations 
that were covered on a 24 hour a day basis.

f. . ScreE/1.ng of all persons recruited for the EFade 8 ·• • 3 .\ .... ~ 
(but this work first started in November 1960, and by that time 300 
or 400 men had already gone to camp). This AMCJr screening of the 
military trainees really amounted to a field check since the 
various cases were discussed with Cuban sources of information 
present in Miami. •
