During the periods 1-20 February, 12 April-7 May,. 
and 9-20 August 1971, a surveillance was conducted of 
Miss Deborah Fitzgerald, a former staff employee, and 
Orlando Toro Nunez, a Cuban national ~ith whom 
Miss Fitzgerald had become professionally and emo­
tionally involved. Surveillance was predicated upon 
information that Miss Fitzgerald had been seeking from 
employees information in Information Processing_ Division 
files, and that employees ~ere visiting a photographic 
studio operated by Miss Fitzgerald and ~unez in Fairfax 
City, Virginia. In addition to physical surveillance, 
one surreptitious entry of the photographic studio wa_s 
made, and an attempt to enter the apartment of Nunez 
was aborted because of a door lock problem. 
Pursuant to a request from the CI Staff, approved 
by the DCI, surveillances ~ere conducted of Iden 69 
and her as?,qc~a~es at various times· from May to September 
l.971 .. • Iden 69 , an acknowledged Latin .A..merican revolu­
tionary, had long been a source of the ~H Division and 
had given information regarding a plot to assassinate 
or kidnap· V·.i:c-e-P-F-e-s-iden-t--Agn.ow and the ·BE+. Surveil­
lances included coverage of the acti vi tics of Iden 69 
during two visits to the United States, technical cover­
age of debriefings of her by WH Division·representativcs 
in New York City, and surveillance, including mail cover­
age, of several American citizens alleged to be part of 
the plot. Although most of the surveillance occurred in 
New York City, surveillance of one of the individuals 
in~luded extensive coverage of a commune in Detroit.
