SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION 
The secret lu""my Organization (SAO) was clandestinely 
formed during the Fall.of 1971 in Arizona. Ma.~bership to date 
has been small and it appears to have the same basic tcr.~ts as. 
the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO 
were formerly active in the 11inutemen. The mail drop for 
this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in 
Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and 
white-hate activities in the past. 
This ultraconservative paramilitary organization 
was recently involved in extremist activities in San Diego, 
California. Members of this group r2portedly made threatening 
telephone calls to a local college professor who is active 
in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the 
forthcoming Republican National Convention. Following these 
telephone calls, a ~.ember of SAO fired shots from an auto­
mobile into the professor's home, wounding a_guest.
