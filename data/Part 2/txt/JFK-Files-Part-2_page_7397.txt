system outlined in the attached agenda, and that we would 
reconsider procedures later if they seemed clearly to be 
unwieldy. W~·antieipated, however. that once the team 
splits into smaller groups as is planned, and pursues 
particular areas of inquiry, it will be possible to evolve 
a workable system whlch meets:the objectives of both parties. 
7. Other: Th~re appears to be no difficulty in 
protecting 1d~ntiti~s of sources, providing documents in 
sanitized form~·maintaining notes only in this building and 
at the appropriate security level and introducing some 
officers under cover in alias where necessary; all these 
points were noted and none was objected to. Space and 
other f~cilities may be cramped but it appears to he possible 
to provide adequate space adjacent to the SA/D0/0 offices. 
Mr. Anderson began by noting the outstanding cooneration on 
the Angola and COMINT surveys done in the building (in which 
relatively free access to personnel and files had been 
afforded his team), and ended by stating that the corning 
survey was not a witch hunt nor an investigation of abuses 
and that therefore he believed that such acces~ could have 
very beneficial results for the Agency. It was agreed to 
begin the survey formally with a briefing by the DDO or 
ADDO on 3 or 4 August 1976. Mr. Walters with several team 
members will, however, set up shop on 2 August to review 
such general briefing papers as Mr, Fendig can make 
available to them at that time.
