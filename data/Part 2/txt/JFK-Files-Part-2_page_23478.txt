MEMORANDUM·FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 30 November 1960 
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant and Mann; Douglas; Gray; 
Dulles and Bissell 
Cuba 
Mr. Gray solicited the Group's assistance in arriving at a 
consensus of views as to what exactly had been decided as a result 
of the high-level meeting of the day before. The following points were 
agreed: 
a. Mr. Gray's associates stand _ready to deny U.S. 
activity based in Guatemala,· even though it may becom<: 
blown {Mr. Douglas urged that every effort be made to· 
make it possible to deny plausibly). 
b. If the program is enlarged, additional facilities 
may be obtained, but at this stage not in the U.S. No 
training of Cubans· will be conducted in the U.S. under 
present circumstances. (Mr.· Bissell told the Group of 
the possibility of an additional finca in Guatemala.)
