Mr.· Miller. What kind of volume did you put together in

interrogation yielded 20 file cabinets, and was wondering the 
total volume. 
Mr. Miler. ~hat were the figures on the cases to read? 
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think I've already presented that 
once, but when we were dealing with the new management and it
