4-.- Disputed Tracts on Rio Grande 
(; 
There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over 
which sovereignty ~sin dispute. We desire to have the 
International Boundary and Water Commission study these 
problems and recommend a solution. 
5. C.ontroi of Narcotics 
• Mexico and the United States are cooperating in 
controlling the importation of narcotics and dangerous 
drugs into the United States. We should strengthen this 
cooperation in the mutual interest of both countries. We 
hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings 
.of the highest law enforcement officers of the two countries. 
6. Desalinization .Plant at Tijuana 
An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is 
the most economical way to supply water to Tijuana. We 
are prepared to go ahead with a feasibility study if 
Mexico desire and will share the cost. 
MAJOR .. POINTS LOPEZ MATEOS . IS EXPECTED . T.O RAISE 
1. Salinity Problem on Lower Colorado· 
The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of 
President Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent and 
effective solution ~t the earliest possible time" of the 
salinity problem. We can agree but _should avoid.anv.commit­
ment on.timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem 
of the groundwater recovery program at Yuma, we agree that 
the Boundary Commission should study the problem. Farmers 
in the lower Rio Grande Valley are seriously c~ncerned 
about saline drainage discharged to the river by Mexico artd 
want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early soltition,to 
this problem.
