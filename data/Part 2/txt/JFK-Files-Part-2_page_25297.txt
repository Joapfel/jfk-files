considerable time went by before Attorney General., Levi could 
address the issue of whether or not to entrust this matter to 
the Bureau. Approximately one week ago, Justice went to Jim 
Adams of the FBI with the request to look into the allega.tion 
and was surprised to find that Adams was already apprised of 
the situation and investigating, i.e., general indexes. 
Apparently, Adams had been in receipt of similar infotmation 
• in recent days. 
Yesterday, in response to the Attorney General's request 
for information, Paul Daly hand carried to Callahan the Bureau's 
response (which is dated January 14) and today Callahan hand 
carried the package to us over Assistant Attorney General 
Uhlmann;s signature. Callahan advised that Daly was upset that 
the Committee had been_ so promptly advised for fear that we 
would interupt the Bureau's inquiry. Callahan apologized.for 
the lack of responsiveness on the part of Justic~ and the Bureau· 
but things are in disarray with Levi about to depart. I assured 
Callahan we did not desire to interfere in the investigation 
l but desired to be promptly informed of any developments and 
that we would stay in touch with Paul Daly in that regard 
Callahan promised to expedite any Committee requests as 
made.
