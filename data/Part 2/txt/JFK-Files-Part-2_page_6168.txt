There is considerable irony in the CXA's position, both then and now. Much 
of the speculation about the murder of President Kennedy has centered on the 
.role of that agency. n207 The only way to sustain its innocence in this matt.t,~ 
may well be to fully disclose the evidence, including selected so~ccz:s and r '' 
cnet:hods, chat will reveal· conclusively that neither it nor some foreign power 
was behind the murder.

Conclusion 
The American public should not rely on t:he JFK Board to settle the question of 
what: happened in Dallas and why. That: .is not .the (*37] Board's mandate. n208 
The Board is not charged with answering the question of who m~dered President 
Kennedy. It is not running an investisation; it is, instead, seeking to disclose 
documents in an age of open secrete, an age in which we have come to ernprace the 
idea that openness is to be preferred and that accountability is the touchstone 
for public confidence in government. n209
