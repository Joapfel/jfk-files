to hims~lf as Oswaid. He pulls the tap~ 
and marks it "urgent" and notifies 
Goodpasture that they have an ID on 
an American. The tape is delivered to 
Tarasoff for im.~ediate transcription. 
It is recieved late this day or early on 
the second by Goodpasture. Disposition 
of tape unknown, could "urgent" tapes 
have been routinely retained for long~r 
period? Goodpasture now has ID but does 
not know for sure that it is the one that 
Scott has asked about. The guy in the 
9/27 conversation sounds real interesting 
but there is nothing in this conversation., c~ 
that clearly connects. She discusses -~ 
reporting it with Manell. There is some 
disagreement over whose responsiblity it 
is to report. Either dec~sion is made, or 
conflict continues until photos is check~d. 
Photos from 10/1, 10/2; 10/3, 10/4 (?) 
are recieved in base from Soviet Embassy. 
B. Manell drafts report cable. Goodpasture 
adds paragraph 2.
