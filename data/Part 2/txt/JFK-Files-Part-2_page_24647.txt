This series of cables sent during, and after 
,. -
Goctlieb I s visit to the. Congo demonstrated a clear intent at CIA 
headquarte_rs to authorize and suppqrt rapi,d progress on the assassi­
nation mission. The cables also show an intent to severely re­
strict knowledge of the assassination operation am.on:g officers in 
CIA's Africa Division and among United States personnel in the· 
Congo, including·those who were aware of and involved iri other 
covert activities. 
(e) The Chief of Station Moves Forwar_d With Assassination 
Plot 
The testimony of the Chief of Station,· taken fifteen 
years after the events in question ~ndwithout benefit of review 
of the cables discussed above, was compatible with the picture 
derived from the cables of a fullya-µthorized and tightly restricted 
assassination operation. Hedgman's.testimony is at variance from 
~ 
the cables only with respect to the lack of vigor_with which he 
claims to have pursued the assignment- ~1hich he dealt with in an 
affirmative, aggressive manner in the cables. 
(i) The Chief of Station Testified That He Requested 
and Received Confirmation of the Assassination 
~Ian from Headquarters • • 
Hedgman testified that, after recei~ing Gottlieb's 
instructions, he cabled CIA headquarters seeking confirmation that 
he was to carry out Gottlieb's instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 36). Hedgman did hot recall whether he identified Gottlieb by 
name, and he doubted that he "would have" mentioned the President 
in such a cable (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 36, 43).
