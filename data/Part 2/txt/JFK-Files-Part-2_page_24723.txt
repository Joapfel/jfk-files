I'have "examined the memorandum (which I prepared) 
summarizing the discussion of the Congo at the 
September 21, 1960 meeting of the NSC. I recall the 
discussion and believe it is accurately and adequately 
summarized in the memorandum. I have no recollection 
of any discussion of a possible assassination of Lumumba 
at this m~eting. Wiih specific reference to the st~te-
ment of the Director of-Central Intelligence·. . I 
believe this is almost a literal rendering of what. Mr. 
Dulles said. My own interpretation of this statement 
was that Mr. Dulles was speaking in the context of 
efforts be~ng made within the Congolese government to 
force Lumumba from power. I did not interpret it as 
referring to assassination 1'._. (Boggs affidavit 10/10/75, 
pp.· 2-3.) 
Boggs was not, however, in a position to analyze Dulles' 
remark in light of the· actual planning-for covert operations 
that took place during this period because Boggs was not privy 
to most such discussions (Boggs affidavit, 10/10/75, p. 2). 
C. Douglas Dillon, who attended .this NSC meeting as. 
Acting Secretary of State, said that he did not recall ~he dis­
cussiop (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 47). Dillon said that the minutes 
"could mean that" assassination would have been·one acceptable 
means. of "disposing of'' Lumumba, although he felt that "getting 
him out [of the Congo] or locking him up" would have been a 
preferable disposition.of Lumumba at that point since he was 
·k NSC Executive Secretary James Lay, who was also present 
at the meeting of-September 21, 1960, stated: "I cannot recall 
whether there was any discussion of assassinating Lumumba at 
any NSC meetings.
