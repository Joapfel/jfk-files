ever, I was not advised that weekend days would be counted in the 
calculation of the leave period. 
He further advised that since the House payroll system is 
based on a 30-day month, for purposes of calculating a termination 
date he counted weekend days, whereas a vacationing employee who 
would be returning to work after vacation would not have weekend 
days counted. (I checked with the Committee on House Administra­
tion and learned that though each Committee establishes its own 
leave policy, it is unusual to penalize a terminating employee 
by counting in weekend days.) 
Inasmuch as there was no written leave policy I had no way 
of anticipating his method of calculating leave. And because of 
the punitive ~ature of the decision I have suffered a break in 
service which may affect seriously my transfer of benefits from 
the House of Representatives to my new employment. Had I been 
aware of his method of calculating leave, my dates of departure 
from the Committee, obviously, would have been different. . . 
I hope that you will review the calculation of my date of 
departure and act swiftly to rectify the situation to allow my 
termination date from the Committee to be set at Friday, May 20, 
1977, which would reflect 5 working days leave from the Committee. 
I have already acted to begin employment at the Department 
of the Treasury as of May, 23. • I gladly forfeit the 6th vacation 
day which would have been May 23. 
Thank you in advance for your kind attention to this matter 
and I 1 ook forward to hearing from you soon.
