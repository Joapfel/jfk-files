upon our government,~, the use of underworld figures involves 
tae following dangers: 
a, The use .of underworld figures for "dirty business" 
gives them the power to blackmail the government and to avoid 
prosecution, for past or future crimes. For example, the 
figures involved in the Castro assassination operation used 
their involvement with. the CIA to avoid.prosecution. The CIA 
also contemplated attempting to quash criminal charges against 
QJWIN in a foreign tribunal. 
b. The use of persons experienced in criminal tech­
niques and prone to crimin~l behavior increases the likelihood 
that criminal acts will occur. Agents in the field are neces- --··• 
sarily given broad discretion. But the risk of improper 
activities is increased when persons of criminal background 
are used, particularly when they are selected precisely to take 
advantage of their criminal skills or contacts. 
1'The corrosive effect of dealing with underworld figures is 
graphically demonstrated by the. fact that Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy, who had devoted much of his professional life to fight­
ing organized crime, did not issue an order against cooperating 
with such persons when he learned in May 1961 that the CIA had 
made use of Sam Giancana in a sensitive operation in Cuba. 
In May 1962, when the Attorney General learned that the 
operation had involved assassination, he did, according to 
a CIA witness, inform those briefing him that underworld 
figures should not be used before checking with him first, 
but failed to direct that they must never be so used.
