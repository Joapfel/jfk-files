Alsc I was asked to look at the photographs of Howard Hun~ 
and Sturgis that appeared in N~wsweek some years ago. We 
obtained this photograph from the FBI ~st night about 5 otclock. 
We had not had it before. We had a copy of the Newsweek 
edition. 
These are photographs of Howard Hunt in 1919, 1950 and 
1961. This is the only photograph ws have of Mr. Sturgis. 
It is taken out of the Newsweek.
