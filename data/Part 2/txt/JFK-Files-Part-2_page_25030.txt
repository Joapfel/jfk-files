Mr. Baron. And this document refers to the election of 
Joseph Ilea to the Presidency of the Senate of the Congo, and 
recounts a report by General Cabell that the US assisted Ileo

the relationship between the US and Joseph Ilea? 
Mr. Dillon. No. 
Mr. Baron. Generally speaking, would you have been
