.Ms. Goodpasture atterrpted to explain this mis~ake . 
. Q: Looking at the log, can you now ex~ 
plain to the Committee why the cable 
referred to a photo~raph taken on 
O~tober 1st when actually it was taken 
on another day? • 
A:· If you look at the log ·here you see at 
the top--it was jLst an oversight on 
the part of th~ pE.rson who was· writing 
that cable. It leaks as though the date 
is 1 October, but if you read it very. 
closely you see ttere are only two frame~ 
.that were shot on 1 October and 2 Octo­
ber, it starts up with fram number 3, 
et cetera, et cetE·ra, and there the shots 
. occur.•, That is tt e only explanation 
I can. give. 
- Q: Is your explanati< 1 n that whomever refer­
red to the log sir1ply looked at the date 
at the top of the page, the date being 
October 1st, and did not see any ·reference 
to the .date Octob1ir 2nd? 
A: Right. 557/ 
This Committee finds it implausible that Ann Good­
pasture, who had 1the specif ,c duty of "processing for 
operational leads al 1. Stati,in photosurveil lance info per­
taining to the Soviet targe :" since 19'60 and had. received 
. a· rating of ou_ts_tanding on 1er annual fitness reports.
