1 • THAT THE Metro team is even· 
Involved is happenstance. RQ.Sselli 
lived in Plantation, Broward Coun- •, 
ty, with his sister and brother-in- " 
law. It's just that his killers chose. 
to dump his body in Dade. 
• While . several detectives say 
their instincts leaa them to con­
clude that the Rosselli murder was 
an internal underworld affair, all. 
·on the team are aware of the pres-. 
sure on them to search each clue 
that leads back to the CIA-Castro. 
affair. . . 
. With· Rosselli's 'death this sum­
mer, the newly appointed Senate 
committee saw its list of knowl­
edgeabie witnesses further trim­
med. Some of those witnesses have 
died violently and some from natu-
• ral causes. • • 
• ,· When Giancana was murdered in 
i~ne of 1975, before he could even 
be questioned by the committee 
staff, authorities attributed it to an 
internal gangland struggle ~ even 
though. the murderer is still un.• 
known. _ 
• The death of Rosselli, who had · 
appeared before the committee 
three times in the past year with• 
• out immunity, caused greater con~ 
cern on Capitol Hill. 
THE SAME night Rosselli's body 
was identified - the legs hacked 
off and stuffed along with the body 
into an oil drum - Baker, vice 
chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
• • Committee, called for the FBI to 
·get involved in the case. (Several 
days later, Attorney Gene_ral E 
ward Levi ordered FBI mvolv 
ment.) • 
It wasn't until several w 
later. however, . that what was 
known to Baker. became public 
knowledge. • 
•• A section of the former commit• 
.tee's April report told of a Wash• 
ington attorney who in 1967, went. 
to Supreme Court Chief Justice~, 
Earl Warren (chairman, of th·e•' 
then-disbanded Warren, Com 
sion) to say that two'..of his-cli 
believed • they knew a 
agents in the United States w _ 1 ::... 
. conspired in the ~ssassination• of : . · 
, . ..'oh'1 F. Kennedy,. · • • .. ; 
•• THE 1NFORMAT!ON, eventually' 
• reached the FBI, but as the Senate 
committee concluded this year, the . 
1967 FBI probe was slipshod and 
incomplete. • • . . : 
One of the cl!ents refer.red t_o_ m,1' 
the report has smce been 1dent1f1ed.,, 
' as Rosselli. And it has since been , 
• learned that Rosselli was con-
. vinced he held a vital clue to the 
JFK murder.

"There was never the slightest. 
doubt in John's mind that Castro 
was responsible for the assassina~• 
tion of Kennedy," said Edward P. 
Morgan·, the attorney referred to in 
the report. 
Morgan is an attorney of no 
mean stature in Washington. He 
~, served as chief counsel to the joint 
congressional • committee · which 
studied the Pearl Harbor attack. 
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela.;. 
tions Committee and for seven 
years was chief inspector of the 
FBI. 
ROSSELLI. told Morgan about 
the CIA plot in: 1967, when the De­
partment of Justice was vigorously 
attempting to deport Rosselli for 
being an illegal alien. • 
Rosselli, Morgan said, "was cer- : 
: tain that the people he (Rossellil. 
put around Castro in the CIA plot 
turned right around and killed Ken- . 
nedy. The people he still knew (ill 
.1967) did it."' 
Rosselli, according to Morgan,'. 
decided to talk about his CIA activ.:-, 
. ity in hopes of decreasing the pres- , 
sure from the FBI and Department . · 
of Naturalization and Immigration,. -
both Justice Department agencies. . 
• • Several. friends of Rosselli, in- : 
' eluding Morgan, say they are con- . 
·vin,ced the FBI tried to get Rosselli 
to become·· an organized crime in­
formant by threatening to have,· 
him deported if he ·didn't coopera-; te. , · ' 
1N • 1961, through a bungled 
~}wiretap-:". effort:-the -FBf" became-; 
' aware of Rosselli's CIA activitfes. • '; 
· While • Giancana • and ·Rosselli, 
were in Florida planning the opera­
tion, Giancana wanted to return to 
Las Vegas to check on· his girl 
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he 
suspected, of dating comedian Dan 
Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori­
da, it was agreed that a bug would 
be placed in her hotel room and her. 
conversations monitored. 
But the private detective they·. 
hired, with CIA money. it has since i 
been· learned, was discovered and 
arrested. Eventually the police in- . 
vestigation l.ed back to the Castro ! 
plotters. 
. Prosecution was avoided when • 
• .. the • CIA intervened and said the : 
• "national interest" would be ·dam­
aged if the .plot information be-
:· came public. · • • 
WHEN THE wiretap case was 
again to be Investigated in 1966, 
this time by a Senate· committee 
headed by the late Sen. Edward 
Long (D., Mo.), the CIA again step­
ped in to stop it. 
Morgan was told about the pend• 
ing investigation by Rosselli and 
Robert Mahue, a former FBr 
• agent-turned Howard Hughes aide 
who was the CIA's. initial link to, 
Rosselli. • • 
Mahue told Morgan that· both he• 
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to; 
appear before the committee. Mor•)• 
gan said he called Lawrence Hous:.\: 
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous-:': 
ton went to Long and the investi~~ 
. gation was dropped. • :y'f 
·,· 
MORGAN SAID he knew, as the:; 
·senate committee recently empha-~ 
, sized as well; that all i,nformation i 
. about the CIA plots - which couldi 
have been the incentive for pro•< 
Castro forces to kill Kennedy -, 
had been kept .from the Warren· 
• Commission.· ' 
"I was an admirer of Earl War-. 
ren," Morgan said. "(His) report'. 
said that . . . Oswald alone killed? 
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after. • 
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli,· 
that the Chief Justice could put his 
• name on a report which didn't as­
sess the most· significant piece of· 
evidence bearing on the killing· of· 
Kennedy." · • . , 
The information Morgan had 
was passed to Warren via .. coJum:. 
nist Drew Pearson. a mutuar 
friend. Eventually, it reached the• 
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di•' 
rect orders from President Lyndon 
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in•·. 
vestigation was not vigorously pur--' sued. • - • • 
THE SENATE Intelligence Com-, 
. mittee compared that apparent. in- : 
action with a statement former FBI. 
director J. Edgar Hoover made to 
the Warren Commission on•May 5,., 
1964. Hoover said, "well, I can as-•' 
sure. you so far as the FBI is con-.: 
cerned. the case will be continued; 
.in an open classification for alF 
i. time. That is, any information com-:;. 
, ing to us or any report coming to, 
i us from any source will' be thor-·'. 
: oughly investigated, so that ,we, 
twnr be 'ableTo· prove or~ d{Spiov~ 
hthe allegation." • ·~ 
A Senate Committee staff mem..,, 
ber commented recently, "what is: 
• really happening is that the investi­
gation which the FBI should, have 
done in 1967 - and no one can 
come close to explaining why it 
wasn't - is actually· being done 
now." • ,· 
HART, AS have local investiga­
tors, has established three possible 
scenario't: for Rosselli's death: his 
recent organized crime activity, re­
taliation for his Castro assassina­
tion efforts or the information he 
held concerning the JFK assassina­
tion.
