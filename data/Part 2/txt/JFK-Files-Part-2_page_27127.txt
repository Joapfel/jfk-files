the counterintelligence function and conferred upon it the 
necessary measure of authority, autonomy and the essential 
secrecy required for the conduct of this activity. To better 
understand the need for reform, it is believed that a short 
historical presentation is essential. What is here submitted 
is based on voluminous files and documentation which record 
the shaky progress of counterintelligence as practiced by 
the_U.S. Government following World War II until the present. 
After October-1945 the concept of counterintelligence as 
a separate and equal function withered away. On 17 October 
of that year Brigadier General John A. Magruder, then the 
director of the Strategic Services Unit (a short-lived 
inheritor of O.S.S.), stated in a memorandum to 
Mr. John J. McCloy that the valuable O.S.S. liaison relation­
ships abroad were deteriorating because foreign services were 
uncertain as to whether the United States would have a central 
intelligence service. General Magruder was an honorable and 
conscientious custodian of O.S.S. 
Although CIA was established in 1947, and although the 
first version of NSCID/5, promulgated in December 1947, 
charged the Director of Central Intelligence with the conduct 
of all organized federal counterespionage operations overseas, 
the new Agency did not have a central counterintelligence 
unit of mechanism through which it could meet its counter­
intelligence responsibilities.
