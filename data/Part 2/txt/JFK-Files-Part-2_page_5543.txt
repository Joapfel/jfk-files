the letter Nosenko wrote in 1994 objecting to the release of his material without his being consulted 
or advised, and the letter Ted Price wrote to him in response assuring him that everything possible 
would be done to prevent further release of his papers. I don 't see any problem with this since the 
papers would support our position--unless the ARRB starts thinking about releasing the letters also. 
~aid she told Combs CIC would have{8Qb Pring!?; former Chief of AG/FIOB currently 
serving as Officer in Residence at the University of Kentucky, flown in to address the ARRB if this 
appears necessary. Combs will pass this on to the ARRB. @__ukitc_h:Y,oted that Combs alluded to
