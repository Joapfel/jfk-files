"any further action on the subject would henceforth be the responsibility 
of the CIA and that DIA would perform normal support functions." (Roth, 
p. 8) * 
Both Bennett and Philpott testified that the activities described 
·-by Roth were routine .DIA activities. However, Colonel Roth testified: 
* 
I believe my impression at the time, or my recollection, is 
that I was informed that there was concern at the highest 
U.S. Governmental level over the possible election of Allende, 
that DIA then had a priority responsibility of coming up with 
the identities of key Chilean personalities that would be help­
ful, and so forth. I have nothing specific as to the nature of 
the instructions or the channels through which they came. 
Q. It was your sense at the time that you were working on a 
project that if it had not been initiated by, at least had 
the attention of or concern of, the highest level? 
Roth's chronology also indicates that Philpott had asked thaS Broe 
be queried on two or three occasions regarding a report froml:'limerc) 
and that Philpott instructed that only he (Philpott) would communi­
cate with Cushman if the need arose. (Roth, p. 11) Roth also testi­
fied that Philpott advised him that communications withfWimert\would 
be by CIA channels. (Roth, p. 41) L- ~
