4. The two papers from me Coordinator of Cuban Affairs 
on sabotage operations and additional covert programs were 
returned for consideration by the Cuban Affairs Committee. It 
was noted that the Cottrell Committee had not acted on these papers. 
The procedure adopted was for Cottrell Committee action and 
recommendations in much the same way that we now get Ambassador 
endorsement of covert activities elsewhere. There was a general 
concensus that actions against Cuba shipping would not be final 
although it would be an irritant, since plan called for damaging and 
making ships inoperative rather than destroying them. Several 
details of the additional Covert Action Program were discussed. 
The paper is to be revised and reviewed by the Cottrell Group.

7. [§ was reported that SAC seriously questioned CIA's con-
clusion that the SA- 3 sites in Russia are low-level intercept 
ground-to-air missile sites. Apparently SAC has prepared a report 
on this. Gilpatric noted the March 18th CIA memorandum reaffirming 
our conclusions. 
JAM/ji 
Action: DD/I must pursue this matter and explore with 
SAC their reasons for questioning our conclusions. This 
is the second time in weeks that these conclusions have been 
questioned. Ad vise me..:J
