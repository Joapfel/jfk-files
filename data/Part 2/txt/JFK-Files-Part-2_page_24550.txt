1962 assassination activity may have come from the period when Allen Dulles 
was DCI. As Harvey stated: 
"But I had every right to believe organizationally, 
humanly, whatever way you want to put it, that nothing 
that was being told to me by Bissell had not in fact 
come to him from LA11en Dulleff. 
But Harvey made clear that this did not imply that McCone knew of or au-
thorized the assassination activity: 
"The Chainnan: 'That doesn't necessarily mean that be­
cause the previous director had knowledge that Mr. McCone 
had knowledge. It is not like a t:ovenant that runs in 
the land. '" 
"Mr. Harvey; 'No, of course not, and they don't always 
brief their successors.'·" (Harvey, 6/25, p. 85.)
