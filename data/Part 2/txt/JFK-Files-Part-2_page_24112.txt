I. INTRODUCTION AND PHILOSOPHY OF USE 
Questions have arisen as to CIA's use of proprietary mechanisms 
to help carry out the Agency's missions. In particular, concerns 
have been expressed about the Agency's financial and management control 
over these entities and about the treatment of funds related to such 
entities. A careful review of these entities has revealed that CIA's 
proprietaries are appropriately limited and controlled with careful 
consideration given to their use within the spirit and letter of the 
law. 
Proprietaries fall into· two main categories: 
1. Operating companies that actually do business as 
would any private firm; and 
2. Non-operating companies or entities that appear to 
do business under commercial guise. 
These entities may be legally constituted as corporations, partner­
ships, or sole proprietorships; or they may have no such legal standing, 
i. e·. , they may be "notional" entities which have bank accounts and 
backstopped addresses controlled by the Agency. Corporate proprietaries 
are incorporated in accordance with the statutory provisions of the 
jurisdiction of incorporation, are subject to the same review as-any 
corporate entity within that jurisdiction, file applicable state and/or 
federal tax returns, and obtain the necessary licenses to conduct their 
normal business. The purposes served by them are two-fold: they provide 
cover, attribution for_funding, and administrative assistance to agents·
