defenses being built up by the Cubans as evidenced by the arrival of 
new PT boats and advised the Group that we must plan contingent 
methods for evading such coastal defenses. Also McCone stated 
that he had asked for a review of all reports for the last 90 days 
because of his continuing concern over the large number of 
unexplained reports we are getting on Cuba which indicates some 
ominous situation might be developing.
