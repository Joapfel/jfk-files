Mr. Goldsmith. Yes. 
_ Mr. Tovar. Most individuals don't maintain .personal. files!, .

I don't think. I would sat, for example, anything I write, 
I dictate a_memorandum and I send it to anybody you want to 
name, in a sense that is mr work, I have done it but I don't 
keep a personal file on th1t. That goes into my office file . 
It is part of the office c.1ronological file which is maintaineJ 
I 
by my secretary. Let us s1y multiply that by-,500,000 over, a 
period ·of years the foles ·;row. At the time I leave I am 
incidental in a sense. I just happen to be the person in the 
job at the time. The file:; will still be there.

Mr. Goldsmith. Most paperwork would go· in this office 
chrono file?·

office chrono file. Anyth:.ng I write to the Directorate of 
Operations, DDO, CI, it is normally part of the chrono files.

I If I want it, it is ·there. It is my own file in the sense thatl 
when I am on the job I havH total access to-it. If I left 
the job and wanted to look at it.·six months later, it is still 
in the fole and I would asL somebody who took my place could I
