Select Committee on Assassinations 
Dear Al: 
I herewith submit my resignation from the Select 
Committee effective May 15, 1977. 
I have not lost my convictions about this investigation 
which brought me here to work last December. However, 
personal and financial obligations have made it necessary 
for me to obtain more secure employment. 
I wish the Committee all success in the future and 
I sincerely hope that it is never agairi plagued with the 
problems it has previously faced. 
ly, 
ise L. McCray
