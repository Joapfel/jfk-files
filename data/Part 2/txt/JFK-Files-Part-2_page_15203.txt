. State Department clearance for the Bureau -to institute 
a program to develop sources and informants within all Indonesian 
diplomatic establishments·· in the United States· was granted 7-19-600 
State Department advised that the successful penetrati6ri of• • 
Indonesian diplomatic establishments in the United States would be 
of real interest to it. • 
. Therefore, Bureau authority is hereby granted the 
• • Washington Field and New York Offices ·to conduct an up-to-date 
·--survey regarding the identities of individuals connected with 
·_·Indonesian diplomatic establishments in your respective territories· 
>. who can be utilized regarding captioned matter: and, thereafter • 
~submit recommendations as to the individuals to be investigated 
in separate 134 cases with a request for Bureau authority for _ 
such investigation in each individual case. Bureau authority is 
not granted at this time for investigations of those individuals 
mentioned in relets until such time that an up-to-date office 
index check is.made, local police and credit records are checked 
and a check made with established sources. Attempts should also 
be made to secure the individual's date and place of birth which, 
of course, will assist the Bureau in checking its indices regarding 
the individual you propose to investigate. Upon receipt of this 
information, the Bureau will then be in a better position to 
determine whether or not an investigation should be conducted.· 
WFO and New York should bear in mind that we should 
select only those persons for development as confidential sources 
and subsequent interview whom we can anticipate from our investiga­
tions will be responsive to our request for assistance. Such per.son~ 
should be considered for intervi.ews to present a minimum of ris·k in 
regard to their divulging to their employers any contacts by the 
FBI as such disclosure could result in serious repercussl'ons between 
the Governments of Indonesia and t'he United Stateso
