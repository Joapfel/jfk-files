MR. HOLLAND: Well, the Zapruder film, as the chairman is aware, the review board 
designated that as an assassination record about a month or so ago. We felt 
that that decision was determined by the Congress in the passage of the JFK 
Records Collection Act when it said that all records in the possession of the 
National Archives are assassination records and should be included in this 
collection. 
Recognizing the potential cost of a film like this, we did set forth a 16-month 
period before the taking would take place, so that the Congress could address 
this issue and make appropriate determinations that the Congress wished to make 
those determinations. The board did feel that that decision had been made for it 
by the Congress in the earlier act and that it is the most significant piece of 
evidence of one of the most significant crimes in our nation's history. So, 
therefore, the original has an intrinsic value, and it should belong forever to 
the American public.
