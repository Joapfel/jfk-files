--Assistant Attorney General ior faternal Security, Robert lvi:"ci:r-dian

representative, I had attended various inter-agency meetings pre­
sided over qy Mardian. r" expressed the view to Director Helms 
that Mardian would require vC'ry careful handling due to his inex­
perience. Furthermore, Mardian v.:as deeply involved in the_ split 
between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis 
one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullh·an was secretly 
passing fil.cs to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permission. This 
was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from 
the Bureau.
