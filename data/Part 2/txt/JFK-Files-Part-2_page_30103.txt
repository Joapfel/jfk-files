Mr. G. Robert Blakey July 14, 1978 
The two latent fingerprints, which are 
present on one lift. on the card bearing the notation 
"B - from inside outer edge of safe door," and the 
inked fingerprints appearing in the two photographs 
designated Band C in the Latent Fingerprint 
Section were made by one and the same individual. 
The remaining latent fingerprint is not 
identical with the inked fingerprints appearing in 
the five submitted photographs. 
The specimens are being retained in the 
Latent Fingerprint Section until called for by a 
representative of your office.
