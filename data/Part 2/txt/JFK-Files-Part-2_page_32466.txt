~anama is relatively quiet. Although Panama has failed to 
receive any commitment for a long-sought ~enegotiation of the 
Canal Zone treaty, continuing talks on areas of disagreement and 
some con~essions hav~ eased tensions and softened violent anti-US 
propaganda.· Public emotion may again be aroused, however, bi the 
recent petition, fil~d by a Communist lawyer, requesting the Supreme 
Court to declare the treaty unconstitutional. President Chiari 
has also indicated he expects to press for increased compensation 
during the forthcoming talks. On the internal scene, President 
Chiari has failed to provide a strong administration. Corruption 
continues; the cabinet is divided by conflicting loyalties and 
ambitions; badly needed reforms have not yet been adopted; and 
the chronically depressed economy remains stagnant. 
The stability which has marked the 30-year dominance of 
Mexico's Party of Revolutionary Institutions (PHI) is gradually 
being eroded. Extreme right and left factions of the PRI are 
- vying for domination. In attempting to placate both, President 
Lopez Mateos has adopted inconsistent and vacillating policies, 
pleasing neither group. Forces outside the PHI also pose an 
increasing threat -- particularly the r£cently formed Independent 
Peasant Central (CCI) with which l~ftist ex-President Cardenas is 
associated. The CCI, organized to exploit unrest among the land~ 
less peasants, may·also attempt to challenge the PHI politically. 
To undercut the CCI, the government plans to complete the land 
distribution program by the end of Lopez Mateos' term late next 
year. Although this may alleviate discontent in the agrarian 
sector, rising population and mounting unemployment will continue 
to be major problems .
