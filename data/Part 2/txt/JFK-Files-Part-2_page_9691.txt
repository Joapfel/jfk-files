the Bill of Rights, an·d eliminated or revised all the amend­
ments to the Constitution. We have formed a national caucus

present identity will remain anonymous, who at the time the

... We of the NRA are the people, we speak for the 
·people, and we will violently eliminate A~erica's enemies 
with the haste of a speeding bullet. The NRA has chosen for 
its spokesman a well-known adversary for the return of A~erica 
to a natural social order. The revolutionaries of the NRA are 
ordered to maintain in every way possible or to avoid detection 
by the enemy, but are ordered not to deny their association if 
at such time they are detected by the enemy or captured. All 
NRA members and associates are instructed that if captured they 
are governed by the laws set at the Geneva Conference for cap­
tured so1diers and prisoners of war. Thls is by all means a 
declaration of wat. The enemies of white America will fall • like flies at a Raid party.

of the NR.ti.. once we seize power .
