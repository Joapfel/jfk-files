UTILIZATION OF INFORMANTS-AND SOURCES AT INSTITUTIONS OF LE.ARNING 
1. Use of students 
a. Students under age of 21 years are not to be developed as security 
informants, potential security informants, or other types of security 
sources in other than highly unusual circumstances. Under such 
circumstances, furnish complete justification to Bureau. . 
b. Upon initial contact wi-th a potential student sec.uri ty informant or 
source, individual shquld be tactfully requested to execute a brief 
signed written statement for field file setting forth that.this in­
dividual has voluntarily c·ome forward to furnish information to FBI 
because of his concern over individµals or groups that may be inimical 
to interests of u. S .. Government and that he understands that FBI has· no 
interest in legitimate• ins ti tut ion or campus acti vi ties. Taking this 
statement sh.01.tld place Bureau_ in a position to refute poss;i.ble subse-' 
quent false allegations as to nature and purpose of source's coopera­
tion with FBI. 
2 •. Quarterly letters 
a. Beginni~g 1-1-70~ submit quarterly letters on each student and te?cher 
authorized by Bureau for contact as a security informan~, potential 
security informant, or other sources· (including·panel sources). • 
{Quarterly letters are not to take place of or be combined with six • 
months' payment justification letters.) Include following in quarter­
ly letters: 
(1) Specific productivity 
(2) Specific information furnished not otherwise ava.ilable from pub-· 
lie source material or other office sources off campus 
(3) Frequency of contact 
b. Quarterly letters of security and racial intormants should be jointly 
transmitted to Bureau by cover letter captioned 11Utilization of In­
formants and Sources at Institutions of Learning." Include followi~g 
in cover letter concerning security sources: . 
(1) Number of security informants, potential security informants, and 
other security sources active and under development at each educa-
tional institution affected • 
(2) An overall analysis of coverage afforded by.campus informants and 
sources 
3. Responsibility for well-planned coverage 
Each office must have a continuous and well-planned program to ootain nec­
essary coverage at institutions of learning so that Bureau can fulfill its 
obligations. Care with which this must be done in no way lessens respon­
~ibility of each individual field office to have proper coverage.
