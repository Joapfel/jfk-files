0 on 8-8-58 advised that since the revolution in /2~~;,/e:~:::.lJ 
Venezuela in January, 1958, the country has been.- rule,d, by a _Junta.\~~ 
Newspaper -media since the revolution have reported periodically that_ 
individuals who were political exiles cluring the ·regi}ne of iviarcos 'Pe_ __ rez 
Jimenez have been allowed to return to Venezuela and .. Jpursue. their ·-·--,,

It has become apparent from daily news stories that 
Venezuela is presently in a state·of political upheaval; Although 
the_ leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated he has no 
political aspirations it has been pointed out by 9orrespondents that 
he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and 
"wooing" the support of the communists. This reportedly has ·been 
done by statements attributed to Larrazabal that he could not conceive 
of a Venezuelan communist being c·ontrolled by the us;::l.ll since all 
Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and loyal to ·venezuelao. It has 
also been pointed out that the cpmmunists of Venezuela are being 
played u_p as the he roes of the· recent revolution "in that country.

Some correspondents have stated tha~: it is felt there wi 11 pos-s i bly. , 
be a mi.J.itary coup if the polii/icians of Venezuelq, do not soon set up i-
a government· acceptable to the military leaders. _-It is further · ;---
noted that the Vice President and ll!rso Nixon experienced insults (. 
during their tour of Latin .America, the most vicious of which - l:

From the above, it appears -that we should try to place 
ourselves in a position to obtain current intelligence data 
concerning the Venezuelan polit_ical situation. It is pointed out· 
that there_ appears to be a possibility of the Venezuelan communists 
I\ 
gaining more and more influence and power in that country and, ~ 
therefore., shifting Venezuela· to alignment with the Soviet Bloc. f/FO 
noted that a confidential source has reported _on several occasions _ J :: 
a strong interest in Lat in America by the Soviet Embassy. JYFO has· .-y\.\./\ 
requested the Bureau obtain State clearance for JfFO to initiate a / J __ \ 
program, looking toward the development of informants and sources ·~- • ;
