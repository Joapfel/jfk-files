disclosed that the current Ceylonese Ambassador to the United States -~, 
11.s.s. Gunewardene~ while assigned as ambassador tn Rome in 1954, •·' •• 
did not conceal his syrtipathies to representatives o.t the countries L 
in the "peace. camp" and that he was ofttm;:; in attendance at cultural • ·) 
and social even.ts o:t the npeoples Democratic States." This in,Jor­
mation was disseminated to State Department. In addition, hTO.-was \

In view of the informat ton concerning the Ceylonese ~ ~ 
Ambassador's past sympathies.coupled with the Bureau's responsibilitie·t 
in security investigations regarding intern.at ional trends or ·:-·· 
developments aj~ecting the internal security of:the u.s. and our 
responsibilities Jor keeping other interested agencies advised of
