coula be created by a security threat issuing from any one ~f these

some procedures ·which will place us in a positio,,n to acquire inforr::ation.

The 1954 case involving Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., which 
resulted in compromising communications intelligence material with 
lletherlands of.ficials, vividly brought to our attention_ the question 
whether we should 1tt<.'iiat6:in investigcXtive coverage of the·aclivi'ties o.f 
al 1 representatives of .friendly .foreign governr;1.ents,_··i·ri the U. S. .d 
care.ful study of the problem at that time le.ft us with'' the conclusion 
that in order to establish such ,coverage as would effectively reveal an 
operation such as tlutt occurring in the Petersen case, it would be 
necessary to maintain both technical and physical surveillances on 
diplpmatic offictals and o.fficial establ isluients in the U. S. iJf all 
frie11dly foreign countries. llotinJ that our intensified coverage of 
Soviets and satellites alone required over 6JO .Agents at that time, 
it was concluded that manpower eJ;penditure would seem to negate 
.following a similar _,p_r~gram with regard to non-Soviet bloc officials and 
establ isJuzents. (05-03113-1) 
Taking a more realistic approach, we immediately (l!ovember, 
1954) did two things: (1) Alerted 12 key field offices to the probler:z 
and issued instructions designed to help cope with it. (2) Informed 
si.,-.t other agencies of ou,r Government of our responsi.bil ities in this '.·,:-.. 
.field and askecZ them to n.otify us of the arrivals in the u. S. of all 
.foreign int el 1 igence o.f.ficials, even though their presence in this 
country might be under working arranger:zents with one of the s iY.. agencies -
involved. (65-6]113-1 through 5') • 
Since 1~rovember, 1954, we have coordinated into captioned 
program two positive cowiterintell igence procedures which have been in _ 
use .tor many years: (1) Technical surveillance coveraqe in the ll. s. oJ 
ofJicial establ ishi.;,Cnts of frien,:Zly foreign countries located in. "tr~. 
c..reas. (65·-0311]-40) (2) Developr-zent of 1 ivc sources in such c::.;t-.:,,:.:"
