6. Practices Current at the Time in Which the Assas-
sination Plots Occurred Were Revealed by the Record to 
Create the Risk of Confusion, Rashness, and Irresponsibility 
in the Very Areas ·where Clarity and Sober Judgment Was 
Most Necessary. 
Various witnesses described elements of the system 
within which the assassination plots were conceived. The 
Committee is disturbed by the custom that permitted the 
most sensitive matters to be presented to the highest levels 
of Government with the least clarity. We find this dis­
turbing, and view the following concepts as particularly 
dangerous: 
(1) The extension of the doctrine of "plausible denial" 
beyond its intended purpose of hiding the involvement of 
the United States from other countries to an effort to. 
shield higher officials from knowledge, and hence, responsi­
bility for certain operations. 
(2) The use of circumlocution or euphemism to describ.e 
serious matters--such as assassination--when pr~cise meanings 
ought to be made clear. 
(3) The theory that general approval of broad covert 
action programs is sufficient to justify specific actions 
such as assassination or the passage of weapons.
