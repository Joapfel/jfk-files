had no other function. If they had another function, I was 
never made aware of what it was . 
Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background? 
Mr. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are 
relevant details to put on the background, go ahead. 
Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for 
years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen­
heimer," and I saw quite a few references to Colonel Pash. I 
had known previously that he had been associated during the 
war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security 
background. And as I believe I touched on briefly befoie, it 
was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years 
at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of 
thing that we had been discussing so far today. 
Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about 
Pash's previous activities? 
Mr. Hunt. Kidnappings mostly. 
Mr. Baron. And where were those? 
Mr. Hunt. West Germany and West Berlin. 
Mr. Baron. Do you know the names of any of the victims 
of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than 
Pash and 
Mr. Hunt. I do not. 
Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of 
any assassination planning or attempts tfiat Pas.h was involved
