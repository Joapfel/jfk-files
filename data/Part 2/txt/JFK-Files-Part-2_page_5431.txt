JFK - March 18 Board Meeting 
8 March 1996 
I have been informed thaliia~~ Edg~~~will be attending the next JFK Board meeting. If this is the case, it would seem that Jeff should 
go as well. _./ 
Two issues need to be discussed with .the Board: stations and cover employees. 
1. Jeff and the Board agreed in principal to a "window" in which all stations would be opened .(l960;;&1J. Of course, if· 
there are particular stations which need to be exempted from this the Board wm consider it upon the presentation of substantive 
evidence. 
• HRG and the Board think this is a good idea that would enable them to-avoid raising potential appeals ever.y month 
f'Dave Edger needs to be signed onto this idea . 
• Jeff, last month, presented additional information on
1
0$1otSto~kholro/imd Cgpenhagen. Jeff and Dave should be 
prepared to answer questions or provide more information so that the Board will agree to protect these stations. 
2. The Board recently released the names ofi1Biover employees. An appeal is being prepared (or.so I am told). The 
thirty days runs on March 18. We need to finalize with the Boar·d how to handle this issue. At the last meeting the Board agreed that 
this.was a really important decision, but that they were not getting the information they need to make the right decision. At the last 
meeting, the Board intimated that they might be willing to delay this release, if CIA and the Board could come to a mutually agreeable 
way to deal with cover employees. I understood from Jeff that this is an issue that CIA will appeal on justthe principal. If this is true, 
the Board should understand what our ultimate position is on this, but that we are willing to cooperate with them to find a suitable • 
alternative (using pseudos or generic descriptions like "case officer") 
3. I will be out all next wee~ but B~rry Harellson/HRG (302921 and John Pereira/CS!) (303731 will be happy to fill you 
in on the details. Barry will be contactingffiob Caudle.next week to find out how the March 18 meeting will be handled.
