MR. HALPERN: ... t~at Bill had no choice at that point. I've talked to John 
about this, I listened to his argumentation. I'm no lawyer. And I still find 
it hard that something couldn't have been done about that. 
INTERVIEWER: Yes, he spoke about that to me and put it on tape. 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, J.ohr is an honest man. I'm not saying anything about 
that. John said by the time it got to that point he couldn't advise Colby in 
any other way from a legal point of view. He had to tell him to go. And that 
I find very hard to accept. Although again, as we said before, times have 
changed. And times change and poor Dick was caught in the middle. Absolutely 
caught in the middle. 
INTERVIEWER: He sure was. What about certain issues raised by the Church and 
Pike Committees? What are your thoughts about certain of them such as mail 
opening? 
MR. HALPERN: Well, I think they did not prove the case, that it ~as 
illegal. And take as my text the fact that the Justice Department, in looking 
into this after the Church Committee and after spending God knows how many 
months and years looking into this thing, had to decide even under the Carter 
administration there wasn't anything we could do. There wasn't enough 
evidence one way or the other and when you had Postmasteis General who 
testify. Some testified it was totally illegal. But some say it was 
perfectly legal. Nothing wrong with it. We knew what was going on and we 
agreed. And that's got nothing to do with whether the President is approved 
or not. When you have a difference of view from postmasters themselves, how 
the hell can you go to court on that? So, oh sure, it was another one of ' 
those headline grabbing things. And as somebody said, I don't know of anybody
