**Following the September 4 ~lection, the CIA's Directorate of Intelli­
gen~~ circulated an intelligence community assessment of the impact of 
an Allende government on U.S. national interests. That assessment, 
dated September 7, 1970, stated: 
Regarding threats t; U.S. interests, .we conclude that: 
1. The U.S. has no vital national interests within Chile. 
Th~re would, however, be tangible economic losses. 
2. Th~ ~orld military balance of power would not be sig­
nifican.tly altered by an Allende government: 
3. An Allende victory would, however, create consider­
able political and psychological costs: 
-a. Hemispheric cohesion would be threatened by 
the challenge that an Allende government 
would pdse to the OAS, and by the reactions 
that it would create in other countries. 
We ddnot see, however, any likely threat 
to the peace of the region. 
b. An Allend.e victory would represent a defin­
ite psychological set-back to the U.S. and 
a definite psychological advance for the 
Marxist idea. (Intelligence Memorandum/ 
"Situation Following the Chilean Presidential 
Election," CIA '.s Directorate of Intelligence, 
7 September 19~0)
