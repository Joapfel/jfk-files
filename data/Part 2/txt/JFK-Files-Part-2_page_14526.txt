Israeli intelligence acti.vities in the United States, which has 
indicated direct intelltgen9e and espionage aottutty on the part. 
of Israeli diplor.iatio represen-tatives. In the spring of 1954., when 
the Guatemalan revolution was brewing, we opened rather extensive 
coverage of the Guatemalan Embassy and developed intelligence 
information of interest to other Uo s. agencies. We have developed 
informants, in the diploma.tic establishments of China:, Indonesia., 
Japan ~~d Korea, and are making efforts to develop informants in the 
embassies of Ceylon and India.

Throu·gh the Bureau's Program, designed to obtain 
the cod~s and cyphers oJ' forei.gn countries, we, have obtained. code 
material of India, Israel, jfati onal tst China, Japan, ··Yugoslavia., 
The Philippines, Swit2erland, Guatemala, Yiest German,y~ and Spain, 
which has been of inestimable value in ·the cryptanalysts field. 
While we have stayed away from United Nattons as such, 
and feel that we should' continue to do so, we have established 
coverage of the Soviet Delegation to the UJv, and we have developed' 
informants among UN employees,· who report on Soui et bloc acti ui •ties

OBSERVATIONS 
th The Bureau is an t ntelligence organi.r:att on and· a large portion 
iof our prestige is the result of intelligence-type operations 
!1successfully handled. It is /ar better for us to consider this 
hproblem now rather than to have someone else raise the issue 
Ulater and perhaps force us into a program we do not want. . - '
