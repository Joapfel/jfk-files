Paul Daly called at 3:10 p.m. to advise that "the powers 
that be" at the Bureau were upset with the possibility that the 
Committee was considering going to Dallas and interfering with 
the investigation.· He specifically that the Director be given 
an opportunity to talk with Inouye prior to any such action. 
I told Daly that it was merely the Committee's desire to go 
to Texas; I had heard no discussion of going regardless of 
the Bureau's position. Daly promised to pull together without 
the need for a written·request, all available information on 
I . 
Brading for Committee review this afternoon, if at all possible.
