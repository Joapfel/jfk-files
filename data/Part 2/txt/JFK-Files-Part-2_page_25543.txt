ML: And I'm in the middle. So, anyway; I go, I go to the 
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years 
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my 
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not 
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to 
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me 
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both 
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had 
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She 
needed ,material. Now as soon as we walked into \the 
mission everybody there I know because they reside in 
the building. · And they all say,. "Ilonka Maris cha 
blah, blah, blah, blah." And I'm very friendly with 
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're 
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see 
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile 
I'm aware that every pi~ture has an eye or every 
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my 
<laugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room 
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know 
we're being watched. She knows it too and she 
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful, 
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this 
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you 
want?", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please. 
I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he 
is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait. 
I refused a wire or anything like that, but ... 
FS: What wire are you talking about? 
ML: A wire on me. 
FS: Oh. 
ML: Because ... 
FS: That the agents (unintelligible) 
ML: Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me 
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian 
way ... 
FS: Yeah. 
ML: And he'll feel that and I'm dead. 
FS: Right. 
ML: Right in the mission. That's not my proper there. 
FS: Right.
