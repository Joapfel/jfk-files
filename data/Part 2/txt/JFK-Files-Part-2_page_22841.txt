Mr. McCone, when did this occur; approximately? 
Mr. Bundy. That occurred earlier<on. 
Mr. Smothers. Before the,Rock~fell~r Commission inquiry? 
Mr. Bundy. I don. t' know ex~ct'i~; \ih~~ ·11( wa~. ' But it 
·::: .. •· '.-.:.-~:>;::~·. 
was within the context of the Rockefeller Commission 
inquiry and not this inquiry. 
Mr. Smothers. Are you talking about more than one 
conversation? 
Mr. Bundy. No, I think I talked to him on the phone 
and then I had a meeting with him. 
Mr. Smothers. In either the phone conversation or the 
meeting did you discuss Mr. McCone's 1967 report? 
Mr. Bundy. He told me that he had heard of it. I don't 
think he had then seen it. 
Mr. Smothers. You don't think he had then seen it? 
Mr. Bundy. He had then seen it as of 1975. He obviously 
saw it in 1967. 
Mr. Smothers. Can you give us a feeling for the approx­
imate time when this conversation occurred? 
Mr. Bundy. I could '.probably work it out from my own 
calendar, but I don't have it in my head. 
Mr. Smothers. But at this time he had not seen the 
report?
