Q: Had the information concerning Oswald's visit 
to the Cuban Embassy in addition to the Soviet 
one, ·that Oswald had been ieqtiesting a visa, 
if it had been sent to CIA headquarters, would 
hi s case pr i or to . the as.sass i n at i on hay e been 
handled in any different manner? 
A: It would have been in the case of dissemina- · 
tion of information about him, but I do not 
think that any operational action would have 
taken to apprehend him or to contact him or 
to try to force him back to the United Sta~es. 
Q: ... how would the dissemination have been 
treated_differently? 
A: Well, it simply means that we would h~ve dis­
semirlated any additional i~formation that ~e 
got. 657 / • 
It cannot be determined with exactitude whether or 
not this additional infor~atiori about Oswald was reported 
to Headquarters. In all likelihood it was not. The Chief 
of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station 
was ever criticized for this failure to report in the 
face of a ~pecific re~uest to do so by CIA Headquarters. 
He said: 
No_ That was not because we were trying to go 
easy on them, it is simply because it is in the 
nature of the business. What you are trying to 
do-is engage, as I used to say, in important il­
legal manipulations of society, secretly.
