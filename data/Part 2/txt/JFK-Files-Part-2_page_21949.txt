CIA officials maintain that they acted faithfully in transmitting 
messages to Generals Bennett and/or Philpott and in never sending a 
message without proper authorization. Mr. Karamessines was particularly 
forceful in this regard: 
... I can recall no instance in my experience at the Central 
Intelligence Agency in which a message was received for an 
individual, an officer of the government anywhere, in what­
ever department, which was not faithfully, directly, promptly 
and fully and accurately delivered to that officer, or to his 
duly authorized representative. 
(Karamessines testimony, p. 79) 
We may have played tricks overseas, but it stopped at the

general instructions to the frmyJAttache. This possibility would be 
contrary to their sworn testimonye Second., General Bennett was not aw;ire 
of Track II but General Philpott was. and communicated general instructions ro 
the GrmyJAt Cache. This possibility is Dupµorted by Roth's testimony 
' . 
but would be contrary Cv Philpott's sworn testimony and his duty to 
keep General Bennett infor~ed. Third, the CIA acted on its own, and,
