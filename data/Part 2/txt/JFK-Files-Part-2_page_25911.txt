Viy stream of consciousn~ss on kinds of things to consider would 
include: What our public statement on this should or should not be, 
security for other witnesses:, immediate contact with other key witnesses 
(to reassure them), secrecy of witness lists and irrnnunity applications, 
secrecy of place, time and even fact of-interview, meetings with Justice 
organized crime section, Chicago strike force, local law enforcement people 
in Oak Park- and Illinois, obtaining all FBI investigative reports (they're 
in it per tonight!sStar), ·getting background on all law enforcement officials 
in Illinois who will be inv~lved (whom do you trust?), is this a diversion 
which we're being sucked into, how do we avoid that (hire someone just for 
this), how do we show we care so .other witnesses (known or unknown) won't 
dry up, etc. etc. etc. 
NOTE: Mike can be reached after 6:45 tonight at (802) 863-2652.
