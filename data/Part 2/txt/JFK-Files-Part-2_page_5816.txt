source materials related to an individual associated with 
the assassination. Second, in a number of cases targeted 
areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of 
interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and 
added documents to the collection. And third, impro~ed 
search techniques have provided better access to those files 
which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the 
material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to 
the material in the sequestered collection and the overall 
set of material from CIA which has been designated as 
"assassination records" by the JFK Board. 
In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority 
to designate records which it considers relevant to the 
assassination as "Assassination Records." These documents 
are then subject to review for declassification or, as 
deemed appropriate by the Board, held for declassification 
in the year 2017. The Board has designated the entire 
sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as 
selected material generated in the course of searches 
subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is 
the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including 
duplicates.
