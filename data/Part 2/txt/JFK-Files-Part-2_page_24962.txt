Memo to Files 
September 5, 1975 
Page Two 
I read to him a quote from the Special Groµp minutes of 
September 8, 1960. Douglas was in attendance at this 
meeting. Mr. Gordon Gray was quoted as saying that he hoped 
that CIA people were "fully aware of the top-level feeling 
in Washington that vigorous action would not be amiss. 11 
Douglas had no independent recollection of this remark or the 
discussion to which· it related. 
Note: 
I indicated to Mr. Douglas that it probably would not 
be necessary to call him to testify on the Lumumba matter. 
Mr. Douglas' phone numbers are: (617) 693-1353 (until September 
29) and (312) 726-2452 (office in Chicago).
