MR. HALPERN: Oh, it was nonexistent. Nonexistent, less than nonexistent. 
INTERVIEWER: Gee. 
MR. HALPERN: 1 73 was a bad year. A very bad year. 
INT ERV I EWER: 
1 
7 4? 
MR. HALPERN: Well, I don't know. In 1 74 it probably got a little bit 
better. Things were settling down a l_ittle bit under Colby. And we weren't 
quite so much under the gun .. About that time most of the people had been 
separated. 
INTERVIEWER: And was that harshly, that separation issue, is that Agency 
officers were coming back from Vietnam. 
MR. HALPERN: Partly that. But only partly. We had a program under Tom 
Karamessines and under Helms. We knew that we were going to have to bring 
back a 1 ot of peop 1 e from Vietnam gr·adua 11 y, and we started actua 11 y, believe 
it or not, we started earlier than most people give us credit for to plan for 
this kind of reduction in force in Vietnam, the Far East Division, and 
gradually try to sort of sptead the officers back to their proper divisions 
and areas, and we knew it was going to take.a long ti~e. And we knew we were 
going to have to reduce the total· strength -- we were getting cut budget wise 
anyway and personnel slot wise~ But it was a long range program. We were 
going to do it over a period of time. We weren't going to do it in a day. 
And it was a totally -different approach. One with humanity, one totally 
without humanity. And I think we were right in feeling that we owed the guys, 
after all of their years and effort, some consideration. And, you know, there 
are perfectly legal ways and means of using the personnel rules and 
regulations and financial rules and regulations to ease the passage.
