CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer 
Records Briefing for ARRB Staff 
24 February 1997 
ARAB letter to DCI, dtd. 27 November, 1997, RE CIA Compliance 
with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. 
1. The JFK Board (ARRB) staff has requested briefings by records "specialists" on the 
Agency's records systems as part of the compliance with the JFK Act process (see reference). The 
first DO briefing took place on 12 February. The DA briefing and a follow-up DO briefing is planned for 
early March. I would like to set up the remaining briefings as soon as possible. 
2. The ARAB staffers are very familiar with agency documents and have had several general 
briefings on Agency records; one member of the staff is a former Agency employee (CTC). These 
"compliance" briefings should focus on what files would have existed in the 1958-63 time period and 
how we search, or account for, those records today. The ARRB requests you have been working on 
give you some sense of the type of information they are interested in. In addition I am faxing a copy of 
the "talking points" prepared for the DO briefing. I have also ask Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General Counsel, 
to provide a list of directorate specific topics. 
·3_ The briefing can take place at HQ or at IP. The ARRB attendees will include Mr. Gunn and 4 
or 5 members of the Board's CIA team; all are fully cleared (SCI). I have asked Mr. Gunn to provide a 
list of dates.when he and his staff would be available~-t I will forward the list to you as soon as I receive 
it. Thank you for your assistance in setting up these briefings. If you have any questions, please give 
me a call on extension 31825.
