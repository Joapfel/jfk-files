In a personal letter from McCone to Lodge it 1·1as stated that: "I was told by Dean Rusk 
that you proposed that Gen. Lansdale(replace Richardson as Chief of Station). I wish 
to errphasize the .:.1gcncy wJll reorient the Saigon station any practical way to meet your 
desires. Personnel, including the station chief can be replaced ... Lansdale would 
not be acceptable to the organization or to me personally ... if the decision is to 
abandon all hope of working with the regirre then R.i.chardson probably should be replaced 
We have no current :tntelJJ.[~ence nor resulting estimate in hand which could lead 
·us to conclude that the present reginc can be disposed of, or that there exists a 
replacement regime which would be better. This is not hoVIever to say that a coup iray 
occur even before you receive this letter ..... " •
