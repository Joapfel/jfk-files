BRAZIL 
1. Approximately 400 Brazilian nationals trav­
eled legally to Cuba in 1962, and another 24 the 
first two months of 1963. A total of about 50 Bra­
zllians are believed to have received specific guer­
rilla warfare training in Cuba, starting with a con­
tigent of 12 men in July-August 1961. We know of • 
19 Brazilian specifically. A defecting Cuban army 
officer who claims to have run a base for guerrilla 
training reports that 37 Brazilians took courses 
there at a time which does not coincide with the 19 
cases in our records. 
2. At least four of the guerrilla trainees ·.in 
the original contingent of 12 w~re connected with 
the guerrilla training camps of the Brazilian Peas­
ant Leagues, exposed by the Varig air crash docu­
ments. At least six such camps were established, 
and each was to have 30 men and at least one leader 
trained in Cuba. Only one of the Cuban trainees is 
known to have been arrested. Altbgether there were 
only three arrests, although 24 additional warrants 
were issued. 
3. All of the Brazilians we·can identify as 
guerrilla trainees have come from the regular or 
the dissident Communist party or the Marxist-oriented 
Peasant Leagues of Francisco Juliao. Trainees sent 
by the Leagues were in some cases also members of 
the regular Communist party. 
4. Brazilians in positions of influence known 
to have received training in Cuba include: 
Clodomir dos Santos Morais, number two man 
in the Peasant Leagues, and principal agent in set­
ting up the training camps; still in custody. 
Joaquim Ferreira, Pedro Motta Barros, 
Rivadiva Braz de Oliveira, and Amaro Luiz de Car­
valho, Peasant League leaders. (Ferreira, a lawyer, 
.is a former economist for SUDENE, development agency 
for the impoverished northeast. Barros and de Oliveira 
are also student leaders, and Barros is a Communist 
Party youth leader.)
