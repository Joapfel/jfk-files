TRUJILID 
Agreed to by drafting 
s ubcormri. ttee on 
August 28, ·1975,·, 
Rafael Trujillo was assassinated by a group of Daninican dissidents on· 
May 30, 1961. 
TrujillO was a brutal dictator, and both the Eisenh0v1er and 
Kennedy Administrations enoouraged the overthrew of his regime by Dcminican 
dissidents. Toward that end the highest policy levels of both Administrations 
approved or oondoned supplying arms to the dissidents. Although there is no 
evidence that the United States instigated any assassination activity, certain 
evidence tends to link United States official. to the assas~ination 
plans. 
-Material support, consisting of three pistols and three carbines, was 
supplied to various dissidents. \·lhile United States' officials knew that the 
dissidents intended to overthrow Trujillo, probably by assassination, there 
is no direct evidence·that the weapons which were passed were used in the 
assassination. The evidence is inconclusive as to how high in the two 
Administrations information about the dissidents' assassination plots 
had been passed prior to the spring of 1961. 
Beginning in March of 1961, the dissidents began asking United States 
officials for machine guns. By the ti.rre four M-3 machine· guns were shipped to 
the CIA Station Chief in the D:Jminican capitol in April, it was well known 
that the dissidents wanted them for use in connection with the assassination. 
Thereafter, hGWever, pennission to deliver the machine guns to the dissidents 
was.denied, and the guns were never passed. Two days before the assassination, 
President Kennedy personally autl1orized a·cable to. the U.S. Consul General 
,,, The second paragraph under V7CT.c. and the paragraph under VII. C. were 
drafted pursuant to the directions of the Subcormri.ttee but have not been 
reviewed by. the Subcorrmittee.
