CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: CUban Subversion in Latin America 
Since July 1963 
___ 1. __ ~ban subversive efforts in Latin America 
are continuing at a steady pace, despite recent 
major setbacks in such countries as Venezuela and 
Brazil. From July 1963 through December, when 
Havana evidently believed a "second CUba" was likely 
in Venezuela, Cuban propaganda stressed.the inevi­
tability of Castro-inspired revolutions in t-he 
hemisphere. Since the first of this year, however, 
Cuban leaders have muted direct exhortations to vio­
lence and .have emphasized other policy priorities. 
Neverthelesei"~ • ·the Cuban pot en ti.al for subversion in 
Latin America remains high. 
2. In his speech of 26 July 1963, Castro re­
captured much of the militant tone of his speeches 
in late 1962. He made it clear that he regards 
CUba as the main source of inspiration and guidance 
for inevitable revolutions in the rest of Latin 
America. He claimed that what has been done in 
CUba can take place "exactly the same way in many 
Latin American countries." The hemisphere's mili­
tants, he said, must take advantage of· conditions 
presently favoring revolut~on and "open the breach." 
_On 28 September, Castro said that while "imperial-
ists believe they can destroy the CUban revolution," 
the Cubans believe that before that could be accom­
plished ''many other revolutions like 9urs-will ap-
. pear on· the continent." On 24 November, Che 
Guevara said the spreading of revolution in the 
hemisphere "is also our responsibility and it is 
part of our daily preoccupation."
