Mr. McCone went on to say that continuing reports are now being 
received, alleging the existence of various exotic items of materiel 
in Cuba. No one report appears to stand up, but he has directed 
that all such reports for the past ninety days be examined in total 
context, so as to see whether on this basis any possible pattern 
might emerge. Mr. McCone added that he personally feels very uneasy 
about the situation in Cuba.
