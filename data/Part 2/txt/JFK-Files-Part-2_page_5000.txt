2. LIVING SINCE RETIREMENT IN AUSTRIA FROM<1971 TO 1980..AND FIWM 
1983 TO THE PRESENT, I HAVE ACHIEVED HIGH POSITIONS IN VIENNA'S 
MUSICAL .BODIES, BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE. JOHANN.;STRAUss,soCIETY AND .• 
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE VIENNA MEN' s SINGING SOCIETY, AND I AM • • •• • 
PERSONALLY I<NOWN TO SEVERAL RECENT AUSTRIAN,.PRESIDENTS, '.MANY 
REPORTERS AND RADIO FIGURES. . I SUFFERED A DISABLING. STROKE. IN .· · · 
DECEMBER 1993 AND MY WIFE AND I, BOTH 1s; CAN.CONTINUE TO EXIST HERE 
· BECAUSE OUR 2000· so·. FT. APARTMENT. IS WITHIN .WAI.ICING DISTANCE OF 2 •.. 
POST.OFFICES, SEVERAL SMALL SUPER MARKETS, MY FAMILY PHYSICIAN, OUR 
DENTIST, MY UROLOGIST, AND AN EYE DOCTOR AND.OPTICIAN. WE ARE 
WITHIN WHEEL CHAIR DISTANCE OF THE CONCERT HALLS AND THE OPERA. 
WHERE CAN YOU DUPLICATE THIS FOR ME? . 
3. DURING MY ACTIVE CAREER IN VIENNA AROUND 1959 I INTERROGATED AND 
BROKE AN INTELLIGENCE SWINDLER WHO HAD BEEN A NAZI ASSASSIN; I 
PROMISED HIM SECRECY IF HE CONFESSED, BUT THE US ARMY PUT OUT A 
"BURN NOTICE'" ON HIM, FORCING HIM TO MOVE TO GERMANY. I AM SURE HE 
WOULD LOVE·TO FIND ME AND SHOOT ME. 
4. VIENNA IS FULL OF ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL 
*<ASSASSINATIONS,>EVEN OF A CITY COUNCILMAN, BY THEM IN RECENT YEARS. 
UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW, I, AS A FOREIGNER, CANNOT EVEN GET A PISTOL 
LICENSE. YOU MUST I<NOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD. 
4. I HAVE TWICE TESTIFIED BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES ABOUT 
*THE<KENNEDY ASSASSINATION.> THEIR FULL REPORTS SIMPLY CALLED ME THE 
"DESK OFFICER" AND.THAT HAS SEEMED TO SATISFY EVERYONE. NEEDLESS TO 
SAY, IF YOU DO EXPOSE MY NAME, I WILL NOT EVER TALK TO ANY 
JOURNALISTS OR SO-CALLED HISTORIANS. 
S. IF MY NAME IS EXPOSED, I WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LEAVE VIENNA, 
WITH THE WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF FURNITURE, PICTURES, LIBRARY, CLOTHING, 
ETC. WHICH I PACKED AND PAID TO HAVE MOVED OVER HERE IN 1983. 
BECAUSE OF MY STROKE, I WILL BE UNABLE TO DO ANY PACKING AND THE 
MOVE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE. WHERE CAN. I RESETTLE IN A 2000 SQ FT. 
APT. SO CONVENIENTLY LOCATED. 
6. MY WIFE AND I LOVE LIVING HERE FOR MANY REASONS, AND LEAVING 
WOULD BE A CRUEL AND NEEDLESS,FATE. 
7. I REGARD THIS LAW AS DISHONORABLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE UNITED 
STA.TES OF AMERICA. IF YPU DECIDE AGAINST ME, I WANT TO APPEAR 
BEFORE THE BOARD AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT, WHOM I HAPPEN TO ADMIRE. I 
. WILL PAY MY OWN WAY BACK TO.DO SO .. I SERVED IN WWII AND NEVER 
SPARED MYSELF; IN THE OUTFIT I-. WORKED HARD, · WAS FEARLESS IN DEALING 
WITH MY SUPERIORS ·(CORD MEYER AND DICK HELMS CAN TESTIFY TO THAT) 
AND MY ADVERSARIES. I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF THREATENING TO EXPOSE 
THINGS TO PRESSURE YOU. I WILL.BE·EMPLOYING AN ATTORNEY OR TWO, 
FAMILIAR WITH OUR AFFAIRS, TO REPRESENT ME. I·WILL NOT DENY, THAT I 
CONSIDER YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IMPLEMENTING THIS LAW TO BE ENGAGING 
IN DISHONORABLE CONDUCT, UNWORTHY OF OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICE. 
8. IN THE LATE 1960'S WHILE SERVING IN VIENNA UNDER TOM 
KARAMISSINIS, I WAS ORDERED BY HQ TO REVEAL TO AUSTRIAN MILITARY
