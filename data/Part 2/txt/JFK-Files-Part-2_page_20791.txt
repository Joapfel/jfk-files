Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition 
(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would 
also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation 
Movement through their influence in WONAAC! 
The SMC is controlled by the 
SWP and its youth affiliate, 
YSA. SMC initiates and supports 
public demonstrations against 
the war in Southeast Asia. 
NPAC was founded in 1970 by 
members of the SWP. Its objec­
tive is the immediate, total 
and unconditional withdrawal 
of all US forces and material 
in Southeast Asia. 
NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972, 
through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were 
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular 
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local 
(NYL) during that period. 
NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader­
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP. 
NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC 
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY, 
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though 
WONAAC previously had accused various female activists 
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle 
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against 
the SfvP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they 
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen 
the WONAAC cause. 
At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members 
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting I 
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members. ( 
Thev indicated that the sivP-YSA has no right to be in a 
policy-making position in WONAAC .
