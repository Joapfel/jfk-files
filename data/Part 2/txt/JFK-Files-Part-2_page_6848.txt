First, vesting in a body outside--in an outside body 
the determination whether CIA materials related to the 
assassination can be released to the public is inconsistent with 
my own statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources 
and methods . • 
Second,· I am concerne~ that the joint resolution 
contains no provision requir_ing security clearances or secure 
----d-oeument hand:tirrg-by-the assassination materials review board or 
its staff. 
Third, I'm concerned that the joint resolution does 
not provide the agency with the opportunity to object to the 
release of CIA information. c_ontained ___ in __ documents .. originated by_ 
the Congress or the warren Commission: 
Under the joint resolution documents originated by 
these entities can be released directly_ b~ the executive 
director of the assassination materials rev~ew board, without 
any review by the president or the.executive branch. . 
Fourth, the joint resolution-provision for·a 30-day 
period for agencies and departments to appeal decisions of the 
executive director to release information m~y not.provide 
sufficient time for meaningful review of what could ~rove to be 
a large volume of material at one time. 
Fifth and finally, Section 6 of the Joint Resolution, 
which outlines the grounds for postponement of a public release 
of the documents, makes no provision for postponing release of 
documents that may contain executive privilege~-- or- d"e!Ioerative 
process, attorney-client or attorney-work product information. 
While such privileges could be waived in the public interest, 
and in fact are not likely to arise with respect to factual 
information directly relating to the assassination, they would 
be unavailable in the joint resolution in the rare case they 
might be needed. 
These are· ·tecfinical : probiems, and I believe they can 
be solved in ways that can expedite the release of~ocuments 
bearing on the assassination of President Kennedy. But again, 
whatever the futur~ course of this legislation, CIA is 
proceeding even now to review for declassification the relevant 
documents under its control. And further, we~will cooperate 
fully with any mechanism established by the Congress and the 
president to declassify this material. 
That concludes my summary of my statement, Mr. 
Chairman.
