MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter 
You will note from the very brief memorandum of my 
discussion with Secretary Rusk that he made two requests -­
the first, a study of the reasons for lack of action of the 
Communists in Southeast Asia. This is a matter I discussed 
at this morning's meeting and I hop~ that we can have an OCI 
memorandum on my return. 
The second question was concerning clandestine channels 
to Castro, the C_hinese Communists and Hanoi. This should be 
given serious thought by DDP. Ea.ch situation differs. I am sure 
we could, if we desired, open up a channel to Castro. The 
Peiping and Hanoi situations are more difficult. In one respect 
there is a channel open to P,ifi1:g through Warsaw, but it is not 
effective. Perhaps theQ:aipe1 ~ta\ioii}vould have some thoughts.$ 
on this. Also, there is a channel to Hanoi through the@anadiaiu 
representative on the ICC; however this obviously is an "official" 
channel and is not very productive. I think it would be well to 
go over this matter with Dick Helms when he returns. 
Secretary Rusk expects comments on both these points 
next week.
