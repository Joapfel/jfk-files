Hedgman summarized his testimony on this question in h{s 
.... 
second appearance: 
• . • ' . • 
I, probably had authority to act on my own 
but ... it was possible that I had to go 
back and get clearance for my action. 
(Hedgman, 8/25/75, p. 11; see also 8/21/75, 
p. 39.) 
_Hedgman testified; however, that a 
11
policy decision"•had been 
made -- that assassination had been ''approvedl! as. "one means" of 
eliminating_ Lurnurnba as a political threat (Hedgman, 8/21/7 5, p. 52~. 
I thought the policy decision had beerr made 
in the White House, not in the Agency, and 
that the Agency had been selected as the 
Executive Agent, if you will, to carry out 
a political decision. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52.) 
Although Hedgman assumed that the President had not personally 
. . 
selected the means of assassinition, he testified that he was under 
the impression that the President had authorized the CIA to do so 
and to proceed to take action: 
Hedgman: ... I doubt that I thought the 
President had said, you use this system. 
But my understanding is the President had. 
made a decision that ari aci should tak~ 
place, but then put that into the hands of 
the Agency to carry out his decision. 
Q: Whatever that act ·was to be, it was 
clearly to be assassination or the death 
of the foreign political leader? 
Hedgman: Yes. 
~ Instigated by the CIA, initiated by the CIA? 
Hedgman: • Certainly if those -- if Dr. Gottlieb's • 
lethal.agents were employed, that would have been 
the result, yes. '(Hedgman, 3/21/75, p. 104.)
