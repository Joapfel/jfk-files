On October 21, 1069, we told CIA that future 
requests from CIA for technical surveillance.coverage 
should be tr~nsmittcd by the Agency directly to the 
Attorney General. 
CIA has never mD.dc any official comrncnt or 
protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned action 
by the.Burenu as unfriendlj and uncoopGrativc. The Agency 
has looked to the Bur2rru ns the logicnl point of contnct and 
as the only or;;a11iz:i tion ho. ving the resov.rcer3 and capr,.bi 15. tics 
of adequately detorminin;; if such coverage is even feastble.

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of otht 
situations or conflicts which occured over the years and 
which resulted in the voicit'l[; :.f.. CIA dirsplcrrsurc or cri ticic.m." 
The Agent cannot recall tho nnmca of the caz6s which is 
necessary to ncquir6 the required datae There was one 
inst~nce c~rly in the 1950's ~hich involved information 
rcc,:;i vcd from a Bource of unlmown rcliQbili ty ch:::.rgin~~ 
Allen Dulles with having been a co~muni:~~ and a spy while 
in Europe. We· dissenin~ted the in:Zornation to several 
agencies. Dulle3 exploded but never lodged a protest. 
The Agent nlso has recollection of instancris when 
CIA.alleged th~t its source or informant was compromised by 
Burenu rcvelntion;of CIA information durinG the course of 
interviews conducted by us. Tcchuically, this. vmuld be a 
violation of tho th:!.rd ~.gcn.cy rule n.nd, if CIA hn.d hard 
core fncts, we would be vµlnernblc, particularly if an 
important h1forr:1nnt \'/::ts lost. CIA never made any of ficin.l 
issue or protest.
