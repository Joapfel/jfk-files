Having reached this point, the Soviets have at least three 
alternatives: 
One-, they can abandon Castro, reduce military and economic 
aid, cut their losses, and in such event Castro would soon collapse. 
Current intelligence does not support such a probable Soviet course 
of action, otherwise they would not be disposed to leave such quantities 
of extremely valuable modern military hardware, including the SAM 
sites, communications equipment, and extensive Naval and ground 
equipment and a large number of technicians. 
Second, they could maintain about the same level of economic 
and military support as in the past, although I would feel this could not 
be a very reasonable assumption from the standpoint of military support 
as the presence of large amounts of additional military equipment, in­
cluding those mentioned above, would necessitate a higher level of 
military support than before in order to provide operational readiness, 
training, maintenance, spare parts, replacements, etc. This does not 
mean more economic supportJ3-lthough I think Castro could insist upon 
it on the grounds that Soviet equipment is a burden to him and of course 
Dorticos alluded to this in statements in New York.
