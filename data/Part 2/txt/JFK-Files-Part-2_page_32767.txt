of appreciation of the complexity of a problem, the adjusted figures are 
subject to substantial errors. 
Expressed another ·way, the cost esd.mators of the Evaluation Group 
could only assume an equal understanding of the problem by both Boeing 
and General Dynamics, and then correct the two cost proposals more or 
less mechanically. But the predictable result of the lack of appreciation 
of the scope of a problem is delay and increased costs, the extent of which 
is essentially unpredictable, and therefore not susceptible to analysis by 
the application of statistical factors. 
The question has been raised as to why costs are important when 
both contractors were proposing fixed-price incentive contracts. There 
are several reasons. 
In a development contract for a complex new weapon system like the 
TFX, there inevitably will be engineering change orders. The cost of 
change orders .is borne by the government. Consequently; when two pro-• 
posals both meet military requirements as did Boeing 1s and General 
Dynamics 1, the proposal which seems likely to involve less change, with 
consequent delays and increased costs, is to be preferred. 
Aside from the matter of cost over-runs induced by multiplicity of 
change orders, there are other reasons why credibility of costs must be 
carefully evaluated in a fixed-price incentive contract.
