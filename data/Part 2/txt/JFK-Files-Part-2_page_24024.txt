,Kissinger believed that the gist of the October 15th meeting as 
recorded in the CIA memorandum was incompatible with the order the CIA 
issued to its Station the next day, an order ostensibly based on the 
October 15th meeting. And, he noted, in writing its memorandum of the 
meeting of the 15th, the CIA had a "high incentive to preserve the maxi­
mum degree of authority." (Ibid., pp. 55-5!;.) The October 16th order 
indicated that Track II had been reviewed at "high USG level" the previous 
day, and stated: 
2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende 
be overthrown by a coup. _It would be much prefer­
able to have this transpire prior to 24 October 
but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously 
beyond this date .... 
4. There is great and continuing interest in the 
activities of Tirado, Canales, Valenzuela et al 
and we wish them optimum good fortune. 
(Headquarters 802, 16 October 1970) 
Kissinger_ recalled the October 15th conversation as "turning off 
the coup plans rather than giving a new order to do them." (Kissinger 
testimony, p. 56) Haig agreed in his testimony. 
The conclusions of that meeting were that we had 
better not do anything rather than something that 
was not going to succeed .... My general feeling 
··~as, I left that meeting with the impression that 
there 'Was nothing authorized." 
(Haig testimony, p. 13)
