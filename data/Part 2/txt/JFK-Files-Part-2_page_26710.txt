A. No sir, because they were proprietary hires of this 
commercial cover. 
(1. Did CIA levv anv intelligence requirements upon these 
people other than in their duties -- in their debriefing 
capacity, I should say? 
~ No. When -- there were -- obviously there was a 
standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence 
interest or a battle, you know, anything -- economic questions, 
morale, and this type of thing. When these questions. -- when . 
these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the 
report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over to the Station. 
If the debriefing report contained something of positive 
intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer -- well, not the 
Case Officer but a staffer in the Station May or may not jot 
down soMe additional re0uin,ments and ask that that person be 
recontacted and asked specific.questions. 
Q. Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this 
smaller broup of AMOTS do for the Agency in. the Miami area? 
A. This was their prime nurno~e.
