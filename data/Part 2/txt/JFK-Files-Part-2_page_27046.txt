MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD .. 
. . 
SUBJECT: DCI Presentation to the President 1 s Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board, 7 December 19 62 
1. After conclu~ng the discussion· on Cuha, the Director told the 
Board that he wanted to report on the status of OXCART. He noted that we 
were on schedule with the aircraft, and that five would be completed by the 
end of December. He said that one had reached MACH 2. 16 at 60, 000 feet.· 
There had been some trouble with the J -58 engines, but all problems were 
soluble. He said the progress on the aircraft was _running ahead of that on 
the engines, and noted that we had had· 7 5 hours in the air with 18 hours on 
the J-58 engine. He said he had been in dh-ect contact with Mr. Horner to 
insure that the project was receiving top priority. Dr. Killian asked if Pratt 
and Whitney had their first team in and the DCI said yes, but one of the 
problems was that Hamilton Standard didn 1t have access to everything "in 
Pratt and Whitney unless Horner paved-the way. 
2. Dr. Baker asked if there had been a solution to the fuel pump 
problem and the DCI commented that he believed a solution was being reached. 
Dr. Killian noted that Bendix was working on an alternative fuel pump. The 
DCI concluded by saying that while the radar cross section was not as small 
as we had hoped for, it was being worked on.
