MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM 
FROM: Charles A. Briggs 
JFK Declassification Project, OIM 
SUBJECT: The JFK Declassification Experience 
1. My assumption in preparing the attached is that 
I was asked because: a) for seven-plus years I've been_ 
involved in the project; and b) my past Agency assign­
ments, including being the first DO-Information Review 
Officer, gave me the opportunity to see-declassification 
from many vantage points: from a legalistic directorate­
oriented, either-or standpoint (taking full advantage of 
allowed exemptions), to a "corporate" Agency-wide strategy 
to foster credibility while protecting secrets that should 
remain secret. My comments and conclusions reflect that 
experience and do not necessarily reflect the views of HRP 
management. 
2. Historically, the Deputy Directors have not 
paid much attention to information management - unless 
there's a problem. Then the approach has been: what went 
wrong; who's to blame; how can we ensure that this doesn't 
happen again; what lessons have we learned? What this JFK 
experience reiterates is the need for a proactive, not just 
reactive, flexible strategy, with corporate Agency direction 
through the Deputies to their Information Review Officers. 
And the IROs, who, in essence, determine credibility and 
resource impact, should be supergrades, with experience 
in at least two directorates. Because information release 
has become a major management issue, the Executive Director 
is the obvious officer to ensure consistent and informed 
implementation of release policy.
