play

"independently of the institutional program we are spurrinc;. n 
(Lansdale Ex. 4, p.l). Lansdale testified that in this memorandum the

"The Chairman: i-lhn.t preci~;ely clir1-you mcnn by "uncork the 
touchdown play independently of the institutional pro(!;rruns 
we are spurring?" 
"General Lansdale: Well, I was holdine; almost daily rncet­
inr,s with my workinr:; r.;roup, and -- in taskinr~, and fitH.linr; 
how they were developing plans I was becomi 11r~ ~1ore ancl more 
concerned tint they kept r,oin17, back to doing what I fcl t were 
rro [-9._!·m~ American types of actions r;:i_ther than actively ex­
plorinr: how to p;et the Cubans into this, and Lo have them 
undertake actions. 
11To me, the touchdown play was a Cuban revo]t to over­
throw the rer:ime. I did not feel tlrnt we had rwtten into 
the real internal part of r;etting Cubans into the action, 
and I was concerned about that."

power and to do that, there needed to be political actions
