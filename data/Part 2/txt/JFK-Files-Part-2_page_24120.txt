Arrangements are made with cleared and witting businessmen to 
provide a domiciliary address for these_ entities at a law office 
or telephone answering service. These entities, like the proprietary 
corporation administered by Agency Headquarters specialists. provide 
cover, payrolling, and tax attribution for Agency personnel and are 
similarly administered. 
Another type of entity used by the Agency and a proprietary 
only in the sense of being Agency-owned and administered is exempli­
fied by some 215 notional companies which are not legally registered 
but have names and bank accounts controlled by the Agency. The Agency 
arranges with cleared and witting attorneys or proprietors of telephone 
answering services to provide a domiciliary address and to refer any 
queries to the Agency specialists concerned. These notional entities 
are used to provide status and operational cover for Agency personnel 
involved in all types of high-risk intelligence operations. They are 
also_ used as ostensible clients for purposes of funding Agenc·y pro­
prietaries or bona fide American companies which provide 
cover and payrolling of Agency personnel. 
II. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR PROPRIETARIES 
The Agency's statutory authority to spend money for proprietary 
corporations in support of Agency operations derives from Section B(b) 
of the CIA Act of 1949. This Act states: -
"The sums made available to the Agency may be.expended without 
regard to the provisions of law and regulations relating to 
the expenditure of Government funds; and for objects of a 
confidential, extraordinary. or emergency nature, such 
expenditures to be accounted for solely on the certificate 
of the Director and every such certificate shall be deemed 
a sufficient voucher for the amount therein certified."
