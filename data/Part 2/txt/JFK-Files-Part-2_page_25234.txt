C URRENCE: COIBY states that 11When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINH, 
that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had comnitted suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible 
on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics Rnd CONEIN doubted • 
that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance 
to look at the bodies but .!;urned it dqwn. .Irl trying to reconstruct the period of the assass­
ination on November 1, COIBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between Presi­
dent DIBM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was vecy 
strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early 
stages. At a later stage, in the early rrnrning of November 1, he called and indicated that 
he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent sorrebody down to 
receive that surrender and foW1d that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten 
out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city.

OCCURRENCE: The IG Report ma.kes the following stateITEnt: "The fact that CONEIN was at 
JGS headquarters is well lmown in official circles", and bolsters that notoriety by the 
following staterrent: '"The first cable ( on the coup) was received at headquarters at 0117 
hours, ( November 1, 196 3,) Washington tirre, and was filed on the CRITIC network at 0159. 
At 0256 hours, following receipt of the sixth non-CRITIC cable, headquarters instructed the 
STA'"rION to put the coup reporting on the CRITIC network at the STA'I'ION. SoJTEtiITE during the 
day of 1 November (the confirmation copy of the cable lacks a date/tiITE stamp) headquarters 
cabled a warning to the STATION against including the names of CIA personnel in its CRITIC 
cables. CONEIN is identified by and as being at JGS headquarters in eleven CRITIC ITEssages, 
seven of which were put into the CRITIC channel, without the na.rre being deleted, here at 
headquarters."
