Mr. Dillon. Yes, I see~:now that I attended this as Acting 
Secretary of State, this particular meeting. 
Mr. Baron. And do you recall the discussion reported in 
those :minutes of affairs in the Congo, that there was the 
fear of Egyptian influence on the Congo situation on the part 
of Lumumba, and that there was some pressure being brought to 
reconcile Kasavutu and Lumumba? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't reca11· any of the d~tails of this 
meeting. I don't recall the meeting itslef. But it fits 
right in with the general feeling about the problem, the way 
you looked at the Congo problems. 
Mr. Bar6n. The minutes refer to a visa application for 
Lumumba. Would that have been in connection with Lumumba's 
desire to come to the US to be recognized as the legitimate 
representative of the Congo Government before the United 
Nations? 
Mr. Dillon. It would certainly refer to his desire to com 
to the United Nations to get out of the Congo, where he had 
been deposed. Whether he cared much whether we recognized 
him as the legitimate representative or not I would doubt. 
I don't think he had much interest in what we recognized. 
But I think it does show that he wanted to get out. And this 
was a way cf getting out. 
And he also probably wanted to go to the UN and make a big 
complaint there.
