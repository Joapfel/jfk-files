the ARRB's request to review all files on William 
Pawley and any files on his possible connection with 
Cuban exile groups in the 1962-1963 time frame. The 
Agency's 201 file on Pawley consists of three volumes, 
the same as in the JFK sequestered collection, and

his 201. However, the Agency holds operational files 
for the period 1963 to 1965 which related to Pawley.

staff and they selected a number of documents for 
inclusion in the materials being processed for release 
to NARA.
