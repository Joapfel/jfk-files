revision for circulation to the NSC members for approval. 
6. If extremely sensitive matt~rs were discussed at ~n NSC 
meeting, _it was sometimes the practice that the offic{al NSC 
minutes would re~ord only the general subject discussed without 
identifying the specially sensitive subject or the discussion. 
In highly sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would be 
made iri the NSC minutes. 
According to my recollection at this time, there was rio 
fixed procedure for r~cordin3 the discussions of"these sensitive 
matters which were usually discussed in a very limited attendance._ 
Some of these discus~ions were of a general nature which did not 
need to be re~orded. Others were of such importance that a full 
record was drafted by me and my deputy, as he attended, and circu­
lated by highly classified memorandum to each· of the NSC members 
for approval. In some cases, only a record of the conclusions and 
decisions, if any, were similarly drafted and approved. As approved 
by the NSC members atid finally the President, the record of these 
extremely sensitive matters were circulated on a very strictly con­
trolled distribution. 
Prepared by me on this 8th day of September, 1975.
