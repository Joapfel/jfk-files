Goodpasture (cont'd): 
in Spanish, ie. translations were done at the intercept 
unit when the language was Spanish. The tapes • 
that were in Russian were brought back to CIA head­
quarters in all likelihood. (From Phillips' testimony, 
it appears that the Russian translator fo:t .the CIA 
was based in the Embassy where CIA headquarters were.) 
Goodpasture transported the tapes·and transcripts in 
suitcases. She was notified i'f' t:ap·efwas~interes'ting 'Or not. 
Phillips believes that Goodpasture is retired and 
residing in Dallas, Texas. 
Raymond Swider: 
Also assigned to Pnillips, replacing Joe Picolo. 
Phillips believed Swider presently works in the 
Washington headquarters of the CIA. 
George Misco: (phonetic) 
Although Phillips was somewhat shakey about £acts 
with respect to Misco, he was able to tell us that 
Misco was the Russian translator for the CIA.and 
that his office was most likely in CIA headquarters 
rather than the Soviet i~tercept unit outside. 
Phillips claims that Misco was not in Mexico City 
at the time of Oswald's visit. 
Herbert Manel: 
CiA officer in charge of the assignmen.t:for Russian 
affairs, and as such was Phillips' counterpart at 
CIA station. 
Manel worked with his wife, Babara, on this assignment. 
Manel and his wife later worked with Phillips wh~n 
they were all assigned to Caracas, Venezuela.
