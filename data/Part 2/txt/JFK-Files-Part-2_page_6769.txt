MEMORANDUM FOR: 
FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
OCA 2149-92 
19 May 1992 
Director, Center for the Study of 
Intelligence 
Chief, Administrative Law Division, OGC 
David M. Pearline 
Deputy Director for Legislation, OCA 
Follow-up to DCI's 15 May JFK Testimony 
1. We have reviewed a transcript of the Director's 
15 May testimony on the JFK Assassination Materials 
Resolution to identify those questions with respect to which 
CIA committ·ed to provide answers for the record. A copy of 
the transcript with relevant portions marked is attached. 
2. The following specific questions require follow-up 
action: 
a. How much material has been destroyed by CIA that we 
may never know about? (p. 5) 
b. Why was the Oswald file opened at the CIA 14 months 
after his defection? (p. 5) 
c. Was Oswald in fact a Soviet spy? (p. 5) 
d. Was that picture in his [Oswald's] file that was 
thought to be him, was that an error? Or was there 
something involved in that you can shed some light on? 
(p. 5) 
e. [W]hat consisted of new information [in the Oswald 
file] that the public had not already had in its published 
files somewhere? (p. 14) 
f. [W]ould the establishment of such a panel of 
outside experts [by DCI, to review redactions in the absence 
of legislation] ... violate the Privacy Act? (p. 16) 
3. I assume CSI, in coordination with appropriate 
components, will take the lead on all questions except for 
the last. I understand OGC will take the lead on the 
Privacy Act question. (Note: OGC advises that the issue of 
why Oswald's file was not opened for 14 months after his 
defection is addressed in the Findings and Recommendations 
volume of the HSCA Report at pp. 200-202.) I appreciate 
your assistance in preparing proposed responses for the 
record.
