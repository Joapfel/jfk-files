IIBMORANDUM FOR MR. .ROSTOW 
SUBJECT: Meeti-ng of the Task Force on Viet Nam on June 19, 1961 
Intelligence Briefing 
Among the interesting items reported in the intellige~ce 
briefing was a r~sponse from Embassy .Saigon on the Cambodlan 
border problem .... Embassy Saigon did not agree with the view of 
Embassy Phnom Penh ~hat this is an insignificant problem. At 
present; Saigon ·repqrts·, ·cambodia is used primarily ·as -:a safe 
haven by guerrillas in Viet Nam rather than as an area from 
which operations are mounted. The Embassy provided specific· 
information on VC-·activlty in Cambodia which, it suggested, 
should be shown to Sihanouk. There was also a report that the 
Indian member -of ··the ICC ·has stated in the ICC that that· body 
should investigate·· subversion.· This was said to have • caused 
the .-Polish m·ember -to ask for· a recess of -the· .ICC in order to 
permit him to prepare a ·reply. •. (This report, if confi"rmed.-,.· is. 
.in line with ~n earlier·TDCS indicating that instructions 
. along these· lin~s had goz:ie· to _the Indian· meinber of the. rec.·). 
It was also rep_orted that on _Fric,lay there may have· been a 
clash between :Pathet' Lao and .South· Vietnamese fo·rces just· in­
_sfde ~os • on the highway connecting Laos .and .South Viet ~am •.
