and the Government of Cuba over the lease of Guantanamo 
I 
Bay. So serious was this issue in fact, that the 
Agency agreed 
that. all Cubans participating in over­
flights of Cuba would be told that Guan­
tanamo Naval Base was not to be used as 
a safe haven, and that if they landed 
there, they would be turned over to the 
Cuban authorities. 107/ 
The•Guantanamo Base also presented a major dif­
ficulty for t.he Department of State. Evidence of this 
surfaced in early October of 1960 when it was reported 
that during a meeting of the State Working Group on 
Cuba a: suggestion was put forward that the us try to 
influence Latin American nations to ap~rove US reten­
tion of the base. One proposal had been made that 
this be done through the Inter-American Defense Board 
(IADB), where a resolution apparently was about to be 
introduced asking for a definition of the relations 
betweeri Cuba and.the USSR, with the expectation that 
' this might force Cuba's resignation from membership 
on the. IADB. According. to Col. John F. Mallard, the 
Agency's. liaison officer with the State Working Group: 
In addition, State desires that the 
IADB, make some statement on the impor­
tance of Guantanamo Bay to Latin American 
hemisphere·defense. This statement would, 
in effect,· give Latin American approval 
to U.S. retention of this base. 108/
