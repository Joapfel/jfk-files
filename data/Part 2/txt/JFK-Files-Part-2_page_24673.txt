Mr. O'Donnell: I told Mr. Bissell that I 
would be willing to go down to neutralize 
his activities and operations and try to bring 
him out [of UN custody] and turn him over to 
the Congolese authorities, that is correct. 
Senator Mondale: Has it discussed then that 
nis life mighfoe taken by the Congolese• 
authorities? 
Hr. O'Donnell: It was, I think, cons.idered

rule it out .... There is no questibn about 
it, he said, I wouldn't rule this other out, 
meaning the elimination or the assassination
