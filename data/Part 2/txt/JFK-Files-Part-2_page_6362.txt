Subject: OGC' s comments on proposed JFK regulations . 
Bob's comments should be included in our response to 
the Board, however, not as he has recommended. The language 
and tone is very different and does not inserted well into 
existing text; I think his comments will work better as a 
separate paragraph or as an addendum.
