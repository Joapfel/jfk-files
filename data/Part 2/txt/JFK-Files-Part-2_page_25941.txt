cncr to a national organization in the Mafia. ,Vas it referred to as 
such? 
:Mr. Bnowx. This is the information as '\Vall has reported that it 
consisted of anal ional board. 
-Senator l\fos1rn•:. Do you know who he identified as members of the 
national board 1 
Mr. Hr:owx. ·well, .Toe Profaci and Vincent Mangano were two of 
the members of the national board. • 
The CnAIR;\IAN. They are shO\,n to be leaders of families, both of 
them. 
Senator MusKrn. But those same people are leaders of families in 
New York as test i ficcl by Valachi. 
.:\fr. HnowN. Yes,sir. 
The C11A1r:::1rAN. So it is yonr impression that the heads of the New 
York fam~lics ma<le up a national board. that had jurisdiction over 
Tampa, among other places? 
.:\Ir. B1wwx. That is correct; yes, sir. 
·wall declared that there were approximate1y 40 members of the 
l\Ia!ia living in the Tampa area and he believed tha.t Trafficante's 
share of proceeds of their gambling operation "·us being <livided with 
other members of the Mafia. 
Information in 011r filrs from another confidential source confirms 
'\\TaJl's statement. In addition it rernals that Antonio Dieciclne made 
,, annual trips to Miami for the purpose of renting a house for Vincent 
l\Iangnno, who came down from New York eYcry year to spend 2 or 3 
months in Miami. This somce statccl that many important members 
of the l\fafot Yisitcd l\Iangnno in Florida, but that Traflicante never 
appea1'cd. 
Senator l\h,sKII·'.. l\fay I ask another question on the national board? 
'\Vns it your impression thnt the national board members shared in 
tlrn proceeds of the criminal acti,·ities in Tampa? • 
_,, Mr. I ~now:-.. Yes, sir; they had a percentage. 
Senator l\h;sKm. Harn you any idea what that percentage wasi 
Ml'. Bnowx. }fo, sir; I Imm no idea. 
The gray shadings on our chart depict the influence of each of 
these 1:1011. To me, it appears to Le 110 small coincidence that in 
T:imp:t the Dieci<lue fomilv lost stature from at lrast the early 1950's 
"·hen Vincent Mangano disappeared; nor that TrafTicante, Jr., the 
Profaci man. was in the immediate vicinity, when Albert Anastasia 
"·ns mmclered in Hl57. 
Sergeant do la Llnna's intelligence unit has· prepared summaries of 
the men in Trnfficantc·s organization, along with a commentary of 
rclf'vnnt facts abont rach of them. So that oiir information may be 
arnilablc not only to the subcommittee, but to all police units to whom 
your reports are so valuable, I wish to submit these summaries and 
commentru·y for the record, as onr f'xhibit 3a through t; and exhibit 4.

2\fr. O'DoNXELL. Chief, as I nnderstnntl it, these are summations, 
very hrief summations, of the Hl imlividnals that are on the chart 
insofar as their criminal activity, their mode of business, their crim­
inal history,etcctern; is that correct? 
l\fr. HnowN. That is correct.
