RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D . .:.Ark.) and Senator Roman 
Hruska (R. -Neb. ) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of 
wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H. R. 5037 in Committee.· 
They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will 
have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President. 
ORGANIZED CRIME : 
As of September 7, 1967, there were a total of 382 individuals, 
involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted, 
or awaiting further prosecuti ve action in connection with violations of 
various Federal statutes. 
By letter dated July 2 7, 19 67, the Bureau called to the attention 
of the Attorney General a: situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York 
for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive 
action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive 
action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals 
would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime 
field during the present fiscal year. Td date no response f ram the Attorney 
General has been received to this communication. 
The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of 
achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in 
organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already 
awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily 
available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the 
earliest po~sible date by the Department.

their political affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order
