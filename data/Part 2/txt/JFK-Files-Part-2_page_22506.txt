. On 21 June 1957, Harlan A. Westrell, Chief} SRS, re­
quested the Director of Security for authorizatidn to con­
tinue the Daily Worker indexing project for one year which 
had yielded approxim2tely 500,000 names in the index. On 
22 August 1957, Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, 
requested and received, such authorization for circa 
$10,000 from the Deputy Director of Support. 
During this period (1956-1959), Wiley worked with 
Herbert Philbrick on a book which Philbrick was preparing 
entitled ".The Most Dangerous Group in the l'lorl<l." Be also 
was "building his cover" as a newspaperman and had n:.11T.crous 
contacts with Earl Browder (ex-chairman of the CPUSA). 
From 5 to 19 January 1959, Wiley made a fact-finding 
trip through the J'>lid-West and the Southeastern states of 
the U.S. contacting newspapers, "conservative" individuals, 
police agencies, and information repositories to determine 
the extent of their information concerning Communism and 
the Communist movement. 
During the summer of 1959, SRS initiated and completed

This, unlike the -Daily Worker index, was a study of the 
various issues for information pertaining to Communists 
and radical organizations and individuals. Don Ingles, 
Wiley's cousin, conducted the study and was paid for his 
time. 
Financial records indicate that the indexing project's 
gross funding from March 1956 through May 1957 was Sl0,000. 
Out of that amount, Wiley was given $8,600 in salary and the 
other $1,400 was for expenses. The same total amount was 
approved for the period June 1957 through May 1958 and was 
expended as follows: $7,900 for salary payments and $2,100 
for expenses. A like amount ($10,000) was set aside for 
the period June 1958 through June 1959 and expended at the 
rate of $734.17 per month in salary payments and the rest, 
$265.83, in expenses. 
In connection with the in<lex, Wiley was also given 
specific requests to compile reports on several individ­
uals and organizations ~hlch were of peripheral interest.
