to the White House and other interested agencies c9gcerning 
the plans of captioned organization, a nationwide group of 
women who are opposed to the war in Vietnam, to stage a 
demonstration in Washington, DoC. on 1/15/68 and present a 
petition to Congress demanding an end to the Vietnam waro 
This demonstration was held as scheduled on 1/15/68. 
The demonstrators marched from Union Station to 
Union Square at the foot of Capitol Hill by way of Louisiana 
Avenue. The group was preceded by several individuals 
carrying a banner which read "End the War in Vietnam and Social 
Crisis at Home." Several women followed the marchers 
carrying another banner which read "United States Women 
Unite, End the War in Vietnam." Initially, the group carried 
other placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats 
Imperial Margarineo" However, at the request of authorities, 
these placards were discarded. / • )

Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a ~1<:;./ 
delegation of 15 women, including Je~nnette Rankin, drove 
to the Capitol where they presented a petition to 
Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and to Senator Michael Jo Mansfield. The 
petition entitled "A Petition to the 90th Congress" pointed 
out the opposition of women of the United States to the 
ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistantneglect to 
human needs at home and demanded Congress as the first order 
of business resolve to end the war in Vietnam and immediately 
withdraw all Americrutroops. It called for Congress to use its 
power to help a sick society at home, to make rep~~ationsfor 
destruction in Vietnam and to listen to what the American people 
are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military 
industrial complex. . -y ,7;-:-1/7-:~7,:_
