I'm not trying to twist your testimony, I know you referred 
to the basic purpose being to keep tabs on what was going on 
so you would be aware of what Alpha-66 and groups like that 
were planning, but in-general, they were the eyes and ears of 
the Station in tha Cuban community and might come up with 
counterintelligence information as well as the information 
about the activities? 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir, yes, sir. 
Mr. Wides. And as you understand it on a smaller scale, 
this was also true with regards to the group in New York? 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Wides. It was not simply to find out about Alpha-66, 
but they would also report to the extent that they obtained 
CI, that is counterintelligence information, about the Cubans 
in New York? 
Mr. Sarno. . -
Yes, sir . 
Mr. Wides. What about with regards to the activities at 
th~ UN? Any reports regarding UN activity relative to Cuba? 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. 
Mr. Wides. Was there a Cuban mission at the UN at this 
time? 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Wides. And this group never relayed any information 
regarding the Cuban mission or the people they contacted in 
New York?
