President stated that he was not satisfied with the Ambassador-elect

Senator Russell would expand his Committee to include Fulbright and 
Hickenlooper, and Vinson expand his Committee to include two members 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, that the issue would be put to 
rest. The President said he thought this was a good idea and that he Vv'ml.ld

5 .. l!.then reviewed the brochure on the OXCART by giving the 
President a broad picture of this development. I explained that surfacing 
of it was a problem which had been under consideration by Defense and 
CIA which I had discussed with President Kennedy. I said that McNamara 
was pressing for a rather early release but that President Kennedy 
felt that the timing of the surfacing was of very great importance. I said 
that I felt that the timing was even of greater importance now and I had 
some reservations about surfacing this vehicle in the first few days of 
President Johnson's administration. The President seemed to agree and 
suggested that McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and I meet with him on Friday for 
a discussion of this problem] 
No arrangements were made as to the time of Friday morning's 
briefing.
