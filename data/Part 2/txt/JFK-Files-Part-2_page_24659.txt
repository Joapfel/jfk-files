Whe'n asked his. opinion about the truth of the testimony received 
by the Committee that poisons were delivered to the Congo by 
Gottlieb, who carried instructions that they were to be used in 
·. the assassination of Lumumba, Tweedy replied: 
There.is nothing in my experience with the 
Agency which would really bear on that 
point whatsoever. (Tweedy, 9/9, PP. 39-39) 
Tweedy added that if Gottlieb went to the Congo as a courier, 
"I will bet I knew it, but I don't recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 35). 
Tweedy testified that it was "perfectly possible" for lethal bio­
logical subst,ances to have been sent to the Congo, "but I don't 
recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 30). 
In response to a question about whether he knew about a cable 
. from headquarters informing Hedgman that a messenger was to come to 
the Congo with iilstructions for him,. Tweedy said.that he would be 
"very surprised if I didn't [know], but I certainly have no recoll­
ection of it whatsoever (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 31). 
Tweedy said that he "was not going to gainsay" the testimony of 
the Chief ~f Station that a cable was sent to headquarters through 
a special channel requesting confirmation that the instructions 
were to be carried out but he did not rec al 1 it (1\•1eedy, 9 / 9, pp. 
32-33). 
Tweedy commented that rather than questioning the truth of the • 
testimony of ~he Chief of Station,* the discrepancies in their 
,'r Tweedy expressed a high regard for the general credibility of the 
Chief of Sta ti.on. Tweedy said that he never had occasion to doubt 
Hedgman's veracity or integrity, adding; "I would trust his r1emo:ry 
and I certainly trust his integrity.
