for left democratic reform ended. Goodwin professed himself puzzled 
by Johnson's assertion that he had discovered a "murder incorporated" 
I 
in the Caribbean. The only sp~cific instance Johnson ever cited was 
Trujillo, yet Johnson had known about the Trujillo assassination from 
the very beginning and so could hardly have "discovered" it after he

5.· Covert Operations and Counderinsurgency: 
When asked about the Jthos surrounding covert actions during 
the Kennedy Administration, Goddwin responded that the major emphasis 
. I 
' was counterinsurgency, not cov~rt action. There was certainly no 
I 
I 
I 
reluctance to use covert action, but no one believed that American 
1 • 
objectives could be secured th 7ough it. Counterinsurgency was some-
1 
thing different. A good deal of money was spent training police throug 
AID, much more was spent through the Pentagon equipping Latin American 
militaries, and there was as well some CIA activity. At that point, 
the U.S. really believed that the communists could not get elected to 
power and that the threat was subversion. Paramilitary operations 
• were considered by the Special!Group (counterinsurgency). Latin 
American matters were considered there, and in some ways Latin 
America was considered a kind of training ground for Southeast Asia. 
Goodwin believed that in sum U.S. counterinsurgency efforts made little 
difference to the course of events in Latin America. Cuba could not 
in any case provide support to guerilla movements in South America 
without substantial support from the Soviet Union, and the guerilla 
' 
movements that began had little indigenoJs support.
