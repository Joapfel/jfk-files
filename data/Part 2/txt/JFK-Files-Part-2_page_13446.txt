By agreer.1ont 1 the FBI is currently conducting :full field 
investigations rega1"ding SSC staff personnel. These have on.remely 
short (2 w~~k) daadlines wuich are identical ~o those afford~d 
Presidential appointme11ts and are, therefore, given pre:fie1·ential 
treatment ilt opening, assigning, and .following field progress,- ·l'he 
svecial Inquiry Unit of the Employees Sectirity and Special, Inquiry . 
Section, which has n bQnt twice its .normal. Ct4.$0 load,. is h~"ldling 
these requests.. Senator C!1u;:-ch, Ch.airi..unn" SSC, originally estimated 
· tha·t between 35 and 40 staf:f members "Would be sub.'ilittad for in.testi­
gation. As of today, .J!-;.S-75'" w~ hava received re:cr:.xests for 65 such. 
investigations from the SSC and the end <lees .not ~ppear to be in 
sight.. ·r.aey are re1~ei ved in bunche$ ns many us 5 at a· timo,. which 
is not the even :flow ~::..;pected and presents 4n addi·tional b1u-den. 
. In addition it is ~xpected that similar requests will be 
forthcoming in the near futu.re !rma the HSC since we have a similar 
agreement wi 'th. it. Conf.ress.man tl'erlzi , Ch.airman o.f the HSC, has 
estimate'1 1•probs:b1y no more than ao,;:,ut ;:t5 staf:f rJo~bers ,vill be 
hired." It .1·emains t\). be seen if this estir.mte also .falls short of 
ar~tual receirrts. 
Since there is no cha1~0 for these full field investigations 
they will have to be eonaidored in the budget. It is noted tho 
cur.rent charg@ for a tull iield investigation, where applicable, J.s 
$20;?S .. 
ACTIO~: For in:fonJJation. Since it appears the nucleus of thG 
Cor~4ittee h~s oo~n forned~ it is suggested Senator Church bo con­
tacted and queried ret{arding a mo1·e realistic. (~O day) doadline on· 
the rema·ining investiga tio,ns ooncerning ;future sta.tf memoors and 
their roplacgmants.
