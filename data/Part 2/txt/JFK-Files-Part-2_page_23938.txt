the man's fears were well-founded and had promised to seek a 
. * pistol. 
Al though t;1ere is no direct evidence linking any of these 
pistols to the assassination of Trujillo, a June 7, 1961, CIA 
memorandum, unsigned and with no attribution as to source, 
states that two of the three pistols were passed by Owen to 
Lorenzo ''Wimpy'' Berry, a United States citizen who was in direct 
contact with the action element of the dissident group. It 
should also be noted that the assassination was apparently con­
ducted with almost complete reliance upon hand weapons. Whether 
one or more of these .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistols 
eventuallv came into the hands o.: the assassins 
and, if so, whether they were used in connection with the 
assassination, remain open questions. 
Both Dearborn and Owen testified that thev regarded the oistols 
as weaoons for self-defense purposes and they never 
considered them in any ~1ay connected with the then-current 
/ 
assassination plans. (Dearborn 7/29., p.70; Owen, pp.3.8,73) 
However, none of the Headquarters cables inquired as to the 
purpose for which the handguns were sought and Owen's cable 
.stated only that Dearborn wanted them for passage to dissidents. 
(Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61) Indeed, the March 24, 1961, 
*Dearborn is clear in his recollection that he asked Owen to 
request only one pistol. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp.30,31) Owen, 
on the other hand, testified that if his .cables requested three 
pistols for Dearborn then Dearborn must have asked for three 
pistols. (Owen, p. 72) 
The pistols were, however, apparently sent in one package 
(HUS to Station cables,3/27/61 and 3/24/61) and Dearborn testi­
fied that, what he believed to be the one gun, came "wraooed 
up" and that he passed it. , .. (Dearborn,--7/29,p.30) -·
