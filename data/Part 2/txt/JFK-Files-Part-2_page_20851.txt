ourselves not only as your supporters, but as sisters in a 
revolutionary struggle for the liberation of all people. 
nwe are becoming women of the revolution, working 
in our own way to stop the bombs from dropping in your land, 
at the same time that we work to build day care centers, health 
clinics, and a whole culture that will come from and respond

and brothers the depth and strength of our love and solidarity.
