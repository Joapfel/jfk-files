4. In addition to the "category II" items, there are 
a number of additional subjects largely geographic in nature 
for which the DCI feels CIA should assume respo~sibility 
for preparing comprehensive papers. In view of the 
apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select 
Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation-, it may 
be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with 
specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency 
probing and result iri a positive solution to problems before 
they aris~. 
• 5. The Chairman reminded· the group of the responsibility 
• which exi.sts to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department 
informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga·­
tions whi9h will clearly impact on his agency's affairs. At 
present, the cross-agency character of.the interviews no~ 
under way indicate a possible communication _gap in adequately 
coordinating on postal matters. •

late May to separate the responsibility for· CIA's response

bilities of the IC Staff. Both Dr. Clarke and Mr; Elder 
emphasized the·very close relationship which exists in the 
two efforts. Mr. Elder will represent CIA at all USIB Ad 
Hoc sessions henceforth. 
7. The Chairman questioned Mr. Elder, the CIA repre­
sentative, whether or not the Senate Select Committee- had 
yet furnished the Agency with a list of subjects with which 
they.plan to deal in depth. Mr. Elder reported they have 
not yet done so, but it is apparent that three items are of 
·priority interest at the moment: assassinations, the Phoenix 
program, and covert action; that-it appears clear the Committee 
i~- currentiy pursuing the questi~n of authorities, approvals, 
and support from other agencies. •
