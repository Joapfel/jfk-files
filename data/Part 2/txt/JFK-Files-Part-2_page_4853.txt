believed them. Or everybody in the Red Cross is a CIA agent or 
everybody who is an academic from wherever is a CIA agent. And 
pretty soon, you know, everybody is a CIA agent. One of the 
problems I th.ink Casey had with the Congressional Hil 1, and 
again this is sitting from the outside, is he kind of gave them 
the back of his hand, which automatically creates an • 
adversarial situation. I don't know how much time he spent 
wining and dining th~m. I mean, having them out to breakfast. 
I remember Directors like Allen Dulles or Dick Helms or McCone 
and others used to have members of Congress up there on the 
Agency top floor at the dining room where they had lunch, or 
breakfast in the Director's dining room. And, .you know, tried 
-
to talk to them man to man. And tell them a thing or two that 
they'd want to know and ask them questions. And try to work 
out some kind of dual relationship without having them become 
co-equal managers. That's the big problem. I've got no 
objection to telling a guy who is an elected Representative of 
the United States, if he is one of a handful of people picked 
by h1s colleagues to be privy to all the ~ecrets they need to 
know to help run the place, within limits, without 
micro-managing the thing. Yeah, bring them into the thing. 
Te 11 them a thing or two. Try to teach them what it is a 11 
about and why it is important that they keep their bloody 
mouths shut.
