Cray said that shortly after the BERLIN TUNNEL, Eisc1;hower said, 
"I want the 54/12 co,rnnittce to consider any action that irnph1ges upon__ _ .... 
the sovereignty of another country. II 't( (\.:,r·:) c~? {(.~; l ::r \r' J i

Gray said that in almost every case, a proposed covert action would 
have been discussed with the State Depa:rbnent and would have been staffed 
out before Special Group meeting. "Most of the rest of us did not have a chance 
to reflect before.the meeting." 
Gray said that during his tenure, there was no chainnan of the 54/12 
(Special Group). But perhaps Merchant conducted the meetings. 
Gray said that during the transition to the Kennedy aclrninistration, he 
asked McCeorge Bw1dy to promise him that the Special Group would not be 
washed out. Gray explained that the Special Group v;as necessary for the 
protection of the President. TI1e Special Group discussions _allow the President 
the chance to know in advance about actions which are potentially embarrassing 
to him. TI1e President's representative to the Group (Gray, then Bw1dy) has the 
right to object to an action and take it up with the President. TI1e President 
has a chance to h_71ow about everything that goes on in the Special Group, and 
through his Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, the President ,,,ould 
have a chance to say ''no" to a proposed action. Gray said that the presence 
\ 
of the Special Group hould protect a President from op9rations such as assass-
inations. 
3. "His Associate": 
Initially, Gray did not recognize the phrase used by Pa_rrott in the 
Special Group minutes "Mr. Gray's associate" or "liis associates". Gray's 
first reaction was that "his associates" would probably refer to- members 
of his NSC staff.
