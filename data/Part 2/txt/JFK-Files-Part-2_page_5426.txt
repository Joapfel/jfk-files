We also believe that the Agency still is not providing the type of evidence that will be 
the most convincing to the Board. Where issues exist that the Board has not yet 
addressed, and where the Agency would Uke to see postponements upheld, specific 
information must be provided to support a postponement. General stateinents, while 
useful in identifying the underlying issues involved, do not provide the Board with the 
complete knowledge and understanding of the issue that is necessary to make an 
informed judgment regarding release of the information. • • 
The Board is looking forward to receiving the OA's evidence iri support of the 
postponement of true names. As you know, we have planned for some time to devote 
_ the December (12 and 13) meeting to this important issue. 
' Additionally, you will find .enclosed with this letter the next in our series of information 
requests, covering boxes· 7.-9 of the Oswald collection. We are submitting these requests 
now in an attempt to give HRG as much advance notice as possible of which records we 
will be reviewing for·the January 4 meeting. Evidence for records to b~ reviewed 
January 4 should be provided no later than December 13, 1995. 
We hope that during HRG's review of the.January documents, the standards outlined in 
this .letter will be kept in mind. If at any point an issue is deemed 8<? sensitive that a 
briefing is required, ARRB staff will meet with you at your convenience. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
