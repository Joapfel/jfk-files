March 1966 
AccorclTng to a sensitive source, 
~ ( [ rom un iden t 1 f ied sources in ~fos cow): NOSDH:O, 
wbo \;las ncl personally known to.,,tllffll. was an important~Source 
boss in the KGB. When NOSENKO was a young man, he was in 
the GRU Military Academy and was then sent to the GRU 
Information Department for a short time; in all, perhaps 
for a year. NOSENKO had been a very undisciplined person 
while in the GRU an<l "not very good". He was to have been 
discharged from the GRU; however, his father, who was a very 
influential person in the Ministry of Shipbuilding, was 
able to et NOSENKO transferred to the KGB. It was the opinion 
of persons to whom talked that NOSENKO had given 
very, very good information to the U.S. after his defection 
and that NOSENKO had had great access to KGB information 
which included all means of KGB coverage of people in 
Moscow, microphone systems in the embassies, etc. Based on 
NOSENKO's information the American Embassy found many of the 
microphones.
