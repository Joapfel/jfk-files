Do you remember the story of the fox 
and the grapes? illustrating a principle of 
such timeless value that the phrase "sour 
grapes" has been used and understood by 
millions of people for 2000 years? 
Well, why not make a collection of 
ideas and principles of common sense and 
wisdom - and why not illustrate them 
with fables, allegories, and anecdotes of 
enormous impact? 
That was the plan of this book. 
It cx>mes right out of our work on the 
"Notebook on Common Sense and Wisdom. 
Elementary and Advanced" - which we 
have been talking ab.out for two years to 
anyone who would listen. 
Some of the issues of the Notebook 
roused the interest of the president of 
Quadrangle Books - and this book is one 
of the results. 
You can't lose by taking a look at 
this book: 
• You might enjoy it. 
• You might find much of it 
humorous and imaginative -
as did Aesop's listeners. 
• You might find it instructive, 
philosophical, worth thinking 
about, and more besides. 
You can see it, read it, keep it for 
7 days, return it, and back comes the 
full price of the book. "
