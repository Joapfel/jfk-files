Hr. Tweedy. Yea, I know that. Thia ia the one we dis-
cuaaed tvo months·ago and thia happens ail the time. 
Mr. Baron. We are referring opecifically to QJWIN's 
report that"WIROGUE had offered him SJOO per month to par­
ticipate in intel net and be me.m.ber•.--t am sorry -- •member 
'execution squad'•. 
Mr. Tweedy. Yes: I remember all of thie aa a result 
of your having previously brought it to my attention and I 
recall it, it was a typical example of an agent or asaet 
tull of piss and vinegar exceed!ng his briof and he waa 
certainly put back on the track very early on. 
Uut in this business do not confu9~ oxecution sc1ua,I 
with anything to do with tha assassination of Lumumba or any-
thing else . It had nothing to do with that. 
Mr. Aaron. You are saying even though you would 
assume that Mr. Hedgman's testimony about poieone coming to 
the Congo and instructions to carry out an aesaseination 
coming to the Congo was true I the approach that WI ROGUE made 
to QJWHJ was probably not a part of that mission. 
Mr. Tweedy. rt was quit~ specifically not a part of 
that mi as ion. There wa~ a chl"pter of accidents. You have 
seen it haJ,pcn, I have seen it happen, ~ thousand times be-
fore, two people who arc r~riphic.-'llly involv~d in the same 
thing ~nrl run into each• ·.er nnJ one ~m~lls something on the 
other.
