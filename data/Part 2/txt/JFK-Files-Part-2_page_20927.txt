~'F~tC, NEW YORK {100-172487) 
• A~OMEN Is BAIL FUND 
IS - REVACT ;/ 
/ (00:NY) 
Re New York airtel and LHM, 8/28/72, and captioned 
as above. 
On 11/28/72, ~ 7.~15~ advised the Women I s Bail Fund 
(WBF) is not a leading e emen~ and lacks any influence in the 
movement in New York City. 
A review of the subject file discloses there is no 
$·tructure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who 
belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main 
purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail. 
It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted 
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the 
lack of political direction of the WBF and would like to turn 
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other 
direction. There is no indication that this has occurred, and ~ 
the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded (~ • 
individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for. . 
various purposes. Because of its lack of common political dir- : \ 
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in/ 
the movement. 
In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi­
gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent 
information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected 
as a structured group for a common political and ideological 
p~rpose.
