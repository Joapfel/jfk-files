This sentence was a sequel to J convers,,tion we had 
.,cld on a rm.:vious evening and which had turned i~to 
,,n all-nignt session. To.be precise, it lasted from 101in 
:he C\'ening until 4 in the morning. A good part jof 
the talk revolved about the impressions I recount;eJ 
to him of an interview which President Kenne'.dy 
1;ranted me this last October 24, and about. Fi~el 
Castro's reactions to these impressions. During this 
nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself ic,f

both the American· coMinr,1;1-':s~achievc this goJt, a_. 
lc,1der would have ·:o arise in the l.inited States c.z..pable 
of u1~derstanding the explosive real:ties of Li.tin Amer-
ica and of meeting them h«lf\\'av. The;1 suddenlv he 
had taken a less l~ostile t.1ck: "Kcn:,ed; could still be 
this man. He still has the possibility. of becoming, 
in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the 
United StJtes, the leader who may a.t I.1st understand 
that there can be coexistence between capitalists and 
socialists, even in the _Amcric.1s. He wo~ld then be 
an even greater President th:rn Lincoln. I know, for 
ex.imple, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a mJn you 
can t,1lk with. I ha.ve gotten this imprcs~ion from all 
my conversations witf, Khrushchev. Other le.1ders nave 
,1%urcd me that to ,1ttain this go,11, we must first await 
his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible 
for everything, but I will say this: he has come to 
understand many things over the piist few months; 
,md then .too, in the last ,malysis, I'm c,rnvinced tl1Jt 
anyone else would be woi-se." Then Fidel h.1d Jddcd 
with ,1 bro,1d and boyish grin: "If you sec him ;igain, 
you can tell him that I';,:,;,~ng to declare Goldw,1ter 
my friend if that will gu.1r.rntee Kennedy's re-election!'' 
This conversation WJS hcid on November 1.9. 
Now it was ncarfy ; o'clock and· we got up from• 
the table .1nd scl tied ourscl ves in front of J. r ..1Jio. 
Comriundant VJ.llero, his physician, aidc-de-ccimp, .1nd 
intinute friend, WJ.S easily .1ble to get the· broadcasts 
from the NBC network in Miami. As the ne•.vs came 
in, Vallero would tr.1nslate it for Fidel: Kennedy 
wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder 
of a. policeman; fin.1liy the fatal announcement: Presi­
dent Kennedy is dead. Then Fidel stood up and said to 
me: "Everything is changed. Everything is goi:16 to 
chJnge. The United States occupies such a position in 
world afL1irs that the dcJth of J President of th.1t 
country affects millions of people in every corner of 
the globe. The cold war, rrbtions with Russia, L.1tin 
Amcric,, CubJ, the Negro question. , . ,ill will h.1ve to 
be rethought. I'll tell you one thing: at least Kennedy 
w,,s zi:i enemy to whom we had become Jccustomed. 
This is a serious matter, an extremely serious matter.'' 
After the qu.1rter-hour of silence observed by .111 
the American radio stations, we once more tuned in 
on l'vliami; the silence had only been broken by a re­
bro,idc.1sting of the Amcric,rn nJ:ional anthem. Strange 
indeed was the impression made, on he.1ring this hymn 
ring cut in .the house of Fidel C.1stro, in the midst of a 
circi.• of worried faces. '
