on marginal or non-relevant information. •• 
* On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective 
way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a 
large project. Without the DO's JFK team on site it would 
have been impossible to complete the JFK project. 
* Develop guidelines and processes for coordinating Third 
Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do 
not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies' 
FOIA offices without this advance discussion. 
* Maintain written,up-to-date, project-specific 
declassification guidelines. This is no small task. A 
"declassification guide" ·must be flexible; no guide can 
anticipate all the issues which will arise in-a review. 
After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines 
in the last month of the project. 
* In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do 
a thorough, professional job as required by the project 
activities (see Unrealistic Deadlines above). 
* Ensure we have adequate support people for routine 
processing tasks; declassification involves both tough 
substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing. 
* If possible, inventory/index all materials before the 
review and P+Ocessing begins. Experienced indexers are a 
must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key 
part of any inventory or index.
