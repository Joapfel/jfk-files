Onder such circumstances, the Warren Commission's Report would have been""'~ 
subjecced to reevaluation even if it had been compiled perfectly. Furthermore,' 
because che Warren commission labored at the height of the Cold War;~n,o the 
Commissioners adopted a strategy that depended on implicit public trust. The 
Cold War environment combined·with other circumstances to handicap tlie·Warren 
Commission and eventually. to erode that public trust in five significant ways.

First, the Commission had acceH to an enormous amount of information not 
otherwise accessible to the American press and public. n41 This ·information was 
secret, top secret, and beyond, much of it compartmentalized cryptologic and 
signal intelligence material dealing wich t:.he Soviet Union,.CUl)a, and other 
foreign governments, such as Communist China. n42 Because of the enormous Cold 
war paranoia, as well as the requirement to maintain tight secrecy around the 
sources and methods used to collect t_his infomation, the Commission could not 
argue its case fully to ebe American people. When the research community 
asserted that the government itself had been im- [•8] _. plic:ated in the 
a,sassination, n43 the evidence that the Commission had used to discount such a 
possibility was available only eo the government charged with having abetted the 
crime. The cost of secrecy was uncertainty, an uncercainty that turned to 
cynicism, rnuch of it based on the~ries about.the assassination that gained 
.legitimacy simply because they could not be tested againsc the appropriate 
evidence.
