that the Special Group wriuld not have expected assassination 
activity to come under this particular policy. (Helms, 7/18, 
p.21). And with respect to the Special Group Augmented's desire 
to "keep its hands tightly on preliminary actions" leading 
towards sabotage and other actions beyond intelligence collection, 
Helms stated that was the kind of injunction "that appears in all 
kinds of governmental minutes of me~tings.'' (Helms, 7/18, p.17). 
Helms said he regarded these as "general injunctions: rather than 
an "all inclusive injunction" to keep the Group informed pf all matters. 
(Helms, 7/18, -.17). 
Helms said hi recognized, however, that there were limits on 
permissible activity during Mongoose.!:_/ (Helms, 7/18,p.9). Thus, 
Helms ~;tated that although there were "no limitations" on actions 
to refuove Castro during Mongoose, there were restraints on sabotage 
operations and he did not understand the absence of specific limitations 
to authorize more drastic actions, such as committing the U.S. military 
to an invasion of. Cuba. (Helms, 7/18, p.9).

*/ Helms testified, that although. loss of u\ was implicit in the

"I think there was an effort made not to take tacks 
that would recklessly kiil a lot of peopl~ and not 
achieve very much. I think there was an effort, if you 
had a sabotage operation, not to throw a lot of h~nd 
grenades into a city, but rather take out the power· 
plant which would actually damage the economy of the 
country. There was an effort made to find devices that 
would seem to ha~e a useful end. (Helms, 7/17, p.63-64).
