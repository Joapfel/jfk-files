27 March 1963 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
1. The Dominican Republic in 1962 and 1963 
arrested 120 persons for sabotage, terrorism, or 
other subversive activity. Of these, 45 were held 
for an appreciable time, tried, or sentenced. This 
includes 33 who were deported. Of these, three are 
known or believed to have received training in Cuba. 
2. There were 15 incidents in all, five of 
which are considered to have been inspired by Cuban 
trainees. The remainder were caused by people not 
believed to have had any Cuban training. 
3. There is no hard evidence of legal or ille­
gal travel from the Dominican Republic to Cuba since 
1 January 1962, although some of the deportees may 
have returned from Europe to Cuba. The best avail­
able estimate is that about 25 Dominicans may have 
gone to Cuba illegally. We have.an unconfirmed re­
port that three Dominicans went ~o Cuba for guer­
rilla training, and 12 others a~e believed to have 
stayed long enough for appreciable training or in­
doctrination. 
4. Individuals in positions of influence, 
known or believed to have received training in 
Cuba,, include: 
Juan Ducoudray Mansfield of the Dominican 
Communist party. 
Rafael Faxas Canto of the leftist 14th of 
June· group. 
Gustavo Machado Baez, director of the 
Agrarian Reform Institute (rumored to have been 
trained in Cuba, but we have no previous traces.) 
Labor leaders Jose Estrella and Jacobo 
Armach. 
Student leader ·Luis Gomex Perez.
