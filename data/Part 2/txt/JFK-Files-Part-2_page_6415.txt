Gentlemen: 
The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to 
• declassify approximately 147 records previously flagged by the Joint Staff from both the 
JCS Central Files, and the papers of JCS~-~~, Taylor~ Wheeler. The 
files date principally from the period 1961-64. The records were flagged during

understandµ,g or context of the assassination of President Kennedy. A description of 
the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities l'elated to Cuba, or to Vietnam

numerous military entities in these papers, as well as equities of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, the State Department, the National Security Council, and others.
