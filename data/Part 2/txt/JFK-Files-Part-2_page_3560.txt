since breaking off formal diplomatic relations have become 
alarmed by the realizati9n of.the extent to which they depend 
on their sugar imports from Cuba and the. dislocation which 
the loss of these imports would entail, probably will give 
the Cuban delegation a sympathetic bearing. Nevertheless it 
is unlikely that Rabat will agree at this time to return.an 
ambassador to Cuba or to disavow publicly its renunciation of 
diplomatic ties so long as Cuban troops remain in Algeria. 
On 21 November, Rabat instructed one of the junior members 
of ·its embassy who had remained in Cuba when the ambassador 
departed to remain at his post until he had closed out all 
financial dealings with Cuban banks, etc., and to forward per­
tinent documents on his activities to Morocco's Permanent· 
Mission to the UN• Two days later the secretary general of 
the Moroccan Foreign Minis.try cabled Havana that his government 
was inclined to receive a Cuban good-will mission. (NSA,
