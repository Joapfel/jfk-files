_confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information 
and that we will not disclose their identities without theit

· · · A third change makes it possible for either the _ 
• Attorney General or the Director to certify :that an individual 
. • is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure 
would be detrimental to the national security. The prev_i ous 
draft required that t'1iis certification be made by the Attorney 
General and we consider this ·preferable. If the head· of the 
inv·estigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data 
and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to 
have an opportunity to confront ,the ·source of that data,· this 
pr~cedure may be critici2ed both by the-public and the courts. 
This matter was discussed with the Department by }lr. Belmont 
at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General 1s Office on 
August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical 
standpoint and the standpoint of the Supreme Court, 
certi/icati on concerning the need to protect an informant's 
, identity should be made· by the Attorney General in the case 
of the FBI or the appropriate department head in the case of 
other investigative agencies. 
The fourth change clarifies the authority of the 
department head to deny or revoke access to classified data 
without regard to the balance of the Order. Although the 
previous draft granted this aut}iori ty, the new language is an 
improvement as it r_emoves all p·ossible doubt as to its meaning. 
Our observations concerning the four changes, as 
l 
summari2ed above, -were forwarded to Assistant ·Attorney General 
Yeagley by memorandum dated February B, 19&Q.
