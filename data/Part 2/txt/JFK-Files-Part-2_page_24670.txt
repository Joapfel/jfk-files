(ii) 
~r6bably shortly after the Chief of Station's cable of 
October 17 requesting the assignment of a senior case officer to 
~oncentrate on the assassination operation, Richatd Bissell broached 
'the subject with CIA officer Justin O'Donnell. 
At th~t time, O'Donnell was the Deputy Chie1 of a com­
ponent of the Directorate of Plans -- the CIA's covert action arm 
O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 8). 
Justin O'Donnell testified that in October of 1960, he 
was asked by Richard Bissell to undertake the. mission of assassi­
nating Patrice Lurnumba (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 11,-12; .9/11/75, 
pp. 19, 43): 
O'Donnell: Ile called me in and he told r,1e 
ne-\vanteo to r;o down to the Jelgian Cono;o, 
the former Del3ian Congo, and to eliminate 
Lurr1umba .... 
Q: What did you understand him to mean by 
eliminate? 
0 'Donnell: To kill him and thereby eliminate 
ri1s-rnITuence. 
0: What was the basis for your internreting his 
remarks, whatever his precise language, as 
meaning that he was talking a½out ass2ssinatiorr 
rather than merely neutralizin~ him through 
some other means? 
O'Donnell: It was not neutralization . 
cTearrythe context o:: our talk ·was to till 
him. ~O'Dorinell, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12.) 
O'Donnell reacted strongly to Dissell's instruction: 
I told him that I wou.ld absolutely 
have any part of killing Lurmrnba. 
I want you to go over and talk to 
Gottlieb. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p.
