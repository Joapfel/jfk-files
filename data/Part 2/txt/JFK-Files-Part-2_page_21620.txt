Mr. Phillips. There is no question that I could under-
stand why anyone concerned with world affairs, looking at 
Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned. 
Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that 
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32 
years beforehe was elected. 
Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar­
dent socialist. Before this decision was made I believe that 
we had a visit from a man who had the code name of-ib-1g he 
was a Cuban.intelligence officer.· The Cubans were moving in 
rapidly. The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot 
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the 
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send 
22,000 rather than 400. 
So,I can.understand why they thought this was going, 
in the long strategic sense, in the -long range against our 
interests. But that_ is an assumption. 
It is true that Allende very definitely made it clear 
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ­
ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice 
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to 
Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are 
going to have to use violence. 
I found it interesting to read in this morning's paper 
',
