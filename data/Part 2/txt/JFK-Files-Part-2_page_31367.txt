2. On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of case file 5OD24G-133, of 
which WERBELL is the SUBJECT, revealed the following information~ 
'WERBELL was in the RVN in an unofficial status, with the concurrence of ASD, 
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, to demonstrate a noise and flash suppressor assembly for 
the M-16 rifle, as well as other firearms equipment. He possessed no security 
clearance. He· was to demonstrate his equipment only in the RVN and was then to 
return to the U.S. Upon his arrival in the RVN, he was given a Military Assistance 
Command Vietnam (MACV) Identification and Privilege Card (MACV Form 6) for use 
while in country. The application for this card was filled out by Col WILLIAM M. 
FAGAN, Commander, Det 6, ASD, TSNAB, RVN. The card, to expire Mar 69, was only to 
reflect WERBELL was to have BX.privileges, and no grade or rank was reflected 
intentionallyo The card that was finally issued reflected equivalent rank of GS-16 
and gave WERBELL postal, BX, commissary and check privileges for a period of one 
year, to Sep 690 The application form was adjusted to show this and someone other 
than FAGAN placed FAGAN's initials in the appropriate blocks to obtain these privi­
leges. 
SUBJECT was the individual who met WERBELL upon his arrival in country, and 
who took care of getting his weapons registered in accordance with MACV directives. 
SUBJECT also set up the demonstrations WERBELL was to give. 
At the conclusion of the demonstrations, rather than return to the U.S., 
WERBELL traveled to Bangkok and Korea, utilizing his MACV ID card and dropping 
names of alleged acquaintances of high reputation in order to show his equip~ent 
in those countries. FAGAN obtained the MACV ID card from WERBW.. in Bangkok on 
8 May 69. 
J. On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of 5OD24G-O/86 revealed the fol­
lowing information concerning WERBELL: 
FAGAN advised that in Jan 69, WERBELL stated he had captured weapons he 
wanted to ship back, FAGAN told him he would help through legitimate channels if 
the weapons were for a government agency; otherwise, he would ship back only the 
equipment WERBELL brought overo FAGAN heard no more from WERBELL until early 
Feb 69, when WERBELL stated he was ready to leave and would bring the items to be 
shipped" He was told by FAGAN to bring the items in an open box, which would be 
sealed at the aerial port, 
FAGAN was unable to locate WERBELL after that meeting until 8 May 69, when he 
located WERBELL in Bangkok to retrieve the MACV ID card. WERBELL requested FAGAN 
to ship some gear from Saudi, Arabia, to the U.S. FAGAN again replied he would 
ship back only the original equipment from TSNABa 
The files contained no further information pertinent to the present investiga­
tiona
