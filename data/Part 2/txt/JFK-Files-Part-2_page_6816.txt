You have asked about documents in our possession 
generated by other agencies.\ In fact, much of the material held by 
CIA originated with other agencies or departments. For example, 
in the 17 boxes of Oswald records, approximately 40% of the 
documents originated with the FBI, and about 20% originated 
fr_om the State Department or elsewhere. Our staff is still going 
through the material compiled at the request of the Warren 
Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, 
which incl~des 63 boxes of paper records and one box that 
lJ~) contains 72 reels of microfilm. The microfilms in part overlap 
material in other parts of the collection. We estimate that within 
the 63 boxes of paper records, approximately 27% of the 
documents originated with a variety of other U.S. government 
agencies, private organizations, and foreign and American press. 
Although our holdings do include many documents from 
other agencies, we nonetheless have a substantial collection of .. 
CIA documents that will require a considerable effort to review 
and, as I said earlier, at my direction, this review f9r 
declassification is now underway. A preliminary survey of these 
files has provided us some indications of what they contain. 
Although the records cover a wide variety of topics, they 
principally focus on CIA activities concerning Cuba and Castro, 
Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, and Oswald's subsequent 
activities in Mexico City and New Orleans. They also include a 
large number of name traces requested by the staff of the House
