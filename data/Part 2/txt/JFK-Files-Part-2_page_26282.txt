£• If the proposal ·under !a above_ is not adequate to 
obtain GVN agreement,· we would offer an additional $4-•. 85 
million in piasters. • Thi~ is estimated to be sufficient 
to cover local currency costs in 1961 of the call-up of 
the additional 20,000 men. • 
c. If neither of .the above proposals ~roves accept­
able-;- the tr •. s-.- would· offer· an additional $4.,55 million in 
assistance in 1961.which, if the GVN would accept a.dollar/ 
piaster rate _of 7J, would be ·sufficient to meet the piaster 
cost for 1961.-
·As of yesterday afternoon,-no reaction had been obtained 
from Saigon.. In a long coriversa~ion wi tn Ben Wood·, the -Deputy 
Director of the Task Force, _Thuan was told before he left_ the 
u .. s .. of our offer: under a above. On the basis of this offer, 
he. indicated that he woulcI- send instructions -to Saigon to in­
itiate the ca11.:.up • of the -20-;ooo men, .even in the absence of a 
final agreement.· .This problem, - ·therefore·, seems on· 1 ts way 
to~ard solution.

The Situation in Laos in Relationship to South .Viet _·Nam 
A large part .. o_f: the meeting was devoted to discussion of 
a draf"t -memorandum that Cottrell read to the Task Forc.e co·n­
:taining his i°deas With_ respect to the situation in _Laos.-· ano. 
what should be done· about it. You are generally.familiar with 
his ideas as a result·of your conv:ersation yesterday with him • 
. I aid not attempt to take detailed notes on the memorandum, but 
his proposal runs along the f9llowing· line~. 
Cottrell does not -believe that any arrangement- to create 
··a neutral Laos will"° _be viable.- He does not -believe that we 
-should withdraw in favor of the French ·1n Laos.. The ·French . 
• cannot be depended· ·upon to do a good job and the ree~tabli~hment 
, .of their presence Will be deeply ·resented throughout· the former 
Indo-Chinese states·;· The military-situation in Laos is alarming. 
-The Pathet Lao arei_ now posing a serious threat in southern Laos. 
-Cottrell proposes ·that.· we seize. upon some .plausibl.e excuse to • 
br~ak off_ the Geneva Conference. The failure of the ICC to 
stabilize the situation would provide such_ an excuse. ·He would 
then introduce Thai· special forces and ".hunter-ki;Ller" forces 
now being ·trained :'in South Viet Nam into southern' 'Laos in an . 
effort to clean out the Pathet Lao "infection'-' there. In the· 
discussion of his proposal, _the question was ·:rai'sed· as to. • 
whether the introduction of-U. s. _for~es·wo~l~·not be nece$sary. 
-Cottrell aeknowledged·that this was a real possibility and 
emphasized the importance of our ~ot·1et~ing'our friends.in 
Southeast Asia down by refusing· to: ·use force if that should 
p_rove necessary.
