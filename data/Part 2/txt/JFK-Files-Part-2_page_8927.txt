According to a sensitive - source, 
• N (from conversations with various unnamed KGB 
officers NOSENKO knows many 
of the chiefs and deputies of the KG~ directorates and 
department~ at KGB HeaJquarters in Moscow, In KGB Head­
quarters th~re are (our separate dining rooms for personnel 
wl\o work there; one such dining room is reserved for chiefs 
and deputies of departments. B~cau~e of this fact, NOSENKO 
has a vast knowledge of the hierarchy of the KGB. 
Comment: NOSENKO never referred to the dining rooms 
until the January-March 1965 interrogations, 
when he volunteered that he had eaten occasionally 
in the "chiefs' dining room",
