his inner office, his dining room, his office· in East 
Building, and his study at his residence on White Haven 
Street. I do not know who would be willing to_ raise such 
an issue, but knowledge of such operations tends to 
spread, and certainly the Agency is vulnerable on this

11. Also under the hea~ing of old business, I 
well remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl
