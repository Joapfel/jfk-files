Dear Mr. Sprague: 
November 15, 1976 
I would like to be considered for a staff position either on the 
full committee or the two subcommittees that you intend to set up 
to probe the Kennedy and King assissinations. Enclosed is my resume. 
I would hope that my knowledge of the Hill and the working press would 
prove helpful. 
I am available for an interview at your convenience. 
Sincerely, 
~It~
