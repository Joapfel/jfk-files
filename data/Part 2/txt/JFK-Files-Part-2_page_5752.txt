Re: CIA Compliance With the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 
Dear Mr. McNamara: 
I am writing to address the completion ofCIA's outstanding obligations under the 
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 
2107 ("JFK Act"), including submission by 0A of a Final Declaration of Compliance 
certifying, under the Act, its work to identify and release records relating to President 
Kennedy's assassination. As we have advised CIA previously, the Final Declaration 
will constitute CIA's-representations, under penalty of perjury, regarding disclosure of 
. its records relating to the Kennedy ass$Sination. . 
Accordingly, set forth below is our understa,nding of (1) the status for completion of 
CIA's work under the JFK Act and (2) the form and content of CIA's Final Declaration. . . 
A. Completion of CIA's Work Under the JFK Act 
1. Processing: of CIA Assassination Records·by Septem,ber 1998 
We confirmed with CIA that it intends to place into the JFK Assassination Records 
Collection ("JFK Collection") at the National Archives and Records Administration 
("NARA"), by Septemb_er 1998, all identified assassination records except certain 
documents confirmed by the Review Board staff as being duplicates, which may be 
processed later.1 Thus, CIA commits to placing the following assassination records into 
the JFK Collection by September 30, 1998: 
1 In addition, some peripheral documents may be processed after September 
1998, but only if identified beforehand to, ~d approved by, the Review Board.
