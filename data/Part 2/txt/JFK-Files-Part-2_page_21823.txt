it, you said the only penetration was forrpurposes of finding 
out about exile activi~ies being planned against Cuba. 
What was your testimony with regard to the use of~ 
for members of the Cuban community who might come under 
suspicion as possibly being intentionally or unintentiona1ly 
Mr. Sarno. Suspect? 
Mr. Wides. They were employed or they were not employed 
in any way regarding checking on this? 
Mr. Sarno. If you mean to say did they go around and 
surveil them --
Mr. Wides. No. In any sense of counterintelligence 
work, keeping their ·ears open and reporting back information 
that might be of a suspicious nature. 
Mr. Sarno. Well, to explain it, if an were to walk 
into a place and see a friend and the friend says did you see 
Juan, do you know Juan is here, and the'9 himself knows and 
the guy he's talking to that Juan used to work for the Internal 
Security in Cuba, it's obvious. Where's he at, try to find 
him. 
And then they would go back to th~ files and dig out all 
the information and in would come a report. Juan is in the 
city of Miami and here's the stuff that we have on him. He 
was a Castro collaborator, or he's a member of :the security 
forces over there, and everything. 
Mr. Wides .. So in.general it would be fair to say -- and
