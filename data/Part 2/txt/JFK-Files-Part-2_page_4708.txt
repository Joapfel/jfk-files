INTERVIEWER: And how about the comment I had read earlier that Helms was 
betrayed by Nixon, that if Helms had gone along on Watergate and all that type 
of.thing he would have kept his job? 
MR. HALPERN: Well, that sounds, it's a plausible theory, but I don't thi.nk 
so. l•don't th.ink i~ was in the cards because my own feeling is that Ntxon 
was ready for a change, and he was ready to just clean house. Because look .at 
\' 
the rest of his changes 6n personnel throughout the gov~rnment after the '72 
election. I mean, it was just all those crazy things. He just felt he wanted 
to have.a new team. I personally don.~t think that that would have made much 
difference with Helms. I mean, Nixon and Helms in terms of keeping him on the 
job. I think he was ready for: a new guy anyway. 
INTERVIEWER~ Did you ever hear how Schlesinger happened to be chosen? 
MR. HALPERN: No, I don't know; except that in '70 or '71 he was the deputy in 
0MB and he wrote a directive, well, he wrot~ ~ study and not a directi~e. 
changing the intelligence community relationships and the Director's 
relationships to the intelligence community and therefore I think he was 
considered an expert on the intelligence community and national security 
po 1i cy and so on. And when they were 1 ook i ng for a new boss. T wou 1 d think 
that there he was sitting·over at Atomic Energy which Nixon probably didn't 
know what he was doing over there anyway. And so he did in 1970 or '71, I 
think it was '71. a study and a report and moved him over. 
INTERVIEWER: Had it ever been mentioned that mayb.e he was Kissinger's choice? 
MR. HALPERN: I haven't heard that. I would doubt it. I would doubt it. 
Very much. I just hadn 1 t h·eard that one before. 
INTERVIEWER: .Okay. ·A 11 right. 
MR. HALPERN: That's a new one. I presume some of your other sources
