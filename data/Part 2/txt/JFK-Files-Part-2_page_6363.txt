CSl-0319/95, subject as above, dtd 8 March 1995 
1. The DO concurs in ref comments and would add the following: 
10 March 1995 
10 March 1995 
A Comment Par 2 re Section 1400.2 - para d and e(3) call for "Organizational 
charts. of government agencies" and "Records necessary and sufficient to describe and agency's 
storage facilities and locations". 
Organizational charts of detail are classified and release would have to be 
balanced against DCI mandate to protect such details. 
Description and location of agency's storage facilities are classified-and 
release of such information would have to be balanced against security concerns and DCI mandate 
to protect such information. 
B. Comment 4 re Section 1400.7 - Consideration should be given to protect 
records and files of different time frame not related to JFK where the subject is but a passing 
name or reference. To reveal full records could endanger national security without adding to 
body of information relating to JFK. 
2. Believe these two comments should be considered for inclusion into official CIA , 
remarks.
