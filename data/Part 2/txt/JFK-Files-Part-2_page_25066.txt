!,,fr. Dulles inquired whether lvfr. 1v1erchant wanted. to discuss 
the proposal to dispatch a letter to Trujillo suggesting that the fatter 
retire· from oifice. At Mr. Merchant's request, the DCI stated his 
opinion, which was to the effect that he had considerable reservation 
as to the efficacy or wisdom of such a letter. He said that it 5eemed 
to him much more useful to rnake a personal approach,which not only 
stood a cb.:tnce of being more effective, but also could be dcnieu. 
He pointed out tho.ta personal approach had been attempted some tim.e 
ago, but tbat the individual in question had not been able to carry it 
off. He suggested tha.t the approach might best be made by an 
unofficial American, and that Mr. Pawley would be a be1.ter bet than 
the previous rn~i vi dual. 
1.1r. lv1erchant said that he realized his own name had been 
suggested, and that he was far from enthusiastic about the idea. He 
said further that he has a visceral feeling against asking a Chief of 
State to get out of office - either through t:ne medium of a letter or 
personal contact - particularly when we do not k11ow who rn.ight succeed 
him. Mr. 1v1erchant conceded with good humor the validity of Mr.

Mr. Gray said that he was entirely opposed to having a:1y U.S. 
official sign such a letter. He thcught that an nnofficial letter might 
be a diHerent matter. 
The conclusion of the Group was that it would be worth the 
effort to get Mr. Pawley to attempt a direct approach to the Bene.factor; 
it was noted that the chances of success are perhaps less than even, 
but that no great harm could result. 
There was a brief discussion of developments in the Congo and 
the possibilities of effective action tl1ere. :Mr. Gray sai<l that he 
hoped that Agency people in the field arc fully aware'of the top-level 
feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be arn.i1;s.
