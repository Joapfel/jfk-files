The following grer areas were delineated by Papich: 
1. The question of ·,,hether the FBI should recruit agents in the United 
States for use by the CIA overseas or ~hether this should be left 
to the CIA.

4. 1'.h~ ,qwlll.stion uf who ~i'itH.d.d p·rnvide cover in the United States for 
CIA operations overseas. 
5. The handling of agents suspected by CIA to be Communist agents over­
seas who travel to the United States. 
6. Inadequate communication between the ti-:o agencies in resolving 
bona fides of defectors of interest to both agencies. 
7.. See the subheadings below. 
Papich believes that in fairness to the men in the field a more clear-cut 
delineation of jurisdiction is needed. He did state that from time to 
time documents were put forth by Hoover concerning the FBI' s ju1·isdiction in 
particular areas. Generally such a guideline would be issued following 
a particular flap in an operation involving both the FBI and the CIA. 
Papich could not point to any specific doclliuent but suggested that we 
ask Kelley for this type of infonnation. 
Papich did feel that there were some areas of jurisdiction that were clear­
cut. For instance, CIA is not to investigate violations of the law in the 
United States. However, it is not Papich's opinion that the determining 
factor of jurisdiction is a strictly geographic ·one. (At least i_t shouldn't 
be.) 
Espionage Matters 
Papich felt strongly that the FBI had the responsibility to investigate 
any possible violations of the espionage laws. He could point to no case 
t,'herc the FBI refused to undertake this rcsponsi bi li ty where reasonable 
evidence of espionage existed, even if the suspect was an employee of the J 
CIA. In some instances, the CIA might coce to the FBI with infomation i)>"~(
