individual documents located in other project (example Bay 
of Pigs) or activities. The current automated 
declassification effort under the Ex. Order is setup to 
refer any assassination records to HRG/JFK team. We have 
not done any work on these materials since the sequestered 
collection and specific ARRB requests are our first 
priority. A discussion of the History staff 1 s· 
identification of the Agency's JFK collection followed. He 
would like more information. 
6. Additional questions/issues raised: 
Is there a "records" person at the Agency who can 
address their concerns? 
Gunn ask if he can go to~ and/or other Records 
Centers and look at shelf lists and the files around a topic 
of special interest? 
What is on the shelf lists? Would they say, for 
instance, these are the files regarding .JFK from Sheffield 
Edwards? 
What are the steps taken in a name trace? 
Are records around the specific hit searched? 
Is it possible to provide an explanation of the routing 
indicators in the collection?
