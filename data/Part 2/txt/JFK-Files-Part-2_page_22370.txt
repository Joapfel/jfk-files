Special Activities Staff. It ~as headed by Desnond Fitzgerald. 
And than, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations 
Group. 
Q Now, was this a special group within the □ DO or w2s 
it attached to one of the area divisions? 
A No. Following the Day of Pigs, they created a thing-
called Task Forc2 W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And 
that -- wh~n Harvey left, 
Fitzgerald to8k over, it becane Special Activities Staff. 
It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the 
Deput~ Director, Plans. 
Q And that was Mr. Karamessines? 
A Yes. Well, it was Helms at th3t time back when it 
was first created. Helms was DDP at that time. 
Q And Task Force w was created immediately after the 
Bay of Pigs? 
A Well, not immediately. I think sometime aroun<i --
in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in 
September, something like that, 1961. 
Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities 
Staff? 
A Special Activitiei Staff and consequently becane the 
Cuban Operations Group. As the Cub3n Operations Group it went 
back into the Western llenisphere Division . 
Q And what was the date of that reorganization?
