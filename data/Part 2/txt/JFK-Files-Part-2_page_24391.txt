'U time, how-
ever, the memorandum stated that even in the development of ideas or plans 
for action, it was incumbent upon the Agency not only to coordinate with 
other executive departments and agencies, but also to "obtain necessary 
policy approval" (emphasis added). The issue which faced the Committee, 
of course, was whether such approval was, in fact, sought and obtained 
for assassination plans, and whether CIA officials thought it was "neces­

committee of the National Security Council corrrposed of the President's 
Assistant for National S~curity Affairs, the Directbr of Central In­

State for Political Affairs. Today th}-s group is known as the 40 Com­

of Staffs. In addition, during J962 another subcommittee of the NSC was 
established to oversee covert operations relating to Cuba. It was known 
as the Special Group (Augmented) and was composed of the members of the 
Special Group, the Attorney General and certain other high officials.

be "pro.per" and in the American interest. The Special Group • Chairmc1.n 
usually was responsible for deterrµining which projects required Presi­
