Item No. 22, 28,· 152, 172 MSS pp~ no. 46J 48, 165, 189 
(U) NE Division h~s highlighted these items~ 
(S) Item 22 states in part "A notable example of such 
a 'special relationship' is Ir~n, where a CIA organized coup 
d'etat iestored the Shah to power in 1953. The Shah was 
_understandably grateful ... ". Item 28 lists the Shah among 
other "world leaders with whom CIA has developed special 
relationships" as- does Item 152 and a similar statement is 
made in Item 179. 
(U) Ray S. Cline in his book "Secrets, Spies and 
Scholars," pp. 131-132, states: 
" ... a covert operation so successful that it 
became widely known all over the world was carried 
out in Iran. The Shah, then very young, had been 
driven out of Iran by his left-leaning Premier, 
Mohammed Mossadegh, whose support came from the 
local Communist (Tudeh) Party and from the Soviet 
Union. CIA mounted a modest eff6rt under a skillful 
clandestine services officer who flew to Iran, 
hired enough street demonstrators to intimidate 
those working for Mossadegh, instructed Iranian 
military men loyal to the Shah how to take over 
the local radio station, and paved the way foi· the 
Shah's triumphal return." 
(U) . The Church Committee, Book I, p. 111, briefly 
mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran" 
as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert 
opera·tions." 
(S) There is a vast difference between the classified 
deleted i terns speaking about an active "special relationship" 
with the Shah following the overthrow of Mossadegh and a 
statement about CIA's role in overthrowing Mossadegh. The 
former is still properly classifiable and classified.
