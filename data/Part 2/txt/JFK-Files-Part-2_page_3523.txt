NON-BLOC RELATIONS: 
The Moroccari foreign minister has received a three-man 
Cuban "good-will" mission for the second time and the lstiqlal's 
Nation claims that a resumption of formal diplomatic relations 
is imminent, according to the US Embassy in Rabat (see Daily 
Summary for 29 November and 6 December). According to a semi­
official account of the meeting, .which took place on 4 December, 
the Cubans reasserted their desire to normalize relations and 
professed a lack. of hostile intentions against the Moroccan 
Government-~which·severed formal relations after Cuban "techni­
cians" arrived in Algeria on 22 October. "Informed sources" 
in Rabat claim that the government is considering the Cuban 
demarchd with "attention." The Nation explains that the Cubans 
now recognize that Morocco has not been the aggressor in the 
Algerian conflict and that they are "repentant" over their pre­
cipitous action in aiding Ben Bella. (Am Emb Rabat, 866, 6 De­
