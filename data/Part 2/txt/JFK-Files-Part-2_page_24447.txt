Connell, Maheu, and Roselli 
I 
i:net with Giancana and Trafficante in Miami. Bissell testified 
i 
as follows concerning the sequence of those events: 
"Q.: Well, before we come to the meeting [with Dullesl, 
you had been informed, prior to that, had you not, that 
contact had been made with the Mafia? 
"Mr. Bissell.: I had. 
"Q.: Now. were you informed;that the Mafia had been given 
the go ahead to proceed ~it~ actual efforts to assassinate 
Castro? 
; ~ , 
"Bissell: Not that early, to my best recollection ... 
I canriot date that. at all well. I would suppose that it 
was within the next two or three weeks." (Bissell, 6/9, 
pp. 20-21.)

i . On the· ·other hand, Roselli' s testimony suggests that Maheu had 
! ·. 
indicated prior to the "latter part of September" 1960 that a 
I large sum of money would be paid!for Castro's death (Roselli,. 
l 
I 
p. 17), and Edwards' May 14, 1962 memorandum indicated the 
briefing of "senior officials" took place after the money had 
been offered. 
I It is clear, then, thay even if Dulles was informed 
i 
about the use of underworld figures to assassinate Castro, sub-
. ! 
ordinate agency officials had pr,viously decided to take steps 
toward·arranging for the killingiof Castro, including discussing 
I 
it with organized crime leaders. i
