I i Contracts for fertilizer 
installations, plastics and syn­
thetic plants, petrochemical 
equipment, and mining machinery 
are already in various stages of 
/
negotiation. Officials in Bonn 
report they have under consider­
at;ion a proposal by a West Ger­
min consortium to supply the 
U~SR with $400 million worth of 
petrochemical equipment. A 
/ S~viet mission is negotiating 
I with the British Imperial Chem-
/ ipal Industry (ICI), which here­
• tofore has supplied the USSR I, 
with technical know-how. ICI 
tjeportedly has offered to de­
~iver equipment and processes 
for the production of fertiliz­
Jrs, herbicides, rubber chem­
icals, and plastics. Negotia­
tions also are under way for 
~arge numbers of Japanese chemi­
cal fertilizer plants.

esses, is discussing delivery 
of a large oil refinery. In 
addition, contracts for a wide

equipment will probably soon be

expanded purchases is crucial. 1 
The USSR presumably can generat • 
sufficient funds to meet down 
payments on sizable orders. 
However, credit arrangements 
must be set now to spread out 
the heavy crush of payments 
which otherwise would fall due 
in 1965~66 when equipment con­
tracted for next year will be 
delivered .. Soviet ability to 
increase hard-currency reserves 
is not likely to improve in the 
near future. Moscow's current 
grain imports will reduce its 
gold reserves by 25 percent. 
If these continue beyond mid-
1964, the Soviet hard-currency 
position will be under further 
strain. 
Despite the bleak foreign 
exchange prospects for the USSR, 
Soviet officials appear hopeful 
that Western competition for 
Soviet orders will be adequate 
to foster Western governmental 
and banking opinion favorable 
to more and longer term credit. 
Moscow may also hope that a 
continuation of its relatively 
restrained foreign policy will 
be helpful in this context. 
While viewing the USSR as an 
acceptable commercial risk, the 
banking community has hereto­
fore been unwilling to extend 
credits beyond a five-year pe-
