TO: Mr. Sprague 
FROM: Bob Lehner 
DATE: December 23, 1976 
SUBJECT: Cornish F. Hitchcock 
Mr. Hitchcock is a very bright young man. He 
graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center in 
May, 1975. He then clerked for a Connecticut Supreme 
Court judge for a year .. He did part-time work for 
Representative McKinney and is now working with a small 
Washington, D.C. law firm making $200 a week. 
I was impressed with his willingness to work hard 
and his ability to fend off pointed questions. 
I recommend we take him.
