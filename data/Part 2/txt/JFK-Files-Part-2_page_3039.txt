Director of Plans, forwarding a program having as its

one year, and his replacement by a junta f'.riendly to 
the United States which will call for elections 6 
months after assumption of office." To achieve this 
objective, Chief, WH/D put forward a program, to in~ 
elude among other items the following: 
1. Clandestine radio attacks on Cuba, 
from liberal Caribbean countries. 
2. Intrusion operations against Castro's 
TV and radio, to be mounted from within Cuba. 
3. Formation of pro-US opposition groups 
to establish by force a controlled area 
within Cuba.

disappearance of Fidel would greatly ac­
celerate the fall of the present govern­
ment.* 45/
