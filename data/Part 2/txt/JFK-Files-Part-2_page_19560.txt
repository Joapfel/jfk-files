WAGE GARNISHMENTS 
1. GET A LAWYER IMMEDIATELY if your wages are garnished. 
The Seattle Legal Services Center.provides lawyers for people with· 
low incomes who qannot afford to pay for a lawyer. A similar ser­
vice for low: income workers is provided by the Tacoma Le.gal Assis­
tance Office, 1501 South 11M11 Street, Tacoma. 
2. DO NOT GO TO COURT ALONE and do no~ call the creditor 
w_i th out legal advice, or they may help you to confess judgment 
against yourself; and you can lose your wages and your case with­
out·any evidence or trial or opportunity to testify. Do not sign 
a confession of judgment without your lawyer's advice. 
3. DO NOT IGNORE THE ACTION or a default judgment may be 
/.-,'7entered against you without your knowledge. Your lawyer can pre­
