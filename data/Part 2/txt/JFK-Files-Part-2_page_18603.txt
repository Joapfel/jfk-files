Any leads for purpose of checking ·background of potential sources 
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention a,.nd results submitted by 
_teletype. 
In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau, 
your attention· is directed to over-all need for additional informants and 
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained 
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved 
in developing Dominican sources· through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program -over the past several years. • : • 
In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each 
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substanttal 
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the 
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage 
sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature, 
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data 
·.:·.-:·~·-concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field 
·i ·tJs considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be 
overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development 
program. . ~---
