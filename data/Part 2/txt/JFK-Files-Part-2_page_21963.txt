'i , At about 7 am that· day the group that intended to kidnap General 
Schneider met to discuss last-minute instructions& According to the 
findings of the Chilean Military Court which investigated the Schneider 
killing, neither the Army~ or the Navy were there. 
Shortly after 8 am,General Schneider's car was intercepted, on his 
way to work, by the abductorsand he was mortally wounded when he drew 
his handgun in self-defense. The Military Court determined that hand 
gunahad been used to kill General Schneider, although it also found 
• that one unloaded machine gun was at the scene of the killing. 
The first Station reports following the Schneider shooting said 
"Military Mission sources claim General Sch=ider machine gunned on 
way to work" (Santiago 587, 22 October) and "Assailants used grease 
guns." (Santiago 589, 22 October) The submachine guns had previously 
been described as ''grease guns.'' Thus the initial reaction of the Station 
was that Schneider had been shot with the same kind of weapons delivered

Headquarters "Station has instructed(Col. Wimer~ to hand over $50,000 
if Gen. Valenzuela requests" (Santiago 592, 22 October), thus indicating

shooting o·f General Schneider on October 22 were part of the Viaux-led

In June 1972 General Viaux was convicted for complicity in the plot 
culminating in the death of General Schneider. He received a 20-year 
prison sentence for being "author of the crime of kidnapping which re­
sulted in serious injury to the victim," and a five-year exile for con-
spiring to cause a military cu Also convicted on the latter charge
