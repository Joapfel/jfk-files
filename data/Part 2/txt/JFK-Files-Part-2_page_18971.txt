During the interview on. 3/27A-69,· JAFFE was adviged 
that iritervievring agents -were concerned regarding a number of 
aspects of his relatior:iship_with the Soviets and th;e FBI. For 
example, it ·was noted he had now disc1ose,d <::onsiderable additional 
information about his relationship ,;,rith 11Slava 1~ more than· 
previously; that because of his pa~t relationship~with Agents 
of the :t'ITO, the FBI had a right to expect that he would make 
i1mnediate full disclosures of such relationship and his failure 
. to do so raised m1estions about the rele.tionship, ,;-1hether he ~ '1- ' , 
has been recontacted by KGB since he left Russia, etc. It alsd•'~ 
was pointed out that his expulsion from Russia after he had /' 
been order,ed to Hong Kong and his replacement named, seemed ~ (.....; 
somewhat suspicious, particularly since he had been warned that

defector had in fact reported this relationship and alleged . 
that he had been an agent of and furnished information to 1ts1ava 11 •

3/27/69 on his relationship with KGB and his failure to make II!... 
complete disclosu1~e to }?BI, he offered the lame excuse, his V 
fear of ns1ava 11 , but conceded this was a poor excuse for not 
reporting the relationship after his return to the United States.
