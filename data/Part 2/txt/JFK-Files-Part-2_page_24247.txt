_) As to the issue of safeguards against misuse of F"'°Jec. t funds • 
or insider informat~on by the· Agency, the Chief CCS has told the 
Cormnittee that compJr~mentation, the honesty of the Chief of_CCS,. 
and display of the 4ortfolios .to appropriate congresSional commit-
tees are what have prevented or will prevent such abuse. 
Houston agre~d with the three safeguards outlined by the CSS 
Chief. However, he added a f~urth; 
When we were investing in stock, I would have the 
list of stock·, the portfolio, reviewed by our con-
tract people, and if I found we had any contract 
relationship with any of the companies involved, we'd 
either refuse to -- Well, a couple of times our invest­
ment -advisor recommended a stock which I knew we had 
big contracts with, and I told the board no, this in­
volves a conflict of interest. We won't touch it. 
And if we had anything from the Agency contract office 
that indicated a relationship, we would either sell 
the stock or wouldn't buy i~. 
Houston believes that "the ui1111ple.1' should continue in some form. 
One reason is that "assets are· few and far between.

The acquisi­
tlon of a board of ·directors, the establishing of accounts, basic 
credibility and relations with t~e jurisdiction in which the entity 
is located are not easy things to do according to Houston. This 
creates the "tendency, once you've got something that looks good, 
to hang on to it." He would recommend in this regard that the 
Agency be constantly forming new companies and phasing ou~ old ones 
on a rotationa1 basis so that the same complex would not remain 
for security reasons.
