propaganda including radio and publica­
tions and the paramilitary effort. Again 
he .pointed out that this is an expensive 
program running to approximately $28 
million. Mr. Dulles.discussed the radio 
effort and paramilitary effort in some 
detail, indicating the numbers of Cubans 
being trained and the supply efforts and 
the bases. 34/ 
Because of the subsequent charges which_ would 
be made by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and 
others writing on the Bay of -Pigs, it is important 
to emphasize that among other CIA personnel attend-
ing this briefing was Robert Amory, Jr., the Deputy 
Director for Intelligence, who, according to Schlesinger 
and some of the later "experts," was supposed to be 
in almost total ignorance of any planning for an 
operation such as took place at the Bay of Pigs.* 
* Other Agency personnel in attendance at this brief­
ing were General CabellJ DDCI; Colonel L. K. White, 
Deputy Director for Support; Richard Helms, C:hief of 
Operations for·· DDP; ·Emme·tt Echols, Director of Per~onnel, 
and John Warner, Legislative Counsel. It also should 
be noted that Mr~ William A. Tidwell, Jr. of Amory's 
office was appointed in January 1961 to be Chief of 
the. Office of Operations.in M:iami. 35/ Organizationally 
at this time, the Office of Operations was under the 
Deputy Director for Intelligence. In view of ·the 
efforts being made in the Miami area to recruit Cubans 
for training in the exile Brigade, itis inconceivable 
that Tidwell and the Deputy Director for Intelligence 
were not fully aware of the·plans that were being made 
to unseat Castro until after the invasion had collapsed 
at Playa Giron ..
