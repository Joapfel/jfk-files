Special Group, t~e subcommittee of the National Security 
. .,. 
Council responsible for plann'ing covert operations:· Thomas 
Parrott, a CIA officer who served as Secretary to the Group, 
began the meeting by outlining .the CIA operations that had 
been undertaken in "mounting an anti-Lurnurnba campaign in the 
Congo" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60). This campaign involved 
covert operations through certain labor groups and "the planned 
attempt •. · . to arrange a vote of no confidence in Lumumba" 
. 
in the Congolese Senate (Speciil Group Minutes, 8/25/60). 
The outline of this campaign evoked the following dialogue: 
The Group aiieed that the action contemplated is 
very much in order. Hr. Gray commented, however, 
that his associates had expressed extremely strong 
feelings 6n the necessity for very straightforward 
actioTI in this situation, and he wondered whether the 
plahs as outliried ~ere sufficient to accomplish this. 
Mr. Dulles replied that he had taken the comments 
refirred t6 seriously and had every intention of pro­
ceeding as vigorously as the situation permits or 
requires, but added that he must ne.cessarily put himself . 
in~ position of ~nterpreting instructions of this kind 
within the. bounds of necessity and capability. It was 
finally agreed that planning for the Congo would not 
necessarily rule o~t 'ccinsideration' 6f any particular 
kind of activity which ~ight contribute to getting rid 
of Lumumb:a. (Special Group Mi,nutes, 8/25/60, p. 1.) 
Both Gordon Gray and Thomas Parrott testified that re·fer­
ence to Mr. Gray's "associates" was a euphemism for President 
Gray, Special Assistaht to the President for National Security 
Affairs; Livingston Merchant, Undersecretary of State for Political 
Affairs; and John N. Irwin II, Assistant Secretary of Defense. 
Also in regular attendance was Thomas A .. Parrott, Secretary to 
the Special Group.
