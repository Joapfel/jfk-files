DO Response to Board Request C!A - 16 
Oswald Pre-Assassination Files 
The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO 
records to determine if there were any additional files 
containing pre-assassination records relating to 
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald 
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The 
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian. 
CIC has confirmed that all CI.Staff holdings were 
in~orporated into the 201. 
Prior to establishing a 201, any .documents received 
would _have been placed in an operational interest file. 
We found no reference to the existence of an 
operational file. If such a file had existed, however, 
it might not have been reg.istered in the central i,:idex. 
It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the 
documents from an interest file would be transferred to 
the 201. 
Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL 
operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a 
file on him. We destroyed all of the In'LINGUAL files 
under court order, and no record was-. made of what files 
existed. We did not review all of the DO record system 
to destroy all copies of material which may have been 
derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for 
instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to 
Oswald in the HSCA sequestei::ed collection 
-
In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the 
information we are aware of that we had prior to the 
assassination:
