The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions 
of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives 
at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that 
these materials were deemed to be.absolutely essential to our 
complete understanding of the King investigation. As you are 
aware, several other documents previously provided to the 
Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison 
as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to 
King, and it would appea~ that the withheld portions of 
Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter 
described above, would contain the detailed bases for such 
conclusions. 
I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts 
concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our 
responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's 
activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would 
appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including 
your own examination of the three docl.ll~ents in question, and 
hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should 
be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except tor the 
names of so-called 11live 11 informants). 
An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I 
would hope you can respond by the end of the week. 
Sincerely,
