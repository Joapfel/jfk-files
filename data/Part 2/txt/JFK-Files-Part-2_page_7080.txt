DCI Sources and Methods Autt~rity With Respect 
to JFK Assassination Records 
1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the 
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of , 
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprir.te.d.-at 
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note. For ycur convenier.ce, I have higtligr.ted 
the pe~tinent provisions that will aid in res;~ndi~g to a~ 
inql.!iry regarding the statute's ef feet on the DCI' s statut.ory 
aut~o~:.:y to protect intelligence sources and methods.

discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and mettods

information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively 
supersedes the DCI 's National Security Act authority with respect ✓ 
to :n:elligence sources and ~ethods infonnat:.~n subject to tte 
ARCA. 
3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the 
release of information may be •postponed.• The statute 
contemplates that all information will eventually be released. 
Ind~ed, it specifies that all infonnation will be made available 
to t-he public no later than 25 years after the passage of the 
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president 
certifies that continued po~tponernent is necessary. ARCA 
§ 4(g) (2) (D). With respect to intelligence-related information, 
ARCA allows postponement if: 
11 (1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is 
of such gravity that it outweighs. the public interest, and 
such public disclosure would reveal--
