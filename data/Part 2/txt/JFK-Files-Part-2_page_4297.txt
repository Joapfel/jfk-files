MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 15 August 1963 
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone. 
Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Cheever were present for Items 1, 
2 and 5.C. 
Dr. Whelan, Colonel Ledford, and Mr. Cunningham were present 
for Items 3 and 4. 
1. A Non-Violent Program to Inhibit Free World and Neutral Taade 
with Cuba 
The operational proposal dated 12 August, was approved by the 
Special Group, with the two changes in wording made by the State 
Department. Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that to make tl;lis operation 
convincing, a ''big bang" on a Cuban ship will be carried out before 
the operation is implemented. He further pointed out that in paragraph 
2.a. of the paper, the reference to "real ••• sabotage" applied to 
Cuban shipping only. Item 2.c. in the operational proposal was thought 
to be of low priority and is to be placed at the bottom of the list. 
2 .. Cuba - Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups 
Mr. FitzGerald recommended that the paper dated 13 August be 
submitted at this time for dis.cussion only rather than _decision by the 
Special Group. This reconanendation was made because the members of 
the Group had not been given sufficient time to study the proposal. 
The paper had been presented in hasty fashion because CIA had received 
reports that the exile group in question was beginning to scatter and 
prepare for an operational program not influenced by CIA. 
There was some discussion of the effects of using a British 
island for launching these operations and as to the desirability of 
striking Cuban shipping on the high seas. Decision on this operation 
was deferred until the next meeting.
