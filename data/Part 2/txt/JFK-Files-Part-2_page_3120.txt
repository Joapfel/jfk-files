The President concluded the meeting, by 
saying that he would like to urge caution

on 17 August 1960, Gordon.Gray noted that in discuss­
ing the CIA meeting planned for 18 August, that in 
addition to Messrs. Dulles,and Bissell, a third CIA 
officer might possibly be in attendance; and he also 
.noted that -the Vice...:President had been invited to at­
tend the briefing. According to Gray's record, how­
ever, neither the Vice-President nor the third C~A 
"representative were in attendance at the briefing of 
18 August. The attendance of the Director and Mr. 
Bissell, but with no CIA representative from WH/4, 
was further illusfration of Jake Esterline's criticism 
that at too many high level briefings, CI.A's repre­
sentatives were individuals who, high ranks notwith­
standing, were the furthest £rom the operation -- yet 
they were responsible·· for informing the nation's policy­
makers about the details of the anti-Castro program. 94/ 
It is also interesting to note that this off-the­
record meeting which was arranged by Gordon Gray lasted 
only 23 minutes, and this included at least a short • 
time for a brief discussion related to Francis Gary· 
Powers. 95/ •
