Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOr.JESTIC 
INTELLIGENCE JV:lATTEns

In summary, ij: is premature to say that the First A1nendment 
line of .cases, dealing- ,vith the "chilling-" concept offers any substantial 
impediment to our intelli~·ence investigations. There is less reason for 
optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. \Ve 
should be prepared, therefore, to meet ar 6ii.unents regarding the need 
... for outside supervisiGn. -The sound ::msv:er, which should satisfy 
governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tlght internaj. 
controls and carefully developed guidelines. ·
