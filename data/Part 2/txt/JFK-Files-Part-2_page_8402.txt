B. Curriculum Vitae (Chronologically by year from birth 
to present.) 
Jesus' youth was that of a normal middle class Cuban. 
The fat her had a small farm and from ~he .. profits gave his 
family a comfortable life. • They were not, however, • rich 
or from the upper crust of the social ladder. Jesus' 
sister said "we had everything we needed. We were middle 
class Cubans, not rich, but not poor." Jesus was a student 
during the Batista era before Castro. He did not have to 
work; he just asked father for his expense money. Sister 
thinks Mercedes was from a middle class family. (UFAA 2430, 
22 October 1970) 
Apparently in Havana, then Paris, Havana, Mexico City. 
See Job history. Some question whether they went to 
Prague, when, why, and for how long, possibly this was 
after Paris.
