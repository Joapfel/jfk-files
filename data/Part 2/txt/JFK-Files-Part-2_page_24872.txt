available to the Ambassador four hours before it took place, 
and suggested that Lodge not change_his plans to go to the 
United States on October 31. (I.G., C, p. 37; Pentagon Papers, 
p. 219.) 
On October 30, Lodge reported to Washington that he was 
powerless to stop the coup, and that the matter was entirely 
in Vietnamese hands. General-Harkins disagreed and cabled his 
opposition to the coup to General Taylor (Pentagon Papers, 
p. 220). A cable from Bundy to Lodge dated October 30 expressed 
White House concern and stated that "[w]e cannot accept conclu­
sion that we have no power to delay or discourage a coup" 
(Cable, Bundy to Lodge, 10/30/63). A subsequent cable on that 
same day from Washington instructed Lodge to intercede with 
the Generals to call off the coup if he did not believe it 
would succeed. The instructions prescribE!d "strict noninvolve-
ment and somewhat less strict neutrality". (Pentagon Papers, 
p. 220.) 
Late in the morning of November 1, the first units involved 
in the coup began to deploy around Saigon. The Embassy was 
given only four minutes' warning before the coup began (MACV 
cable to Joint Chiefs of Staff 8512, 11/1/63) .. An aide to 
Don told Conein to bring all available money to the Joint 
General Staff headquarters. Conein brought 3 million piasters 
(Approximately $42,000) to the headquarters, which was given 
to Don to procure food for his troops and to pay death benefits
