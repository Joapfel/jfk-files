Women's National March 
on the Pentagon, Apri1·10, 1971 
Reference is made to New York memorandum 
dated March 16, 1971. 
On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished 
reliable information in the past, advised that on March 22, 
1971, a "Committee for April 10 11 held a meeting at the Law 
Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which 
was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned that a 
woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington, 
D.C. working with others there to arrange permits, speakers, 
et cetera, for the women~ march on the Pentagon on April 10, 
1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit 
for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon, 
than from the Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that 
no permit had been obtained as yet. It was pointed out that 
a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was 
preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers 
en route to the Justice Department than from marching 
from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated 
that no buses had been chartered at NY, but:it was hoped that 
15 buses would be needed.
