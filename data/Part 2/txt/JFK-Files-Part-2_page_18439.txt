Within the Committee mandate, contained in 
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the 
intelligence cormnunity which we are required to investi­
gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti­
mately to. decide whether to make recommendations for 
leg;isl·ati ve or other changes. _They are: 
f 
1 .. The structure, performance, and utility of 
government operations with respect to intel­
i~gence activities. 
2. Whether certain policies or practices are 
or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise 
improper. 
3. ·Whether there has or has not been excessive 
duplication or inadequate coordination be­
tween and among intelligence agencies and, 
more generally, the efficiency of intelli­
gence activities. 
4. Whether there has or has not been adequate 
internal and external control and oversight 
over the policies and practices of intelli­
gence agencies. 
ln attempting to find the answers to these funda­
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways. 
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as 
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the 
authority for particular functions, the problems which 
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce:... 
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been 
proposed.., approved, executed,. evaluated, arid terminated, 
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve 
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of 
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in 
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves­
tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion 
of other cases that would give added insight into intelli­
gence matters under your jurisdiction.~ ) These specific 
subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the 
scope contained in the more general questions.
