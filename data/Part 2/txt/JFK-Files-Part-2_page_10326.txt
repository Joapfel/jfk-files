MEMORANDU'.·1 FOR: 0/DDI 
.,· ·.,•·:-
SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs 
-1. '!'his r.1eraorandu:n responds to the_ DDI 's 
request for a listing of any question~ble. 
involvements in do~estic affairs, I do not believe 
that CRS is doing anything ·t:ha t a reasonable 
man could construe as improper. 
2. ens. _does, of course, have several programs 
to acquire ntill pictures, 1.1ovies, videotapes 
and books- either privntely, se:cretly or \without 
acknm-:lcdqc:---ient th,1t CIA is the actunl end user. 
CRS is regularly .involved with Customs in looking 
at the content of film cans nciclressed to the 
Russian E~bassy in Kashington. Custo~s occasionally 
also provides access to oUicr filn from denied 
areas. It 1:my be ,tcldres5ed to private: citizens 
01.~ organizations or other e::mba!.:sies. These efforts 
are aimed at acquisition of poiitivc foreign 
information. 
3. CRS files do not genarally bear on U.S. 
citizens 01; organiza.tions. The biographic fiic;.. 
building criteria $pecifically excludes u~s. 
nationals unless the person has becone of such 
major importance in the political life of a foreign 
country that tho file is. essential. {To my knowledge, 
• only 2 persons so qualify, One i~ ·the wife of 
the opposi_tion len<ler of Guy.aria . and the other. 
is Hope Lang .. Our Cuban files probably include 
some persons who are now u.s. citizens but we 
have no way to separ • .:i te ther.1; we have files on 
U.$. defectors to_ Cuba.)
