Incoming cable #36017 from Mexico City dated 
9 October 1963 
Outgoing cable #74830 to Mexico City dated 
10 October 1963 
Incoming cable #47041 from Mexico City dated 
24 October 1963 (no mention of Oswald). 
Question 4: (U) To the.extent that Counterintelligence 
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination 
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices 
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination. 
In answering this question, please make appropriate 
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB) 
and to any other materials (including organizational 
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and 
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have 
maintained such files. 
Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on Lee 
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during 
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in 
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the 
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts. 
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the 
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution 
. of these reports. In the beginning this material was 
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of 
documents on this person increased, a separate file was 
created to be the repository of information on the alleged 
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors 
File that a separate file exists on Oswald. 
(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of 
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D. 
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre­
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a 
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of 
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the 
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing 
of this information.
