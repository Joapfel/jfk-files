he'intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-
tacts of t_he newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources 
of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they 
received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom we re identified; 12 s ~nators 
and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members, 
of whom 11 were identified; 16 government employees, including a staff 
member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an 
Assista.nt Attorney General, and other well-placed ind_ividuals. A number 
·.o! other sources were partially or tentati'vely identified, but ·the short span 
o! the activity precluded positive identification~ It was observed that through· 
these contacts the newsmen actually received more clas~ified and ofiicial 
data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen· 
for release, ·establishing that many "leaks'' appearing under other by-lines 
were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.-
