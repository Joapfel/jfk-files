CONSIDERATIONS 
Possible future use 1n com1nunications and support. 
Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose 
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions 
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train­
ing are for resistance activities, •the task of recruit­
ment and training will be much less difficult than if 
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes 
only. 
There are "colonies" in Washington, D. C., and other 
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church, 
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties 
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential 
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail­
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this 
e[fo rt. ) 
As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CIA will activate 
other interrogation centers as f)rOmptly as feasible. A 
center is being activated in~ Negotiations with 
local authorities are being undertakJn to activate centers, 
if possible, i San
