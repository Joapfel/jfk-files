d. This Communist effort is 
aimed at discrediting the post-Diem 
regime before the new leadership is 
able to get its feet on the ground 
and capture the loyalty and respect 
of people in the provinces. 
e. Although the Viet Cong still 
continues to draw its main streng:th 
fro~ local recruiting, a steady stream 
of cadre and training personnel con­
tinues to make its way to the-south 
from North Vietnam along the Laotian 
border. 
f. We are now reasonably sure 
that at least 784 ~ersons infiltrat~d 
from the north during 1963 and the 
actual total may be much higher. 
a. There have been no further 
developments in.Soviet preparations 
for a series of extended range ICBM 
shots to the Pacific. 
b. We probably should have had 
by now an announcement closing an area 
roughly 500 miles south of Johnston 
Island to shipping. We suspect the 
Soviets may have delayed it in order 
not to appear to be rattling rockets 
immediately after President Kennedy's death. • •
