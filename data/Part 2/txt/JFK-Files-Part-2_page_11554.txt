During the first contact,. t. ,n,terviewing Agent 
will introduce himself as a Special Agent of the 
FBI by use of credentials or badge· and will open 
the conversation by using an appropriate prete~t 
or by reciting the Bureau's responsibilities in 
the security field and asking the subject wh~ther 
he can be of assistance to the Government. If the 
·individual has been a member of a basic revolut.ionarv 
~rganization and indicates he might cooperate, he • 
may be questioned during the initial contact about 
his own activities in order to further ascertain 
the extent to which he will cooperate, This 
original interview is for the sole purpose of 
allowing the Agent to determine whether the 
individual being interviewed might be cooperative.

interview with prior Bureau-authority has previously
