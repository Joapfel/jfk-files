I was a regular visitor to·washin(Jton, but alwa 
-:-··· .• 
one or 
two days at a time when there was always a full ag • da of events 
l to be discussed that related to the Station in Miami. I did not 
l carry here, I did not engage, you know, in idle conversation wit 
my associate5l. Therefore, I was not aware of the ·firsthand 
situation of how they conducted business on a sus~fined basis 
on items that did not immedhtel;· impact on Miami.·I

Mr. Daron. Do you have firsthand knowledge of any operatic 
run out of Florida·with CI1\ involvement that could e construed 
as an assassination effort? j· 
Mr. Halley. No, I do not have any firsthand • owledge. 
t You also hav~ to put this in a historical perspective. In 
I other words, from what I have read in the Press sin~e then, 
obviously I could put certain things toget-.her.

Mr. Daron. Exactly.
