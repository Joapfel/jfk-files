Further Information obtained fTom George Brewer 
(See February 18 Interview) 
On Monday, February 24, I again spoke with George Brewer in the Commission 
offices from approximately 9:00 am W1til 10:1!:i am. The following additional 
information was obtaiQad. 
Technical Operations 
In 1960 and 1961, Brewer was prir1ary involved in Bay of Pigs operations (pro­
viding support to the a.ami Field Office in smuggling frirndly Cubans into the 
United States). He was engaged in little technical activity during that time. 
Between 1962 and 1965, he was involved in approximately 30 technical operations, 
only four of which wer~ telephone taps (the rest were mike and wire ca:;0s). 
During that same perio-1 four or five other support agents were also engaged 
in technical acti vi tie::, each performing approximately the same amount of tech-
nical work that Brewer was rforming. Some of the agents doing technical work 
were Jack Cryer, H·a1. tl f-b and Bill Simpson, the latter being a former in-
structor of Brewer's. Bot ryer and Simpson had b.zen doing technical 11orl: for 
quite some tirr.e (throughout the 50 1 s). ~ ( 11:,1-s2)

taps with out c0..11·t order or with out approval of the A ttcrney Gener-al in security 
cases, technical 1v0rk performed b)' Brewer and others at the Washington Field 
Office almost stopped completely. Brewer can recall only two taps that were 
placed during that period. One of these \vas placed in a Safe House in the 
11/ashington area, and the other was placed in a New York apartment in connec:-
tion with Project PARAC-ON. Brewer assumes that the appropriate approvals were 
ob~:ained prior to his placing the~e taps. {~ { 11 'I rJ - 4 8) 
Most of the technical operations in the early 1960 1 s were performed at the re­
quest of the Operations Directorate. While Brewer was not privy to the purpose 
for each technical operation that he performed, he believes that many involved
