TESTIMONY _OF C. DOUGLAS DILLON 2 
T P SECRET 
Mr. Baron. And are you aware that you may cease answering 
questions at any point to seek advice of counsel? 
Mr. Dillon. I am glad you have so notified me. 
Mr. Barori. And are you vuluntarily appearing here today 
without counsel? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I am. 
Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that you have all of your 
constitutional rights intact here before the Committee, 
including your Fifth Arnentment rights? 
Mr. Dillon. I am glad to know that. 
Mr. Baron. Mr. Dillon, could you please give the 
Committee a general idea of your position in the Government 
from, say, late 1959 until March of 1961? 
Mr. Dillon. In late 1959 I was Under Secretary of State, 
which was the number two position in the State Department. 
And I continued in that position until 1961. 
My duties as such were two-fold. One was the position as 
the First Deputy to the Secretary of State, and Acting 
Secretary in his absence from time to time, in which capacity 
I had to be fully aware at all times of moreorless everything 
that was in the ken of the State Department, so I could fill 
in for the Secretary of State as necessary. And in those 
days the Secretary was absent a good deal of the time, because 
there were travels abroad, and various reasons. I think I 
mentioned in my affidavit that I think I served as Acting 
Secretary at least a third of the time during that period.
