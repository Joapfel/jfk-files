STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
ROBERT s.-'McNAMAI{::A/,'I;Q2'THE PERMANENT 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 
U. S. SENATE 
13 March 1963 
Mr. Chairrnan, I am grateful to this Committee for having granted 
my request of 9 March that I be afforded the opportunity to present my 
views on the development of the TFX concept and on the selection of 
General Dynamics Corporation as prime contractor for this versatile new 
addition to our Defense arsenal. 
My decision in November 1962 to select General Dynamics over the 
Boeing Company, as the better of two qualified competitors, was based 
on the judgment that the General Dynamics design would result in an air-
plane less expensive to produce, maintain, and operate, and more depend­
able both in training missions and in actual combat. 
The General Dynamics-Grumman t_eam was successful because, in 
my judgment, and in the judgment of the Secretaries of the N~vy and the 
Air Force, their proposal gave the most valid promise of obtaining a 
single airplane that can meet Navy and Air Force requirements with: 
The least expensive, time-consuming research and 
development effort before production. 
The least reliance upon unknown process and materials. 
The earliest delivery to our fighting forces. 
The highest level of experience in building fighter-type 
aircraft.
