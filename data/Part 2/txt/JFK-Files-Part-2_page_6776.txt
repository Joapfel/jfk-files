CIA originated with other age~cies or departments. For example, 
in the 17 boxes of Oswald records, approximately 40% of the 
documents originated with the FBI, and about 2_0% originated 
with the State Department or elsewhere. Our staff is still going 
through the material compiled at the request"-ofthe Warren 
Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, 
which includes (>3 boxes of paper records and one box that 
contains 73 reels of microfilm. The microfilms-in part overlap 
material in other parts of the collection. We estimate that within 
the 63 boxes of paper records, approximately 27% originated with 
a variety of other U.S. government agencies, private 
organizations, and foreign and American press. 
Mr. Chairman, you have also asked ·about ass·assination-- • • 
materials that may be held by other Intelligence Community 
agencies. The FBI will describe its-holdings separately, which 
I assume include both intelligence and law enforcement 
records. The National Security Agency and the State 
Department's Bu_reau of Intelligence and Research report, 
after a preliminary search, that they have identified a 
relatively small amount of material responsive to previous 
inquiries by the Warren Commission, the Church Committee, 
and the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The 
Defense Intelligence Agency, which did not come into existence 
until 1961, has identified no assassination material to date, 
I 
and it anticipates thafany holdings'it might have would be
