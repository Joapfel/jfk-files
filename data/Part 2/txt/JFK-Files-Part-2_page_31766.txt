force that. can only be •• contained by force.· He stated that 
the communist conspiracy is.· a movement that · does not hold 
together because of nationalistic interests. He cited 
the Sino-Soviet • dispµte and the int--ernational squabbling 
between satellite countries and the major communist powers. 
He said the Vietnam conflict began as an internal dispute 
• and if the U. s. withdrew from·the .conflict this .. withdrawal 
. would reaffirm the communists' confidence in the possibility . 
·.· of peaceful co-existen·ce. 
He concluded,that.if anyone is genui11ely concerned. 
about American security, he is going to have to work to· 
reverse_American foreign.policy.
