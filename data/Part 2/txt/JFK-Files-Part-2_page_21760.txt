II. CONCEPT OF OPERATION 
Basically, the operation is to bring about the revolt of the Cuban 
people, The revolt will overthrow the Communist regime and institute 
a new goverrunent with which the United States can live in peace. 
The revolt requires a strongly motivated political action movement 
established within Cuba, to generate the revolt, to give it direction to­
wards the objective, and to capitalize on the climactic moment, The 
political actions will be ass~sted by economic warfare to induce failure 
of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs, psychological 
operations to turn the peoples' resentment increasingly against the regime, 
and military-type groups to give the popular movement an action arm for 
sabotage and armed resistance in support of political objectives. 
The failure o{ the U.S. -sponsored operation in April 1961 so shook 
the faith of Cuban pat riots in U.S. competence and intentions in support -
ing a revolt against Castro that a new effort to generate a revolt against 
the regime in Cuba must have active support from key Latin American 
countries. Further, the foreigness {Soviet Union and Bloc) of the tyranny 
imposed on the Cuban people must be made clear to the people of the 
Western Hemisphere to the point of their deep anger and open actions to 
defend the Western Hemisphere against such foreign invasion. Such an 
anger will be generated, in part, by appeals from the popular movement 
within Cuba- to other Latin Americans especially. 
The preparation phase must result in a political action organi:1.ation 
in being in key localities inside Cuba, with its own means for internal 
communications, its own voice for psychological operations, and its own 
action arm (small guerrilla bands, sabotage squads, etc·.). It must have 
the sympathetic support of the majority of the Cuban people, and m.;ike lh1• 
fact known to the outside world. (It is reported that the majority oC Cub.an, 
are not for the present regime, but are growing apathetic towards what 
appearstobe a hopeless future or the futility of their status.) 
The climactic mo~ent o{ revolt will come from an angry reaction o{ 
the people to a government action (sparked by an incident), or from a. 
fracturing o{ the leadership cadre within the regime, or both. (A major 
goal of the Project must be to bring this about.) The popular movemer:•·.: :.:,__
