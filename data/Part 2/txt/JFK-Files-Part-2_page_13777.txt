A~ Legal Authority for FBI Intelligence and Counter­
intelligence Activities 
The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI 
intelligence and counterintelligence activities. 
There may be serious question as to the adequacy 
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's 
functions in these fields. Current statutes 
authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law 
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically 
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence 
activities. Therefore, the CoITu~ittee seeks to 
determine whether the FBI~s authority should be 
clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre­
hensive statutory charter. 
Responsible staff: Senior staff 
Task Force leader 
Mark Gitenstein

The Cqmmittee is investigating the structure and 
operating practices.of the FBI Intelligence Divi­
sion. Proposals have been made that the national 
security intelligence and counterintelligence 
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate 
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's 
criminal investigative activities. Further recom­
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina­
tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies, 
for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and.
