" ... we don't care if the Dominicans assassinate

In contrast the CIA Station Chief, Owen, did regard the 
cable as man~festing a change in U.S. policy, particularly on 
the questionof supplying arms. ( Owen' p. 120) He believed the

associated with assassination. If we are to at least 
cover up tracks, CIA personnel directly involved in 
assassination preparation must be withdrawn."
