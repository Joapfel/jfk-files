~ reasonably effective in getting overall coordination. It was re­
sponsible for making a thorough inventory of all the equipment 
that the Agency had in the aviation field, and by and large was 
able to keep track of who needed what and whether an asset was 
available that could take care of a problem without the necessity 
of acquiring a new asset. 
According to Houston. a general shift in thinking at the 
Agency occurred between 1968 and 1972 on the desirability of their­
holding substantial contingent capacity of airlift. The records· 
seem to indicate that Mr. Houston apparently convinced the Director 
in the early 1970's chat the capacity should no longer should be 
retained. Houston cornmen~ed on this assessment as follows:• 
Through what knowledge I had of the utilization 
of the various assets, it seemed to me that util­
ization, particularly of large assets, that is, 
heavy flight equipment, was going down to the point 
where there was very little of it. Consequently, we 
couldn't forecast a specific requirement. Such re­
quirements as you could forecast we~e highly con­
tingent. But I also remember a couple of times 
putting the caveat into the Director that with a 
changing world and with the complications in the 
aviation field, once you liquidate it, you could 
not rebuild, and so you ought to·think very, very 
carefully before getting rid of an asset that did 
have a contingent capability.
