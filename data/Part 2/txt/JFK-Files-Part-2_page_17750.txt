request received from the Senate Select ·Committee on Intelligence Activities. 
The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modliy portions 
of the Committee's request. 
Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division 
pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable 
file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of 
the FBI to 11(1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence 
information, and (3) engage in counter-intelligence activities; together with 
copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential 
directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials 
asserted as sources of such authority. 11 With regard to )?art m concerning the 
FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel 
in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the 
Intelligence Division that there would be a needless prollieration of a list of 
Bureau. pe~sonn~l working in this field which list, of course, would be of interes~,-
to foreign 1ntelhgence sources. {fll.1: 
On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed ;f 
these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee; 0 
John T. Elllif, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee 
looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select 
Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request 
in Part ill to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division ne.~d .not ,b~. 
identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart 
to be furnished them pursuant to their, request of 3-19-75. They asked as an·• - ~ 
.alternative th~ ,Bureau prepare a listAt':'personnel in the Intelligence Division down 
to the level of Unit Chief with names 1-t{cy1~ed which they would have access to 
review in Bureau space. "-C/ ,1
