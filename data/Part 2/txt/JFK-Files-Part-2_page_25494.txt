ML: And I wouldn't risk it with my daughter. So, anyway, 
we waited. We were allowed the run-of the place. We 
knew everyone there and ... 
FS: Like you say, eyes were watching you. 
ML: Oh definitely, definiteJy, because that's how they 
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't 
get in there and have the run of the place, you're 
not left· alone. But I know you're being watched. 
FS: Sure. 
ML: Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate 
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations 
because it was in the paper the next day, that it 
was some security council meeting. And I said 
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him 
thank you very much for the material. And best 
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left. 
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us, 
a uniformed police officer. 
FS: For what reason? 
ML: He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring, 
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the 
police department because they're helping me now. 
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know? 
FS: Yeah, he thought you were Russians. 
ML: He thought I was a Russian. 
FS: Or a Russian sympathizer. 
ML: Right, especially going in with a child and I looked 
very ... 
FS: Yeah. 
ML: American. Anyway, I got home and John Kotter was 
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was 
raining. He was reading. And_I said, he said "Are 
you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell 
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?" 
FS: Yeah.
