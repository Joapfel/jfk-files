methods. This new unit, the ._Historical Review Group, in the 
• 
Agency's Center for the Study of Intelligence, will review for 
declassification documents 30 years old or older, and national 
intelligence estimates on the former Soviet Union that are 
10 years old or older. In addition to the systematic review of 
-30-year-old documents, I have directed the History Staff in the 
Center for the Study of Intelligence to assemble CIA records 
focusing on particular events of historical importance, including 
the assassination of President Kennedy. The Historical Review 
Group will then examine the documents for the purpose of 
declassifying the records. 
Because of high interest in the JFK papers, I am not waiting 
for legislation or other agencies to start declassifying documents 
belonging to CIA. The Historical Review Group, at my direction, 
already has begun its review of the documents related to the 
assassination of President Kennedy, and I am glad to report that 
the first group of these records, including all CIA documents on 
Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination, }:las"been 
declassified with quite minimal deletions and is being transferred 
to the National Archives for release to the public. This is, I 
acknowledge, a small fraction of what we have, but it is an earnest 
of my commitment to begin review for declassification 
immediately of this material. And, indeed, as I speak, the 
reviewers are going through a subs~ntial number of documents, 
and I anticipate that many of these will be released shortly.
