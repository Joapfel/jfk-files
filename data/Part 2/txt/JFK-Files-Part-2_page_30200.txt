Summary of Contact: 
On two occasions on this date Garv Cornwell and I snoke 
with Regis Blahut of the CIA. We first spoke to him at 
approximately llA.T-1 in Gary Cornwell' s office.. We spoke 
with him a second time at approximately 2PM at which 
time we recorded his statement pertaining to a breach 
of security at the HSCA. The recorded statement fully 
covers the substance of the first conversation with 
two exceptions: 
1) In the first conversation Regis originally told us that 
he looked through an autopsy photo book after receiving 
permission to do so. Later, during that same conversation, 
wtien ask~d from whom he received permission to look 
through the autopsy photo book he denied having said he 
received permission to look through the book and stated 
that he at no time received permission to look through 
tHe autopsy photo book. Both Gary and I distinctly recall 
him telling us at the outset of the conversation that he 
looked through the book only after receving permission to 
do so. 
2) In the first conversation Regis told us that he was 
alone in the security room when-he saw the bQOk on the 
window sill and decided to look through it. However, 
when asked during the taped recorded conversation whether 
he was alone when he looked through the autopsy book he 
then stated that there were people present in the roam 
when he looked through the autopsy book but that he cannot recall

both G~~¥and I clearly recall h1m telling us when we first 
spoke with him that no one was present when he looked throuqh
