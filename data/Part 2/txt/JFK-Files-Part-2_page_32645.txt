ANNEX D - ECUADOR 
Well-placed and reliable agents have reported 
that the last Cuban charg~ in Quito, Ecuador, had 
given more than $40,000 to the Union of Revolution­
ary Ecuadorean Youth (URJE) for guerrilla warfare 
training. 
More than 45 young Ecuadoreans, including 
three girls, were rounded up by Ecuadorean para­
troopers last spring at a guerrilla training camp 
at Santo Domingo de los Colorados, about 50 miles 
west of Quito. Many of the trainees had been to 
Cuba. The leaders of the group, Santiago Perez 
Romoleroux, Jorge Rivadeneyra Altamirono, and Efrain 
Alvarez Fiallos, had recently returned from extensive 
guerrilla warfare training in Cuba. 
When the Ecuadorean Communist Party last January 
arranged for the expulsion of several URJE leaders in­
volved with the guerrilla operation in order to re­
store full Communist control, newspapers reported that 
the expelled leaders had been accused by the Communists 
of wasting Cuban funds. 
Guillermo Layedra, Communist leader from Rio 
Bamba, arrested on his return from Cuba in March 1962, 
was reported to have photographs showing him under­
going guerrilla training in Cuba. Communist Miguel 
Lechon, the only Indian on the party Central Committee 
and president of the Ecuadorean Federation of Indians, 
was arrested in 1962 for shooting a peasant. He showed 
a Soviet pistol which he said had been given him by 
Fidel Castro during a visit to Cuba, and has also 
shown. a key which he boasts is the ignition key for 
a Cadillac Castro has promised to send him as soon 
as he recruits 300 Indians for the Communist Party. 
Reliable sources in Ecuador report that at 
least 80 Ecuadoreans were in Cuba as of January for 
guerrilla training. We have 30 of these trainees 
listed by name.
