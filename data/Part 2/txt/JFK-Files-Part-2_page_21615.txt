Consequently, I personally made this proposal, that we 
establish what I called a false flag base of people that would 
go from outside, and should there be any sort of flap, the 
chances of linking it to the U.S. Government would be much 
less, because they would appear to be from another nationality. 
Mr. Schwarz. I would like to read to you a cable -- is 
this cable of 27 September in the Senator's.book? I know that 
he asked for it after I came over. 
Mr. Treverton. It is not. 
Mr. Schwarz. I am going to read from a cable which 
unfortunately is not in your book, but the key part is 
relatively simple. 
This is a cable, Mr. Phillips, dated September 27, 1970, 
and it is signed by yourself and Mr. Broe. And it is sent to 
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the 
purposes of setting up the false flag office 
Mr. Phillips. We call it a base. 
Mr. Schwarz. False:_ flag bases: "Each member of base 
19 will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and operate as 
20 a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican". 
21 That is right, isn't it? 
22 Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. Continue: 
"Having at least one keyi_i;:,~z-~ and one key lii_g~~i~.!!£)
