9. In o.utgoing SW message no. 9 of 30 September, AllFAUNA-26 had 
been ·asked to investigate a Cuban naval officer naJBed Carlos *LOPEZ 
Avalos with. a view to forming an opinion as.to his political attitude. 
She reported. in SW message no. 37 of 3 November that all reports on 
this individual were derogatory except for one given by .AMLMIE-5. This 
report reache<V'"AMFAU~-26 via .AMFAUNA-31 who got it fron a man identified 
only ·as Ramon "'PEREZ. who said that AMLAME-5 had told bin that he had a 
contact to the .. Swiss Embassy, and that LOPEZ was already connected with

son of AMFAUNA-32 was asked to phone his mother in Cien.:fuegos· and instruc 
her.to tell .AMFAUNA-26 to·go into hiding. On 3 January the son reported 
completion of the call and ~aid that his mother had told him that 
AMFAUNA-26 had• been arrested .on 29 December and taken to the Santa Clara prison. • • • 
11. The·~eason for ·AMFAUNA-~61s arrest ·remains obscure, or rather 
there are ~o many· accep~able explanatio.ils that the prob1em is to select 
the right one. She could have been implicated by AMFAUXA-38, as would 
seem to be suggested by the fact that her house was searched immediately 
following AMFAUNA-381s arrest; if so, however, it is hard to explain 
·· why AMFAUNA-26 herself was not arrested until three and one-half months 
late~. She could ·have been denounced by AMCUTLER-2 who was herself 
arrested two or three .days before AMFAUNA-26's arrest; this seems unlikel 
in view of the fact that AMCUTLER-2 and AMFAUNA-2~-are ~riends, that when 
AMCUTLER-2 reaches the point where she is ready to implicate other 
members of· the AMFAUNA net she could be expected to begin with people 
who are not her friends, and that at least one such person (.AMFAUNA-25) 
was known to be at liberty as recently as 4 January 1964, as were two of 
the· cutouts between AMFAUNA-26 and AMCUTLER-2 (ADAUNA-32 and AMFAUNA-33)1 
AMCUTLER-2 is· believed to have been under surveillance by the DSE, at , 
least sporadically, between 12 and 24 October (see .AMF.AIJXA~l Progress 
Report for October, November, and December 1963), and AllFAUNA-26 could 
have been observed and identified when she visited AMCUTLER-2 during 
this period and· marked for subsequent arrest and interrogation in 
connection with AMCUTLER-2's activities. AMFAUNA-26 coald have made an 
attempt between 22 and 29 December to recover the cached cipher groups 
(see· paragraph 3), and either been detected in the act or arrested while 
trying xo :gontact J\14CUTLER-2 on the same trip; in this case, however, 
it would seem that the DSE would not have transported her all the way 
back to Santa Clara "but would have kept her in Havana for concurrent 
interrogation with AMCUTLER-2. The open telegram sent to the son of 
AMFAUNA-32 on 23 December was rather indiscreet and cou1d have caused 
difficulties for the sender, but some of these difficulties ought in this 
case to have brushed off on.~FAUN~-32 herself: ~d as of? J~a~ary 1964 
she• was still at liberty. . c.t~;_ _ AJ,t;7"'i,,../. >-• ....._}

I, AMFAUNA-'26 nor· AMLAME-5 had been involved in any plot against the life 
of Fidel CASTRO, but both could have been high on a general suspect list,
