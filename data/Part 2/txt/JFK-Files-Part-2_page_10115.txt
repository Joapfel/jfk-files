Agents Merrill R .. Smith and J. Hale McMenamin.

Professor Donald Fanger is the subject 0£ 
Security Matter - C, Bureau file 100-408465, opened 
in January, 1954, when there was indication he supported 
Communist Party policies and closed 1964 when investigation 
indicated he did not qualify under Bureau•s criteria for 
inclusion on the Security Index and his activities did not 
appear to warrant investigation. The only known connection 
between Fanger and Riha is that they were both included in 
a group of American graduate students selected to attend 
Moscow or Lenigrad University in 1.0!:::?-1959 in exchange for 
twenty Soviet graduate students. 
Professor Oldrich Leska is the subject of 
Internal Security - Czechoslovakia, Bureau file 105-19779. 
Leska, born 6/16/27 Czechoslovakia, was in the U. s. from 
7/17/68 to 9/5/68 and again from 10/15/68 until 6/8/70 
when he returned to Czechoslovakia. He was in the U. S. 
under the East-West Exchange Proeram. During the earlier 
visit and from October, 1968, until the Summer of 1069, he 
was at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, and 
from the Summer of 1969 until June, 1970, he was at the
