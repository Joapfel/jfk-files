2. Director Helms owned a beach house near Lewes, Delaware. On one occasion 
Brewer 1aet witl1 the chief of police there concerning the security of the 
beach house, as Helms had been receiving threats. Apparently Osborn gave 
the police chief a box of flares and other equip1;1ent (as a gift to the 
department) for the chief's assistance. 
At some point during the interview, Mr. Brei<Jer indicated that he had not 
discussed his testimony with any representative of the Agency prior to the 
interview--except the General Counsel. 
IMPRES'SIONS 
Mr. Brewer 1qas originally some1d1at reluctc1..nt to be intervic1,;ed and at one 
point was considerinr. whether he should retain a lrnyer. However, as· 11e 
1·1cnt along he opened up considcrallly to tho point 1:here I n01·1 believe I have 
a pretty good understanding of tho Office of Security's Washington Field 
Office. It \':ould appear that the Washington Field Office did conduct nuch, 
if not most, of the physic::il and technicnl sm".;eiLLzmcc directed against 
American citizens subsequent to 1968. In every case the survci llance was 
directed by higher c=i.uthori ty. It also appears t),c::.~ the Washington Field 
Office gave substantial assistance to. local police departments in the Wash­
ington, D. C. area. Much of this assistance 1vas o:wious ly an appropriate 
exchange of information between two intelligence units. Most disturbing is 
the incident where CIA agents assisted NPD officers in a bona fide police 
surveillance (a law enforcement function), but this seems to have been an 
isolp.tcd case.
