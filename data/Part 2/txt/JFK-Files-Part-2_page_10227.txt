3. Facts ·pertaining to both actions undertaken at the 
initiative of this Office are as follows: 
a.· A covert procurement proprietary concer~, dedi7 
cated to the acquisition of firearms, amr.1unition, ·and 
related police-type equipment, is operated in Baltimore, 
Marrland. It was organized in 1969. This proprietary 
is operated in order to give the Agency a capability to 
• obtain such materiel without associating the procurement 
action with the United States Govern~ent .. It is legally 
. necessary that the proprietary be licensed by both the 
State and Federal·jurisdictions. Since it is located in 
Maryland, it is appropriately licensed by the ~!aryland 
State Police to buy and sell firearms and ammunition.
