Although Colonel Wimert was instructed not to involve himself with 
:• Viaux because of the high risk involved (Santiago 461, 5 October), he 
served initially as a contact to Viaux through an Argentine military 
Attache. The Argentine reported on October 5 that Viaux wanted several 
hundred paralyzing gas grenades to launch a coup on October 9. (Santiago 
476, 6 October) Headquarters turned down the request, concluding that 
a "mini-coup at this juncture would be counterproductive" and Viaux 
should postpone his plans, "while encouraging him in a suitable manner 
to maintain his posture so that he may join larger movement later if 
it materializes." (Headquarters 585, 6 October) 
The primary purpose of the "False Flag D..ase" was to contact Viaux, 
and it very rapidly relieved Wimert and the Argentine Attache of that 
task. Viaux reiterated his demand for an air drop of weapons to the 
"False Flagger," and again the response w_as the same: reject the demand 
for arms, but encourage him to keep planning. In essence the Agency 
was buying time with Viaux: "We wish to encourage Viaux to expand and 
refine his coup· planning. Gain some influence over his actions." 
(Headquarters 689, 10 October) To achieve this latter purpose, Head­
quarters authorized passing $20,000 in cash and a promise of· $250,000 
in life insurance to Viaux and his associates, as a demonstration of 
U.S. support. (Headquarters 729, 13 October) 
·. 
On October 13, Headquarters again indicated its concern over Schneider 
by asking: "What is to keep Schneider from making statement in early 
hours which will freeze those military leaders who might otherwise join 
Viaux?'' (Headquarters 729, 13 October) The Station's response later that 
same day was "Viaux intends to kidnap Generals scrneider and Prats within \ U: ! d. 
the next 48 hours in order io precipitate a coup.'' (Santiago ~27,
