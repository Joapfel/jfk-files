ended on~tr15ecember, avoided 
erious discussion of the more 
ontentious issues facing the 
ai~liance. There was, for _in­
s;ance, only passing reference t the matter of nuclear shar-
i g. While NATO's military • 
posture was generally recogniz d· 
a~ still inadequate, the Forcel PJanning exercise--which is 
d1!signed to help correct this • 
situation--was not discussed 
I 
a~ all. The dispute over basi 
sprategy, the chief stumbling 
b-ll.ock to the exercise, was put 
otf until after De Gaulle's 
Ptess conference.sometime in 
J(nuary. 
All but the French agreed 
. tat the alliance should explo e 
ppssibilities of negotiating 
with the Soviets on outstandin 
Xast-West issues. The. Germans 1 
as usual, indicated some reser~ 
~ations because of their sensi • • 
~ivity regarding Berlin and Ge -

p~ge was led by Communist-dom­
i~ated unions seeking, as in 
tie past, to force the resigna-. ton of the Conservative - So-
c al Democratic government by 
d screditing its economic poli­

as a political victory for Prim 
Mjnister Benediktsson's govern-

unable to maintain a solid grip

w~ll intensify inflationary 
p~essures and will probably 
f9rce Benediktsson to take ex­
t~aordinary measures to maintai 
e~onomic stability. For polit­
ifal reasons he will try to avo d 
another currency devaluation,

~conomic stabilization program
