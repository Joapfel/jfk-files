SECTION 107 ••• ECURITY INFOR~NTS AND CONFID~AL SOURCES. 
Contacts by Agents 
a. Except in espionage and foreign nationality matters where frequency 
of contact is dependent on circumstances, -informant·s should be con­
tacted as often as necessary, but at least one personal contact 
should be made every two weeks. If such frequent contacts cannot be 
established, obtain specific Bureau authority for exception to this 
requirement. 
b. During each contact, carefully review informant's activities since 
previous contact and make certain informant has furnished all in-
formation which he has obtained since last contact. • 
c. Contacting Agent should not only collec·t; information but direct 
informant, be aware of his activities, and mainta~n such close· 
relationship that he knows informant's attitude towards Bureau. 
Good judgment -~ust prevail in handling informant to see he· does 
not become too familiar with Agent. Promptly advise Bureau of any 
indication informant is wavering in Bureau relationship. 
d. Arrangements for paying informant or personally contacting him mu,st 
be specific and no doubt should be left in minds of either Agent 
or informant as to methods of payment, amount, place, and time. 
e. Informants should use only public telephones in communicating with 
contacting .A.gent and consideration should be given to furnishing 
informants nonpublished office telephone number for emergency com­
munication. This rule is not practical i·n all espionage and 
foreign nationality matters but should b_e followed where applicable. 
f. Positive information rece.ived from informant should be subje·ct of 
written statement by informant or memorandum prepared by contacting 
.A.gent to be placed in informant's subfile and appropriately 
channelized. • 
g. Record dates of all contacts, whether negative or positive, in 
informant's administrative file. Memorandum or form FD~209 may be 
used. If informant contacted frequently, one memorandum or form 
may be used for several contacts. 
h. Dates of negative contacts and file numbers of cases involved· must 
appear in informant's administrative file. Where file has more than 
one subject, name of subject under inquiry should be noted. Do not 
set forth title of case involved. 
i. If positive information received from informant, show only dates of 
contacts in informant's administrative file. Place positive i"nforma­
tion in informant's subfile and appropriately channelize same. 
j. Alternate Agent should be designated for contacts with informant 
and should be thoroughly acquainted with informant so that contacts 
may be handled by alternate .A.gent where necessary. 
Checking reliability . 
a. Reliabili·ty of all active informants must be constantly checked. 
b. Give consideration to use of. any investi.gative technique deemed 
necessary to be certain they are completely reliable and are fur­
nishing accurate, truthful information. 
Fingerprints 
a. After informant has been developed and unless some reason to 
contrary exists, obtain and forward his fingerprints to Identifi­
cation Division if they are not on file there. 
b. If informant refuses, do not force issue. 
c. Forward informant's fingerprints as enclosure to FD-165 using 
applicant-type fingerprint card, form FD-258, fully exe outed·.
