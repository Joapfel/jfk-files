policies. l: believe the procedure j~ outlined cou1d be. 
applied 11uch more widel.y. A statute aould declare that al.l. 
govermnent recordS JDOre than thirty years o1d wou.1.d.become 
publ,.i~ unJ.ess the originating agency showed specific- ca.us& 
for continued non-disclosure. . A Board or comnission ap- . 
pointed by the President with the advice and cons.cant of the 
Senate oould have authority to review all such materials and 
to question or appea1 the ncn-discl.osura. This approximates 
pJ:ac:tioe in the United Kingdom. 
:rn concl.usion, :r repeat a wazning against expecting ~ 
legislation to create consensus and the..~ "contribute to 
the trust of the.people- in their governm.ent.n :tnventors o:C 
conspira~- theories wiJ.1 al.ways be ~re • ingenious than as­
setD})-lers of evidence.. '!!he immediate resul.t o~ rel.easing 
records vill be, moreover, to provide grist for the 
- tlleorists' mil.l.s. •. Even if eye;ey;t;bi pg: were released tomor-
" . 
row, it.would take at least a decade for ressarchers to sort 
. . 
the newl.y released 111a.terials. In the lDeantiJD.e, conspiracy 
builders wcuJ.d be picking out those bits and pices of evi­
dence that suited them. Ill the long nm, rel.ease of docu­
ments will g~t us cJ.oser to truth; bttt, as Xeynes obser.ved, 
that_l.cin.g run ~l.y stretches beyond ~y of our 
1ifetimes.
