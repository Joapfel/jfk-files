MRo SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE 
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY 
DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967 
communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving 
force· behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County 
and that his statements to staff members are· antiwhite and 
antipoliceo He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying 
to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional 
antipoverty funds. 
The source of the above information also alleged 
• 
that in Apri_l of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of 
the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year­
old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in 
the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the 
arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity 
learned of his activity and told him tp desist. He stated that 
in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic), 
staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were 
in possession-of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot. 
He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming 
the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov 
cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in 
preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action. 
Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb 
an "Uncle Tom."
