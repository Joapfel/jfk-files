This frame of reference concerning Guantanamo 
Bay led the Executive Officer of WH/4, Ed Stanulis, 
to prepare an extremely sharp memorandum for Chief, 
Western Hemisphere Division raising some questions 
which are as pertine·n t to CIA today as they were 
when they were raised in 1960. Stanulis wrote as 
follows: 
I realize that this Agency is an 
implementing arm of. the Executive Bran.ch 
and has no right or privilege in the area 
of formulation of U.S. national policy. 
· I believe that within this framework we . 
who are part of t;his·Agency are permitted 
to comment on certain. State Department • 
or other Executive Department propositions 
that appear, on th~ basis of our own 
personal observations and experience, to 
be counter-productive to the best interest 
of the United States. I am convinced 
that the course of actio~ described in 
paragraph 1 [that the U.S. use the +ADB 
to win Latin American support for the 
U.S. retention of Guantanamo] is in fact 
within this category. 
It is high time that the U.S.· take an 
understandable public position in matters 
of international agreement, compact, con­
tract, and treaty. The rights of the U.S. 
to the Guantanamo· Bay are·a have been clear­
ly and legally described in several docu­
ments which bear the signatures of the 
then reigning and cognizant governments 
of the United. States and Cuba, respectively . 
. Certainly the assistance of any single or 
plural Latin American national,entity (ies) 
seems to me to ·be.indicative of an admitted 
weakness on the part of the United States
