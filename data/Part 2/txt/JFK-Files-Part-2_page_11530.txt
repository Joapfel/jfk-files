• (j) Physical description 
I. Obtain ~nd report a detailea physical description. 
II. During the course of the initial investigation in any 
security-type case, including espionage.and nationalistic 
tendency cases, the physi~al characterist~~s and ddscrip~ 
tion of the subject shall be determined or verified by 
personal ~bservation. It is not necessary to observe 
personally the subject of a.ny case where preliminary 
investigation determines the basis for opening the 
case is unfounded. 
·III 0 The subject should be personally observed, if possible, 
early in the investigation after it is determined that 
a complete investigation is warranted to develop the 
extent of a subject's supversive activities and to 
consider whether the subject's name should be ad'ded to 
the security index. This action should be taken in the 
course of developing background information to determine 
the true identity a.nd existence of the subject a.nd to 
assist in establishing that the s,·"t;jeot of the inves.ti­
gation is the person against whom the subversive 
allegations hav•': been made. Each subject should be 
personally obsc:··~~d whcnever·a complete security investi­
gation is conduu.ed even thdugh a security index card 
is not being recommended at the completion of the 
investigation. 
IVe Do not delay the submission of form FD-122 reco'7!~nending 
the addition of a. subjectts name to the securit..,· Index 
even though it has not been possible .to observ~ : ~rsonally 
the subject if it has been determined through l· ·i:.stiga,tion 
that the subject is dangerous or potentially du. ;erous. 
Ve If a securit:;- index card is not being recorr4-nen,3,;,i1. after 
all logical investigation has been conducted and it has 
no~ been possible to observe personally the subject during 
the investigation, the case may be closed even though 
this has not been doneo If a sec~rity index card ~as 
.been recommended and prepared and it has not been possible 
to person~lly observe the subject, the case shall remain 
op-en until such tim:3 as the subject is personally obse:i:.·vcd., 
except when it has been determined that the subject is 
residing outside th·e continental u. s., Hawaii, Alatika, 
or Puerto Rico, in which event the case may ba closed if 
there is no other pending investigation and the matter 
should be followed administratively to be certain that 
the subject is personally observed upon his·return to 
this countryo 
{k) Photograph 
-I. Reasonable efforts should be made during the investigation 
[of a security subjcct]to obtain a photograph of the 
subject through ~sual sources.

III. [Cases on security ~ndex subjects are to be maintained 
in a pending.status µntil such timo as a suitable 
photograph is obtained unless circumstances dictate
