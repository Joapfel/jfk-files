INTERVIEWER: How about a couple of the Senators, Church and 
Mondale, have emphasized that accountab1i1ty to the President 
and to the Congress was needed. And they were referring to the 
Agency .. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, I think you have to have accountability. 
And we always thought we had accountability. We went and got 
our money from Congress to do all the convert action that 
everybody is Objecting to now. They didn't object th~n. I 
mean, those handful of guys didn't. I mean, the so-ca 11 ed Laos 
Secret War. They provided every penny. We don't make ou~ own 
money. We don't print our own money. We might print somebody 
else's counterfeit money but that is another story. But the 
Congressional leadership knew. Again, under the ground rules 
that the Congres~ laid down we always had oversight. Four 
. overs1g~t committees .. We ~eported to those four oversight 
committees. If they didn't want to listen, if they didn't want 
to ask questions and if they didn't want to know more, that's 
their problem, not ours. We've got a war to fight, kind of. 
But we keep on going. When they stop us, we stop~ And yeah, 
you've got to have Congressional Oversight. The system ve've 
got, fine. But oversight is oversight. Oversight does not 
mean management. Not in my opinion anyway. Oversight does not 
mean daily running of the office. And I am told that there are 
guys on the Hi 11, and they've got badges just 11 ke the next 
guy. They've got a 11 the c 1 earances. They've got badges .and
