Students of the assassination would benefiu from opening the mass of 
information produced by the intelligence community's intense effort to get to , 
the bottom of the President's murder. Yet, protecting America's foreign and 
domestic intelligence-gathering capabilities is essential to our national 
defense. nlS4 Thus, the intelligence agencies regularly assert that the· 
identities of.agents and informants must remain perpetualll' confidential; nlSS 
that nothing should be revealed about the methods ana sources used to gather 
intelligence; nl56 that direct reports from United States incelligence agents 
should not be disclosed; nl57 and that intelligence informacion provided by 
other nations to the United States, and, indeed, the very existence of such .,. 
relationships, should not be disclosed.

VIII. Informants 
Informants play a critical role in the world of intelligence operations, both 
domestic and foreign. For example, the FBI relied heavily on informants to 
infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan in the 196Oe and [*24] 197Os. n158 Today, the 
FBI recruits informants to help thwart. narcotics trafficking and international 
terrorism.· nl.59 The internal secu:r:ity and general welfare of the O'nited. States 
depends heavily on the role of informants. n16O
