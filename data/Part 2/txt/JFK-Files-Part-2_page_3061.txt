Despite .the rather positive doubts that the 
President had about the sugar sabotage activity, J. 
C. King charged ahead almost immediately following 
the Special Group Meeting of 17 February 1960. On 
18 February, King atid Milo Perkins had a detailed 
discussion concerning the .disruptive effects which· 
might result from interference with the.Cuban sugar 
operation. Perkins was planning meetings with Am­
bassador Hill and Thomas ("Tommy the Cork") Corcoran, 
and King brought.to Perkins's attention that Corcoran 
had been willin9 and able to provide valuable assist~ 
ance to .the .Agency in the past. Later in the month, 
Col. King met with Thomas Mann, the Assistant Secre­
tary for Economic Affairs (subsequently Assistant 
Secretary for American Republic Affairs) who reportedly 
was in favor of both reduced sugar quotas and direct 
sabotage of Cuban sugar mills. According to King, 
Secretary Mann also would .support both cut backs in 
US oil. companies deliv'eries to· Cuba and actions which 
might cut back on US tourist trade with the island. 24/ 
Col. King also consulted with former Ambassador 
William Pawley, whom he asked to make arrangements
