OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL TO ALEXANDRIA OR OTHER RESORT AREAS ON 
THE WEEKENDS. LASHIN'S FAVORITE PASTIME SEEMS TO BE LYING 
ON THE BEACH. HIS DESCRIPTION OF HIS LIFESTYLE IN EGYPT IS 
NOT THAT OF A CIVIL SERVANT WHO MUST DEPEND ON HIS SALARY AS 
THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME. 
4. C/O RAISED THE TERRORIST KILLING OF U.S. DIPLOMATIC 
PERSONNEL IN KARACHI ON 8 MARCH TO GAUGE LASHIN'S RESPONSE. 
AFTER LAUNCHING INTO A HOMILY ABOUT HOW THE PROPHET HAD 
CALLED FOR MERCY AND DECENCY BY WARRIORS IN THE TREATMENT OF 
CIVILIANS, LASHIN WENT ON TO SPIN A SERIES OF TYPICALLY 
PARANOID ARAB CONSPIRACY THEORIES. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE 
*<ASSASSINATIONS>OF<JFK>AND ANWAR ((SADAT)) WERE SOMEHOW THE 
THE WORK OF THE ISRAELIS, WHO ALWAYS SOUGHT TO DISRUPT GOOD 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EGYPT. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE 
ISRAELIS LIKED TO "PLAY THE FUNDAMENTALIST CARD" WHENEVER 
PRESSURES MOUNTED ON THEM TO MAKE CONCESSIONS, AND HE ARGUED 
THAT THE ISRAELI MOSSAD HAD BEEN BEHIND TERRORIST ACTS IN 
EGYPT AS FAR BACK AS THE 1950'S. 
5. BIOGRAPHIC MISCELLANY: LASHIN'S BROTHER IS THE 
EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR IN ECUADOR. FOUR OF HIS BROTHERS-IN-LAW 
HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME IN THE U.S. TWO REMAINED. TWO 
RETURNED TO CAIRO, WHERE THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. HOWEVER, THEY 
ARE RELUCTANT TO RETURN TO THE U.S., WHERE THE PACE WAS TOO 
STRESSFUL FOR THEM. LASHIN RECALLED THAT HIS BROTHER HAD 
ADVISED HIM NOT TO JOIN THE FOREIGN SERVICE, FOR IT WAS NOT 
A PARTICULARLY REWARDING CAREER. LASHIN NOW SEEMS TO REGRET 
THAT HE FAILED TO TAKE HIS BROTHER'S ADVICE. HE SAID THAT 
HE HAD THE CHANCE TO PURSUE AN ACADEMIC CAREER AS A 
PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY, AFTER HAVING SERVED AS AN ARMY 
DOCTOR FOR TWO YEARS. HOWEVER, HE DECIDED AGAINST PURSUING 
MEDICINE, FOR HE FELT AT THE TIME THAT THE MEDICAL 
FACILITIES AND SYSTEM IN EGYPT WERE TOO BACKWARD. NOW HE 
BELIEVES THAT IT IS TOO LATE FOR HIM TO RETURN TO MEDICINE. 
LASHIN IS AN. OBSERVANT AND APPARENTLY BELIEVING MUSLIM, AND 
THIS YEAR HE CONTINUED HIS RAMADAN FAST FOR AN ADDITIONAL 
SIX DAYS. 
6. LASHIN IS HARDLY A RISING STAR. HOWEVER, OTHER 
THAN A DISLIKE FOR HIS AMBASSADOR, HE HAS NOT DISPLAYED ANY 
PERCEPTIBLE UNHAPPINESS _WITH THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN 
TREATED BY HIS MINISTRY. IN FUTURE SESSIONS. WITH LASHIN THE 
C/O WILL TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE POSSESSES ANY 
MANIPULABLE DISGRUNTLEMENT OVER THE MODEST PROGRESS OF HIS 
CAREER, WHETHER HE HAS ANY WELL-PLACED PATRONS WITHIN HIS 
MINISTRY, AND WHETHER HE HAS ANY PROSPECTS FOR AN ASSIGNMENT 
WITH GOOD FI ACCESS UPON HIS RETURN TO CAIRO. THE C/O WILL 
ALSO SEEK TO DRAW HIM OUT ON HIS CONTACTS WITHIN THE LOCAL 
DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY,· ESPECIALLY AMONG CHINESE, RUSSIANS, 
INDIANS, AND PAKISTANIS. THE C/O WILL KEEP IN THE BACK OF 
HIS MIND THE POSSIBILITY THAT LASHIN MAY AT SOME POINT HAVE 
CROSSED THE SCREEN OF RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS.
