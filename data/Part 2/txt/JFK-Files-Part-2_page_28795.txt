RE: BiLL TRIPLETT 
It is my recommendation that Bill Triplett 
be hired as a staff counsel. I interviewed 
him approximately 5 months ago and he is far 
superior to almost all of the applicants I have 
interviewed. His legal background is excellent 
for our purposes. He has experience as a pro-
secutor, a defense lawyer and as an investigator. 
He impressed me as being intelligent, well spoken 
and as having an easy going manner. 
He desires to leave his present position with LEAA 
due to the lack of challenge. I am certain that 
this Committee would be gaining a productive member 
by hiring Mr. Triplett.
