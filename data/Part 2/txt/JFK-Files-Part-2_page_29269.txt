Dennis Flynn Interview Page two 
CIA use consular cover. Flynn said that he remembers the C1A 
officers who had State Department cover in Moscow during this 
period. He is sure that Richard E. Snyder and Jack F. Matlock 
were not CIA employees, and he is fairly certain that John A. 
McVickar, Joseph Norbury, and Alexis Davison were not CIA em­
ployees.
