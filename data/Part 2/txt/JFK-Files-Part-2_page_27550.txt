My entire working experience has been in Congress­
man Downing's office and has fallen into two 
major categories: 
April 1969 - Present - Caseworker - Duties include 
dealing with all constituents' problems relating 
to military service, retired military and veterans; 
requires a thorough knowledge of all military per-
sonnel procedures. Primary emphasis is personal 
counseling for constituents who have problems which 
they feel they are unable to resolve through normal 
channels. This position demands a strong, unemotional 
and patient disposition and the ability to impose 
reality upon constituents who are undergoing problems 
ranging from fairly routine ones to severe mental and 
emotional conditions. This counseling is primarily 
telephonic but often personal interviews are required. 
Also, handle U.S. Military Academy appointments; requires 
selecting all Congressman's nominees to the four major 
service academies. Compose all _correspondence required 
to execute the functions of this position. 
May 27, 1962 - April 1969 - Composed correspondence 
dealing with numerous facets of constituent inquiries 
concerning legislation, federal agencies, government 
publications, casework and academies. General office 
duties including dictation, typing and filing. Acquired 
a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of a Congres­
sional office.
