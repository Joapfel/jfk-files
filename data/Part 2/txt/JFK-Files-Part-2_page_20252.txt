RE: DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S. POLICY 
IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., . 
JANUARY 15, 1968 
100-448475 
NOTE CONTINUED: 
Seattle Office has been attempting to reactivate the informant 
in CP work. She has been invited to attend the demonstration 
by one of the CP members of the area and her attendance will 
enhance her status with the Party and facilitate her reactivation. -
As her husband is an airline employee, the cost of the trans­
portation will be minimal. 
Teletype is being used to afford informant opportunity to 
make arrangements for the trip.
