IF we had the authority and capability to have made 
an objective probe of this sensitive activity we may 
have been able to have surfaced these obviously ridi­
culo~s procedures in such a manner that corrective 
action would have been taken. Now is the time to 
present the case in light of the abiding fear of publi­
city currently permeating the Agency. I recommend that 
we go after the authority to make independent (uni­
lateral) probes and/or probes requested and known only 
at the very highest levels of the Agency with the results 
discreetly channeled where they will do the most good. 
There necessarily follows the unpleasant subject of 
money. As distasteful as it may be, it is no good to 
have the authority without a sufficiently large confi­
dential fund set aside and earmarked for independently 
iniated activities. 
He emphasized that if the Agency did not take the above kind of 
action to monitor its "image" at the operational level, "we will 
continue to be plagued with the unsolicited and uncontrolled 
critique through the newspapers, periodicals and pooks." He 
critically concluded: 
Further, l challenge anyone to deny that such exposes 
to date are largely true and usually the result of our 
own "ostrich policy" and refusal to face the fact that 
we have operated in some relatively amateurish manners 
over the years.
