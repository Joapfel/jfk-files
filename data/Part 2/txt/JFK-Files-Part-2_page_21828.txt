Mr. Sarno. It would come out of the Cuban branch. 
Mr. Wides. Olban-Operations Task? 
Who would come down? Just a member of the staff? 
Mr. Sarno. Come down? They usually came in a cable. 
It said, you know, we understand such and such a person is 
living at such and such an address and they worked at such and 
such, suggest send an out to debrief. 
Mr. Wides. Did you have a particular point of contact 
or several people who wer~ particular poin~s of contact for 
you that would tend to be the ones sending you cables? 
Mr. Sarno. No, I wasn't the Station Chief. The cables 
come into the station, the Station Chief would pass it to me 
or to the Branch Chi~f, and that would be it. 
Mr. Wides. Okay. 
I think that's all the questions we have, and I want 
to thank you for your patience, it's been a long morning. 
(Whereupon, at 12:42 o'clock p.rn., the hearing recessed.)
