THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH 
The magazine Computers and Automation has for more 
than three years followed an unusual publication policy: 
- The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro­
cessing, for the benefit of people, 
and an unusual belief: 
- That computers are too important to be left to 
computer experts and must be integrated into a 
socially responsible profession of information 
engineering. 
Wh!f.i:-this policy has operated most is in publishing 
information, articles, and reports on subjects which a 
great many liberal and progressive newspapers and peri­
oclicals have left unexplored or unmentioned: 
- The political conspiracies which have led to the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena­
tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and 
others - and their coverups 
- The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection 
with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator­
ship by the Saigon regime 
- The connections of President Richard M. Nixon 
with organized crime and the Mafia 
- The Watergate crimes 
If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting 
on the most important topics for the welfare of the 
people of the United States today, we urge you to sub­
sa-ibe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost 
every one is in print). Please help us pursue the important 
truth and report on it, by buying our products. 
Edm'!nd C. Berkeley, Editor 
Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical ... 
Computers and Automation, established 1qs1 and 
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com­
puters and data processing, believes that the pro­
fession of information engineer includes not only 
competence in handling information using computers 
and other means, but also a broad responsibility, 
in a professional and engineering sense, for: 
- The reliability and social significance of 
pertinent input data; 
- The social value and truth of the output 
results. 
. 
In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro­
fessional responsibility for the reliabi 1 i ty and 
significance of the data he uses, and the safety 
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human 
beings to risk their lives on. 
Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes 
from time to time articles and other information 
related to socially useful input and output of data 
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to 
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical 
- but productive of thought and an improved and 
safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which 
our children and later generations may have a fu­
ture, instead of facing extinction. 
The professional information engineer needs to 
relate his engineering to the most important and 
mo.st serious problems in the world today: war, 
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo­
sion, and many more.
