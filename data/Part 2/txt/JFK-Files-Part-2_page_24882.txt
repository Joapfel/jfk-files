As Director Colby testified before the Committee, the death of 
a foreign leader is a risk forseeable in any coup attempt. In 
the cases we have considered, the risk of death was known in 
varying degrees. It was widely known that the dissidents in 
the Dominican Republic intended to assassinate Trujillo: the 
contemplation of coup leaders to assassinate Nhu, President 
Diem's brother, was communicated to the upper levels of the 
United States Government; while the CIA and perhaps the White 
House knew that the coup ·1eaders in Chile planned to kidnap 
General Schneider, it was not anticipated that he would be killed, 
although the possibility of his death should have been recognized 
as a.forseeable risk of his kidnapping. 
4. The Plots Occurred in a Cold War Atmosphere Perceived 
to be of Crisis Proportions 
The Committee fully appreciates the importance of 
evaluating the ass~ssination plots in the historical context 
within which they occurred. In the preface to this report, we 
described the perception, generally shared within the United 
States during the depths of the Cold War, that the country 
faced a monolithic enemy in Communism. That attitude helps 
explain the assassination plots which we have reviewed, 
although it does not justify them. Those involved neverthe­
less appeared to believe they were advancing the best inter­
ests of their country.
