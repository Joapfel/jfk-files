With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselli has known him since the 50's. 
The last time he met Greenspun was when he ran into Greenspun in Los Angeles shortly 
after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few minutes. No questions 
were asked and there was no discussion wit~ Greenspun about his involvement with 
Maheu. He noted that G:eenspun has nev;er quest,ioned him about any matters. 
He noted that-he has never met Gordon Liddy, Howard Hunt or any of the 
Cuban Americans 'Who :were involved in the Watergate break-in~ He said however that 
he has been Liddy orice, and that was at Terminal Island when he was acting as a 
prison librarian. There were no discussions with Liddy. He is fairly certain he 
has never met Hunt with regard to any CIA involvement of his own. He.also noted 
that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba. 
The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoena upon Mr. Roselli 
and the decision to hold a further meeting under oath at a later date.·
