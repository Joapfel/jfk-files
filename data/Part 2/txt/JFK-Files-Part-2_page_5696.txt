5 (S) The Office of External Development (OED) is one of the most sensitive 
components within the Directorate of Operations and is responsible for the 
recruitment and placement of."non-official cover" (NOC) officers overseas who 
are responsible for the recruitment and management of foreign nationals who

'· (S) The various DO area divisions utilize WTC for immersion language 
training, covert communications training, and.other seminars and studies.where 
such training could not be accomplished through the Department of State or 
identified CIA facilities because of their pending overseas assignments. 
Hence, if WTC was associated with CIA, then the presence. of a student at WTC 
would serve to identify that officer as a soon-to-be-assigned espionage 
officer for American int~lligence -- an identification inconsistent with their 
pending diplomatic or commercial cover and the success of their mission.
