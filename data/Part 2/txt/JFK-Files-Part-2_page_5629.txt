number was 605055. Now this number 501264 
belonged to the filfu's office. So consequently 
if that particular···ca.11 went out of the main 
building ·to the f;ilms office and it had been 
transcribed befor~,-that is exactly what I 
would do, put down "previously transcribed". 
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/
