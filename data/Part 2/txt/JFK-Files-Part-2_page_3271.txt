On 20 June .1960 at .the request of .General 
Cushman, Jake Esterline joined him for. lunch, the 
p'urpose being to provide the General with sufficient 
information on the state of the anti~castro program 
so that he could bring the Vice Presigent up to date 
from the time of the Miami meeting that had taken 
place at William Pawley's house.* Among the points 
covered were the developments related to the organ­
ization of :the FRO and. the. fact that Mr.· William 
, ... 
Pawley's candidate, Senor Rub.i"o, had decided not to 
join the Frente. According to Esterline's memorandum: 
Dr.· Rubie's failure to join the Frente, 
however, has not held up progress in form­
ing: the junta, and/ or the ·other· important 
aspects of the operation. 
General Cushman was told that the Frente's headquarters 
were to be es.ta_~lished in Mexico, and it was on this 
occasion that Esterline introduced General Cushman to 
E. Howard Hunt, who was going to move to Mexico with 
the Frente.** 
* The meeting of 21 March 1960. 
** Insofar a$ can be determined, this probably was 
the first occasion on which Richard Nixon heard the 
name of E. Howard Hunt.
