INTERVIEWER:· How about your impressions regarding support from 
the White House during the Congressional investigations? 
MR. HALPERN: Again. from the outside looking in ... 
INTERVIEWER: Right. 
MR. HALPERN: I don't think the White House was very 
supportive. or at least as supportive as they might have been. 
But I think I've always thought that they might have been more 
supportive if Colby had been more honest with the White House 
in the very beginning. And the beginning to me is January 15, 
1975. before the Church Committee. And read Colby's book about 
that. I mean, he himself says. you know. says he was out of 
step. basically. And if I were sitting in the White House, why 
would I suddenly think that thi.s guy was going to work with 
me. You know, he cut my feet off at ,the stumps, at tbe hips, 
the first time around. And there is no way I can.pull him back 
now. I think the White House was concerned, I think Henry 
Kissinger was concerned about the fact of the loss of emphasis 
and the loss of capability in the Intelligence Community and 
how to stem that particular problem. And if you remember, Ford 
came out with his own plan of reorganizing the Community and 
took a bit of the•wind out of the sails of the Church 
Committee. which I thought was a smart thing to do. It may 
have been cosmetic and it may have been simply a deal. But by 
that time he was dealing with Bush in 
1
76, a different kind Rf 
a guy. And well, an Executive Order came out under Ford in 
182
