ar.d he is consistent and reliable in his performance. llis 
writing is entirely coherent and always in good form, although 
occasionally a little too clever and glib for my tastes. He has 
an excellent understanding of personal and operational security 
and cover. 
A word about versatility: Mr. K~nt does indeed have near­
native Spanish and a specific interest in Latin American affairs 
as noted in his previous fitness report; however, his general 
interests cover a much greater geographic and topical area and 
and he has no difficulty in quickly finding some common ground 
with persons of all backgrounds and nationalities. Although his 
job here in the branch rarely call~d for direct operational con­
tacts, I have no reservations about his ability to develop, 
recruit and handle all types of persons of intelligence interest. 
He is presentable, sensible, well-spoken, and a definite credit 
to the Agency in his dealings with other elements of the U~S. 
Government. 
Mr. Kent is an enthusiastic and energetic activist with 
now proven managerial abilities. His greatest asset is his q~ick, 
sharp and imaginative mind: llis only shortcoming worthy of men-
tion is a slight tend~....i.mp.ul..s.ix.ene..s.s.~in making decisions. 
My relationship with this officer has been such that we discussed 
operational and personnel matters and his handling of them at 
least several times a day; thus, special performance consultations 
with him were not considered necessary. His performance was 
fully up to our expectations of him and consistent with the high 
standards of responsibility and efficiency required in this 
branch.
