ll~dgman described the extraordinary security precautions he 
..... 
took cabling his request for confirmation of the assassination in-
structions: 
There was some special channel ... because 
it wa~ handled differently than any other 
normal message. For example, it was not put 
on a regular cable form, which, you know, 
·you have several copies for your various files. 
And it was my recollection that I personally 
carrie-d the message to the corrrr:nunicator to 
encrypt, and that was worded in a doublt-talk 
way that even the communicator would not 
necessarily know what •it was about." 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp~ 42-43.) 
This description approximates the PROP channel that was used.for 
~11 cables relating to the assassination mission. 
Hedgman testified that soon after cabling his request for con­
firmation that he was to carry out the assassination assignment, 
he received an affirmative-reply from headquarters: 
I believe I received a reply which I interpreted 
to mean yes, that he was the messenger and his 
instructions were ... duly authorized. 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 37-38.) 
Despite the cryptic nature·of the ·cables, Hedgman said "I was con­
vinced that yes, it was right." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 44, 50.) 
Hedgman did not recall receiving any indication,· either from 
Gottlieb or by cable, that he was to await further authorization 
before .using the poisons (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 38). Hedgman ex­
pressed some uncertainty about whether he "had an absolute free 
hand" to proceed with an assassination attempt without receiving, 
"final confirmation" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 38, 47, 53).
