Senator Tower~ What about Reader's Digest Selecciones, 
which is their Spanish publicatiori? Is that included? 
Mr. Aaron. 1 I assume so. 
The Chairman. Well, according to the CIA's own restric­
tions, it is excluded now, except this would simply 
extend the exclusion to s~ringers, those who do not have 
regular employment. 
Senato~ Huddleston~ And editors and executives. 
The Chairman. And editors and executives. 
Mr. Bader. The present restriction, Senator Tower, 
that has been extended by the Agency in February,_ went to 
accredited journalists, accredited to U.S. media organizations. . . ' . 
The only difference between this prohibition and the one 
already assumed by the Agency is that this.moves further 
accreditation to include those who regularly aontribute to 
U.S. media organizations or are a part of their structure. 
Mr. Kirbow. The management structure. 
Mr. Bader. The management structure, whether they· 
contribute material to or are involved directly or indirectly 
in the preparatidn of material. 
The Chairman. Weli, I think if we are going to do it, 
we had better decide on the policy. If we want to keep the 
CIA out of U.S. media both at home and abroad, and we want 
to extend ~hat to stringers ~swell, then I think ft ought 
t6 be done by statute rather than just-· a recommendation by
