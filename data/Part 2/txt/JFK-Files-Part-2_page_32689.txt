This aim and goal has already been ahcieved in Cuba. It will be achieved 
elsewhere in Latin America unless positive steps are taken to prevent it. We 
must be prepared totak,e appropriate and positive action in our own national 
·self-interest and in the interest of the collective security of the Western 
Hemisphere. 
The Communist domination and occupation of Cuba, and the resulting 
menace to our security, requires and demands that the United States be ever 
alert and vigilant to all of its sinister implications. We must exercise 
the greatest sti.rveiliance and watchfulness possible, and use all available 
resources, for the purpose of ascertaining the true military sit~ation in that 
unhappy island and to insure that we will not again be deceived and surprised. 
The entire Cuban problem, both military and political, should be accorded the_ 
highest possible priority by our governmental officials to the end that 
the evil threat which the Soviet occupation of Cuba represents will be 
eliminated at an early date.
