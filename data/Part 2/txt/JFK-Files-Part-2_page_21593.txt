INTERVIEW AND MEETINJ SUMMARY 
possible assignment, the newsman would contact 
the FBI to ask what was going on, this would go 
to Hoover, who would raise hell with the CIA 
director. But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi­
cation between the FBI and CIA was almost non­
existent by 1952. 
Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is 
so compartmented. He had contacts at all _levels, 
exchanging ideas for operations. He would push 
CIA ideas in the FBI. Flaps would come up. He 
would stamp them out and say "get on with the job". 
The FBI was easier to control since it was cen 
tralized. Papich's relations with Hoover 
go up and down. He frequently asked to 
field -- and sometimes Hoover consider 
him there. But by the 1950's, most

No formal consideration was the FBI 
to limiting its role to Tolson 
probably thought it shoul over never 
expressed a desire to give intelligence 
job. Nobody, including Tolson, knew Hoover's 
reasons for doing what he did. He had his own 
conversations and contacts in the White House, 
Congress, and his personal sources. He knew what 
he was doing and had "a nose and ear for the 
political climate in Washington". This was true 
for "risky" operations. 
Papich believes it would be disastrous to give 
both foreign and domestic intelligence duties to 
a CIA. While there would be advantages in 
coordinating fragmented sources, it is a risk to 
liberty, like a national police·. 
Papich did not recall any significant plan to 
improve coordination in 1958 when FBI joined USIB. 
FBI was part of the USIB predecessor group. 
The CIA would suggest joint field operations but 
Hoover would rarely buy it. This was like his 
reluctance to join any operation with any other 
agencies. He thought the FBI should always have 
control, a comm role. For ex mple, Allan 
Dulles discusse 1th Hoover.
