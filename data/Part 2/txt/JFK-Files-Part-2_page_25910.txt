MEMORANDUM 
TO: 
FROM: MIKE EPSTEIN 
DATE: JUNE 20, 1975 
SUBJECT: GIANCANA 
I expect· that no one will write off the alleged Giancana murder as a 
"third-rate homicide, 
11 
and that, it will grow and grow and grow.. It is clearly 
the most volatile media issue of the season. 
Given the barest outlines of what allegedly happened, and taking them 
at face value, we have a responsibility to take action under 1~ U.S. Code, 
Section 1505: 
Whoever ... by ... force ... endeavors to ... impede any 
witness ... in connection with·any inquiry or investigation 
being ha.d by ... any committee of either House ... or 
'(I 
I 
Wh9ever ... by ... force ... obstructs, or impedes or 
endeavors to ... '()bstruct, or impede ... the due and proper I • , 
ex~rcise of the ppwer of inquiry under which such inquiry 
or :investigation is being had by ... any committee of 
ei½her House ... 
Sh~ll be fined riot· more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more 
than five years, .or both. 
•• In short, if Giancana :was a "witness" (which status he might have 
achieved by mere location contacts made by staff) and he was killed to 
: , 
prevent his ~ppearance; .or i'.hdeed even if he ~sn't yet a_ "witness" but 
this was a "~essage" to ali, witnesses to keep quiet (e.g. Roselli and Maheu), 
there is a violation of law which ~ might have the responsibility to investigate. 
Beyond what our respon.~ibility is, it seems clear to me that most extreme 
I 
possibilities of what might actually have happened dictate that we come up 
with a well-~easoned position and plan -- after careful,. deliberate, intensive
