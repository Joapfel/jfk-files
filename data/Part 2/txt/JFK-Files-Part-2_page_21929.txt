the man's fears were well-founded and had promised to seek a 
* pistol. 
Although there is no direct evidence linking any of ~1ese 
pistols to the assassination of 'l'rujillo, a June 7, 1961, CIA 
memorandum, unsigned and with no attribution as to source, 
states that two of the three pistols were passed by {~we~ to 
(i. 
'en•1i ~ a United States citizen who was in direct 
contact with the action element of the dissident group. It 
should also be noted that the assassination was apparently con­
ducted with almost complete reliance upon hand weapons. Whether 
one or more of these .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistols 
eventuallv came into the hands of the assassins 
and, if so, whether they were used in connection with the 
assassination, remain open questions. 
Both Dearborn and,~~@J, testified that thev regarded the oistols· 
as weaoons for self-defense purposes and they never 
considered them in any way connected with the then-current 
I o3 
assassination plans. (Dearborn 7/29, p.7o;'ffl~ pp.38,73) 
However, none of the Headquarters cables inquired as to the 
~ purpose for which the handguns were sought and~• s cabl_e 
stated only that Dearborn wanted them for passage to dissidents. 
(Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61) Indeed, the March 24, l'.!61, 
v3, 
*Dearborn is clear in his recollection that he asked ©wen to 
request only one pistol. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp.3O,31) 0~ei ,Q) 
on the other hand, testified that if his cables requec.c.ea three 
pistols for Dearborn then Dearborn must have asked for three 
pistols.03,~ p. 72) 
The pis to' s were, however, apparently sent in one package 
(Hi.,!S to Station cables,3/27/61 and 3/24/61) and Dearborn testi­
fied that, what he believed to be the one gun, came ''wraooed 
up" and that he passed it. (Dearborn, --7/29 ,p.3O) ·'
