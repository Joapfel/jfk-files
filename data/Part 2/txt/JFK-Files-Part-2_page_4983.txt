CUBAN POET A1'J7J FIRST HUSBAND OF TERESA_(JEERNANDEZ.J-J-M.ZillDONES_(A ____ _ 
rrEMBBR-GF-THE CCC) , WAS SIGNIFICANT TO THE CCC BECAUSE IT CALLED 
fNTO QUESTION WHERE ALCIDES' LOYALTIES LAY. ALCIDES AND FERNANDEZ 
yAD ONE CHILD, A SON, TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE DIVORCED AROUND 
~ATE 1993. FERNANDEZ HAD REMARRIED AND WAS LIVING WITH RONALDO 
((ROQUE)) (COUSIN OF REINALDO ROQUE), AND ALCIDES WAS SPENDING 
I 
roNSIDERABLE TIME AT THE ROQUE RESIDENCE, PRESUMABLY TO BE WITH 
HIS SON. THE CCC BECAME CONCERNED WITH THE SECURITY OF THE I 
SITUATION AS FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO CCC INFORMATION AND WAS I 
fSSESSED AS BEING EMOTIONAL AND TENDING TO CONFIDE TOO MUCH. 
~TINEZ-AMORES WAS DISPATCHED BY THE CCC TO FEEL OUT ALCIDES, AND 
REPORTED THAT HE SPOKE COHERENTLY AND LOGICALLY AGAINST THE 
I 
FURRENT REGIME. MARTINEZ-AMORES APPEARED TO BE REASSURED. 
pUBSEQUENTLY HOWEVER, IN CONVERSATION WITH ALCIDES, REINALDO ROQUE 
LEARNED THAT ALCIDES WAS PART OF A DELEGATION OF THE CUBAN 
I 
1
NATIONAL UNION OF WRITERS AND ARTISTS (UNION NACIONAL DE 
ESCRITORES Y ARTISTAS DE CUBA - UNEAC) THAT VISITED MADRID 
SOMETIME AROUND 1994. WHILE THERE, ALCIDES SAID THAT HE WAS 
INVITED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER UNEAC DELEGATES TO LUNCH WITH 
CARLOS ALBERTO MONTANER. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE LUNCHEON WITH 
MONTANER MUST CERTAINLY HAVE RECEIVED CUBAN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL, 
AND THE GROUP MUST HAVE INCLUDED CUBAN SECURITY PERSONNEL.) 
ALCIDES TOLD ROQUE THAT ON HIS RETURN TO CUBA, HE ATTENDED THE 
FUNERAL FOR A SISTER (NFI) OF FIDEL CASTRO AND DELIVERED THE 
FUNERAL ORATION. FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL, HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE 
EMBRACED BY MINISTER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES GENERAL 
RAUL ((CASTRO)) RUZ.
