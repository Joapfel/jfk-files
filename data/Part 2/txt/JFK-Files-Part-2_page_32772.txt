through the program definition phase of the TFX project. That I attach 
great importance to the fulfillment of established military requirements 
is, I believe, demonstrated by my refusal to terminate the program . 
definition phase until I was satisfied that the military requirements of 
both the Navy and Air Force had been met. That I attach great importance 
to the recognition of econ.omic and technological limiting condition.s is, 
I believe, demonstrated by my selection of General Dynamics ·as the 
contractor that most clearly recognized .the effects of these limitations 
. on the task to be achieved. 
I do not feel that this is a case which presents a civilian--military 
conflict but rather one of placing emphasis whe.re it must be placed. 
In the final analysis, judgments differed. In reaching my decision; I 
considered the recommendations of my various military and civilian 
• advisors as well as other available evidence, but I had the final 
responsibility. The basic judgments on my part which determined my 
decision were: 
- Both the General Dynamics and the Boeing designs 
met etated military requirements and would provide 
significant improvements in combat capabilities of 
the Navy and the Air Force. 
The _General Dynamics proposal resulted in 
minimum diver~ence from a common design 
compatible with the separate mission of the Navy 
and Air Forcei> thus insuring the substantial savings
