ROBERT GATES (director, CIA): Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. 
I'm here to provide my views on House Resolution--4-54-;·-··-­
the- assassination materials disclosure act of 1992. I very much 
appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee, just 
as I did before your colleagues in the Senate las-t Tuesday. 
I can summarize my statement, I think. It is largely 
the same as the one I did earlier. Let me just say, as I have 
said, that I'm in complete agreement with the effort to 
underline the joint resolution, that is, the effort to 
declassify and make available to the public as quickly as 
possible government documents relating to the assassination of 
President Kennedy. • 
Further, I believe that'maximum disclosure will 
discredit the theory that CIA had anything to do with his 
murder. 
I have undertaken a number of efforts at CIA to 
accelerate the declassification of historical materials, 
creating a new organization to do that. It will be classified, 
or review for declassification, all documents over 30 years old, 
and Soviet estimates up to 10 years ago. 
I've asked them to take as their first priority the 
review for declassification a review of the documents relating 
to_ the assassination of President Kennedy. And we have 
proceeded with that, without waiting for legislation. 
And I've indicated earlier this week, we've 
declassified the first set of these records, the pre­
assassination Oswald file. And these have now been transferred 
to the National Archives for release.
