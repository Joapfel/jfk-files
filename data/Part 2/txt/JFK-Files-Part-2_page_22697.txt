relate to the third part of the damage part on Golitzen 
what·did Golitzen kno~ that they did not know he knew? What 
agents in the West could be under our control as a result of 
Golitzen's disclosures regarding those things? 
And you can see the tre.m_e!19-.~t1s quali_~y _ thia man had of 
almost getting from our man those four or five crytonyrns, 
which would have told them what they wanted to know, because 
there are cases they are not sure whether he knows or doesn't 
know, and so on. And these are officials, and so on. 
So he wasn't given that. He was given stJff that was ----···-· 
sort of medium low level stuff, you couldn't call it chicken 
feed but we never told him we disbelieved in him. And he 
said, if you do those things for me, I have an opportunity, 
because of my mother and so on, to become Head of the J'\rnerican 
Department of the KGB. 
And the other thing he wanted, was, we took him to the 
Soviet Agency and we came out later for contacts, and he state 
there was a telegram there, and he had been requested to 
acquire all the information possible on the whereabouts of 
Golitzen and Nosenko. And I was actually in Wisconsin. /\nd

proposal put up by that individual that would expose -- and I 
use the crytonym name of Golitzen -- dn~'t. 
A week la,ter is when he got to·Moscow and he sent a cable 
to tell us that he can give them word on everything on 
TOP SECRET
