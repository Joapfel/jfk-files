First, it assumes that Dulles himself knew of the plots, a 
matter which is not certain. Second, it assumes that Dulles 
went privately to the two Presidents--a course of action 
which Helms, who had far more ~overt action experience than 
Bissell, testified was precisely what the doctrine of 
plausible denial forbade CIA officials from doing. Third, 
it necessarily assumes that the Presidents would understand 
from a "circumlocutious" description that assassination was 
being discussed. 
The chain of assumptions is far too speculative for the 
Committee to make findings inplicating Presidents who are not 
able to speak for themselves. Moreover, it is inconsistent 
with Bissell's other testimony that "formal and explicit" 
approval would be required for assassination,* and contrary 
to the testimony of all the Presidential advisors, the men 
closest to both Eisenhower and Kennedy. 
* If the evidence concerning President Eisenhower's order 
to assassinate Lumumba is correct, it should be weighed against 
Bissell' s testimony concerning cL:cu.o1loc:ut.i.ous briefings of the 
Presidents in the Castro case. First, the Lumumba case would 
imply that President Eisenhower and Dulles did discuss such 
matters bluntly and not circumlocutiously. Second, the Lumumba 
example indicates that the President would discuss such matters 
openly in an appropriate forum, and would not need to be 
approached privately. Third, it can be inferred from Bissell's 
testimony in the Castro case that if President Eisenhower had 
told Dulles that he approved of the ,.lllot, Dulles would not have 
told anyone else of that fact. Yet ~.9ttl:heb'"B testi1!1_ony fn the 
Lumumba case states that he had been fold ·of Presidential autho­
rization for assassination by Bissell, who in turn assumed he 
was told by Dulles.
