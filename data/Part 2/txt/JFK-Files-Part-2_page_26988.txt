~rea ·now by the i1iani Stat~~n? 
A There are no domestic activ~ties at all in the 
~iami Station. All Cuban ac;:ivities have been mov~d back 
here to '-Ieadauarters. The :_ami Station now is comoletely 
and solely involved in tne ~ntelligence in the Caribbean. 
Q Does the '. 1iami Sta ;:ion -- I beg your pardon --
does the Headquarters comccnent that now handles the Cuban 
situation in Miami run any s.::rents in the Cuban community? 
.'\ No. \•/ell. 2.et ::ie ex?lain that to you. ,·le do have 
a career a.gent who has bee!:. ·,-.ri th us for a good many years-
in :-!iami and we do use nic.. ~o contact relatives of Cubans 
who 2re still in Cuba. ! ~e2n, relatives who are in the U~S. 
~ho jave relatives in C~ba. 
Now, this is done ~rincipally with the idea of a 
cecruitment target, determ~ne weaknesses or strengths, ':.his 
type of t:iinq. Ile does con;:act these people all over the 
United States. If we come across an individual that. looks like 
he :i1.ic;ht be recruitable, or ~erhaps we could even double him, 
·~e will, after we make our ;=eliminary assessment, and we 
~ind out where relatives ani these types of people are, we 
will ~sk this career aqent er instruct him to go contact 
these oeople, be it New York. New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever. 
So you use Cuban. ~ow citizens or aliens in this 
counc=y, as access agen~s.
