the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved. 
DCID 1/10-1. 
7~ (U) National Security Considerations: The importance of 
suc~~ordination with foreign governments prior to the release 
of their information cannot be overemphasized. Should CIA, or 
for that matter any (USG) agency fail to coordinate where 
required, not only would it ·be a violation of the aforementioned 
E.O. and directives, but it would chill relationships it has 
developed with foreign services over the years. If such lack of 
coordination became known, foreign services would hesitate to 
share crucial intelligence information with CIA if they believed 
it would be released, in spite of any agreements or U.S. laws to 
the contrary, without their consent. Furthermore, the U.S. could 
not expect foreign services to safeguard U.S. government 
• information that it shares with its liaison partners in order to 
pursue authorized intelligence and foreign policy objectives. 
8. (S) According to its legal obligations described herein, 
CIA coordinates the dissemination and/or release of foreign 
government information. Its obligation to do so is similar to 
its obligation to coordinate declassification efforts with 
another USG agency should the CIA possess any of that agency's 
documents. For example, CIA could not declassify and release to 
the public FBI information located in CIA files without 
coordinating with that agency. Similarly, CIA has no authority 
to unilaterally declassify foreign government documents or 
information in its files.
