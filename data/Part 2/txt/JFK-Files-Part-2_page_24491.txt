"Senator :Morgan: Mr. Bissell, it's a serious 
matter to attribute knowledge of this sort to 
the President of the U.S., especially one who 
cannot speak for himself. Is it fair to assume 
that out of an abundance of caution you are simply 
telling us that you have no knowledge unless you 
are absolutely certain? ... I gather that you think 
... it [assassination plot information] came out 
but because of the seriousness of the accusation 
you are just being extremely cautious ... is that 
a fair assumption to make? 
Bissell: That is very close to a fair assumption, 
sir. It's just that I have no direct knowledge, 
first-hand knowledge of his [President Kennedy's] 
being advised, but my belief is that he knew of it 
[ assassination plans] . " (Bissell, 6/9, p. 56). 
When asked why he had not himself informed White House officials or the 
-
President of the assassination plots, Bissell said since Dulles was the DCI, 
he "left the question of advising senior officials of the government and 
obtaining clearances in Allen Dulles' hands" (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 2~, 33). 
As with President Eisenhower, Bissell said that, based upon his testimony 
that Dulles knew about the assassination plot, he "assumed" that Dulles 
"had at least intimated [to President Kennedy] 
that some such thing was underway. 1 ' (Bissell, 
6/9/75, p. 33). * 
* The Presidential logs from the Kennedy Administration indicate only one 
meeting before the Bay of Pigs invasion at which the President and Allen Dulles 
may have met privately. This meeting took place on March 25, 1961. (There is 
no record of the meeting. We feel canpelled to state that the fact of this 
. meeting, on the evidence available, is of little, if any significance or 
relevance.
