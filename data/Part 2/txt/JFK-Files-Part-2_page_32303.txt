· 6 December 1962 sent by the Italian Embassy in~\ 
• Habana to the Italian Mjnistry of Foreign Affair~~ 
In my dispatch of 9 November I reported on some of the 
considerations. regarding the consequences which the recent 
crisis could have on the internatipnal position of Cuba. I 
will now add some comments on the \i.bnjecture which has been 
reported by some members of our repres8ntations. 
1) The possjbility that there will soon be a loosening of 
the political and economic ties with the USSR appears to me 
. to be nil at this time. The fact that the talks with Mikoyan 
,;7er·e-~lon~-a-nd-difficul t and that Castro expressed in private. 
his opinion on Khrushchev (wishing that Stalin were still 
alive) does not mean that he can and w{ll renounce ·that,~ 
Soviet assistance which is vital to him.· This assistanc~ 
cannot be replaced by the Chinese. 
Certainly the Chinese Ambassador to Habana will have 
done everythiag possible to convince Castro to resist (and 
in fact the latter held firm on the question of inspection). 
Certainly the activity of the Chinese representation here is 
intense. But the Peiping Government cannot replace the USSR 
. in economic assistance~ It does not seem probable to me 
that /China7 can furnish more than it has furnished to date, 
which-consists of second quality foodstuffs, rather sli.oddy
