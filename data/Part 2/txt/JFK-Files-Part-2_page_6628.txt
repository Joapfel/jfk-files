S. Compliance Depositions. Starting_ on or about August 1, 1997, the Review 
Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions, 
under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other 
agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The 
decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made on a 
case by case basis, taking into account the i.tri.portance of the agency to the 
work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account 
fully for its c;ompliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review 
Board decides to commence a compli~ce deposition of an agency, the 
responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with 
respect to any ·and all issues relating to the- agencys record search, 
including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the 
destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the 
Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a 
deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation. 
We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your 
Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your posi~on with 
respect to the-provisions outlined in this letter. To'the extent·tllatyou have any 
questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to 
contact our General Counsel, T. Jeremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.
