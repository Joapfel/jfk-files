Posner related that other reactions to his book included an accusation that 
he was a CIA agent, a computer network asking its members to discredit his b~ok, 
-and demonstrators in. front of his hotel. See Geoffrey c. Ward, The Most Dur~

The general assumptions the Board holds about what happened inform how it 
assesses the value of a particular documenc to the public.· If the Board assumes 
that Oswald murdered the President, and consequently looks only for information 
that speaks to his role, it is likely, on national security grounds, to postpone 
certain kinds of information. If the Board assumes that the murder was a 
conspiracy, then much of what seems irrelevant to the Oswald explanation may 
actually have great currency. n202_The intelligence agencies rely on the 
[*35] [*J6] theory that Oswald did it and that he did it alone~ n203 To

n202. The Board adopted a broad definition of an •assassination recordA with 
just such issues in mind. See 36 C.F.R. pt. 1400 (1995). The pertinent sections 
dealing with the scope for interpret.ing the JFK statute read as follows: 
1400.1 Scope of assassination reco~d. 
(a) An assassinat·ion record includes, but is not limited to, all records, 
pu:bl.ic and private, regardless of how labeled or identified, that document, 
descri~e. report on, analyze or interpret act.ivities, persons, or events 
reasonably related tot.he assassination of President John F. Kennedy and 
investigations of or inquiries into the assassination. •
