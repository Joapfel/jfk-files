Phillips, page 16. . CllfflMITTEE SENSITIVE 
CIA #3665 indicates that a pitch to Calderon was to be made 
by someone outside of Mexico. "If it was someone from the CIA 
there would be something in her 201 files ... but possibly it 
could have been run out of a soft file." He said that her file 
should be substantial. He said he could not explain why the 
Calderon conversation would not have been in her 201 while it 
was in Oswald's. 
Mr. Phillips was informed of the testing of the impulse 
camera beginning on September 27, 1963. He stated that he had 
"no recollection" of the disposition of the photographs obtained 
during that testing. 
Mr. Phillips stated that if another cable (a third) was 
sent to HQ regarding Oswald prior to the assassination that he 
did not know about it. 
Mr. Phillips was asked if there was a way for HQ and a 
Station to communicate without the cornmo becoming part of the 
permanent record. He stated that there was at least one way 
that he knew of in ~ddition to telephone and personal courier. 
He said that it was techriically possible to set up a ~elcom" 
system by persuading the cable operators to set it up on a 
"back channel". He stated that such a system would work on a 
question and answer i:tieme. He said "It has been done on occassion 
but I don't recall it ever having been done in Mexico." Mr. 
Phillips also stated that he did not believe that there had 
been any telephone communications concerning the assassination. 
Refuting documents were not shown.
