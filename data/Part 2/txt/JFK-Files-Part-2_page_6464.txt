b, Conduct physical and psychological military harassment 
ot the Cuban ..reg11!18 and covert and clandestine operations as 
directed. 
c, undertake military action in Cuba in accordance with 
conti~ncy plans approved by the Joint Chieta ot Start and. 
directed by the President. The primary pu,:-pose ot the us 
military intervention would be to assure the overthrow ot 
the castro communist government and to· assist in the establish-·'. 
ment ot a new, non-coamnmist government acceptable to the 
Ullited States, 
20, ~ implementation ot any ot the suggested courses ot 
action- irj this study would involve mB11¥_agencies· ot the Uhited 
States Qovemment. It would appear neceaaary, therefore, that 
one single governmental. organization be given the primary 
responsibility tor developing a national plan. 
21,. Because of the extensive-military operations involved, 
the Joint Chiefs ot Staff' should participate in the development 
ot this national.plan. In addition, tor a contrived revolt, 
they should be assigned the specific responaibility t~r develop­
ing the·m111tary and paramilitary aspects of the plan. This 
would :require the Joint Chie_f's of' Staff to seek a determ1nat1on 
under NSAM 57 when a revolt contrived by-the uni~ed States were 
an operation large enough to warrant control of covert forces 
by the Department ot Defense and that CIHCIANT be designated as 
the DOD agent. In this connection, CINCLANT has developed a 
specific concept tor political and militaey action in Cuba, 
CIHCIANT CONCEPl' 
22. The .CINCLANT c~ncept provides for inciting a revolt in 
Cuba, f'ol~ow~d by overt, large-scale US military operations-. 
The pl'Oposed timing of operations perm1ts completion in 15-18 
months. Supporting operations by CIA. State, and USIA ·w111 
be required.
