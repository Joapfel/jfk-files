Sergy Alexandrovech Uslov Interview 
Page 4. 
It is surmised that as Golovachev became 
garrulous while drinking, the KGB discovered that he was 
still in. possession of a group photograph depicting Lee, 
Marina and Golovachev among other people. Accordingly, 
sometime in 1971 or 1972, the KGB took the photo. 
Uslov explained that he wrote the complete story 
in Russian and submitted it to the CIA.for transmittal to 
the HSCA. They advised that it b~ translated to English. 
In November of 1977, he sent the manuscript to Radio Freedom 
on 42nd Street in New York City for translation and to be 
:f;orwarded to the Committee. It.is his belief that he was 
contacted by the HSCA as a result of reading his manuscript. 
He is presently attempting to locate his copy, which is in 
Russian, ·for our perusal. 
A:f;ter giving a full dissertation on life in Russia, 
Uslov requested that h£s identity remain anonymbus. He wanted 
to give his information only to the HSCA.
