O'Donnell said that be cabled progress repotts on his plan to 
CIA headqua:~ters (O'Donnell,· ~/11/75, p. 26). He also said that 
he informed the Chief of Station about his plan (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, 
p. 56). 
In connection with his effort to draw Lumumba out of UN cus­
tody, O'Donnell arranged for a CIA agent, whose code name was 
QJWIN, to come to the Congo to wbrk with •him (O'Donnell, ~/11/75, 
p. 19): 
What I wanted to use him for ·was ... 
cbunter-espionage [.] ... • I had to screen 
the U.S. participation in this ... by 
using a foreign national whom we knew, 
.trusted, and had worked with ... the 
idea was for me to use him as an alter 
ego. (O'Donnell Tr., pp .. 19~20.) 
In mid-November, two cables from Leopoldville urged CIA head­
quarters to send QJWIN as soon as possible (CIA Cable IN 41261, 
Leopoldville to Director, 11/11/60) with this message: 
LOCAL OPERATIONAL CIRCUl·i.STANCES REQUIRE 
IMMEDIATE EXPEDITION OF OJHIN TRAVEL TO 
LEOPOLDVILLE. (CIA Cabl~ IN 41556 ,· 
Leopoldville to Directoi, 11/13/60.) 
* A ca_ble from the Chi~f of Station to 'D.veedy in mid-November 
reported that the double guard of United Nations and Congolese 
troops around Lumumba' s residence thwarted this plan: ''CONCENTRIC 
RINGS OF DEFENSE MAKE ESTABLISHHENT.OF OBSERVATION POST IMPOSSIBLE" 
(CIA Cable IN 42478, Chief of Station to Tweedy, 11/14/60).
