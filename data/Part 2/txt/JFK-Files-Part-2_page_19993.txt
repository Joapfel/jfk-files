November 27, 1967 
TO ALL AMERICAN "(NOMEN~ 
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress_ 
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a, 
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be eiected­
to Congress. 
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who 
:must be concerned with the needs a.nd development of the 
human race. I have always fought for the digrJty of all 
human beings -- for those of the present as well as those 
of future generations. 
I will continue to struggle as long as I live. 
I hope all women \\.ill respond to the following CALL, and 
join me in Washington on January· 8~ 196!:\ the opi3ning 
day of Congress. 
With highest hopes,
