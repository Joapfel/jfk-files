a missile gap to a great superiority over the Soviet Union, and that 
this was obviously the wrong way. Mr. McCone said he agreed that this 
was definitely wrong. Mr. Murphy asked whether the government was 
putting out this information. Mr. McCone said he didn't know and that 
he felt it was wrong and dangerous and would develop complacency and 
might even result in an economy minded Congress cutting the Defense 
budget drastically. Mr. Murphy noted that it was implicit that we should 
have precise knowledge on what was going on inside Russia. Mr. McCone 
said that in his presentations to Congre_ss he specifically made the 
reservation each time that there were obviously things we didn't know. 
Dr. Killian noted that even photography can be wrong and can give an 
erroneous impression; e.g., that nothing is there. Mr. McCone 
acknowledged that this was a danger. Dr. Killian asked whether 
Congress, the President and the Secretary of Defense understood this 
danger. Mr. McCone replied that he always stressed it, and he also 
stressed that intelligence was commencing to have ahnost absolute 
dependence on photography.
