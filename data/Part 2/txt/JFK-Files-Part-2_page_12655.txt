SECURITY INVESTIGATJ:ON. -87.A 
STATUTES 
There are four principal statutes to consider in security investigations: 
Public Law 733 as implemented by Executive Order (EO) 10450, Smith Act of 
1940, Internal Security Act of 1950 (ISA-50), and Communist Control Act of 
1954. On occasion, other statutes may be applicable, such as seditious 
conspiracy, treason, fraud against Government, and Registration Act. 
1. Public Law 733 as implemented by EO 10450 • 
2. 
3. 
President, by Executive Order 10450, dated 4-27-53, established govern~ 
ment-wide employee security program, based on authority and approach set 
forth by Congress in Public Law 733, enacted on 8-26-50. 
Section B{a) of EO 10450 provides that investigations conducted pursuant 
to this order shall be designed to develop information as to whether em­
ployment or retention in employment i-n Federal service of person being 
investigated is clearly consistent with interests of national security. 
Such information relates, among other things, to following: 
''Membership in, or affiliation .or sympathetic association with, 
any foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, 
group, or combination of persons which is totalitarian, Fascist, 
communist, or subversive, or which has adopted, or shows, a 
policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of 
force or violence to deny other persons their rights under the 
Constitution of the United States, or which seeks to aH;er the 
form of government of the United State~ by unconstitutional 
means." 
.Attorney General's part of employee security program consists of making 
full field investigations through FBI; maintaining list of totalitarian, 
.fascist, communist, or subversive organizations; and giving agencies 
advice in establishing and maintaining their security programs. 
Smith Act of 1940 (Title 18, use, § 2385). Advocating overthrow of Govern­
ment 
Smith .A.ct prohibits knowingly advocating or teaching overthrow of Govern­
ment by force or violence; publishing or circulating written or printed 
material with intent to cause such overthrow; attempting to organize 
group of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage such overthrow; and 
conspiring to commit these offenses, Penalty for conviction carries fine 
of not more than $20,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than 20 years 
and shall be inelegible for employment by U. S. or any department or 
agency thereof for five years next following his conviction. Decisions 
by Supreme Court on 6-7-57 and 6-5-61 established new eviden·tia.ry stand­
ards, such as proof of incitement to action, which must be met by Govern-
ment in future prosecutions under this act. · 
Internal Security Act of 1950 (Title 50, use, §§ 781-816) 
Internal Security Act of 1950 {ISA-50) became effective 9-23-50. It gen­
erally provides for registration of communist-action and communis~ front 
organizations; amends obstruction of justice statute; implements espionage 
and sabotage statutes and various immigration, and naturalization regula-• 
tions; prohibits contributing to establishment of totalitarian dictator­
ship; and provides for detention of individuals in case of national 
emergency. Act was amended 1-2-68 to delete requirement that communist 
organiz2tions and their members register with Attorney General, a. pro­
cedure ruled unconstitutional by Supreme Court because it violated con­
stitutional rights against self-incriminati-on. This manual section i's 
limited to ISA-50 provisions pertaining to communist-action organizations, 
communist front organizations, contributing to establishment of total­
itarian dictatorship, and detention of indivi~uals in case of emergency.
