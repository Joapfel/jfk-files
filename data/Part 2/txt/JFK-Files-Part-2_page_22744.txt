indicate that you believe that this decentralization, lack of 
compartrnentation and in general, spreading the counterintellige 
function around is eventually going to lead to a breakdown in 
the end product. We're not going to be getting what we should 
b~ getting. You may be getting bigger statistics, and on the

not. 
Mr. Miler. You're not going to get substance, 
Mr. di Genova. Why WlS that decision made? That seems to 
be so fundamentally apparent by the way you explain it? 
the Director must have made that decision for a reason? 
Do yo..i know why? 
Surely; 
! 
Mr. Angleton. Mr. Miler has known him more than -- lonycr;

Mr. Miler. Yes, 1•1{ offer my opinion on it. 
Mr. diGenova. We would like to have it. 
Mr. Miler. The basic reason is that neither the current

counterintelligence actually is and what function it has, and 
wh~t the CIA's responsibility is for counterintelligence to 
the nation. That is my persona-! opini6n. They do not -- they 
have not had experience in counterintelligence. They've never 
worked in counterintelligence. And quite frankly, they· do not 
understand the problems involved in counterintelligence.
