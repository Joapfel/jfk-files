Re WFO report of SA JERRY M. GRAVES, dated 12/lo/f/2. 
On 12/27 /72, :wF 11 Q,2,-7-& advised that some of the 
internal conflicts within the "Furies" Organization had·been 
settled, but there are no plans to reinstitute publication 
of the paper. Source stated that most remaining members 
are writing articles for other lesbian orientated publications 
and periodicals. 
Mrs. JEWEL JOHNSON, 1117 Anacostia Avenue, S.E., 
Washington, D.C. (WDC), (protect identity) owner of property 
at 219 11th Street, S.E., WDC, advised on 1/16/73 that 
apparently this dwelling is being occupied by the same 
group of women who rented it, since the rent continues to 
be paid. 
She added however, that about 6 weeks ago, she 
attempted to inspect the premises and found no one present 
at that time. 
She has driven by the residence several times at 
night since then, and has not noted any lights on in the 
house, nor has several attempted phone calls been answered. 
Baltimore and New York furnish results of previously 
requested investigation. 
WFO will continue to follow activities of "Furies" 
members.
