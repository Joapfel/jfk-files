I a representative designated by Betancourt, a.pd chaired by Figueres. The 
. I 
council had its first organ:i.zational meeting in San Jose on 12 May 1961. 
f Subject to CIA's review of the council's proposed program and with the I . 
concurrence of President Betancourt, CIA ha~ indicated· to Betancourt 
and F:i.gueres that it is prepared:·to support: tl:ie council"s program in 
the amount of $15,000 a month. It is Figueres' initial concept th?,t the 
council will undertake propaganda activities directed against Trujillo,

not anti-U,S. and will make them more approachable and amenable to

U.S. Government objectives once Trujillo is overthrown. (2) The conduct
