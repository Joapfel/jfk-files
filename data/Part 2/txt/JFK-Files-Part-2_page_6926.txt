Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: 
I am honored to have this opportunity to testify before you 
on the legislation to require the government to release its records 
pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I 
appear on behalf of the Assassination Archives and Research Center 
("the AARC"), of which I am President. The AARC is a private, non­
profit organization which collects, preserves and disseminates 
information and materials on political assassinations. The AARC 
is funded by membership dues and donations from the public. I am 
an attorney specializing in Freedom of Information Act litigation, 
and have litigated well over 100 such lawsuits. over the past 
twenty years I have represented nearly all of the major authors and 
researchers who have litigated their Freedom of Information Act 
• - -· 
requests for records pertaining to the assassination of President 
Kennedy. To -date, I have handled over fifty such lawsuits. 
I have carefully studied the proposed legislation. I have 
also read the letter which you received from the Department of 
Justice. I have heard that the Administration ~ay seek to achieve 
its goals, particularly that of using more restrictive standards 
for release of Executive Branch records, by issuing an executive 
order rather than awaiting action by Congress. In my mind the only 
thing worse than see_ing the Justice Department's wishes granted in 
legislation would be to see them set forth in a stand-alone 
executive order .which goes unchallenged by Congress.-Legislation 
is needed to bring each bran~h of government which holds records
