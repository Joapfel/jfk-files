iielms testified that "I remember vividly (the pressure to overthrow 
•··, Castro) was very intense." (Helms, 6/13, p. 26.) Helms stated that this pres­
sure intensified during the period of Operation }~ngoose during late 1961 and

throu2,hout 19E,2,. and then continued on through much of 19(;3. (llelms, 6/13, p. 27.) 
As these pressures rose, "obviously the extent of the rr:cans that one thought 
were available, obvious increased too." (Ilelms, G/13, p. 26.) 
Helrns st2ted that during the Mongoose Operations period "it was r,iade abundantly 
clear ... to everybody involved in the operation that the desire was to 8Ct rid of 
the Castro re8ime and to z;et rid of Castro ... the point was that no limitations 
were nut on this injunction." (Helms, 7/17, p. 16-17). In Helms' testimony, 
the following exchanr,c occurred: ... 
"Senator M~thias: 'Let me draw an example from history. 
When Thomas A. Beckett was proving to be an annoyance, 
as Castro, the King said who will rid me of this man. 
He didn't say to somebody go out and murder him. He said 
who will rid me of this man, and let it go at that. 
"Mr. Helms: 1 'l'hat is a warming reference to the problem. ' 
"Senator Mathias: 'You feel that spans the generations 
and the centuries?' 
11
Mr. Helms: ·, I think it does, sir.' 
!!Senator Mathias: 'And that is typical of the kind of thing 
which might be said, ·which might be taken by the director or 
by anybody else as presidential authorization to go forward?' 
. "Mr. Helms: 'That is right. But in answer to that, I re­
alize that one sort of grows up in [ the] tradition of the 
time and I think that any of us would have found it very 
difficult to discuss assassinations with a President of the 
U.S. I just think we all had the feeling that we're hired 
out to keep those things out of the oval office.' 
"Senator J-1athias: 'Yet at the same time you felt that some 
spark had been transmitted, that that was within the .per..,. 
missible limits?' 
11Mr. Helms: 'Yes, and if he had disappeared from the scene 
they would not have been unhappy. 1 1
