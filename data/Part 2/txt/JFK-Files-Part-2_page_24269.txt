Indeed, new proprietaries have.been formed within the last 
several years. 
In terms of U.S .. budgetary impact, Table I indicates that 
proprietaries do not add much new capital· to CIA available resources 
-- i.e., while they have a very large expenditure level and momentum 
over the years, the "cross-order" phenomenon means that most of 
these expenditures originated in CIA and other U.S. Government 
appropriations and that net profits generated by outside business 
or investment have been relatively small. On the other hand, another 
way of interpreting the figures is to observe that nearly half the 
$1.6 billion gross income of CIA proprietaries has been supplied 
by sources outside CIA. 
Table II shows the pattern of income, expense, and net U.S. 
investment for the twenty largest proprietaries now active, review­
ing their financial experience in the twelve months preceding 
·June 30. 1975, or the indicated reference date. The two biggest 
proprietaries, Air America and .MHMUTUAL, are seen to dwarf the 
others. Air America will be-phased out by June 30, 1976, ending 
CIA's owned airlift and returning an estimated $20 million to the. 
U.S. rr·easury. MHMUTUAL will continue. 
Today, the CIA operates 45 major proprietaries, of which 25 
are in the process of liquidation. The 16 biggest proprietaries 
did a gross total of $4 million business in 1975, compared with an 
average volume of $75 million annually in the heyday period of 
proprietaries, 1967-1973, exclusive of CIA subsidies. On the subsidy 
front,"; the con-trast is equally striking: 90 net subsidy in.1975 vs. i 
$26 million an~ual subsidy in -the 1967-73 period. Put differently,
