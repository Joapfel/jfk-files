operation of the two radio transmitters (one 50,000 
watt~ and the other 7,500 watts) was that the Navy 
was going to purchase scientific signal time from the 
Gibralter Steamship Company, an Agency proprietary, 
which was nominally the op·erator of a commercial 
radio station then being established. 
The loading of the transmitters, the unloading, 
the construction of the facilities to house the trans­
mitters, and the installation of the transmitters 
was done by the Navy Seabees under the direction of 
Alfred Cromartie of CIA's Office of Logistics. James 
Burwell, a logisitcs officer who was thoroughly in­
volved in the JMATE operation, reported that the con­
struction activity at Swan Island required the move­
ment of 180,000 pounds· of equipment from the Washing­
to11 Depot, aboard Agency trucks for delivery to Norfolk 
and the reloading aboard two LST's. In addition to 
locating the transmitters and constructing the facili~ 
ties for housing the transmitters, a crude landing 
field also was cleared. The total time involved was 
approximately 20 days, and the cost was something under 
$225,000.
