'l'e,otss op 20 Soptember 19 I was employ.ed . by the 'ht<,·ency· in a capeci ty which ca~ be 
accurately described 0s that of an e.e,-ent, in. every sense o_f the• word •• lly eseignm~nte 
• va:!'ied and necessito.ted travel to three. Lo.tin American nations anq many states; including 
• the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. They alEo necessitated my taking on cover employ 1ent 
;. for one week in' New York anti for about ten weeks in Los Ane:eles, though usually I p eed 
as a . tourist, an investigator for:.- the· Immigration '& Nature:li zation Service or e a 
researcher for a private firm,· the appropriate cretlentials bei~g furnished to me by the 
CIA. To ~um it up briefly, I opero.ted in Uexic~ City at the onset of the Cuban Mis ile 
; Crisis in an effort aimed ·chiefly· at. the Soviet ·government; • I conducted inqui iee 
relative to "dissident". members of several Cuban refugee groups baeerl in the Un·, ted. 
States; I checked out· ari • alleged connection between a Miami rer.ident named Eiadio Del·. 
Valle and New Orleans CIA informant Sergio ·Arcacha-Smi th·; I investigated an aeeociat ·of 
_ the now deceased right-wing .extremist David ·w. Ferrie of New Orleans, as I did the • 
. activities of left.;,.wirigers Vaughn L. Snipes • and hie wife, Priecills., near • Ven· ce, 
• qalifornio., and others;_ I conducted a surveillance ?n .a man, said to have been an exjCIA 
, employee, observed talking to MRP leader Manuel Artime and former Cuban senator/racketeer_· 
Rolando llaeferrer; I. inquired into an allegation that Karina Oswald intended. to div1rce. 
• her. husband nnd return to. the U .s.s.R. ( al t~ough I never stated_ that I-. met he: pereona~ly_, , 
. as was reported by the FBI O:nd Secret Service); and I p~rformed courier du\iee and acted . 
'·as a cut-out. At. t·he. time of my arrest I was op.erating in an und~rcove_r ·role, haJing 
• become · ip,vol ved in a, .riomeatic.:.inspired plot • to assassinate PreEident • _ Kennedy Ind,.-
leastwise ostendbly, other highly-placed government ··officials. • 
: . • . . . 
llr. t.ucey goes on to state that my last ·aeeiE"Dment. at· the 'time· • "was to_ penetrate 
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, ·whe're he met Oswald." Such statement ie also .incorrect. 
·•ae never a member, .bona-fide.or otherwise, :or the FPCC. And my conversations with 
functionarie~ like • Steve· Robert.a, . in . official of the· s·ocialist Workers Party at 
Ange~ee, could hardly'beconetrued ae a penetration .• Furthermore, I had been introd 
t.o Mr. Oswald long before the Fi>~C came into: existenc_e·, albeit ·upder an assumed name. 
As to the· alluflion that. I told . "Bob".~ was· an intelii~ence man, not a kill r, 
'.therefore· I couldn't, ki 11 .·Mr~· ·oswald, while. the reference is true its connotation· is . , 
.·deceptive. • I ha:d killed ~efore .. and .~ ha9 _participated in ?omicidee under the Ei,u~pice~I of_ : 
both lll anti the, CIA ( one instance bei_ng the part I. played in the February 1958 ·abductipn-· ' 
: interrogation·;_murder of an FOI agent,' a u.s. soldier, KSGT Emmett E.· Dugan, • 'from Craftbn,· : 
, Pa., suspected of. h~ving defected . in place t9 the Chinese), • under t·he. guise that! an •

:~hreat, that vae advanced to me·by Robert Graham.as an incentive to diepose·o~ Ur. Oswald 
j·in September 1963~ ... But my ·refu·eal ·to do eo . had absolutely ·, no bearing on ~the reason tor 
' effecting my arrest in the ·manner .I c}loee, nor did it engender· in me fear of. reprieal by l 
. : the CIA. 
Pertaining· to my arrest . and convfctions at El Paso, Texas, which the official• , 
·.~ epokeenien and •• the • press have eo neatly labeled. 00 being for "bank robbery," • let one of 
'the go.vernment 'e own spurious records, . the appelate court decision that finally· yawned a 
judgement of acquittal in ·my case, give its versions "The charge was then, and ie now, : : 
··entering a federally insured bank n ~h intent to rQb'." What the record aptly ignores ie 
• •the. fact that . t_,ro • juries,. inceq~ed . by ~lle pro~ecution~ s • innuen~e>ee in and oµi of the
