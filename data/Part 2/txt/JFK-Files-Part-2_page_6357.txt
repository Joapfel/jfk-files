MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Periera 
. FROM: Gary Breneman 
SUBJECT: Cormnents on Proposed Rules, 36 CFR 
Part 1400, Concerning JFK Records 
Collection Act of 1992 
1. You asked that I review subject proposed rules and 
provide my thoughts and concerns. This is in response to 
that request. 
2. As a general statement, the proposed rules are not 
well written and seem to try to cast the biggest net 
possible. With reference to poor draftsmanship, note that 
at Sec.1400.2, they introduce a term "additional information 
and records," and describe what the term includes. Compare 
sections 1400.3 relating to "sources" and 1400.4 relating to 
"(t) ypes of materials." In the latter, they have reversed 
the term and used "additional records and information." 
While the intent is fairly clear, it causes one to wonder 
what they had in mind. 
3. With reference to the big net approach, it is a 
basic rule of statutory and regulatory drafting to not write 
laws and regulations which cannot be enforced. In this 
regard, I-know of no authority in U.S. law, including the 
JFK Act, which would give the Board jurisdiction over 
records which "may be located at, or under the control 
of," ... "(f)oreign governments." See 1400.4 (b). I have a 
similar concern with respect to "private" records. Cf. Sec. 
1400.1 (a). 
4. On the nonsensical side of the big net approach is• 
every book, magazine and newspaper article and which has 
ever been written that may "report, analyze, or interpret" 
the assassination. See 1400 .1 (a) . If _read literally, the 
Agency would have to give up all of its collections of 
private books, etc. which fall within this definition. This 
is particularly true of those books we referred to here 
within HRG for information and understanding as we conducted 
the review. See 1400.2 (a) -- (a)ll documents used by 
government offices and agencies during their 
declassification review of assassination records ... "
