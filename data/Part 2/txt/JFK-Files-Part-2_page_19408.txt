TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN: 
I aru pro~d of the f&ct that my first vote cast in Congie~~ / 
was a vote against the war. It was the first oppo~tunity 
£or a woman to votc 1 becaus~ I was the first woman to be 
elect~d to Congress. 
I believed then, as~ do today, that women are the ones that 
must be concerned with the needs and development of the 
human race. I have always fought for the.dignity. of all 
human beings - for those of the present as well as those 
of future generations. 
I will continue to struggle as lcing as I live. ~ hope all 
women will respond ~o the following call and join me in 
Washington on January 15, 1968, the opening day of Congress. 
. . 
With highest hopes, 
JEANN·ETTE RANKIN
