Mr. Wides. Any telephone taps?. 
Mr. Sarno. Never, any telephone taps, we didn't have 
telephone tap capability. 
Mr. Wides. Any photography? 
Mr. Sarno. We had a photographer. 
Mr,, Wides. When was he used? In what circumstances? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, the biggest majority of his work was 
to copy certain documents. 
Mr. Wides. I mean photographic surveillance. 
Mr. Sarno. There may have been. I really can't state 
which one he was used on if he was ever used for photographic 
surveillance. 
Mr. Wides. Which what he was used on? 
Mr. Sarno. I mean if he was used on photographic 
surveillance. I don't recall ever ordering him out on photo­
graphic surveillance. 
Mr. Wides. Do you recall if there ever was any photo­
graphic surveillance carried out by any of the~? 
Mr. Sarno. I have no recollection. I do not recall. 
Mr. Wides. Were you getting reports of any sort, whether 
you would characterize it as surveillance or not; on people 
who had already come and were in Miami as distinct from the 
interview reports when the refugees first came? 
Isn't it correct that the personnel were providing 
you with reports on Cubans who were already in Miami?
