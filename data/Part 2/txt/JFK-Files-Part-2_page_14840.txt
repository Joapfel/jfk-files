Use of such authority and power 'Will permit the· department • 
head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is

majority of cases. 
We have· several times· reiterated that FBI will 
I 
respect the confidence placed in it by both regular in/ormants 
o~.other persons and will not disclose thei~ identity without 
their specific permission. 1Ve have summarized by stating 
that from our.standpoint, the Order as drafted, will permit 
us to furnish all 6vailable data to appropriate agencies as in 
the past and provides appropriate prote·cti on j'or our confidential 
informants. Data from any casual informants and·from highly 
sensitive techniques will largely be usable only under Section 9. 
We have stated tha-t the Bureau does not object to the proposed 
Order from an operational standpoint. 
On January 14:, John Doherty of the Department in/ormed 
us of a very minor addition, proposed by Philip Areeda of the

This addition would not affect the comments we have previously 
made concerning this Order.
