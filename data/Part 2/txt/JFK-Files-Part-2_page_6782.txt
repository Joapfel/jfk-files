·--- --· ----· ---·our-views· on House-Joint·Res-otutiotrt5-zt;''Tlfe-Kssassination-- -- ------ • -
Materials Disclosure Act of 1992," and to describe the nature of 
documents held by the CIA that relate to the assassination of John 
F. Kennedy. • I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on 
this important matter. 
Let me begin, as the Director did last week in testifying on 
this subject, ·by emphasizing that I am iti complete agreement with 
the purpose underlying the joint resoluti~n--that-efforts should be 
made to declassify and make avail~ble to the public as quickly as 
possible government documents relating to the assassination of 
John F. Kennedy. We hope that opening up and giving 
journalists, historians and, most importantly, the public access t~ 
governmental files will help to resolve questions that still linger 
over 28 years after the assassination. Further, we-believe-that - • 
maximum disclosure will discredit the theory that CIA had 
anything to do with the murder of President Kennedy .
