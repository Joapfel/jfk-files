This memorandum reports the results of a meeting ~ 
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of ~ ,~ 
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the ~ 
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the afternoon of 3/25/75. 
This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role 
as the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were 
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; the then Deputy ·1 
AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter0, ti· 
Mr. John Clarke, as well as officials from Defense, Treasury ·,f' 
National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, 1 
and the Energy Research and Development Administration. 
The following items of interest were discussed: 
Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate 
Select Committee (SSC), and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.o. 
Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business. 
Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is 
the identification of several key issues that the Committee 
could look into in-depth. For example, the SSC might propose 
to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and 
examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every 
covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this 
appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each 
agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide 
a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could

The question ~he SSC'~'i;aff signing a Secrecy 
Agreement is still not settled. The Staff Director raised 
some constitutional questions regarding the Secrecy Agreement. 
Mr. Schwarz admitted, however, that some type of~ngemen-t­
would have to be made to insure that the Intelligence Community 
had some protection against unauthorized disclosbr<AfiR~f.,J 
members of the SSC. ~J' . - ....._
