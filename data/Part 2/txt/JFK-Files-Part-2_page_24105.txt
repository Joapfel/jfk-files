Of course, whatever the e_xtent of the President's own constitutional 
powers," it is a fundamental principle of our constitutional.• system that these 
powers are ·checked and limited by the Congress, including the Congress' power 
of impeachment. As a necessary corollary, any action taken by a. President pur-, 
. . : 
suant to his limited inherent powers and in apparent conflict with the law 
must be disclosed to the Congress. Only then may the Congress judge whether the ac­
tion truly represent.ed, in Lincoln's phrase, an "indispensable necessitylt to 
the life of the Nation. 
As 1·incoln explained in submitting his extraordinary· actions to the Congress 
for ratification: "In full view of .his great responsibility he has, so far, 
done what he has_deemed his duty. You will now, according to your own judgment, 
perform yours." (Abraham Lincoln, Message to Congress in Special· Session, July :4, -· ".
