JUNE 14, 1977 
JOAN T. Tf.!ORNELL, LETTER RE LEAVE 
• Mrs. Thornell left at the close of business 
on Friday, May 13, 1977. As the Committee had no leave 
policy at that time, she made her termination effective 
Sunday, May 15, 1977, at.my suggestion, so that she 
would receive two days extra in pay. 
Mrs. Thornell began employment November 8, 
1976 and left May 13, 1977. Under the Clerk of the 
House's leave policy, she would be entitled to 5 days, 
no credit being given for a fraction of a month when 
hired or a fraction of a month when terminated. 
The Clerk's policy further states there 
are no provisions to permit reimbursement to an employee 
· upon termination for any accumulation of leave. However, 
to the extent possible and practicable, every effort 
should be made to consider such accumulation when sub­
mitting a recommendation for termination. 
Twelve Committee Staff Members with a total 
of 42 days accumulated leave who have terminated, in­
cluding one who terminated the same day as Mrs. Thornell, 
were given no credit for their leave because the 
Committee had no policy at that time. 
This fact and the fact that Mrs. Thornell 
was paid for six days past May 13, in my opinion, dis­
credits Mrs. Thornell claim to "the punitive nature of 
the decisiono" The facts clearly show that Mrs. 
Thornell was given special consideration.
