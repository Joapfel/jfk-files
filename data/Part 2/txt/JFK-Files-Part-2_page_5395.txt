A. Memorandum from ODO dated 9 June 1993: 
Subject: Release of JFK Assassination-· 
Records -- Differences; 
B. Memorandum by Dave Gries of 22 June 1993: 
Subject: JFK Assassination Records-- Proposal 
for discussion 
1. Regarding the items discussed in the referenced memos, 
it appears that a further interpretation is required. 
--On the subject of cryptonyms, we cannot give wholesale 
approval for their release, but if the crypts have been 
previously blown or exposed they can be released. There may be 
cases in which, if the crypt has been retired, does not relate 
to existing or another project and does not contain a valid 
digraph, it may also be released. Note, however, that crypts 
which are related to a series (ZZBOAT/1, ZZBOAT/2 etc.}, would, 
when exposed, link operations or assets to one another or which 
ref~r tb bther operations or projects cannot be released.-, -
--On-the subject of pseudonyms, if the pseudonym has been --previously blown, there is no objection to its release. Note 
that release of pseudonyms serves to link offiters with 
assets/operations and this "guilt by association" could lead to 
futher, undesireable, exposures. Care must also be taken so 
that the release of pseudonyms is not done in such a manner so 
as to enable a researcher to accummulate through an inspection 
of numerous documents the approximate size of a given station.· 
(The sense of this is to mean that only a small number of 
pseudonyms· would be considered for release.)
