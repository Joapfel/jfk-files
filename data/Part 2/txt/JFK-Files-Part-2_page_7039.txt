JFK Act -- Process 
• Scope/Deadlines/Decisions defined by law and outside Board. 
• Focal Point (HRP) Serves Primarily as: {1) Moderator 
between Board and Components, (2) Bookkeeper, (3) 
Consistency Keeper. 
• Everything reviewed by Focal Point (HRP) and the appropriate 
component (Often many times). 
• Components often take strong initial position but recede in 
face of strong arguments. 
• Senior Agency Managers unaware of intricacies of the Process 
unless problems come up. 
• Exceptions: Issues Taken to Board by senior management: 
Cover, Employee Names, Facilities Stations.

Without making a value judgment on the merits of the JFK Act, it is possible to 
characterize the process which the Act dictated for CIA. 
The scope/deadlines and decisons were defined in the law and by the 
Assassination Records Review Board, an outside body. Over the course of the 
history of this effort (5 years), CIA, as did other agencies, devel~ped (and 
redeveloped) processes and responses to the Board. For the most part the 
detailed work by the Staff was at a level which did not involve senior managers 
unless a major problem arose. 
When problems did arise, Senior Agency officials were asked to make 
presentations to the Board and, in all cases, consensus was achieved. No issues 
from CIA had to be appealed to the President, the formal procedure in the Act 
for resolving differences between Agencies and the Board.
