T P SECRET 
Mr. Baron. For the record, these minutes refer to a 
report by Thomas Parrott, who was the Secretary of the Special 
Group on CIA activity in relation to the Congo. Mr. Parrott 
outlines three CIA operations in the Congo which make use of 
trade unions in the Congo and include the prospect that a 
vote of no confidence in Lumumba would be arranged. 
Following th~t report by Mr. Parrott there is a paragraph 
which describes the action of the Group as follows: "The 
Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much in 
order. Mr. Gray commented, however, that his associate had 
expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very 
straightforward action in this situation, and wondered whether 
the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this. 
Mr. Dulles replied that he had taken the comments referred 
to seriously and had every intention of proceeding as 
vigorously as the situation permits or requires, but added 
that he must necessarily put himself in a position of inter­
preting instructions of this kind within the bounds of 
necessity and capability. It was fihally agreed that 
planning for the Congo would not necessarily rule out 
'consideration' of any particular kind of activity which 
might contribute to getting rid of Lurnurnba." 
Do you recall receiving a report of that meeting? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't, that particular meeting. But 
you would have to ask Mr. Gray about that. I don't know who
