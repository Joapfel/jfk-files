MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Joseph Di Stefano 
SUBJECT Responsibilities During Assignment to 
00/Washington Base ( re Fitness Report Jan ,9 . Jan. , 70) 
FROM Mr. William M. Kent 
1. During the early days of my assignment to DO/Washington 
Base, the matter of my cover was discussed a number of times 
with DO Personnel and CCS. Eventually, CCS came up with World 
Wide Information Services, Inc., of New York, as a legitimate 
firm which would provide me with the needed cover. It came 
out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover 
would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest, 
and would allow me to handle recruited agents, but, because 
of the high risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for 
cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments. 
2, Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal. 
Among other things, I: 
a. Handled a recruited Venezuelan agent assigned 
to the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington; 
b. Handled a recruited code clerk assigned to one 
of the embassies in Washington; 
c. Contacted and assessed a high official of the 
Soviet Embassy, made arrangements to have him met by 
another Base case Officer under alias who continued 
the development which eventually was to lead to a re­
cruitment pitch;
