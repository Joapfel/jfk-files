Q Non-official cover. What was the cover? 
A It was a commercial cover. It was called -- the first 
one was called Zenith Corporation and it was set up with a 
President and Vice President, normal corporate setup. 
Q Engaging in any business?. 
A No. 
Q Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community, 
how long could a non-official cover last? 
A \'iell, obviously it didn't, but it was research 
activities. Funded itis a giant mechanism when you put 
one of these· things in for the funding and this type of thing, 
. for,your· ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts. 
Q Yes, I understand. 
A So it was a research activity and the only people tha 
ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You 
know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept 
any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this 
type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And o.ut of 
this . one,,. thing, of course, then we were running these innumera­
ble, ·other· covers with different activities. The guard 
force, of course, were like -- well, they wore uniforms, simila 
to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think 
that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the 
Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other 
Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.
