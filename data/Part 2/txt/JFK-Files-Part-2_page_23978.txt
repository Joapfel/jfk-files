June 18, 1970, the U.S. Ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, submitted a 
two-phase proposal to the Department of State and the CIA for review.

campaign_. The second was a contingency plan to make "a $500,000 effort 
in Congress to persuade certain- shifts in voting on 24 October 1970." 
Phase II was, stated simply, a proposal to bribe Chilean Congressmen to 
vote against Allende should he win a plurality in the September 4 elec­
tion. On June 27, 1970, the 40 Committee increased _funding for the 
anti-Allende "spoiling" operation to $390,000. A decision on Ambas~ador 
Korry's bribe_ proposal was deferred pending the results of the Sept~mber 4 
election.
