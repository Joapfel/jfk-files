SUBJECT: Re: Proposed Regs by JFK Assassination Records Review Board 
A number of us have concerns about the broad approach in the proposed regs. Among others, Bob Eatinger has written a memo on the 
subject. We are preparing a formal response for the Board, which will be sent around for comment 
In the meantime, I have had an informal discussion with the Board's Executive Director, David Marwell, advising him of our concerns. He 
has invited us to propose specific textual changes. 
The Board's deadline is 10 March. 
Any additional thoughts would be welcome
