A ta~ed transcript of Barres' debriefing b~ detectives 
Flynn and!Scamardella on July 25, 1973 reveals ~he following: 
Barres got involved in drugs through his friend:l!Veciana who was 
an officer of the International Development Bank in the U.S. 
Embassy in Bolivia. Some people think Veciana is with the CIA 
but Barres does not know. Barres dealt with Vediana regarding 
an attempt to kill Castro in Chile. He s'ays Vediana did a good 
job of tr~nsferring eyerything into Chile (1970il971). Barres 
gave Veci~na $2,000 ih support of this assassiri~tion effort. 
About thi~ time Veciana said that drugs could.i>Eh smuggled out of 
Bolivia through diplomatic pouch. Barres thouglit this was how 
Veciana hkd sent weap,ons into Chile. Barres ad:(rised that the head 
of Interpbl in Bolivia gets a cut of drug money /1 for· protection on 
the Bolivian end and 1that a Secret Service Agent and two Paraguyan 
diplomats!were also involved. They handled the}transfer to
