SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents 
1. I understand the JFK AARB ie presently considering the 
release of documents which would identify CIA stations to the 
public. I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of 
our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station

be temporary. I have surveyed the involved components and 
determined the damage to national security which would follow

3. I strongly urge that you not allow the information 
regarding the Congo and SQnQgal to be released. The Congo is now 
ZairQ and the station in the 60's would have been in

current rQlationship with the Zaireane ia not a full-blown 
liaison type, but more of a limited relationship with cGrtain 
individuals from the services. In the past, we have had cloea
