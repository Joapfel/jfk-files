Memorandum captioned as above 4/23/75 reported on 
interview of Mr. Whitson by Michael Epstein,. staff member of the 
Senate Select Committee. The interview related to Whitson's 
trip to Miami in 1964 at the instructions of former Assistant to 
the Director William c. Sullivan to mail a package to Martin Luther 
King. 
Whitson telephoned my office twice this morning. At 10:35 a.m. 
he advised that Epstein had asked him by telephone how Whitson had 
made the trip to Miami, meaning how it was paid for. Whitson told 
him he had issued a Government Transportation Request (GTR). Epstein 
asked whether there was any prior written authorization for Whitson 
to make this trip and Whitson told him.there was none. Epstein 
asked what kind of record would have b~en made covering the trip. 
Whitson explained that the only record, that he knew of would be /Ji1 
the expense voucher he submitted covering the expenses involved f 
and possibly the copy of the GTR which he had issued. He explaine/' 
to Epstein the voucher would merely show the GTR had been issued 
for a round-trip to Miami and how much per diem had been claimed 
in connection with the trip. 
In advising of the foregoing, Whitson stated it was his 
recollection he had made the Miami trip either in the late Summer 
or early Fall of 1964 and that Martin Luther King was "away" at 
the time. ' 
In my 
11:05 a.m. to 
registered at 
under his own 
under his own 
absence from the office, Whitson called again at 
say that Mr. Epstein asked him as to whether he had 
the Airport Hotel in Miami and, if so, whether it was 
name. \fhi ~son told Eps-tein that he ha~gis tered
