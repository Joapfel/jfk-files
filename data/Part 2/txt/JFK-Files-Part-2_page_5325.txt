Other issues discussed 
Crypts other than Lis and AMs - there was a discussion re 
deleting digraph and letting rest of crypt; everyone seemed 
receptive, but no decision. 
Bill mentioned Iranian takeover as good example.of damage 
caused by releas~-'of documents with crypts, file #s, etc. 
Gunn ask if there was an internal "damage" study prepared. 
Bill said he would check. 
Marwell rejected the approach of the Agency having the 
opportunity to discuss Board actions before official 
notification. If we have evidence, need to present upfront, 
not come back with additional evidence after the decision. 
The balancing of public interest vs Agency needs came up 
several times; Marwell commented that even if a document or 
item is not important to the Oswald story, the Agency must 
still defend. 
Bill stated'several timed during the meeting "If·important 
to the story, we can live with release".
