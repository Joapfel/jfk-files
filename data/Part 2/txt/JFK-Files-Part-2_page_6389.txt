As we previously discussed, please initiate the necessary action to grant the appropriate 
SCI clearances for Carolyn Carpenter, SSN(53-8:46::25W Ms. Carpenter's file was 
reviewed by the Department of Justice Personnel Security Office. The DoJ 
recommended granting a Top Secret clearance and postponing a decision on SCI 
pending a CIA review for special exception to DCI Directive 114, paragraph SC, due to 
foreign in-laws. 
As you may recall from our conversation, Ms. Carpenter is a former CIA employee. I 
would like to request that the investigation for her SCI clearance be given careful 
consideration. It is extremely important to the Review Board that our clearances meet 
the highest standards of the agencies with which we have dealings. 
The Review Board has informed Ms. Carpenter that her employment is contingent upon 
receiving the appropriate clearances. Therefore, I respectfully request that her case be 
given top priority. If you need further information, please contact either me or Tracy 
Shycoff, our Deputy Security Officer. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
