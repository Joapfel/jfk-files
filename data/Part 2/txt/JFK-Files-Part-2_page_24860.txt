C. December 
December 2 
A memorandum, dated December 2, 1970, from Helms to Kissinger stated 
that Helms had given a recapitulation on TrRckJI to Attorney General· 
Mitchell, who would deliver it personally to Kissinger. A handwritten 
note on the memorandum reads: "sent to Kissinger via DCI (Helms)." 
(Helms memorandum for· Kissinger, 2 December 1970) The report, which 
was dated November 18, 1970, contained a full account of CIA activities 
during Track II, including the several plans to kidnap Schneider and 
the passage of weapons to the Chilean conspirators. (Report on CIA 
Chilean Task Force Activities, 15 September to 3 November 1970, 18 
November 1970) -
In his testimony to the Connnittee, Kissinger did not recall receiv­
ing the report, although he doubted that he would have read such an 
"after action" report in any case. He testified that he could not find 
it in his files, in contrast to his finding a CIA report on Track I, 
dated November 19, 1970. Kissinger was puzzled by. a number of aspects of 
the memorandum and report: why_ there were two reports, why the report 
of the 18th apparently was only called to his attention on the 2nd of 
December, and why it was to be delivered through Mitchell. (Kissinger 
testimony, pp. 71, 74) 
n. Did Track II End? 
The Committee also received conflicting testimony about whether or 
-
not Track II ever ended, formally or in fact. As noted above, Kissinger indi- !·-
cated that Track II was supposed to have ended, as far as he was concerned, on 
October 15. It was formally terminated, according to Kissinger, by a new Presi-
dential marching order issued prior to the October 24 vote of the Chilean Congress .1-
