review is focused. The request is for access to review the 
files for possible assassination related material and the 
Board has no interest in reviewing multiple files which have 
~; nothing to., do with the assassination story. _ A_ meeting is 
• held_ between the· ARRB staff, HRP JFK team and the 
appropriatei.IRO}to discuss• the scope of the -request . 
• Usually,. the·,,ARRB' staff' are first provided shelf lists, 
indexes, records lists, etc. for the purpose of· 
narrowing/selection what they think is important. HRP 
assist the IRO or component representatives in reviewing 
the selected files to ensure they deal with appropriate 
subjects and timeframes. Once access is approved, the 
appropriate IRO and component sets up a file review session 
with the ARRB staff. If material requested is particularly 
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive 
Director or members of the Board. Any records selected as 
Assassination Records are subject to review under the JFK 
Act. This process has be used for numerous requests for 
access including DCI McCone Files, Family Jewels materials, 
histories and security files
