But, again, whatever ~e fu~ course of this legislation, CIA; is proceeding even 
now to review for declassification the relevant documents under its control. Further, 
we will cooperate fully with any mechanism established by the Congress and the 
President to declassify all of-this material. 
Chairman GLENN. Thank you, Mr. Gates.

TESTIMONY OF THE . HON. WILLIAM S. SESSIONS, DIRECTOR, 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION; ACCOMPANIED BY 
DA YID G. LEITCH, DEP'CJTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
U.S. DEPARTMENT. OF JUSTICE 
Mr .. SESSIONS. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of. the 
Committee. I have a complete statement which I will file, and 
there are some diagrams which I will also make available for the 
record, and a photogr!i_ph of the _files themselves. . 
Chairman GLENN. Without objection, your entire statement will 
be included in the reco;rd. • 
Mr. SE.9SIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to appear 
before you to testify about FBI investigative records relat~g to the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I applaud this process 
and your efforts. It is fundamental that Governm~nt ~t U? meet 
the needs of its citizens. An examination of these 1SSues 18· directly 
related to satisfying the intense interest and concern of our citizens 
about the circumstances S\UToundmg that tragic event some 29 
years ago. 
From the outset, I would like to state emphatically that .I _favor 
maximum disclosure, consistent with the law and the legitimate 
need to protect certain small but highl__}'_ se~itive categories ~f in­
formation. I can assure you that the FBI will work cooperatively 
through the Department of Justi.ce with both the Sena~ ·and the 
House to develop a comprehensive approach to these rmportant 
issues. 
·As-you know, the Government has conducted a number of re­
views of the assassination. The Warren Commission, the House As­
sassinations Committee, and the Church ~mmittee all C<?nduc~d 
reviews that I believe can be best categonzed as exhaustive. It lS 
my understanding that the FBI provided_ massive amounts of ~nfor­
mation to those entities to help ensure that they accomplished 
their missions. Once again, we desire to be as helQful as we are 
able. · 
• immediately following ·the shooting of President Kennedy, the 
FBl began a massive investigation. An intense effort w~ made. Re­
lated investiga~ions were conducted and much informati<?n was ex• 
changed; as Oirector G!l~ has n<;>~d1 be~een. the vari9us agen• 
cies. • As is the· case ·with. all mSJ_ot investigations, thousands. of 
pages of documents were created to record the results of these ef­
forts and to facilitate the investigations. 
Man_y different .kinds. of infoI'II!aµon ;were rec?rded in the ~I 
files. The results of thousands of interviews of witnesses, other in­
divichials with possible helpful kJ?.o'!ledge, and co~tac~ with confi­
dential informants were memorialized. Comm~cations betwe~n 
the FBI headquarters and our field offices, and vice veraa, were in­
cluded, as were.communications between the FBI and ot?er agen­
cies. Forensic reports were recorded. In all, FBI files relating to the 
59 
assassination contained over 499,000 pages of documents with a 
few more pages added every time the FBI follows up on a ~ew alle­gation or a new issue arises. 
After Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act in 1974, 
the rBI .began receiving requests for information relating to the as­
sassmation. By 1978, four years later, over 200,000 pages of materi­
al had bee~ proc~ed and made available to the public through the 
FBI's pubhc readins: ~oom. Many ~u.thors, journalists, historians, 
and others have V1Sited and reV1Sited these materials which 
remain avaµable today as a _valuable source of historic info;mation. 
I would like to briefly describe to the Committee a breakdown of 
FBI records relating in some way to the assassination. The FBI has 
f<;>ur ~re files that rel!lte di_rectly to the investigation of the assas­
sination. Our cooperation with the Warren Commission and the in­
vestigation of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby-those are the 
four core files. The.re are appr«?ximately 499,000 pages in these 
files, 263,000 of which are duplicate pages that were cross-filed 
third agency records, and some FBI records that have not bee~ 
processed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. 
Approximately 223,000 pages, or 94 percent of the records we 
~ve processed, have already been released to the public. In addi­
tion, the FBI has several other much smaller files as a result of 
other directly related investigations, such as the investigation of 
Manna Oswald, ~d these fil~s comprise approximately 22,000 
pages, l~,000 _of which are duplicate, third agency, or unprocessed 
pages. Fifty-eight pe~cent of these pages processed pursuant to the 
Freedom of Inform~tion ~ct have been released to the public. 
Of the pages available m the FBI reading room on the main floor 
at FBI ~eadql;larte~, approximately 189,000 pages, or 94 percent, 
are ~vailable m their ~ntirety. The remaining 12,000 pages in the 
reading room reflect some degree of redaction. The information 
that has not been disclosed or that has been redacted to some 
degree falls within the exemptions that are enumerated in the 
Free401!1 of Infoi:mation Act and the protections of the Privacy Act. 
~18 mclude~ information that, one, is classified on the basis of 
national ~ecunty; two, would disclose the identities of individuals 
~ho ~~ecifically requ8!3te4 confidentiality; three, would disclose the 
identi~ies of C0!3fidential informants or sources; four, is highly per­
sonal information about individuals; or, five, originated with other 
Gov~rnment ~encies and those agencies specifically requested that 
the information not be released based upon exemptions applicable to those particular agencies. 
While I strongly favor maximum disclosure under the law there 
are certain types of information that are particularly critical to 
successful. law enf~rcement _investigations and national security; for 
~xample,. mformation th!lt lS properly and appropriately classified, 
i~formation that would identify confidential sources, and informa­
tion that ~ould ~close sensitive investigative techniques or the 
~ypes of informati~n. the disclosure of ',Vhich could negatively 
impact upon our ability to fulfill our m1Ssion. Information in FBI 
files ~h~t has ~ot been ?isclosed publicly falls largely within these descnptions of information. 
In any_ CS;5e, I be!ieve it is extremely healthy for the country to 
have these 1Ssues aired and to be resolved. The public interest die-
