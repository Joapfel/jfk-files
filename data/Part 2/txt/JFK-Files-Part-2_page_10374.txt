MEMORl\.NDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: SHAMROCK 
Mr. Buffham and I had an opportunity thls morning to read 
the SHAMROCK file in .ACSI. Major General Joe! McChristian gave 
I 
us permission to view it but once we had read it 1after careful con-
sideration he decided that h~ would not feel free to give NSA either 
the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef 
inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of 
us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary 
and _perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree 
after sealing the file again to limit i?Ccess to the Secretary of Defense 
on demand, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand, 
Chief of ACSI, and the Chief of the SSO, ACSI. 1k.;.. ~ k ~ I'.-\
