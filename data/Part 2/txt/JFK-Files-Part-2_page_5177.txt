cpublic acknowledgment of a station in Tunisia and mig~i 
I 
engage in harassment/sabotage/terrorist actions in Tunisia to i\ 
show its displeasure. If the Tunisian Government should ask that j' 
; our station be closed, the U.S. Government woul_d lose a 
j capability to collect on Libya, north .African stability, and I 
I Islamic extremism. (S) i / 
10. Public acknowledgment of a station in Morocco would be a 
problem for Morocco vis-l-vis its Islamic fundamentalist 
.Population. Morocco, like so many countries with a majority 
Muslim population,. has a growing Islamic fundamentaliat problem, 
and Islamic fundamentalists are frequently opposed to the U.S. in 
general and the Agency in particular. Public acknowledgment of a 
station in Morocco could cause its Islamic fundamentalist 
·population to react negatively and demand that our station be 
closed. If' the station were closed, the U.S. Government would 
lose intelligence on the western Sahara conflict, north African 
stability and Islamic extremism. (S) 
i 
11. In those instances where I have indicated damage to 
operational capability and national security, I would feel 
compelled to seek a reversal of any decision to make a public 
acknowledgment. In those. oases where I indicate "no spedifio or 
additional damage", I am prepared to accept your decision yet I 
must call your attention to the general damaged.one to us byany 
disclosure of operational presence. Our operational capabilities 
are in direot proportion to the confidence place_d in our ability 
to protect source identities and operation~l methods. Dieelosure 
to the public of our presence weakens this confidence. (S)
