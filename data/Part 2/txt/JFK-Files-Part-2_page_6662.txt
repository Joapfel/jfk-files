Dear John: 
Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 
U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994), the Review Board has the authority.to "directa -·· 
Government office to ... investigate the facts surrounding, additional information [and] 
records .... " Section 7(J){l){C)(ii). Pursuant to this authority, the Review Board is 
seeking to resolve·in a complete and comprehensive manner certain questions related to 
files on Lee Harvey Oswald that CIA may have held prior to the assassination of 
President Kennedy. Accordingly, we request that CIA provide complete and 
comprehensive answers to the questions identified below. 
On May 12, 1992, Director Robert M. Gates testified to the Senate Committee on 
Governmental Affairs regarding CIA's records on Oswald prior to the assassination. 
Mr. Gates testified that "[p]rior to President Kennedy's assassination, CIA held only a 
small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 34 documents amounting to 124 
pages ..... " (The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1972: Hearing Before the 
Committee on Governmental Affairs, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1992) (emphasis added) 
(copy enclosed). It is the Review Board's current understanding, however, that at the 
time of the assassination, CIA held at least three separate files (including soft files) on 
Lee Harvey Oswald: a 201 file (201-289248), an HTLINGUAL file, and an Office of
