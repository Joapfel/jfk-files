is that correct? 
Mr. Halley. That is correct. 
I want to quallfy that. Undoubtedly, there were some 
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area 
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Day of Pig 
operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until 
approximately February of 1962. 
Mr. Daron. At what point did you join the Agency? 
Mr. Halley. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

16 I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.'.In the 
17 course of that. service, I spent most of my time working on the
