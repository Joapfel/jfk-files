The truckload of equipment was finally picked up by either Varona 
or Roselli' s agent~~( I. G. , pp. 49-50; Roselli, p. 4o). 
Harvey testified t~arms "could" have been f;r use in the 
assassination attempt, but that they were not given to Varona 
solely for that purpose (Harvey, 7/11, p. 9). 
Roselli kept Harvey informed of the 
operation's progress. Sometime in May 1962, he reported that the 
pills and guns had arrived in Cuba (Harvey, 6/25, p. 64; Roselli, 
pp. 34, 42-43). On June 21, he told Harvey that Varona had dis­
patched a three-man team to Cuba. The Inspector General's Report 
rlescriheo the team's mission as '.'vague" and conjectured .that the 
team would kill Castro or recruit others to d~ the job, using the 
poison pills if the opportunity arose (I.G., p. 51).

Harvey met Roselli in Miami on September 7 
and 11, 1962. Varona was reported to be preparing to send in 
another three-man team to·penetrate Castro's bodyguard. Harvey 
was told that the pills, referred to as 11the medicine," were 
still "safe" in Cuba (Harvey, 6/25, p. 103; I.G., p. 51). 
Harvey testified that by this time he 
had grave doubts about whether the operation would ·ever take 
place, and told Roselli that 11there's not much likelihood that 
this, is going anyplace, or that it should be continued" (Harvey, 
6/25, p. 104). Varona's second team never left for Cuba, claiming 
that "conditions" in Cuba were not right (I.G., p. 51-52). During 
early January 1963, Harvey paid Roselli $2,700 to defray Varona's 
expenses (I.G., p. 52).
