The President then eaid that he .upported this, but at the aame 
time he wanted to make it abunclantly clear that he did not think we had 
to reform every Asian into our own image. He said that he felt all 
too often when we eng&ged in the aifaire of a foreign muntry we 
wanted to immediately transform that country into our image and this, 
in hie opinion, waa a mistake. He was anxiou• to 1etao11g. win the war -
he didn't want as much effort placed 011 so-called 1ocial reform•. 
Note: I received in this meeting the first "Presldent 1ohnaon tone" 
!or action a• contrasted with the "Kennedy tone". Johnson definitely 
feels that we place too much emphasil on social reforrna; he haa very 
lltUe tolerance with our spending so much time being 11do-gooder1"; 
and he hae no tolerance whatsoever with bickering and quarreling of 
the type that has gone on 1n South Vietnam. 
The meeting was followed by a etatement to the preaa which waa 
given out by Bundy to the ef!ect that we would pursue the policle a 
agreed to in Honolulu adopted by the late President Kennedy. A 
picture waa taken of the Pre aident with Lodge. McNamara, Ruak and 
Ball.
