BY US IN-OUR ZONE OF AUSTRIA AND THE. NEW ORGANIZATION WAS GiVEN 
.RADIOS SO THEY COULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US AND EACH OTHER. 
OUR PARAMILITARY PEOPLE PUT CACHES OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, 
FOOD, AND UNIFORMS INTO THE GROUND IN OVER 70 PLACES IN THE U.S. 
ZONE AND ELSEWHERE. OLAH'S GROUP WAS TO BE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF 
THE CACHES WHEN THE.RED ARMY MOVED. 
PAGE: 
RECENTLY THE US GOVERNMENT REVEALED TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT 
THE EXISTENCE OF THESE CACHES AND THE EMBASSY GAVE AUSTRIAN 
OFFICIALS TH_E LOCATIONS OF THESE CACHES. AUSTRIAN PRESS, RADIO, AND 
TV COVERAGE OF ALL THIS HAS BEEN GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND EVEN 
GRATEFUL. OLAH'S INVOLVEMENT IS KNOWN FROM HIS MEMOIRS AND FROM 
STATEMENTS HE MADE DURING HIS TRIAL IN THE 1960'S (HE WAS TRIED, 
CONVICTED, AND-SERVED ONE YEAR FOR USING A LABOR UNION SAVINGS 
ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR A LOAN TO BUY THE KRONEN ZEITUNG,' A TABLOID 
WHICH NOW HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION IN AUSTRIA'. THE TWO MEN, 
( (DICHAND)) AND ((FALK)), HE CHOSE TO RUN THE PAPER, THEN TOOK IT 
OVER AS THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY, BECOMING ALMOST THE RICHEST MEN IN 
AUSTRIA. DICHAND LATER SOLD OUT TO FALK AND FOUNDED ANOTHER TABLOID. 
IN ALL OUR CLANDESTINE MEETINGS WITH OLAH, HE WAS ACCOMPANIED 
BY HIS. TWO "SECRETARIES," JOSEF ((LAS)) AND HEINRICH ( (DAURER)) . 
LAS WENT TO JAIL FOR THE SAME OFFENSE AS OLAH AND DAURER MAY HAVE, 
TOO. 
AT NO TIME WERE OUR NAMES (I WAS SUCCEEDED AS CASE OFFICER BY 
PAUL VON MARX, THEN UNDER STATE COVER IN VIENNA AND NOW RETIRED IN 
BERN, SWITZERLAND). I DON'T THINK .OLAH KNEW OUR TRUE NAMES, BUT HE 
KNEW I WAS IN THE EMBASSY. 
FROM A TV SHOW THE NIGHT OF FEB,RUARY 26, 1996, I LEARNED THERE 
ARE AT LEAST TWO EAGER YOUNG.AUSTRIAN HISTORIANS WORKING TO LEARN 
ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THIS CASE. ONE HAD SHEAVES OF TOP SECRET 
DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE AND DEFENSE DEPTS. BEARING ON U.S. SCHEMES 
TO RE-ARM AUSTRIA. 
IF MY NAME IS REVEALED, IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL 
AUSTRIAN OFFICERS I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS. AUSTRIAN TELEVISION CAN 
SHOW SEVERAL LENGTHY INTERVIEWS WITH ME ON THE 1993· OCCASION OF THE 
150TH JUBILEE OF THE VIENNA MEN'S SINGING SOCIETY, WHICH I HAVE, 
BELONGED TO SINCE 1972. OLAH, LAS, AND DAURER CAN ALL RECOGNIZE ME.
