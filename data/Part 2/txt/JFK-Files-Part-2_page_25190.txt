CONEIN October 1963 DIEM~ 
~ OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that he looked upon his job as conveying o ers rom s am-
~ bassador to the people that were planning the coup and to monitor those people who were 
~ planning the coup, and to get as much information so that our governrrent would not be caught 
with their pants down. He did agree not to thwart the coup and in fact, to supply economic 
? and military assistance if the coup succeeded, but did not conceive his objective the en-
~ couragerrent or the promotion of the coup, nor· did he ever discuss the possibility of dis-
...i couraging the coup. CONEIN stated that if the United States had now shown any interest or 
~ rerrained neutral in opposing DIEM, there would have been a coup anyway. pp. 38-41

OCCURRENCE: When the ministerial post for DINH did not materialize by early October, the 
coup principals realized that they had DINH actively thinking against the regirre. It is 
evident from staterrents during the series of rreetings with GENERAL DON and GENERAL MINH dur­
ing the rronth of October that they still did not trust DINH, but felt they had compromised 
him sufficiently with his troops, and, if necessary to eliminate DINH if he showed any sign 
of compromising the generals. DINH was surrounded by officers who surveilled him 24 hours a 
day including CO, his deputy. p. 13
