Mr. Preyer. Mr. Nosenko, your testimopy" has· been :'.considere 
2 a major piece of evidence, and was so considered by the Warren 
3 Commission as rebutting any Russian connection with the assassi-
4 nation of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I think the k~y part of your 
5 testimony that we are concerned with, not so much the question 
6 about·any inconsistencies in it, but are you right on the big 
7 question, namely, was Lee Harvey Oswald a KGB agent? 
8 I want to mention, I have been a littl~ surprised by your 
9 testimony, bythe gaps in your knowledge of Oswald, and really 
I 
10 j how little you knew about him. For exa,mg1.e~, when he went to 
' I 
1l Minsk, he·was tranferred out of your oversight, I take it, and 
12 as I understood you, you did not know he was married until 
13 later on, and did not know he had gone back to the United 
14 ! States.

I 
Mr. Nosenko. Mr. Congressman, if I was staying and 
16 i wo'!'k:ing '60 and '61 period in the same Seventh Department which 
.17 sent file on Oswald in Minsk, I would !know, but I was working 
18 
1
in First American Department. 
19 
20 that. 
Mr. Preyer. Right. Now, I am not questioning you about• 
The question I wonder 1 that that brings to my mind is, 
21 if Oswald- had been a KGB agent, are you certain you would have 
22 known it? In other words, if you didn't even know he was 
~3 mairied, didn't even know h~ had gone to the United States, 
24 couldn't he have been a KGB agent in that period without your 
2!: , knowledge, or are you certain --
