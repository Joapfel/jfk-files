and Special .Agents Leon F. Schwartz and Thomas J. McNiff 
in Room 4123 JEH. 
Material contained therein runs the entire gambit 
from CIA cooperation, ancl in some instances flnancing,of 
Bureau sensitive operations in foreign intelligence field, 
to CIA involvement in domestic affairs including cooperation 
with police departments and other Federal agencies. In all, 
it was determined that approximately 174 pages of the document 
contain information which in some respect has a bearing on 
this Bureau's operations. 
Pertinent page numbers were identified to 
Mrs. Mowitt and she is taking this Bureau's request for these 
pages back to CIA Headquarters for the purpose of obtaining 
authorization to furnish this Bure~u with copies of the 
pages in which this Bureau is interested. Mrs. Mowitt 
adv•ised that she would insure our request in this respect 
received expeditious attention and she will furnish us with 
the results at the earliest time. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
None. Above submitted for information. You will 
be kept advised of developments.
