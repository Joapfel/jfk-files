October 15 
Karamessines met with Kissinger and Haig at the White House to dis-
1 
cuss Track II. According to the CIA memorandum of conversation, Karamessines 
gave a run-down on Viaux, Canales and Tirado and ''the general situation in 
Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint." It was concluded that Viaux 
did not have more than one chance in twenty--perhaps less--to launch a 
successful coup. Kiss:1nger ticked off the list of negative repercussions 
from an unsuccessful coup. The CIA record of the meeting continues: 
5. It was decided by those present _that the 
Agency must get a message to Viaux warning him 
against any precipitate action. In essence our 
message was to state: "We have reviewed your 
plans, and based on your information and ours, 
we come to the conclusion that your plans for a 
coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, 
they may teduce yo~r capabilities for the future~ 
Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. 
The time will come when you with ~11 ybur other 
friends can do something. You will continue to 
have our support." 
. . 
6. After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux coup 
plot, at least temporarily, Dr. Kissinger. instruc­
ted Mr. Karamessines to preserve Agency assets in 
Chile, working clanqestinely and securely to main­
tain the capability for Agency operation~ against 
Allende in the future. 
8. The meeting concluded on Dr. Kissinger's note 
that the Agency should continue keeping the pres­
sure on every Allende weak spot in sight--now, 
after the 24th of October, after 5 November, and 
into the future until such time as new marching 
orders are given. Mr. Karamessines stated that 
the Agency would comply.
