FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH: 
Castro's two-hour speech on 23 November was what he termed 
an "objective analysis" of the implications of President 
Kennedy's assassination. The speech reflected an appre­
hension that US policy toward Cuba may now- become even 
tougher. He said the President's death was "serious.and 
bad news" and sought to insinuate that "ultrareactionaries" 
·in the US are exploiting the assassination--and may have 
been responsible for it--as part of their campaign for a 
more "aggressive'' US policy against Cuba. (Page 1)
