-SUBJECT: Request for Information on Sensitiv~ Act~vities 
• 
'You will recall that in Fiscal Years 1971 and '1972, 
I believe~ Agency funds were made available to the FBI. 
These funds may still be possibly held in a special 
account for that use. This is one of the areas where 
TSD has been very much involved. Chuck Briggs would 
have the details as this was handled through the Executive_ 
Director's office and of course Angleton would have 
additional information.
