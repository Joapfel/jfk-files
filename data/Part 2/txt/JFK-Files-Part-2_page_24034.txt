In a cable on August 25, CIA Chief of Station John Richardson 
reported the result of a conference among himself, Lodge, True­
heart, General Harkins (Commander, Military Assistance Command, 
Vietnam (MACV) and General Weede (Chief of Staff, MACV). They 
accepted Deptel 243 "as a basic decision from Washington and 
would proceed to do their best to carry out instructions", (I. G., 
C, pp. 7-8) but believed that Diem would refuse to remove his 
brother from his position in the government. 
Early in the morning of August 26, 1963, the Voice of America 
in South Vietnam placed the blame on Nhu for the August 21 raids 
and absolved the army. The broadcast als.o reported speculation 
that the United States contemplated suspending aid to the South 
Vietnamese Government (Pentagon Papers, p. 212).* Later on that 
same day, Lodge presented his credentials to Diem . CIA officers 
. Conein and Spera were told to see Generals Khiem and Khanh, 
resp·ectively, and to convey to them the substance of Dep·tel 243, 
but to remind them that "we cannot be of any help during initial 
action of assuming power of state. Entirely their own action, 
win or lose" (SAIG 0304, 8/26/63). 
A message from .the White House on August 29 authorized 
Harkins to confirm to the Vietnamese Generals that the United 
States would support a coup if it had a good chance of succeeding, 
but did nc;>f involve United States armed forces. Lodge was autho­
rized to suspend United States aid at his discretion. (Deptel 272, 
8/29/63.) A cable from the President to Lodge on the same day stated: 
*In a cable to Harriman, Lodge complained that the VO!l. broadcast 
• had ".complicated our .already difficult problem" by eliminating 
''the possibility of the generals' effort achieving surprise.'' 
Lodge further \>.•arned that. "the US must not appear publicly in 
the matter, ~hus giving the 'kiss of deaU1' to its friends'' 
(Cable, Lodge to llarrirnan, 8/26/63).
