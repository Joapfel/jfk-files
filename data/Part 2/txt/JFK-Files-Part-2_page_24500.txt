(iii) TAYLOR/KENNEDY BAY OF PIGS INQUIRY 
Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, President Kennedy 
convened a "board of inquiry" which refiewed "the causes of ... [the] failure" 
I 
of the operation (Bissell, 6/9/75, PP·i 42,45). The members of the board were 
I 
Robert Kennedy~ General Maxwell Taylor[, Allen Dulles and Admiral Arleigh Burke. 
The panel examined the Bay of Pigs fai:lure for several weeks and issued its 
report on June 13, 1961. The "Taylor Report" does not mention the assassination

plots. _ -. I .· 
Bissell was questioned extensivel~ and-appeared to General Taylor to have 
been the principal person involved in the operation and much more knowledgeable 
than Dulles who had deliberately kept himself out of the planning and delegated 
responsibility to Bissell. (Taylor, p. 73). 
Bissell testified that he did not disclose to the Taylor/Kennedy Committee 
that there had been an assassination effort against Castro (Bissell, 6/9/75, 
p. 42). He put foruard several reasons for not having done_so. First, "the 
question was never asked." Second, he claimed Dulles already knew about the 
operation. Third, Bissell said "by that time the assassination attempt had been 
called off." Fourth, he contended that the assassination effort was "not germane" 
because it did not contribute to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. (Bissell, 
6/9/7_5, pp. 44-46; 6/11/75, p. 39). 
Bissell hastened to add that he had no reason to 'believe" that Allen Dulles,
