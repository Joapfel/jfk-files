regarding ex-members of subversive groups: background, type 
of information possessed, time _period covered, availability f o: 
interview and for testimony. 
Channeling information to case files 
(1) Memoranda regarding membership or activity in.subversive organiza-
• tions, including summaries of informant reports, shouid be 
channeled to case files of individuals involved. When informa­
tion from informants or surveillances is channeled to individual 
case files, it should be documented-
(2) When preparing lengthy channeling memoranda reporting material of 
interest to other offices, limit number of copies prepa,:ed to 
two for each other office. Clearly indicate next to na.r,;.es of 
other offices the page number containing information of interest 
and note on cover page that distribution of material to individual 
case files should be handled by recipient offices. 
Movement of subjects between offices 
If office of origin receives information that subject of current or 
past investigation changes residence ·to territory of another division, 
office of origin request verification within 30 days. If new residence 
confirmed, office of origin submit FD-128 to transfer origin. [Office 
of origin should furnish new office with any pertinent subversive data 
whi~h has not previously been reported 1.n a form suitable for dissemina­
tion, or suitable for incorporation in an LHM or repo"rt. 
Destruction of Channeling Memoranda 
At the option of appropriate field supervisors, in order to avoid the 
accumulation of channeling memoranda in a case file as well as to 
facilitate the subsequent preparation of LHMs or reports, the following 
procedure may be used: Files may be reopened for preparation of an 
"investigative insert" for later inclusion in a LI-JM or report, using 
T symbols identifying informants who have furnished prior information. 
Agent preparing this insert should also prepare a cover memorandum 
showing what serials in the file have been covered by his review and 
also identifying all symbol number informants involved and indicating 
the location of the original data (similar to documentation in the 
cover pages of a report). The channeling memoranda covered in the 
review can then be destroyed and the "investigative insert" along with 
its cover memorandum can, if necessary, be forwarded to another field 
division in the event the subject moves.] 
D. DISSEMINATION OF DATA DEVELOPED 
1. General Policy 
Information developed during these investigations should be furnished to 
other agencies in Executive Branch which have· a legitimate interest. See 
MRR, part II, se~tion 5, pertaining to Bureau's overall responsibilities 
.. and policies in dissemination. • 
Do not disseminate earlier reports without reviewiµg them to insure they 
'meet current reporting standards. ·If they are unsuitable for dissemina~ 
tion, prepare LHM containing pertinent information.

frequently.
