OIM 98-000nn 
13 April 1998 
MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Executive Director 
VIA: Director of Information Management 
FROM: Lee S. Strickland 
Chief, Information Review Group/OIM 
SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
1. (AIUO) Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly 
meeting, we have summarized below the significant- issues which 
are·under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our 
approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step: 
• First, with the staff, we argqe relevance although the statute and 
implementing regulations define ''assassination records" very 
broadly as including 
• (1) any records related to the assassination or Oswald, 
• (2) any records concerning the various conspiracy theories, and 
• (3) any records within the scope of previous investigations 
including ~h~ Church Committee, Pike Committee~ Warren 
Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations 
(HSCA), 1 
• Second, with the staff, we argue that rele~se would cause current 
damage although the exemptions under the JFK statute are much 
narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and 
• Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more 
detailed and formal presentation to the Board. 
1 (AIUO) It is the materials collected by the HSCA which are the most 
numerous and often the most troublesome in terms of sensitive·equities. They 
are generally referred to as the '' sequestered collection.''
