·lcontinue to threaten the police until policemen are trained 
properly in how to deal with Negroes. Captain Al·Prezio of the 
Troy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that 
Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization 
funded by OEO, uses the office of the·antipoverty organization 
as a headquarters to conduct mllitant civil rights work and to 
recruit teen-agers to incite riots arid arouse a Negro community 
on any issue that would create racial .unrest. 
Willie Wright, _ a duly-elected board member of the 
United Community Corporation,- Newark; New Jersey, is alleged 
·to have made statements concerning Negro rioting.such as "To 
hell with President Johnson when he says something about not 
tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more 
than 400 years." He is also quoted as having said: "It is my 
firm conviction that in order to overqome the white man's complete 
human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters, 
we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions 
that are being perpetrated against us by the white man. I most 
emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers 
and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions 
to protect· themselves against 'the most brutal atrocities to be 
seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the 
Newark and State Police. in the recent rebellion in the City of 
Newark." The OEO has requested Wright's suspension·pending·its 
investigation of.statements attributed toWright.

by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs 
Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide.
