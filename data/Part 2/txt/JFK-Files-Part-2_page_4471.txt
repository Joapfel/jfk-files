with the contingency planning for supporting any possible 
military action in Cuba, the Opa-Locka Interrogati9n 
Center as such was dismantled, although the personnel 
of the Center have been retained intact. In order to 
re-establish the flow of intelligence from refugees, 
it is proposed that Pan American Airways and KLM be 
induced to reinstitute their regular flights from 
Havana to Miami. This should be done as soon·as 
possible after the se·ttlement of the current negotiations 
and UN discussions. Coincident with this, the Opa-Locka 
refugee interrogation center will be re-established 
with the same p.ersonnel. 
2. Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be 
made to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the 
viability of and, where necessary, re-establish communica-
~'24 tions with the{).31Jrecruited agents now resident in Cuba. 
To an extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort 
will of course depend upon the stringency of future 
Cuban security and control action, which it is impossible 
as yet to accurately forecast. 
3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-
cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba 
will be reiterated and strengthened and every effort 
will be made to increase this coverage, both through 
the development of additional resident agents in Cuba
