THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION 
. 1. CIA is already in close touch '\.vith three reputable opposition groups 
(the Montecristi, Autentico· Party and the National Democratic Front). These 
all meet the fundamental criteria conditional to acceptance, i.e .. they are 
'for the revolution as originally conceived--r:-!.any being former 26th of July 
membe:rs--and are not identified '\.Vith either Batista or Trujillo. They are 
anti-Castro because of his failure to live up to the original 26th of July 
platforn1 and his apparent willingness to sell out to Communist domination 
and possible ultimate enslavement. • These ~roups, therefore, fit perfectly 
the planned opposition slogan of ''Restore the Revolution". 
2. An opposition ,Council or Junta will be fcrr.1.ed within 30 day<; from 
representatives of these groups augmented possibly by ·repre'sentatives of 
other groups. It is probably premature to have a .fixed platform for the Council 
but the Caracas Ma..'1.ifesto of 20 July 1958 contains a number of exploitable 
points. Two of the CIA group leaders were signers of the Manifesto.· The 
following points are suggested as a few possibilities: 
a. The Castro regime is the new dictatorship of Cuba subject 
• to strong Sino-Soviet inilue~ce. 
b. Cuba is entitled to an honest, democratic governrnent based 
on iree elections. There is no hope of this as long as Castro throttle·s 
I 
the rights of legitimate political pa:::-ties and. the freedom oi expression.
