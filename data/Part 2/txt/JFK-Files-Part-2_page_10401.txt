1. This memorandur.i contains information for the Director 
of Central Intelligence. 
2. This memorandum is submitted pursuant to advice given 
by the Deputy Director for Manager.ient and Services on 7 May 
that Office Directors report on activities, either under their 
cognizance or otherwise knoKn to them, the nature of Khich 
could possibly need explanation or justification when vicKed 
within the statutory responsibility and authority of the 
·Director of Central Intelligence. The responsibilities of the 
Office of Logistics (OL) are such that in all matters herein 
reported, except two, the actions undertaken were at the re­
quest of another Agency component. ~e have prepared i brief 
description of each action involved and then have included tJ1e 
name of the sponsoring component. The substantive reason for 
the requests for action by this Office will have to be deter­
mined by inquiry to _the designated sponsoring component. 
3. Facts pertaining to both actions undertaken at the 
initiative of this Office are as follows: 
a. A covert procurement proprietary concer~, dedi~ 
cated to the acquisition of firearms, ammunition, and 
related police-type equipment, is operated in Baltimore, 
Maryland. It was organized in 1969. This proprietary 
is operated in order to give the Agency a capability to 
·obtain such materiel without associating the procurement 
action with the United States Governr.ient. It is legally 
. necessary that the proprietary be licensed by both the 
State and Federal·jurisdictions. Since it is located in 
Maryland, it is appropriately licensed by the i!aryland 
State Police to buy and sell firearms and ammunition.
