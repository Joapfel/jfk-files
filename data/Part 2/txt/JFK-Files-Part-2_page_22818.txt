Senator Baker~ Pres.id~~t ·Kenn~'dy·• I! decision to begin 
MONGOOSE. Is it clear, Mr. Bundy, ·that President Kennedy made 
the decision to initiate the MONGOOSE program? 
Mr. Bundy. No question. 
Senator Baker. I notice in the staff interpretation 
under the column "Issues and Questions" that they alleged 
that you recall probably writing this memorandum. 
Mr.· Bundy. That is really a logical inference. The 
President would not himself have written a long memorandum of 
instructions of this kind. It is po~sible that General 
Taylor wrote it. But I think it is more likely that.I did. 
But in any event~ whichever of us did so was doing it as a 
staff officer for the Prsiden~•s convenience in recoiding 
his decision. 
Senator Baker, So at least to this extent there is 
no question about the chain of command, or the chance to 
control it, the President authorized it? 
Mr. Bundy. Just to underline that point, as I recall 
the paper which was shown to me, it is one from Mrs. Lincoln 
to General Taylor saying, the President wants you to have 
this as a description of the decisions. 
Senator Baker . Would you repeat that? 
Mr. Bundy. I think the covering memorandum on that 
document is from Mrs. Lincoln to General Taylor, and it says, 
the President wants you to have this as a record of his 
TOP SECRET
