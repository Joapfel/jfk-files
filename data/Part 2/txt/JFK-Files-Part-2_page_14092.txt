NOTE: Q 46 JUN 5 1975 
. The Senate Se) ~ommj t;tee...has exp,~ed a.."'1. urgent 
interest in the details of any FBI investigation concerning "'tl3.e 
disappearance of Thomas Riha, former Professor at University of 
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, in March, 1969. The Bureau con­
ducted no investigation regarding the disappearance. Ther? was 
considerable pub~icity wit.q reference to a statement made by 
Dr. Smiley, then President of the university, that he had been 
informed by a Government official that Riha "was alive and well" 
Smiley was interviewed by the El Paso Off i·ce. Smiley furnished 
information in the strictest of confidence, not to be dissemin-
~ted to any outside agency, r~garding his contacts with a CIA 
r =·· ... J ·representative in Boulder after the Riha disappearance. It was Assoc. Dir. _ 
Dep. AD Adm. - the CIA official who told him that Riha was alive and well. 
Dep. AD Inv. - Without the Smiley interview our response to the Senate Select
