27 March 1963 
HONDURAS 
1. There were 92 legal: travelers from Hon­
duras to Cuba in 1962 and 21 to date in 1963. 
Twelve travelers coµtinued to Soviet bloc coun­
tries. Most of the travel to Cuba was for one or 
two weeks, precluding any extensive paramilitary 
training, but a definite correlation can be es­
tablished between. the return of Hondurans from 
Cuban visits and the intensity of propaganda and 
labor agitation. Honduran exiles· in Cuba carry 
on a virulent propaganda campaign over Radio Ha­
~, calling for revolution. 
2. There are no known Honduran paramilitary 
formations, and other Central American Communists 
are known to have criticized the Honduran Commu­
nist Party for lack of militancy. The PCH ob­
tained a series of 16 aifferent military manuals 
in October, 1962, including manuals on the use of 
the carbine, explosi,ves 9 and demolition techniques. 
3. As in the case of Costa Rica, there are 
guerrilla units of Nicaraguan exiles based in 
thinly patrolled Honduran frontier areas, receiv­
ing support from Cuba and raiding sporadically 
into Nicaragua in the hope of sparking a mass up­
rising. One group under Carlos Fonseca Amador has 
about 40 men. 
4. Since 1 January. 1962, there have been only 
two arrests for subversive activity in Honduras. 
Neither man is known to have received training in 
Cuba, and both were released after short detention 
without trail. Three other individuals have been 
charged with subversive activity but no action was 
taken. 
5. Hondurans in leading organizational po­
sitions known or believed to have received train­
ing in Cuba include: 
Labor: Manuel Noe Rodriguez Reyes, Flores­
mila Castro, Luis Banegas Izaguirre, Sebastian Suazo 
Lopez, Jesus Otavio Hernandez, Darios Hector Toledo, 
Regina de Lainez, Anibal Moradelo, Felex Vanencia, 
Ramon Sabillon. Orellana,. and Guadalupe Reyes.
