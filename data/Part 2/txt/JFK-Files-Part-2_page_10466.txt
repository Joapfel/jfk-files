SUBJECT: Dom~-ic Tests for Agency Rcs.rch and 
Dev pment Efforts 
e. Remote Physiological Measurements -
An ORD-devclopca crrogcnic r:1agnetonctcr is 
being tested at a contractor's site for use 
as a remote cardiograph (magnetocardiograph). 
Some test subjects arc witting, but rno~t tests 
are on naive subjects (they do not know th~y 
are being tested). The magn~torneter is com­
pletely harmless to the subject and the test 
results are closely h~16. 
f. Personality Structure of Defectors 
Sttidy - ORD unaertoqt to cctermine ~ne per­
sonality structure of defectors during the 
period 1966-&9. The work primarily involved 
an analysis of the open literature on known 
defectors. An ancillary effort was concerned 
with. a stvdy of the phenomenon of defection 
itself, i.e., leaving one religion for another, 
or changing one set of political beliefs for 
another. The work was conducted at Stanford 
University. Identity 125 /LS) 
g. Trained Birds - Birds have been trained 
and tested in the United States to carry small 
intelligence collecting packages such as audio 
surveillance devices, small cameras, and cur­
rent measuring devices. Any data collected 
from uqwitting domestic sources would have been 
used only for engineering purposes ~nd then 
destroyed. 
h. Cor.n:mnications Link Loading Study - In 
the perioafroia 1970 through 191·2 various means 
were used to check out an intercept system designed 
to operate against Id~n 93 communications links. 
Under carefully controlled conditions, some U.S. 
microwave cor.u:1.Unica tions were recorded and passed 
through the intercept system under test to prove 
quality of performance. All intercept material 
connected with this ~as destroyed within a few weeks 
of the time of intercept and the material was never 
checkcci for substantive content. NSA participated 
and controlled most element? of the U.S. material.
