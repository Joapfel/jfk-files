requests that they be specified with an accompanying 
explanation of when and under what .circumstances they were 
destroyed. If no information regarding their destruction 
is available, please specify the.earliest time, and under 
what circumstances, CIA first became aware the items were 
missing. 
We expect that staff representatives of the Committee 
and of CIA will expedite compliance with these requests, 
and indicate priorities for production through preliminary 
review of this notification and discussion of the files 
involved. It would also be helpful if CIA identifies those 
persons within each Directorate and Division or Office who 
are actually in charge of reviewing and assembling material, 
so that Committee staff can also discuss these requests with· 
them and resolve rapidly any questions or difficulties 
which might arise. 
We also expect that a good deal of this material will 
be readily available in view of the reviews already done 
by CIA in this area over the past two years. As soon as 
some portions of any requestsa~e available for review, the 
Committee staff should be notified in order that they may 
begin their inspection while the remainder.is being assembled.
