a. North Vietnamese leaders 
are pressing their campaign for neu­
tralization of South Vietnam. 
b. They can count on Cambodia's 
support. Prince Sihanouk has said 
he believes neutralization of South 
Vietnam to be the only way to keep 
his country and the rest of the area 
from falling eventually into Commu­
nist hands. 
c .. The French feel the same 
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re­
portedly told a closed session of 
the Laotian National Assembly that 
the French were urging him to sup­
port Hanoi in this. 
d. Moreover, according to one 
of our clandestine sources, ·the North 
Vietnamese have talked Souvanlia into 
backing the neutralization proposi­
tion in the UH. 
e. The troublesome Polish ICC 
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who 
will be going home soon), has just 
returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and 
is trying, with somewhat less suc­
cess, to enlist British support too.
