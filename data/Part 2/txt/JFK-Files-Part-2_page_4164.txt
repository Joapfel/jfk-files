ADDITIONAL NOTE IN MY MEMORANDUM OF DISCUSSION WI TH THE 
PRESIDENT: 
The !>resident and l engaged in a brief discussion of the Soviet 
plans with respect to Cuba. He indicated that he once felt that the 
Soviets would withdraw all of their forces from Cuba, but that he had 
now reached _the conclusion that the plan had ch_anged. • Bundy volunteered 
that they.at no time had said specifically that they were to withdraw all 
of their· forces, in fact their::particular :wording was somewhat vague. 
McCone stated that indicator» were conflicting. On the one hand, certain 
information such f the ·rece%t Bra:ziHa!i}intercep~)and report of Castro's 
own statements would lead one to the conclusion that a gradual.and 
continuing withdrawal would take place;. that the Cubans were trained and 
became pro!ic'ient in operating advanced sophisticated Soviet equipment, 
This would take many months, prob~bly the balance of the year and 
Castro welcomed this period of time because it would mean a continuing 
Soviet interest in Cuba.; On the other hand, DCI pointed out that building 
of permanent installations and the arrival of undisclos~d but apparently 
sophisticated equipment, although in small quantities, nevertheless 
~portant volume would indicate a conclusion that Soviets were there to 
stay,· but perhaps on a somewhat reduced scale.
