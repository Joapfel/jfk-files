who wrote it. And to talk to them. If you have to stop let me know.· 
INTERVIEWER: No, we are fine, keep going. 
MR HALPERN: Anyway, I used to talk to these fellows and women to see what 
made them tick and it was a very difficult job listening to them many times 
when they had all these bright ideas about intelligence, how you could do this 
and how you could do that. And I had to bite my tongue and say, "Well. wait a 
minute. You know, we tried that 25 years ago or 20 years ago and it didn't 
work." And you couldn't just dampen their spirits by pouring cold water every 
time they would come up with an idea, and yet somehow you had to try_ to get 
them interested enough to look into the history of what happened and how you 
did this and how you couldn't do this and how, why certain things would seem 
beautiful when you dream them up and write them down on a piece of paper. In 
the real world it just don't work. And we learned the hard way. All of us. 
Trial and error. But you hope that the next group co_ming up didn't have to go 
' 
through that same torture if they would look at the record. And my concern 
was that very few people were,borrowing stuff out of the registry. Very few 
people were interested in going back into the history of what took place and 
certain activities. And you can't get it all out of a classroom. 
INTERVIEWER: Right. 
MR. HALPERN: And this was one of the things that bothered me while I was in 
that job for those last few years is that: how do you pass on the experiences 
so that people understand and learn without feeling that they are being pushed 
down, without feeling that they are being squashed? Because you want 
initiative. Half the business in dealing with human beings is initiative and _ 
I don't know enough about the technical side but I know enough about the human 
si~e. But you ha~e to stop them. Why spin wheels? Why push a lot of paper
