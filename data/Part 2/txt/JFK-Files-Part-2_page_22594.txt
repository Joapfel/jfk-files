since 1954. Other than Wiley's comment concerning Penning­
ton and Sweany, previously mentioned, there is nothing else 
from Wiley concerning Sweany. 
HOWARD HUNT 
There is nothing in the Wiley files to indicate any 
contact or association with Howard Hunt. Sometime prior to 
24 August 1970 and probably between the fall of 1969 and 
April 1970, Wiley provided SRS with a manuscript entitled 
"Give Us This Day," which was circulating amongst some New 
York publishers none of whom wished to publish it becaus~ 
of its controversial nature, i.e. Bay of Pigs operation. 
The writer of the manuscript was "later identified as Howard 
Hunt. The exact details concerning this incident are not 
available in the Wiley files. 
Further on this theme, on 19 June 1973, Wiley called 
Louis Vasaly of SRS to say that he had in his hands a copy 
of Howard Hunt's manuscript "Give Us This Day." Wiley was 
advised that he had probably forgotten but that we had had 
access ~o it several years ago when Hunt submitted it to 
a dlfitreDt publisher. (~iley reportedly ha~ ~ede it 
av~ilable at that time). Wiley said that he believed that 
this publisher was going to take advantage of the recent 
publicity (meaning Watergate apparently) and, of course, 
bring it out under Hunt's true name. Wiley was told that 
we (SRS) had no interest in his copy and that he could 
return it to the contact who made it available to him. 
There was no further discussion on the matter. 
The above is the extent of references to Howard Hunt 
in the Wiley files.
