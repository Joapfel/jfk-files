in the .·order they were presented,· ·and discussed this morning, 
the first being the academic issue, and as. I heard the Subcom­
mittee this morning, then I will have another go at the 
options,. give enough-op~ions in the option paper and bring~it 
: 
back before the Committee for a further look before we go -:en.·-}
