had a discussion with Mr. Belmont. Essentially, ,, ... 
McCone is most intsrested in technical coverage 
of individuals and installations of non-Soviet::-Bloc 
countries. He has left the impression that in 
his opinion such coverage could be expanded in 
the U.S. and thereby produce more intelligence 
and more sources. Our coverage in this field 
at the present time is quite extensive. With• 
regard to CIA, we have the understanding that 
if the agency desires particular technical 
coverage, we will give each request the necessary 
consideration.

TOPHAT 
A CIA agent recently obta.ined the message 
which our sen9.irive source Tophat secreted in a / J 
dropQ_n Moscow...:_) The messa.ge included information L.S 
concerning Soviet activities in France, Germany 
and Austria.. We have given this data to CIA. In 
addition, McCone was told that Topha,t identified 
Dunlap as a Soviet agent. We have told CIA that 
Tophat may ha.ve loaded the drop as early as 
June, 1963. The delay in obtaining the communica­
tion prevented us from getting into the Dunlap 
Case well before the subject committed suicide.
