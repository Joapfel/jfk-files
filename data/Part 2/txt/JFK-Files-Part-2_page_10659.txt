The Honorable Dick Cheney 
Secretary of Defense_' 
The Pentagon 
Washington, D.C. 20301 
Dear Secretary Cheney: 
The Senate Intelligence Committee, as part of the ann~al 
budget authorization process, will hold a hearing on U.S. 
-~ounterintelligence and security programs on May 10, 1990, in 
Room SH-219 of the Hart Senate Office· Building. We request 
that you make available to testify at that hearing Mr. Rich 
Haver, Special Assistant to the Secretary o~ Defense for 
Intelligence. Other witne~ses invited to testify at this 
hearing are FBI Director William S. Sessions, Mr. Ivan Selin, 
Undersecretary of State for Management, and Mr. Ted Price, 
the announced successor to Mr. Gardner Hatha·way as CIA 
Associate Deputy Director for Operatio.ns and head of the CIA 
Counterintellig,ence Center. 
We·are asking all witnesses to be prepared to discuss 
with the Committee the results of the Administration's review 
of counterintelligence and security programs for the 1990s, 
whether recent changes in the threat and operating 
environment require modifying objectives in the 1990s, and 
the implications for NFIP and non-NFIP resource allocation, 
program direction, and possible legislation. The hearing 
will also consider issues identified in the testimony from~ 
group of prominent citizens scheduled for March 22, and we 
will be in touch with you further on those·matters .. 
We would like Mr. Baver 'to address in his written 
testimony and be prepared to discuss the following questions: 
(1) what are the results of his review of DoD counter­
intelligence which you stated was "an early and high 
priority" in your letter of May 31, 1989? (2) To wh~t extent 
has political change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
diminished their intelligence threat in the 1990s and the 
1-requirements for CI operations and security measures against 
that threat? (3) To what extent do other traditional 
threats, such a• the PRC.and Cuba~ require greater attention 
in the 1990s? (4) What are the emerging threats in the 1990s 
from third world and "friendly" intelligence services, as 
well as narcotics traffickers and terrorists? (5) What new 
challenges do technological advances and transfers to 
criteria countries and terrorist groups pose in the 1990s? 
(6) What are the consequences of these changing threats for .1 /
