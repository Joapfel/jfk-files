My own impression as to this matter -- and I have already 
testified to the fa~t that I am relying on a recollection of 
a meeting of which ~here is no record -- is that had I been 
briefed on this essentially hypothetical internal, undirected

been right, but that is the quick judgment I appear to have

I did not feel, therefore, that it was a question that needed 
further analysis, and it did not, so far as I know, get 
further consideration inthe White !louse. My own recollection 
is that I didn'thear the words again in any serious con-
