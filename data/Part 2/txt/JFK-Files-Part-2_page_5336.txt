criteria of all three sections are inextricable. It sets 
out four separate criteria which, if CiA satisfies its 
burden; i.e, provides sufficient evidence to prove any one

of them, will operate to postpone a true name until the year

ones, each separated by a comma and between numbers 3 and 4 
and "OR." They are: 
i. The officer must be currently engaged in 
clandestine activities; OR, 
ii. The release of the officer's name would

operations with current intelligence value 
(presumably, the latter permits a review into 
the officer's past activities, agent 
relationships, and cover positions}; OR, 
iii. The release of the officer's true name would 
reasonably be expected to cause significant harm 
to a living person (including family members};

individual, former agents, anyone who shared the 
same cover or cover position, i.e.@ dedicated 7 
Department of State slot -within an e~assy; OR,
