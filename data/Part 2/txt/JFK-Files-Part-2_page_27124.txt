those responsibilities assigned directly to CIA (and thus 
chiefly from paragraphs lb, 3b, 3c, 3d and 9 of NSCID/5, the 
chief provisos of which have been noted above). 
In our view the DCI is not exercising under NSCID/5 
responsible centralized direction of counterintelligence 
clandestine activity. As indicated to the Commission in 
verbal testimony,. the current Director has spent less than 
four to five hburs with the Counterintelligence Staff from 
the moment he became the Deputy Director for Operations 
until the present. His knowledge of the activity during the 
period when he was Chief of the Far East Division was one of 
failure and is reflected in an Inspector General's report of 
.the period. This and some of his communications to the field 
are a matter of record in the FE Division. Instead of exer-
cising leadership in resolving the serious problems of pene­
tration and disinformation, which are of prime importance to 
the security of the country, under his aegis there has been a 
decentralization and mutilation within the Agency and, there­
fore, within the Community of high-level counterintelligence 
activity. We believe that substantial changes are needed 
and that these changes should be effected with and through 
an -understanding of our counterintelligence mission, capa­
bilities and needs. In setting forth our collective views on 
these matters, we do so, drawing on our professional experi­
ence as to what needs to be set right and how it may be done. 
The primary cause of the present vulnerabi'lity of our na­
tional security is the inadequate attention and serious lack 
of understanding of the counterintelligence function .
