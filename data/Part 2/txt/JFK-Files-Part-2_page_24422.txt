Harvey terminated the operation in mid-February 1963. At a 
meeting with Roselli in Los Angeles, it was agreed that Roselli 
would taper off his communications with Varona (I.G., pp. 52-53). 
Roselli testified that he simply broke off contact with the Cubans. 
However, he never informed them that the offer of $150,000 for 
Castro's assassination had been withdrawn* (Roselli, p. 45). 
The agency personnel who dealt with 
Roselli attributed his motivation to patriotism** and testified 
that he was not paid for his services. According to O'Connell, 
Roselli 
"paid his way, he paid his own hotel fees, he paid 
his own travel .... And he never took a nickel, he 
said, no, as long as it is for the government of the 
United States, this is the least I can do, because 
I owe it a lot . " ( 0' Connell, p. 27) . 
Edwards agreed that Roselli was "never paid a cent" (Edwards, 
p. 16), and Maheu testified that "Giancana was paid nothing at 
all, not even for expenses, and that Mr. Roselli was given a 
pittance that did_ not even begin to cover his expenses (Maheu, 
27 
7/29, p. 68). It is clear, however, that the CIA did pay Roselli's 
* "Q: As far as those Cubans knew, then the offer which they 
understood from you to come from Wall Street was still 
outstanding? 
"A: I don't know if they still think so ... I didn't see 
them after that to tell them that" (Roselli, p. 45). 11 
** Roselli claims that he was motivated by "honor and dedi­
cation" (Roselli, p. 59) . 
In 1943, Roselli had been convicted of extorting money from 
motion picture producers to insure studios against labor.strikes,~ 
and during the period of his contacts with the CIA, Roselli was 
deeply involved in hotel and gambling operations in Las Vegas 
{File R-505, Summary of FBI Documents). It is possible that he 
believed cooperating with the government in the assassination 
operation might serve him well in the future.
