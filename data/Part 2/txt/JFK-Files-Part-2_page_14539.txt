In tlie reoent· past, and particularly during the 
month o.f November, I have noted that your off tee has been 
jorwardi-ng a great volume of tntell tgenae matert,,al to the 
Bureau. I hal,e reference to the information produced by 
your established sources and relating to the-tense 
international situations~ especially those areat'ed by the 
crises tn the Middle East and .Eastern Europe. Much of the 
material has been of a high intelligence nature or potemtial 
and, upon its receipt at the Bureau,, has been given wt th in-
t he-hour dissemination to other agencies and departments, 
part icularl 11 the Department o~f State. The latter Department 
has informed me that it has placed a high evaluation on 
some of thts intell fg·ence and has found it most useful in 
its day-to-day operations. 
I am writing to you to stress the importance of 
continutng the flow of this vital information to the Bureau 
to enable us not only to maintain but to increase the · 
,--·--·~-, efficiency of our operations in this field. \
