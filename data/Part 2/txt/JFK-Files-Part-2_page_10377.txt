Project :Me-e-ktn-ghl-r-e-, a telephone intercept activity, w~s conducted 
betwe~n 12 March 1963 and.15 June 1963, and targeted tv:o Washington­
based· newsmen who, at the .time, had been publishing ne¼:s articles 
based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this A 6 ency 
and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligel"!-ce. 
Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's 
office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections 
were established with the assistance of a telephone company official 
·who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col. 
Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards I authority for the a~tivity was ~-1r. 
John A. McCone, Director of Central Intcilige.nce. The latter conducted 
the activity in coordination with the .Attorney General (~v1r. Robert Kennedy}, 
the Secretary of Defe:ise (:Vir. Robert Mc:'\amara}, and the Director of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen. Joseph Carroll). In addition to 
Office of Security personnel directly involved in the inter.cepts and 
• research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency 
• officials are on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director 
o{ Central Intelli~ence (General Marshall S. Carter), the Inspector 
General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence 
Houston). 
The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con­
tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources 
of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they 
received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators 
and 6 members of Congress, ail identified; 21 Congressional staff members, 
o! whom 11 were identified; 16 government employees, including a staff 
member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an 
Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number 
·.of other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span 
of the activity precluded positive identification. It was observed that through 
these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official 
data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen· 
for release, ·establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines 
were actually from the sources of the tar get newsmen. 
Since the termination of Project Moek·~~. those materials related 
to it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access 
of two Office of Security professjonals/;
