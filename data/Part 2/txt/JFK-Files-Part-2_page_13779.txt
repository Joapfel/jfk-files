The Committee seeks to determine the nature of 
FBI counterintelligence operations directed at 
foreign intelligence activities within _the 
United States or at any other hostile foreign­
related activities.~ithin.the United States. 
Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi­
ties go beyond intelligence collection, the 
Committee must consider whether such practices 
require statutory authorization. The impact 
of counterintelligence operations on United 
States foreign relations will also be considered.
