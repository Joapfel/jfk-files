that. he had now rec~ive~ t.he invitation, and invitin~ him to coffee at hie house!

d, •we are puzzled by what at tiret eight appeared 
to be a date, 22.~II.1961, 1n the heading immediately above 
the text on page l. In fact the Roman numeral, •xrr~ are 
the cyr1llic letter X71', but we do not underetand their moaning. Can.AELADLE explain this? 
e. "What 1e the name in which the document 1e 
11gned., and does AELADLE know the true identity or thia pereont 
t,a,"we are a 11\tle surprised at the oyr1111c trans­
literation or ikYNNE-ELL°IS?J name. We should have expected the 
KOB to have a system which ~ould enable them to get back to 
the correct English spelling. Admittedly ~~ELLIS) a name 
is an awkward one to deal with. oC'

was apparently e~nt~only on 11th November, Can AELADLE oomment on this? vu 
5. "We do not wish to suggest by theee comments that -we ~uspaot th~t this document might be a forgery, but we 
would be grateful for your oonf1rmat1on that you do not consider this a posa1bil1ty.
