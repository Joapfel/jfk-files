Dear Ms. Denk: 
This is in response to referent request. 
Searches were made for information responsive to the 
request and materials were provided for examination by ARRB 
staff. From that examination, staff members selected a 
number of documents to be inc·luded within the JFK 
Collection. Those documents have now been included with the 
JFK Collection and are being processed for released to NARA. 
This concludes the Agency's action on this request. If 
you have any question, please advise. 
Sincerely, 
J. Barry Harrels 
JFK Project Officer
