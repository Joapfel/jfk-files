By way o.f illustrating some of the problems 
encountered in acquiring adequate personnel for the 
JMATE operation, on the very day that President 
Eisenhower was approving the anti-Castro program, a 
memorandum was being sent to the Deputy Director for 
Plans from .the Chief, Western Hem:i,.sphere Division 
noting that two individuals assigned to the Office· 
of Training were·urgently needed for service in WH/4. 
Colonel King reported to the DDP that although Colonel 
Matt Baird, Director of Training, was agreeable to 
the release of the two individuals to serve as PM

The author of this history· attempted to arrange 
oral history interviews with Colonels Hawkins and Egan, 
but in neitQer.case would the individuals consent to 
such interview. In addition, the author also asked 
each man if he would be willing to respond to a series 
of written questions, and· neither would agree to this. 
It was made quite clear to the author that both indi­
viduals harbored considerable resentment about their 
relationships and association with the Agency at the 
time of the Bay of Pigs. In a similar manner,. Col. 
John F. Mallard, United States Marine Corps who was 
Liaison Officer between the Agency and the Depart-
ment of Defense, at the time of the Bay of Pigs, also 
rejected the author's request for either an oral inter­
view or a response to written questions.
