Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President 
of the United States on the Independent Progressive Party 
ticket in 1952. This party was formed in California in 1948 
and ceased to exist in 1964, when it failed to poll sufficient 
votes to remain on a California ballot. The California 
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in 
its 1955 report on page fort~-six, states in part that the 
Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly 
captured by the communists and soon was being operated lock, 
stock and'barrel by the Communist Party of California. 
A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent 
Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institute For Marxist
