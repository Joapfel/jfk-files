On March 13, 1961, a dissident in the Dominican Republic 
asked for fragmentation grenades ''for use during the neit week 
or so." This request was communicated to CIA Headquarters 
on March 14, 1961, and was followed the next day by an additional 
request for 50 fragmentation grenades, 5 rapid-fire weapons, 
and 10 .64 mm anti-tank rockets. This furtner request was also 
passed on to CIA Headquarters. (Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61)

in their minds. to have a picn1c but do not have 
the ingredients for the salad. Lately they ;,ave· 
developed a. plan for the picnic,which just.might 
work if they could find the proper food. T.hey

any of these requests and the CIA officer who drafted the 
February 13 memorandum stated the view that some of the ques­
tions raised by the dissidents dicl not rec:;uire an ans,.,er.
