In my m~morandum of 10-6-61 it was pointed out that we 
had proposed to the Department of. State the expansion of this . . - --~ 
progr~un to fifteen Central and South American countries o 111e program.:·."'· 
involves the developing of live sources in diplomatic establisfunents ·'' 
in the U.S. of foreign countries with emphasis on countries faced· .<~: 
with communist subversion, Sino-Soviet bloc activity or revolutionary•;---~ 
situations. We felt the existing situation in Latin America • .. . \ • 
warranted this expansion. In view of the fact that U. Alexis· . . •·:_'.:.--·,. 
· Jolmson, Deputy Under Secretary· of State for Political ,.1-\,ffairs, :.j--, 
-, declined· State clearance for this exnansion it was recom1nended -. _ _.
