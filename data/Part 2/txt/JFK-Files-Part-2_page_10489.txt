Hi~htower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for 
Washington, came to see me to ask about the pr9priety 
of this action. 
14. • The use of IDEN-132 a ircrai t 
has been remarkably secure, but DCI ~cCone himself 
forgot about the cover arrangement and became quite 
exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the 
San Francisco airport for the Republican ~ational Con-
vention in 1961 aboard the IDEN-133 with 
the -highly visible tail nun,ber 1DE.!'\-'-l.3+. This· was, I 
explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate 
charter, but he didn't like it. 
15. McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen 
in Washington. In fact, they gave him a gift and a 
luncheon when he left Washin~ton, which is perhaps 
indicative of the press's relations with him. However, 
in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible 
Goy c 1-:._i_1£_l en i_ , he d i d t r y t o b r i n g pr cs sure on t ll e p u I) 1 is 11 c r 
and the auihors to change things. They did not change 
a comma, and I doubt that this old saw will c..ver sing 
again. 
16. Finally, and this will reflect my ~iddle 
Western Protestant upb1·in~ing, ~.!cConc 's dealings with 
the Vatican, i"J1cluding Pope John XX I I I and Pope Paul 
VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certai.n quarters. 
17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a 
sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that 
allegations fro:il any quarter which cast these things in 
the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention, 
and no amount of denial would ever set the record straight. 
If I may be of any assistance in tracking clown further 
details, I am·of course at your disposal, but I would point
