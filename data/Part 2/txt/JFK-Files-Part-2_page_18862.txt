they have been to.ld by the Russ·ians they probably would be 
suruei,lled as a result of their contact with the Russians. Cc.-) 
The remarks made to the taxi driver, as reported 
by him, plus the activities of this group, reflect a definite 
effort on their part to determine whether they were actually 
-under surveillanceo The admisaion by the ta.xi driver that he 
did not detect any surveillance seemed to indicat~ that it was 
handled properly and with discretion. This would appear to be 
borne out Ju~ther by the fact that when Mr~ JAFFEE and his wife 
entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked out of the Mayflower • 
Hotel onto the street and were obviously not aware of the fact 1 
that Bureau Agents had them under surveillance in the lobby of {y 
the hotel~ ~ 
The surveillance of Mr. crnd Mrs. JAFFE'E was discon­
tinued at 12:42 AoM., when i,t was learned from the cab driver 
that they possibly were "newspaper people", but thereafter in- 1,,.~JJ 
quiries were rode in the hotel to determine the identity of the~ JAFFEEs. • 
In uiew cf the difficult circumstances under whioh 
this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that it·· \tt-1' 
was handled indiscreetly and, therefore, no administratiue ~v, 
action is recommended.
