This conflict in testimony, which the Committee has been unable 
to resolve through its hearings or the documentary record, leave~ un­
answered the most serious question of whether the CIA was acting 
pursuant to higher authority (the CIA~s view) or was pursuing coup 
activities in Chile without sufficient communication (the Kissinger/ 
Haig view). 
* The basic issue is whether or not the CIA informed the White House of 
its activities. In context, informing was tantamount to being authorized. 
No one who testified believed that the CIA was required to seek step-by­
step authorization for its activities; rather the burden was on the White 
House to object if a line of activity being pursued by the CIA seemed 
unwise. Both Kissinger and Haig agreed that if the CIA had proposed a oersua­
sive plan to them, it almost certainly would have been aooroved. The CIA 
did not believe it needed specific White House authorization to transfer_wea-
pons to the Chileans; in fact, CI~ Deputy Director (Plans) Thomas 
Karamessines testified that he did not formally approve the transfer, 
but rather that in the context of the project it was clear that the 
Agency had the authority to transfer weapons and that it was clear to 
Karamessirtes' subordinates that he would approve their decision to do 
so. He believed he probably was informed before the weapons actually 
were sent.
