operation. This ended consideration of this subject. With 
this one exception I never heard any discussion of assassina­
tion attempts against anyone." 
Do you recall this meeting now? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I recall just what I said there. And I 
think probably should expand on that a little bit, because 
in looking at it it is not as clear as I would like it to be. 
When I mentioned the assassination attempt it was not 
necessarily limited to -- or it might have been CIA personnel. 
It also included encouraging one of the many factions that 
might not like him there to take action on their own, with 
CIA encouragement. 
Senator Hart. What kind of encouragement, material 
support, financial support? 
Mr. Dillon. That, or moral support, if they did the US 
would recognize them if they became the head, and would help 
them. 
Senator Hart. Was there any discussion that you can 
recall of the passage o- weapons? 
Mr. Dillon. No, no detail like that. This was very brief, 
very general, and just turned off by the CIA people at that 
time. 
Mr. Baron. So this mention of assassination could have 
included a CIA sponsored assassination attempt? 
Mr. Dillon. It could have, yes.
