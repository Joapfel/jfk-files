14. Mexico 
The Castro regime-has been careful in the past 
to avoid antagonizing the Mexican government, in 
-view of the importance to Cuba of maintaining its 
embassy and its civil air connections through Mexico. 
The ·eubans continue to use their embassy in Mexico 
City as well as individual Mexican nationals and 
exiled Central American residents there to support 
subversive activities elsewhere in Central America. 
The activities of Mexican journalist Victor Rico 
Galan are a case in point.

Nicaragua 
Cuban subversive efforts aimed at Nicaragua 
have been channeled principally through the National 
Liberation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated revo­
lutionary organization. Most of this group's guer­
rilla leaders were trained in Cuba in 1961-62, along 
with members of various other Nicaraguan revolu­
tionary movements. Cuban aid to the FLN takes the 
form of financial support, training, and guidance, 
but details are lacking regarding its current size 
or effectiveness. In August 1963, the FLN launched 
an unsuccessful guerrilla foray into northern 
Nicaragua from Honduras which cost the small organ­
ization some of its key personnel. Since then, 
the FLN has been the object of harassment by both 
Nicaraguan and Honduran security forces. It has 
shown no capability to make another move soon.
