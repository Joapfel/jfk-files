Q: That indicates that t,e caller--could you please 
read that to us. Reaj what you wrote that day. 
A: "The caller from the :uban Embassy was ~~identi­
fied until Headquarters sent traces on Oswa.ld." 
Now, that would have jeen in. answer to the cable. 
that was dated 8th October. I .believe their -cable

have been available f6r such a compatison. It is possi­
ble that the·connection bet~een the 10/1/63 call and
