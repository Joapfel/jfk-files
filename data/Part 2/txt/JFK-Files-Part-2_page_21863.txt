Hedgman summarized his testimony on this question in his 
second appearance: 
I orobablv had authority to act on my own 
but ... it was possible that I had to go 
back and get clearance for my action. 
(Hedgman, 8/25/75, p. 11; see also 8/21/75, 
p. 39.) 
Hedgman testified, however, that a "policy decision" had been 
made -- that assassination had been "approved" as "one means" of 
eliminating Lurnumba as a political threat (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52). 
I thought the policy decision had been made 
in the White House, not in the Agency, and 
that the Agency had been selected as the 
Executive Agent, if you will, to carry out 
a political decision. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52.) 
C:,,, Although Hedgman assumed that the· President had not personally 
selected the means of assassination, he testified that he was under 
the impression. that the President had authorized the CIA to do so 
and to proceed to take action: 
Hedgman: ... I doubt that I thought the 
President had said, you use this system. 
But·my understanding is the President had 
made a decision that an act should take 
place, but then put that into the hands of 
the Agency to carry out his decision. 
Q: Whatever that act was to be, it was 
clearly to be assassination or the death 
of the foreign political leader? 
Hedgman: Yes. 
~ Instigated by the· CIA, initiated by the CIA? 
Hed~man: Certainly if those -- ~f ~/~·G~-~tlie~' s 
let al agents were employed, that would have been 
the result, yes. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 104.)
