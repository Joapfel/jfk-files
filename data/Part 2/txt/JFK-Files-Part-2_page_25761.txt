Your interest in helping to form an FPCC Chapter in llew .Orleans is i:rateduliy 
r::ceived. I s¥11 try to give you some basic information now .eo that you may. have 
a 0ctter '.'lictt.re of what this entails. 
For one tr~ne, r. ar., enclosina a copy of our Constitution and Hy-I..·wra for· ::1.ll 
c:,.,ptcrs and St 1udent Councils, You will note that there is considerable autonomy 
f 0 r .'.\n ·ore;;i.nization our sizo. rle try and let all Chapters operate according to the 
' bcal requireroe~ts. • Natur-ally, tl:r,r,, a minimul reculations which must be mcit. 
:' All Chapters can-receive liter~.ture in bulk at a discmmted rate and resell at L . I • 
t~·" r,,t::til riric~ and use the proceeds for further Chapter activitic&~ '.::rcdit is 
extended and pay,::ont is not re,1uirod vrith the or-der, We do expect payment within a. 
re~sonable period so that ~e m~y continue our end of the operation. 
It wculd be hard to concieve of a chapter with as ferr members as seem to exist 
in the !s'ew Orleans area. I have· just gone throu;;h our files and find that Lousiana 
seer.is somewhat restricted for Fair Play activities.. H01iever, with vrhat is t::ere 
perhaps you co11~d build. a larger eroup if a f(!l'f people would undertake the disciplined 
responsibi'lity·of concrete ort::anizational work. ' •

We certainly are not at all adverse to a very small Chapter but certainly ;oold. 
expect that: thero woiild be at least twice the amount needed to conduct a lega_l executive 
bo:ird for the Chapter, Should this be reas,,nable. we could readily is.sue a charter f<r
