1.\j' \ Captain said he had three machine guns himself "but can be identified 
by serial numbers as having been issued to him. Therefore unable to 
use them." (Santiago 562, 18 October) Colonel Wimert and the Chief 
of Station have testified that the officers wanted the machine guns 
for self-~rqtection. The question, of course, is whether the arms were 
intended for use, or were used, in the kidnapping of General Schneider. 
The fact that the weapons were provided the Lt. Colonel and the Navy 
Captain and that Viaux associates were convicted of the Schneider killing 
sll:ggests that the guns were not iO.volved. 
The machine guns and. ammunition were seft.t from Washington by diplo­

rather than Viaux. An example of th~s shift in focus was the· decision to 
provide the Army Lt. Colonel and the Army Captain the tear gas grenades 
originally intended for Viaux. A cable from Santiago explained the purpose of

this action: 
-ttation plans gi~e six tear gas grenades to 
Colonel Wimert for delivery to Armed Forces 
officers (deletion) instead of having False 
Flag Officer deliver them to Viaux grobp. 
Our reasoning is that Wimert dealing with 
active duty officers. Also False Flagger 
leaving evening 18 October, and will not be 
replaced but Wimert will stay here. • Hence. 
important that Wimert credibility with Armed 
Forces officers be strengthened.
