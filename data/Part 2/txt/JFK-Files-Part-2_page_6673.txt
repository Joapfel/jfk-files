and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee 
liarvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in 
the automated security database known as the Management Data 
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were 
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the 
above numbers circa 1964. A'hand search was also conducted 
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated 
system. This hand search produced the same results as the 
automated search of MOP/PS. 
(U} In your request specific mention is made of an 
HTLINGUAL file. MOP/PS reflects OS maintained four official 
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file}, 
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of 
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along 
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been 
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files 
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of 
Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of 
these files. 
(U) Attached is all of the available information 
regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This 
information was retrieved from[Lydia Hoffmaryof the 
Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and 
from a review of general office administrative files. 
Ouestion 2; (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file 
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was 
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and 
the documents that were in the file at the time of the 
assassination. 
Response; (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have 
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in 
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in 
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was 
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening 
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as: 
#0077826 
#0090079 
#0093466 
#0119144 
Opened approximately July 1952 
Opened approximately February 1953 
Opened approximately July 1953 
Opened approximately May 1955
