man from the United States. The young Cuban had been telling 
Wiley that everything was fine in Cuba and that it was not

this young Cuban in more or less routine reported style· 
when all of a sudden a police officer with two others moved

up by the two assistants to the ranking police officer and

had been interviewing. All these police officers were in 
plain clothes.

one of those who was on tour of the Soviet Union with 
Wiley after he had gone to the Vienna Youth Festival pre­
