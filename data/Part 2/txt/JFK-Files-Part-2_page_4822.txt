with Congress? 
MR. HALPERN: I don't know. I don't think there were very 
many. I think everything was handled through Jim. Because in 
those days, officers below the rank of the Deputy Director and 
Executive Director, very few officers as such ever had any 
direct relations with the Congress.· Bill Broe as the IG, under 
Schlesi.nge~. was the first guy, first officer below that top 
level who was directed to testify in Congress on the Chile 
affair because Bill had been Chief of the WH Division when it 
all took place. And so, Bill's contacts with Geneene of ITT, 
for the substantive of is sue, I be 1i eve Bi 11 was the first guy 
who. Schlesing~r changed the ground rules right away. 
And I think he was the first guy. Other Directors had tiken 
officers up there with them to testify in executive ~ession, 
classified hearings and briefings. Dick Helms took. Ted 
Shackley, for example, to testify about a number of things. I 
think one of them was the Laos war and another one on Vietnam 
and so on. But aside from that kind ~f. the Director doing the 
briefings with a staff officer to assist him, in effect, I 
think Bill Broe was the first, I believe he was the first, 
officer to testify in his own right under oath, etc. And then 
his testimony was declassified almost immediately and published. 
INTERVIEWER: And the Director was present? 
MR. HALPERN: I don't remember whether he was present or not. 
INTERVIEWER: So this was a . . 
MR. HALPERN: It was a change.
