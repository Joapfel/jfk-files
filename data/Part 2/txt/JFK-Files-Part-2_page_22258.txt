OCCUR_R~~-CE: McCone explained the situation which has resulted tn a 'group led by 
[~~ndr:-:ao:s~lacquiring B-26' s which are now in Costa Rica prepared to conduct a bombing 
raid on Cuba. The group discussed a draft State Department cable to various Latin 
American embassies related to this incident. It was agreed that the point should be 
made in the cable that any such contemplated raid would be premature at this time. Dis­
association of the United States from any such endeavor was to be accomplished by leaking 
stories of the impending raid to the press.
