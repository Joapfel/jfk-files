f. Memorandum to C/FI from William Harvey dated 27 June 1963 
"As far as ZRRIFLE aspects this op, which have been 
covered under the QJWIN authorization for security reasons and with 
which Fletcher Knight is fully familiar, except for one precautionary 
'life line', aspects of this case have been terminated and need 
no longer be considered part of this project." 
g. OLLA 1974 dated 24 April 1964 
QJWIN has been terminated amicably. Para 2 - "QJWIN's 
personal history reflects major instability and the habit of 
hedging his bets is undoubtedly part of his character. This does 
not imply a security breach. There is nothing to indicate that he 
has discussed his CIA relationship with anyone except, perhaps his wife."
