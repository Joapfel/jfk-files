,'. ,:ser~es of[ ,lCBM firi11gs_ t_Q{ i -e- --c

• January. i 
1 1 b. Since our last mention of 
,, i this subject,we have picked up indi-
1 cations that some of the· firings .. 
this time may be made from operational/ , 
launchers rather than from the Ty-
uratam rangehead. 
c. There has been unusual 
traffic on the strategic rocket 
forces communications link between 
the operational site at Plesetsk 
and Moscow similar to that which 
preceded the firing last October -
from Plesetsk to Kamchatka. 
d. In addition, some inter­
cepted telephone conversations have 
implied that the firing ranges would 
be different this time. 
e. We also have some fragmentary 
evidence that the forthcoming firings 
may be the ooject of a special 
tracking or detection project.
