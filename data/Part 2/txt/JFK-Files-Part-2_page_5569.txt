MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Discussions with Center for the Study of 
Intelligence on the Release of Material Relating 
to Yuriy .Nosenko 
1. On 3 August I had a series of discussions w-ith the 
staff of,the Center for the Study of Intelli.9ence (CSI) s:tt 
the center's off ice in the Ames Building. our· discussion •• 
centered on the disposition of more than 3,200_pages • 
relating to the career of former KGB officer--and current 
CIA independent contractor--Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko. The 
documents are being reviewed for declassification and 
release as required by the.JFK law. 
2. The Declassification Problem: CSI's de­
classification staff has carefully reviewed the Nosenko 
material. Ellie Neiman--a career Directorate of Operations 
officer--is representing the DO_ in the review process. 
Ms. Neiman noted that the material can be divided into two 
parts: 
• Approximately 800 pages that deal with Nosenko' s infor­
mation about Lee Harvey Oswald's life in the Soviet Union 
and his relationship with the KGB. 
• A b~dy of counterintelligence staff studies, inter­
rogation reports, file reviews, and bona fides studies on 
Nosenko totaling some 2,400 pages. These studies contain 
sensitive personal and operational material. For 
example: 
Information on how CIA conducted operations in 
Moscow ("sticks and bricks"), material on how 
bona fides analysis is conducted, and details on 
how we evaluated the KGB's operations.
