While those officials never consented to actual assassina-

In early 1961, McGeorge Bundy was informed of a CIA 
project described as the development of a capability to 
assassinate.* Bundy raised no objection and, according to 
Bissell, may have been more affirmative. Although Bissell 
stated that he did not infer authorization from Bundy's 
. 
remarks for the .underworld plot against Castro that was then 
underway, the fact that he believed that the development 
of an assassinition capability had been approved by the White 
House (which he subsequently told to Harvey) may well have 
contributed to the general perception that assassination was 
not prohibited. 
Documents indicate that in May 1962, Attorney General 
Kennedy was told that the CIA had sought to assassinate 
Castro prior to the Bay of Pigs. According to the CIA 
officials· present at the briefing, the Attorney. General 
* Bundy, who was National Security Advisor to the President, 
had an obligation to tell the Pr~s.ident of such a grave • 
matter, even though it was only a discussion of a capability 
to assassinate. His failure to do so was a serious e~ror.
