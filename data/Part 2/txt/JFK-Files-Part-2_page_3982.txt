My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was expelled 
from the DDR_by the _East German officials who forcibly 
.propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin. 
As we initially escorted Mr. Nagell back to US Army l.ospital 
tierlin in the US Missio~ ~ehicle, he seemed unsure of where 
he was, and who we were, as well a,s being angry and belligerent 
about his treatment by the East Germans. In the course of 
the two hour interview which was then conducted ·at tLe 
hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and 
gave a more cooperative and coherent history. At his 
insistance, the iriterview took place in the· presence of the 
attorney Mr. Ricey s. New~ Jr~, who acted in an unofficial 
capacity as a legally oriented "friend." 
The salient aspects of Mr. Nagell's history are ~s follows .. __ 
He s_ays he was on active military duty (Army) from 1948 until. 
1959. For the first three of these years he~waa an enlisted· 
man, and· for the last six- he was an officer, working in 
military intelligence. In 1954'he was the sole survivor in 
a plane cra1;;h which resulted in a Lrain concussion, r.urnerous 
• physical injuries, and prolonged military hospital izc;t ion. 
Hr. i.Jacell now claims that he believes it was this head 
injury which resulted in his "unstable personality aJ1J 
immature or impulsive behaviour." lfe attributes to this 
instability his marital difficulties and his decision tc 
resign his commission in 1959, something which he n0\- 1 con!;iciers 
unwise. At the time of his leaving the service he was not 
awarded a disability pension, but he says th~t he wa~ later 
able to successfully petition the VA for a. "li 1+'ii disaLility." 
He claims that he had never seen a psychic1trif;t durili[: his
