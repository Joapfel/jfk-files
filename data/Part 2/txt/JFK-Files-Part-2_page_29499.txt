Q: Why not? 
A: Wel 1, there were cases of other Americans 
who contacted the Embassy for various rea­
sons. We were only obliged to report the 
con~act ·of any American with the Soviet 
Embas.sy. 
Q: So in Oswald's case it was just .a routine 
contact by an American as far as you were 
concerned? 
A: Yes. 
_Q: If that is ·the ca.se, then why was the cable 
·sent concerning Oswald? 
A: that is why I asked you earlier, becaus~ 
in the ~ase of Americans we were required 
to send it by cable and not by dispatch. 
Q: Was that a written regulation? 
A: l don't know if it was .written bu.tit wa,s , 
understood at our S"tat ion that any Americans . [ ~ 
who were in touch wit'i the So_viet E;mbassy . / . _ 
that that . fact hac t_o be known_{to Headq-ua r- • 
ters by cable. It was always sent that way, -
whether we considired it very uni_mportant 
or routine or not. So there must have 
been a regulation but I am not aware .of. 
it. 5 39 / h f, . A _ _ -I+- f: •
