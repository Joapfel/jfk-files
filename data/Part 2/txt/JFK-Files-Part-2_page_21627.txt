carried out on October 19. 
witting of the above plan, has promised to keep 
the Carabineros away from the Schneier houseto assure that the 
abduction will not be interferred with. General Viaux is 
knowledgeable of the above operation, but is not directly 
involved." 
What do you think "not directly involved" refers to? 
Why not just not involved? 
Mr. Phillips. I think that probably referred to what 
I was saying before, that in these situations it is not very 
unusual that there is not some talk that everybody has a cousin 
that works with some group type of thing. 
And I believe that it must refer to that. 
Mr. Schwarz. Taking the actual cable, is the actual 
cable in the Senator's books? 
Mr. Inderfurther~ No. 
Mr. Schwarz. Let me read the full text of that para-
graph from the cable. It is a cable apparently dated 19 
October on the subject of General Viaux: 
"General Viaux, knowledgeable of above operation, but not 
directly involved. He has been sent to Vina to stay with 
prominent physician. Will be seen fn public places during 19 
and 20 October to demonstrate fact that above operation is 
not his doing. Will be allowed to return to Santiago at end of 
week."
