I I' 3. Oswald's Defection to USSR 
With regard to Oswald'i s defection to the S.oviet Union, Rocca 
said Oswald would have been>of interest to the military and the FBI 
and that CIA was only interested in the '.'information"· aspect of the 
case. Rocca could not cite; any, example of a U.S. citizen defecting 
on qehalf of any interest of the U.S. government. 
With regard to the "H,()over" memorandum. of June 3, 1960 ra1.s1.ng 
the possibility that an imposter could be using Oswald's birth certifi­
cate, Rocca believed Hoover- would not have generated it. Rocca sug­
gested someone at the Burea:u who was familiar with Soviet technique 
of using birth certificates for illegals -- Larry McWilliams, Brannigan 
or Cregar - - -would have aut:tior~d the memo. (Rocca could never establish 
if, in fact, Oswald took his birth certificate with him to the Soviet 
Union.) . Rocca commented that the Bureau me.mo, sent to State and ONI, 
should have been forwarded to CIA by State, but never was. 
' ,I 
In Rocca' s determinat!i.on, Oswald was the only American defector 
who was allowed· to stay in Russia following a suicide at_:tempt. Rocca 
said that Oswald would have been subjected to one or two assessments 
by the KGB.
