LARGE MEASURE BY AN UNSCRUPULOUS POLITICIAN LOOKING FOR HEADLINES~ 
~---------~· -=l INTEGRATED STJ'I.TE COVER OF OUR SMALL GROUP OF~ 
UNILATERAL OFFICERS IS AMONG THE STATION'S MOST EFFECTIVE MEA_NS OF 
ACCESS TO NON-FRENCH TARGETS. OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF OUR USE OF 
OFF'.rCIAL COVER IN PARIS COULD PROMPT THEM, OR THEIR Ro/ECTIVE /=_,. 
'SECURITY OFFI.CERS.,-'.12G-RE:V:.IEW THE TR AMERIC~1~ARGETS. 
B. OTHERWISE IS THE CIA UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT 
TO REDUCE PRESENCE, OR MORE FULLY DECLARE PRESENCE, OR UNDERTAKE NO 
UNDECLARED ACTIVITIES? DESCRIBE PRESENCE. DESCRIBE THOSE ACTIVITIES 
TO RESTRICT THE CIA (E.G. SERVICE TO SERVICE, LEGISLATIVE 
INITIATIVES, OPPOSITION POLITICAL INITIATIVES, AND MEDIA 
ACTIVITIES.) 
TO DATE, THE FRENCH HAVE NOT DEMANDED THE IDENTITIES 
OF ALL STATION PERSONNEL; HOWEVER, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 
POSSIBILITY DUE TO OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE FRENCH MAY DECIDE TO 
MIRROR ACTIONS OF OTHER EUROPEAN SERVICES WISHING TO RESTRICT CIA 
PRESENCE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. ARRE DISCLOSURES WOULD SERVE 
AS A POSSIBLE CATALYST FOR FORCING THIS ISSUE BETWEEN US AND THE 
FRENCH. 
C. DESCRIBE SOME PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES WHICH COULD BE 
IMPERILED? 
UNILATERAL ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE STATION'S 
UNDECLARED OFFICERS, OUT-OF-COUNTRY CASE OFFICERS AND NOC'S ARE 
COMPARTMENTED AND CANNOT BE DISCUSSED IN THIS CHANNEL. WE DEFER TO 
EUR/SG RE PROVISION OF SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL DETAILS. 
D. ARE THERE NEW INITIATIVES WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT AND 
SERVICE WHICH COULD BE IMPERILED? DESCRIBE. 
FORWARD MOVEMENT ON OUR JOINT WORK WITH THE FRENCH 
SERVICES, MOST IMPORTANTLY IN COUNTERTERRORISM, WAS SLOWED IN THE 
YEAR FOLLOWING THE 1995 DEMARCHE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE 
SEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE WILLINGNESS OF THE FRENCH SERVICES 
TO RESUME ACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE LIAISON. OF PARTICULAR NOTE ARE OUR 
CURRENT JOINT COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES, (E.G., SUPPORT FROM THE 
FRENCH INTERNAL POLICE/INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE DST AND RG, OF 
CTC'S 17 NOVEMBER TASK FORCE THROUGH TECHNICAL AND PHYSICAL 
SURVEILLANCE OF 17N TARGETS LOCATED IN PARIS), AND AN IMPORTANT NEW 
INITIATIVE WITH THE FRENCH EXTERNAL SERVICE, THE DGSE, TO WORK 
1
JOINTLY AGAINST RUSSIAN SVR INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN LOCATIONS WHERE 
OUR COMBINED RESOURCES WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. QUESTIONS 
RAISED IN THE PRESS OR WITHIN THESE SERVICES REGARDING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF UNDECLARED UNILATERAL ACTIVITIES IN FRANCE WOULD PLACE 
AT RISK THE CURRENT MOMENTUM WE HAVE WITH THE FRENCH SERVICES IN 
THESE AREAS. 
E. IS CIA PRESENCE INHERENTLY SENSITIVE BECAUSE OF HOSTILE 
POPULATION ELEMENTS OR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES?
