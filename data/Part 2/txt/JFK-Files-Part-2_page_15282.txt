This is an analysis of our program to develop informants in the 
diplomatic establishments in the U. s. of· certain Middle Bast .:·countries. 
On June 23, 1959, State Department approved a program to develop 
informants in the diplomatic establ_ishments in· the U. s. of the following 
Middle East countries: Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, 
UAR and Yemen. These countries were selected because it was believed that'. 
n • .;the·y were drifting toward the Soviet bloc and because -the Middle East had 
I long been a volatile "trouble spot. n • -· The Middle East _remains turbulent and 
l unpredicta.bleo Cyprus and the Arab-Israeli borders continue to l)e the 
I 
major trouble spots but poor.·Iranian-Iraqi relations as well as the 
' unresolved Yemeni question may_ also cause many problems. State :i.ndicated , 
it was all right to investigate any proposed source but interviews would be 
considered on a case basis. State advised it did not desire us to use •

anyone other than Americans, but it would colf'3ider the use of non-Amcricn.ns 
if there was an inv~stigative interest involved$ We have no investigative~ 
need for sources since there has been· no inforn1ation developed indicating ··-.. 
any of these countries has conducted espionage or intelligence activitiest· 
against the U. S. 1(.

: At the present time the couJ?.tries of ~Jordan,.· Saudi Arabia and : i-_:: 
Lebanon appear to be firmly oriented toward the Western World and it does/t; 
not appear that further efforts to develop sources at these establishmentrt 
is warranted. · . , ~;::-,

The oil-rich countries of Iran and Iraq are still being wooed 
strenuously by the Soviets and our efforts to develop sources should continu 
lVe have one· good informant who works part time at the· Embassy of Iran iu • 
Washington, D. c. Another informant who worked full 'time there recently 
resigned. We also have a symboled.informant who works as a secretary at. 
the l!."l:abassy of Iraq, Washington, D. C. A source who was employed at the 
Consulate General of Iran, New York Cityp recently resigned. New York has
