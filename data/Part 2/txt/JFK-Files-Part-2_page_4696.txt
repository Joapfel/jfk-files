obviously. So, it was not widely known. 
INTERVIEWER: No. No. 
MR. HALPERN: Information. You might have had access like I did to 
i.nforma ti on and you knew a good source or a bad source. 
INTERVIEWER: And you might know the information came from HTLINGUAL. 
MR. HALPERN: No. I never heard the cryptonymn. 
INTERVIEWER: Never heard the cryptonymn. Okay. 
MR. HALPERN: Didn't even need that. All I knew is that it was a good source. 
INTERVIEWER: Okay. How would you characterize morale in the Agency in the 
two to three years just prior. to the Church and Pike Hearings. 
MR. HALPERN: Oh, I think it was largely unsettled because in '73 you had the 
. turnover under Schlesinger. 
INTERVIEWER: Right. 
MR. ~ALPERN: And it was unsettling, totally unsettli~g. In the end of '72 
wh.en Schlesinger was announced as the new man on the block and everybody knew 
Helms was out, from there on it was utter turmoil and debacle. Both 1n the 
DDP and God knows, where else. 
INTERVIEWER: The worst you had seen? 
MR. HALPERN: Oh yes. Totally. Never had anything that bad before. 
Unbelievable. It was bad. And we had had reduct1on in forces before 
thro~ghout the Agency from time to time. We had a "701 Program," it was 
called, one of them I remember. And several others from time to time. You 
had reduction programs and it was bad in those days. But nothing like '73. 
Absolutely nothing. All heil broke loose. 
INTERVIEWER: Bad in the sense that he was going to cut a thousand or two 
thousand?
