Interview: 
Investigator Robert Buras spoke with Sgt. Roberts relative to 
the attached report dated Aug; 12, 1963. Roberts stated that 
he was in company with Sgt. Horace Austin who actually made the 
report. The Officers spoke with all the arrested subj:cts in one . 
room at the same time. The only interest at that time was to 
ascertain the possiblity of trouble from any individual or group 
represented by the arrested subjects. Feelings were high in the 
room and Roberts had to caution the Cubans to keep from trying to 
argue with Oswald. At one .point in the interview ·the Commanding 
Officer of the First District, Captain James Arnold, came into the 
room and asked Oswald if the Fair Play For Cuba Ccbmmittee was 
communist or a communist front. Oswald denied that he was a com­
munist and that the organization was a communist front. Oswald 
stated that he joined.the F.P.C.C. after finding a leaflet on the· 
street and sending $5.00 to New York. He also stated that he met 
with members locally but did not want to give any names etc. 
Roberts stated that he did not see or hear anything about 
Oswald wanting to call or talk with an F.B.I. 1 Agent while he was 
there. Roberts couldn't remember any other details about the in­
terview.
