However, the ·significance of A~derson•s· column on January 18., : 
1971, was that on the same day, Haldeman requested Dean to fiad out 
what he could about the Hughes - Maheu - O'Brien relationship .. 
In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-
0' Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the 
CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert 
Maheu is advisable to avoid a "counter-scandal." 
In addition, Assistant Attorney Gena-al Wilson showed the 
sensitive "Castro file.1• to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971, 
anq discussed with him the political. implications of the information. 
Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971, 
by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by 
Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rosselli. Maheu 
was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time. 
Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file 
with President Nixon, according to Wilson,. who had advised him to do 
so. 
Conclusion: 
Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs 
on Larry O'Brien in 19 71 and 1972 was in part motivated by a ·rear that 
Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot
