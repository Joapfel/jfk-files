an independent organizaticn dedicat-ed to non-partisan parti­
cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position . 
in favoring or opposing legislation.usu.ally parallels the 
po.si tion of the Cc~T.rr.unist Party and related g:roups. It also 
su~ports legislation- to abolish the House CorrJnittee on Un­
American Act.ivities. Membershio in the Homen for Legislative 
Actio.1"1 does not, of itself, connote membership in or .. sympathy
