Mr. RowLEY. I think there are certain things that you have to allow the man 
who is operating as a politician, and not .as head of state. I mean this makes 
a difference in your operation. 
Mr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, did .you give us a report of the activities in pro-
tecting the President at and around Parkland Hospital? 
Mr. ROWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. RANKIN. And is that Commission Exhibit.No. 1026?

The CHAIRMAN. It may .be admitted.

No. 1026, was received in evidence.,

that exhibit? 
Mr. RoWLEY. No, sir. 
Mr. RANKIN .. Cbief Rowley, did you give us a report about protective activity 
subsequent to Dallas on behalf of the Secret Service?

Mr. RoWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley, I ask you, are there any problems with regard to 
Commission Exhibit No. 1027 concerning security, and whether that should-be-­
that document should be made public? You just take :vonr time if you want to 
glance over it. 
Mr. -RoWLEY. No; as I read it, it is general enough, sir, that it ran be included. 
( At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)

Mr. RANKIN. Are there any of the various answers that you give in the an­
swers to the questions attached to Commission Exhibit No. 1027 that you care 
to els.borate on atthis"time? • 
I am not asking you or urging you to do it, because ·1 assume that you anwered 
them w.lth care at the time. I just wanted to give you that opportunity. 
_ Mr. ROWLEY. No :-not at"this time. • 
Mr. DULLES. May I ask a question there? 
You consider that the criteria as now furnished by you to the FBI and other 
investigative agencies would cover a case like Oswald's? 
Mr. RowLEY. Yes, sir. • 
Mr. DULLES. You think they would? 
Mr. RoWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. DULLES. You think they understand that? 
Mr. RoWLEY. Well, as- we stated in the covering letter when we sent this 
out-we haven't gotten -any reaction-we asked tor their cooperation and sug­
gestions in connection with such guidelines. 
Mr. DULLES; Defectors are not specifically covered, are they, by your criteria? 
Mr. ROWLEY. Well, they are given to us now. QVe are being furnished th 
names of defectors, and they are being investigated, so that their background and 
history will be furnished to us, and_ we will be in il position ii.ow to determine 
whether they represent a risk or not. 
Mr. RANKIN. Chief Rowley--
Representative Booos. May I ask a question there? 
Would you have any notion as to why names of defectors were not provided 
to you prior to November 22? 
Mr. ROWLEY. Yes; under the broad picture, Mr. Congressman, there was no
