(ii) McCone: M~Cone testified that he did not 
know about or authorize the plots. Helms and.Bissell both stated 
that McCone was not told by them of the earlier assassination ef­
forts when McCone assumed the position of DCI in November 1961. 
The I.G. Report states that Harvey received Helms' approval not 
to brief McCone when the actual efforts were resumed in 1962. 
Harvey testified this accorded with his recollection. Thereafter, 
,.,.,\ Helms and Harvey did not tell McCone about assassination activity •. } 
on several occasions .. Helms did not recall any agreement not to

was not claiming that he told McCone about the plots. (These mat-
ters, as well as the various reasons put fon•Jar.d by Harvey and 
Helms for not briefing McCone, are set forth in Section (c) below.)

they could "find no evidence that any of the schemes were apnroved 
at any level higher than division, if that". (I.G., p. 10.).
