ammunttlon. A Sov1et defector, Yur1 Nosenko, was known to have told 
1nvestlgators that Lee Harvey Oswald - 1dent1fled by the Warren Commtsslon as 
Kennedy's assassin - was not a sov1et agent. But Scelso satd: "I, later heard 
tr,at Nosenko was discovered to have been dlssembllng, not being on the level. 
That Information was lff1parteli to me by CIA off1cers." 
Baseti on tne inforrnation CIA headquarters had on Oswald before the assasslnatlon 
- ci,ief iy that rie had been in tt·,e Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union, 
then returned-:-Scelso said t,e saw no reason to pay htm special heed, "Oswald 
Just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector," he satd. But he conceded 
that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents In Mexico City, 
for example - had not reached headquarters before the assass1nat1on. 
It dealt chiefly w1th Oswald's vts1ts to the Sov1et and Cuban embassies In 
Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban vtsa two months before the 
assassination. Scelso satd the informat1on failed to reach Wash1ngton because of 
stmple overwork and bureaucratic delays tn the Mex1co City off1ce. He revealed 
that all the outs1de telephone 11nes at the Sovlet and Cuban embass1es were 
tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded. 
After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made 
while he was In custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same 
man who had vis1ted tl,e embassies.
