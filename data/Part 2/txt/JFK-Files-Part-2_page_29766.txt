the functions of Goli tsin in Moscow had been the reading 
of high-level American Intelligence Reports which convinced 
him that there was a "mole" in.the CIA, but he could not 
identify this person by name. While he was working for 
Golitsin,. Golitsin dictated a long letter describing the 
deficiencies in Western Intelligence ·agencies: which he was 
going to give to Robert Kennedy. It was Golitsin's feeling 
that the Soviets were winning the Intelligence War.

Golitsin's principal handler was a Colonel Leonard 
Weigner, a foreign-born agent whose parents had come out of 
Russia through Mancuria. Weigner had been in Air Force 
Intelligence. He became involved in the Pirigov case in 
1948-49. This involved a Russian MIG pilot who defected and 
brought his plane intact to the West. Weigner seemed to 
get along very well with Golitsin. Others who knew him at 
the time were Howard Osborne, now retired; Ed Knowles; Dave 
Murphy (after 1963); John McMahon, a side-kick to Weigner 
out of SR-CI and Tennent Bagley, aka "Pete" Bagley, who was 
head of Counter Intelligence in the Soviet Russia Division. 
He also mentioned Ted Poling, a Deputy to Bagley in SR.
