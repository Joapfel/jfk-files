Following the approval of the project funding, McCord 
contacted Lee Pennington, of the Americanism CoI1lJllittee of 
the American Legion in l'!ashingtun, D. C., asking, and 
receiving wholehearted agreement, for Penningto~ to provids 
cover for Wiley's work. The cover arrangernents:were so 
concluded. It was made clea~ to Wiley that CIA:was pur­
chasing the end product of his work and that he was not 
now a CIA employee. However, ~lcCord did advise.Wiley that 
he would attempt to secure Agency employment for him at the 
conclusion of the project; and that in the coming year Wiley 
shoald work on the indexing, continue regular c6ntact with 
his sources of information in New York City - keeping the 
Agency advised of anything that may be pertinent to our 
areas of interest, and finally, build a cover story which 
would enable Wiley to contact and interview various ex­
Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.
