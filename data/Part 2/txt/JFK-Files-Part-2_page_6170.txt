What Americans require is a greater sense that they can trust their 
government to protect the secrets that are genuinely important. The government's

intelligence services in an admittedly dangerous world.

Americans have been le!t guessing about the Kennedy assassination-since the 
Warren Commission issued its report. When everything is secret, everything is 
secret - and that is how the intelligence business operates. n21S In the,case of

then will it be possible to assess wh~ther charges of a conspiracy 1!0 murder_ 
President Kennedy are but another example of the virulence of the national 
app~tite for bogus revelation.
