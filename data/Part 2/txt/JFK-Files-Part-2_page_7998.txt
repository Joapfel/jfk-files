is a part of the evolution leading up to computers 
'and that the basic cause of his failure was the in­
ability to organize a complex society. In the very 
enjoyable Funco File (Cole), when the question is 
raised, "Has it become your ruler, your god ... "?, 
the response is, "Well, no. Not exactly. It's more 
like where our technology triumphs have finally got 
us to. I guess you might say our real ruler was al­
ways an idea of what's normal or not. Conformity, I 
guess you'd call it ... I suppose the Machine -
plus the F.D.I. - working together - have sort of 
externalized it once and for all." In the stories 
where there is a struggle between man and the com­
puter, it is not a struggle to retain control but to 
get it back once it has knowingly been given away or 
unwillingly allowed to slip away. 
Consequences of Bigness , . 
The persistent theme in these stories is that of 
~ss - big states and big computer systems -
ana its consequences. This bigness is well described 
in an article by Weizenbaum. This article is impor­
tant because it is one of the few expository state­
ments of this serious theme. 
These often gigantic systems are put to­
gether by teams of programmers, often working 
over a time span of many years. By the time 
the systems come into use, most of the origi­
nal programmers have left or turned their at­
tention to other pursuits. It is precisely 
when gigantic systems begin to be used that 
their inne~ workings can no longer be under­
stood by any single person or by a small team 
of individuals .... This situation, which is 
now upon us, has two consequences: first that 
decisions are made on the basis of rules and 
criteria no one knows explicitly, and second 
that the system of rules and criteria becomes 
immune to change. ("On the Impact of the Com­
puter on Society," pp. 612-613). 
What is the effect of this situation on individuals 
and on society? Two side effects are discussed by 
Weizenbaum. 
First of course, there is the psychological 
impact on individuals living in a society in 
which anonymous, hence irresponsible, forces 
formulate the large questions of the day and 
circumscribe the range of possible answers. 
••• But even worse, since computer-based know­
ledge systems become essentially unmodifiable 
except in that they can grow, and since they 
induce dependence and cannot, after a certain 
threshold is crossed, be abandoned, there is 
an enormous risk that they will be passed from 
one generation to another, always growing. 
(!!ill!,, p. 613) 
Computen Are Not Gadgets 
The reader may argue the degree to which these 
side effects are already present in our society, but, 
if be reads sicence-fiction, he cannot ignore them. 
While the first theme of the differences of man and 
machines·may be the most repeated, this second theme 
ii probably the most important. The science-fiction 
writers maintain their importance ,s poets of the 
"computer revolution" by redirecting our attentio11 
from the computer as "gadget" to the computer as an 
integral part of the modern configuration of govern­
ment-academe-industry-management which shares skills, 
resources, techniques, personnel, and goals. Just as 
our image of the scientist has changed from the man 
standing lonely vigil over a bubbling retort to 
prove his scorned hypothesis, the isolated computer 
with a programmed quirk, asked the wrong question or 
fed the wrong data, is no longer hero. Franken­
stein's monster, or the more recent, Karl, Emmy, and 
Siema; for example, are very limited creations with 
identifiable creators, circumscribed environments, 
and restricted effects. We now have instead Shal­
maneser, Project 79, Vulcan 3, Allied ~lastercomputer, 
or simply, The Machine. The new computer-hero has 
remote access, varied input and output devices, pro­
cesses large amounts of data supplied by different 
agencies, works in real-time, makes policy decisions 
based on quasi-mathematics, commands vast resources, 
and affects large numbers of people.
