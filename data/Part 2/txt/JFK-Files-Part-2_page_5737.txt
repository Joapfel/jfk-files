Third, the Board will presumptively vote to open in full all records that have not 
been reviewed in conformity with the schedule. 
We can assure you that we have no desire whatsoever to take steps two and three. --_ 
However, at this point, we see no other method for satisfying our obligation to ensure·-' 
that the CIA's assassination-related records are released by September 1998, unless the 
CIA agrees to schedule the review in a timely, consistent, methodical, and enforceclble 
manner. Although you should not hesitate to contact us regarding any i4~as you have 
for streamlining or improving the accomplishment of this task, there should-he 11p 
misunderstanding by the Agency regarding what we believe our-~oal to be Gd :th~ _ 
steps that we are prepared to take to ensure the fulfillment of our statutory obligations 
and our promises to Congress. It is our perception that if the Agency allocates 
additional resources to the accomplishment of this project, we all will be able to 
accomplish the goals of the JFK Act. • 
We therefore strongly urge the Agency to allocate now whatever resources are 
necessary to complete its review records in an orderly and systematic manner. To the 
extent that the Agency is able to meet the necessary deadlines, there will be no need for 
us to resort to the extreme -- but potentially necessary - m«:asures to complete our 
obligations to Congress and the American people. 
Sincerely, 
T. Jeremy Gunn
