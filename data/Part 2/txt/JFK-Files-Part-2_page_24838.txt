The next day, October 8, Headquarters cabled the Station in response 
to the Wimert-Lt. Colonel meeting. Headquarters took note of Schneider's 
resistance to coup plans and stated: 
... This would make it more important than 
ever to remove him and to bring this new 
state of events ... anything we or Station 
can do to effect removal of Schneider? We 
know this rhetorical question, but wish 
inspire thought on both ends on this matter. 
(Hqs. 628, 8 October) 
During the first week of intensive efforts chances of success 
looked unusually bleak. The Chile Task Force Log commented: 
President Frei and the highest levels of the 
armed forces unable to pull themselves together 
to block Allende. The Chilean mt'1itary's tradi­
tion of non-intervention, Frei's reluctance to 
tarnish his historical image, General Schneider's 
firm constitutional stand, and most importantly, 
the lack of leadership within the government and 
military are working against a military takeover. 
(Task Force Log, 8 October) 
The following day the Station made reference to the "rapid(ly) waning 
chances for success.'' (Santiago 487, 9 October) This ~essimism was not 
dispelled by their simultaneous judgment: "Station has arrived at Viaux 
solution by pro~ess of elimination.'' (Santiago 504, 10 October) Three 
days later the Task Force agreed: "We continue to focus our attention 
on General Viaux who now appears to be the only military leader willing 
to block Allende." (Task Force Log, 13 October) 
If Viaux was the CIA's only hope of staging a coup, things were bleak 
indeed. His own colleagues, Generals Huerta and Valenzuela described him 
as "a General without ari army." (Santiago 495, 9 October) Yet in the 
first two weeks of October he came to be regarded as the'best ]].ope for.c 
carrying out the .CIA's Track II mandate.
