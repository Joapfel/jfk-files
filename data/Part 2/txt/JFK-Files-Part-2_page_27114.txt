if not privileged, position of the FBI who had dominated the 
Intelligence Community as it relates to counterintelligence. 
Director Hoover refused to submit his views or policies to 
the scrutiny of the Intelligence Corrmrnni ty where any problem 
remotely impinged on the interests and/or jurisdiction of 
the FBI. This unassailable stance estopped any and all at­
tempts to bring the Bureau to account in any interagency 
board of equals charged with counterintelligence oversight, 
including the very.effective President's Foreign Intelligence 
Board (PFIAB) who were thoroughly apprised of the facts, 
given their continuity and authority within the Community.

What emerged was a loose ad hoc liaison of third parties, 
but never a meeting of chiefs with Mr. Hoover to.hammer out 
basic issues relating to internal security and counterintelli­
gence. This was the state of affairs until the appointment 
of Mr. Gray; counterintelligence as a function of Government -
with few exceptions - was frozen by Mr. Hoover. Mr. Gray's 
tenure was marred by the turbulence of Watergate, and it was 
only with the appointment of Mr. Kelley that a new era opened 
up. Unfortunately, nothing of consequence has been tabled 
with Mr. Kelley on the outstanding issues. 
Unlike the producers of positive intelligence, those 
engaged in counterintelligence are the primary consumers of 
their own product, and the counterintelligence product is less 
perishable than that of positive intelligence. We have at­
tempted to remedy this omission over the years on an ad hoc 
basis by distilling intelligence from counterintelligence operations,
