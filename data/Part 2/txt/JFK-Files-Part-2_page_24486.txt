Burke ... was expressing his opinion that if you have any plan {for the 
overthrow of Castr2._f it ought to take these factors into consideration, that 
you might end up with a Communist government." (Gray, p. 45). 
With respect to the March 14, 1960 Special Group meeting, Admiral 
Burke stated that the "general discussion" referred to in the record of that 
meeting'clearly did not involve a discussion of assassination of Cuban leaders, 
but to the possible effects should only those leaders be overthrown by a group 
not powerful enough to also master the organization those leaders had established 
in Cuba." (Burke affidavit, p. 2) Burke stated further: 
"Thus, it was consistent with my views then that I should have 
been recorded in the.record of the Maret 14 meeting as warning 
in this discussion that the Communists might move into control 
even if these three top leaders should be overthrown. As stated 
above, I strongly believed that a strong, organized group must 
be in the forefront of any effort to overthrow the Castro 
government." (Burke affidavit, p. 2). 
In any event, when a question ·"whether any real planning had been 
done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara" 
was subsequently asked at a Special Group meeting on November 3, 1960, the 
Deputy Director of the CIA, General Cabell, according to the record of that 
meeting, pointed out 
"that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly 
dangerous in conception and execution, because the instruments 
must be Cubans. He felt that, particularly because of the 
necessity for simultaneous action,' it would have to be concluded 
that ( such action) is beyond our capabilities.

the danger they might move into control." (Gray Ex. 3, p. 2)
