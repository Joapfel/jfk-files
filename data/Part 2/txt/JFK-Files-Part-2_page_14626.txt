This case relates to the association between 
Lades., a former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) Commissioner ·James c. Sargent and Joseph· 
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation. We 
completed an extensive investigation which determined that 
Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams with several SEC matters 
while Ledes was still with that agencyo Abrams made loan.s 
to Ledes to finance properties which Ledes purchasedo 
The attorney for subject Abrams advised his client 
not to talk to uso The attorney for Ledes, James M. Mc Inerney, 
refused to make Le des available for interview unless he,· 
Mc Inerney, is present. We informed. the.Department and suggested 
that they consider calling Ledes • bef_ore a Federal Grand Jury or 
interviewing him themselves in Mc Inerney 1 s presence. 
On .May 13, 1960, Roger Connor, Executive Assistant to 
Assistant.Attorney General Wilkey, advised that Joseph Abrams 
had been brought down from Danbury, Connecticut, Federal 
Correctional Institution to- Washington; D. C., for appearance 
before a Federal Grand Jury here. The Grand Jury_presentation 
.by three Department attorneys started that date and.is··currently 
continuing. Leads growing out of the Grand Jury hearings are 
being received and are currently outstanding in Washington Field 
Office, New York, Atlanta-and Miami. These matters are.being 
given immediate and continuous attention.
