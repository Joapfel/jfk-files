Donald Deneslya Interview 
Page 5. 
From February to July 1963, Golitsin went to England to 
advise the British on the extent of Philby's damage. Deneslya 
says that when he returned to this country the attitude of 
some people in the SR Division had changed towards Golitsin. 
He detected a hostility towards Golitsin which had not been 
there before. 
When Donald first came into the CIA he worked in the 
Foreign Documents Division. Among the various types of re­
ports which came across his desk were "contact" reports 
which filtered in from the many contact divisions which 
the Agency had around the world. One,in particular caught 
his eye, circa July-August 1963. It concerned an American 
re-defector, a Marine, who would be returning to the United 
States "with his family." This ex-Marine had worked in 
Minsk in a radio factory. The report, which Deneslya says 
came out of New York City, did not mention this defector 
by name. This, in itself, was not unusual because the Con­
tact Division liked to conceal sources. He said the report 
identified this person as a former Marine "cpl. 
11 
or "cpt. '..', 
which Deneslya felt could mean corporal or captain. He 
was certain they were talking about Lee Oswald. 
Deneslya said we could find this report probably in 
the Industrial Registry for the radio factory in Minsk. He 
said there was only one radio factory in Minsk. This Registry
