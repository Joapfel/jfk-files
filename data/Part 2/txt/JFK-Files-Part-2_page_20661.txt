2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston, 
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300 
women attended the conference, which o~ce a?;Bi~ re-established 
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand. It was 
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to 
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings 
across the country had been disann0intin~ly small. It was 
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers 
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the 
abortion issue, includin~ the majority of women's liberationists 
and abortion reform acti ,,.ists. It was felt that the mo,rement 
could not succeed without the support of the working women. 
• At the close of the conferen e, ·woNAAC strongly endorsed 
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972, 11 whidi is to be introduced in 
the U. S. Congress by Cot1g:--essvcDDn BELLA ZUG from New York. 
This bill would override all laws which imp se sanctions upon .,.. -
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.-·
