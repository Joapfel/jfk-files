Advanced Studies in Princeton. 
Mr. Baron. During the Eisenhower Administration did 
you have direct contact with Gordon Gray or Andrew Goodpaster 
with reference to Congolese affairs~ 
You .are shaking your head and we have to put it on 
the record. 
Mr. Tweedy. I am alarnot convinced that the answer ie 
no. I arn just thinking. I know Gordon Gray quite well. 1 
don't recall evor·having• p6licy diacusl!liona with him at all, 
nor General Goodpaster. I think the answer is certainly no. 
Mr. Daron. You mentioned to me earlier that you had 
attended only two National Security Council meetings in your 
memory and that those two meetingn were both long after the 
death of Lumumba, is that correct? 
Mr. Tweedy. I can only imagine that they must have been 
because this was well into the Kennedy Administration. I 
wouldn't be able to put any dates on it now. 
Mr. Daron. It was during the directorship of John 
McCone at Cil\7 
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, that is without queation. And 
McBundy was at the meetings. Yes, it must have been 
well after the dehth of Luroumba, mayhe even the following 
year.
