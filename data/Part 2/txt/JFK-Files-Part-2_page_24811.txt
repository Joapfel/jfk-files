On March 2s; 
·)1~70, the 40 Committee approved a joint Embassy/CIA proposal recom-
m~,pding that "spoiling" operations--propaganda and other activities-­
be undertaken by the CIA in an effort to prevent an election victory 
by Allende's Popular Unity (UP) Coalition. A total of $135,000 was 
authorized by the 40 Committee for this anti-Allende activity. On : 
June 18, 1970, the U.S. Ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, submitted a 
two-phase proposal to the Department of State and the CIA for review. 
The first phase involved an increase in support to the anti-Allende 
campaign. The second was a contingency plan to make ''a $500,000 effort 
in Congress to persuade certain shifts in voting on 24 October 1970." 
Phase II was, • stated simply, a proposal to bribe Chilean Congressmen to 
vote agains't Allende should he win a plurality in the September 4 elec­
tion. On June 27, 1970, the 40 Committee increased funding for the 
anti-Allende "spoiling" operation to $390,000. A decision on Ambassador 
Korri's bribe proposal was deferred pending the results of _the September 4 
election. 
The 40 Committee met twice between the time Allende received a plural­
ity of the popular vote on September 4 and President Nixon issued his 
instruction to Director Helms on September 15:'* At both these meetings the 
question of U.S. involvement in a military coup against Allende-was raised.­
