Mr. Sarno. Nobody ever approached me on it. They were 
outside of Miami, but the thing that happens is the Chief of 
the Miami group, when an~would leave --
Mr. Wides. This is 
Mr. Sarno. When one of the would leave for his 
reasons, th~y would always maintain contact with ~rtlfsml(B 
when they would move to any area, and all they would do is to 
report on Cuban exiles in that area. 
Mr. Wides. And would the fact that they were leaving and 
going to another area be report~d by you, back through channels 
to Washington for relay to CIA personnel in the area where 
th~y Wdre going? Was this ever done? 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, it was done, y~s. 
Mr. Wides. And was it not uncommon in the case of Cubans 
going to the New York area? Does that happen fairly frequently 
Mr. Sarno. Well, since it was handled in such a loose 
way, iri tha+. it was between nd this individual and 
we didn't have them on the payroll. 
Mr. Wides. You mean you didn't have them on the payroll 
in the sense of employees, they were regularly paid agents, 
-
informants? 
Mr. Sarno. They were qiven funds b . which 
obviously were authorized for sort of like operational expenses 
Mr. Wides. Excuse me. You're talking about when they 
were in Florida, or wh~n they w~r~ moving?
