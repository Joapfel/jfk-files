to American intelligence. The Soviets, based on other \\ 
information they had acquired through signals intelligence, 1\ 
concluded that an imaging satellite they had believed to be non- 1 \ 
operational was in fact operational and actively imaging their 
1
\ 
territory. Since the Soviets had believed it was non-
operational, they had taken no countermeasures (i.e., I 
concealment) and the US had acquired a treasure trove of I 
intelligence. Immediately upon learning the true status, they I 
took extensive countermeasures and invaluable intelligence was / 
directly and immediately lost. 
8. (S) With further respect to question four, we have the 
quintessential factor for exploitation. If the foreign service 
believes its asset, they act on the information to the detriment 
of the United States; if they do not, the United States may 
escape damage fully or to some degree. This is the critical 
question that a foreign country must answer and it is the 
critical information that we must protect vis-a-vis defectors in 
our fold.

9. (S) In the matter at hand, we are very constrained by 
what the Russian government knows by virtue of their own 
knowledge and what they have acquired from the substantially 
released document and the Los Angeles Times article. The 
Russians know that Sergei PAPUSHIN (i.e., IJDECANTER) defected to 
the United States; they know or suspect what he told the US; they 
know or suspect that we fully understood the import of what he 
said; they do not know, however, whether we be1ieved him and thus 
incorporated his in£o:rmation into our operationa1 practices and 
activities. And it would be critically damaging today to confirm 
to the Russians the final piece of the PAPUSHIN puzzle and allow 
them to have the ultimate benefit from what heretofore has been a 
US intelligence success. 
10. (C) Indeed, as a reference point for this discussion, 
we can look briefly to the NOSENKO story.· Here, also, the 
Russians knew the first three parts of the puzzle. What they did 
not know was whether we had accepted his story or not. Indeed, 
I 
the CIA did not know the answer for a long period of time and 
, this lack of knowledge was crippling to our FI effort against the 
\', ~t~~~e ~nion and our en~ire CI_i'_rogram for a su~s~antial__Perio~- /
