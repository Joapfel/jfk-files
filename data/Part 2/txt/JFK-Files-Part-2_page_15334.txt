. . In the recent past,· and particularly durtng the 
month of J.lovemberp I have noted that your office has been 
forwarding a great volume of tntelltgence materi-al to the 
-Bureau.· • I have reference to .the information produced by . 
your established sources-and relating to the tense • 
international situations, especially those creat'~d by the. 
ortses in the lt!iddle Eas~ and Eastern Europe. Much of the··. 
material has been of a high-intelligence nature or potential 
and,· upon,/:~i.ts receipt at . the .Bureau, has been . ." gtven within­
the-hour ~d'issem in,at ion to other agencies and.departments, 
particularly the Department of State •. The latter Department 
has informed me that it has placed a high er;aluation on 
some o.f this intell igenoe and has found it most useful in 
tts day-to-day operations. • 
I am writ tng to· -ypui ·io stress the importance of 
cont inutng the flow o~f this vital in.format ion to the Bureau 
to enable us not only to maintain but to tnc~ease the 
efficiency of our operations, in this field • .-.. 
. It is recognized·that the establishment of 
additional sources for the production-of this material 
. and the servicing of these.r•?.sources have called for an even· 
greatt:r application to their.duties on the part of the 
personnel of your office assigned to this work. I request Ya,_,.., .. ,; 
that you convey my personal apprec tat ion to them for thet-r .I • 
past· efforts in this connect ion and adv{se th·em tht!,t upon • .1 
thetr contt~ued efforts rests, to a large extent, the degree 
of success of this phase of the Bureau's over'!#'all tnte~~-i-
