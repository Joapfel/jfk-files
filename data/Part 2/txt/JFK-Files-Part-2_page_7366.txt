~Mr.-~lleri Dulles~ if) Director of ccn:tral I~t~ligen~>g~c-ed th~t G~O 
should expand its cm·rent audit activities in a lette1· to the Comptroller dated 
October 16. 1959 ~ cautioning. however. that the comprehensive audit would have-·~ 
to be limited so as to remain oµtside the area·of sensitive security operations for 
which by law the Director's certificate must be deemed a sufficient voucher .

_ • • ~The results of°the trial period of coinprehenshre audit from °i959 to 1961 
·were i.m1de.known to the CIA Subcommittee in a letter of May 16, 1961 from the 
Comptroller General in which he said the.GAO planned to' discontinue the audit· 
of CIA activi.ties. He acknowledged that various steps were taken by the CIA ato 
place the General Accounting Office. in a position. to make a comprehensive audit 
of the overt activities of CIA.• Nevertheless. h,e stated that GAO "cannot effectively 
. _ revie,v and evaluate ac_tivities of the Support <;;h~ponent because the confidential
