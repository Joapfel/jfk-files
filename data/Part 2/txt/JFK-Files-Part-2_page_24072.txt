that "it never occurred to me" that the vigorous words of 
the Attorney General ~ould be taken as authorizing 
assassination. The differing perceptions may have resulted 
from their different backgrounds and training. Neither 
Bissell (an academician wi,ose Agency career_ for the six years 
before he became DDP had been in the field of technology) nor 
McManus (who had concentrated on intelligence and staff work) 
were experienced in covert operations.* 
The perception of certain Agency.officials that assas­
sination wa·s within the range of Permissible activitv was 
reinforced by the continuing approval of violent covert actions 
against Cuba that were sanctioned at the Presidential level 
and by the failure of the successive administrations to make 
clear that assassination was not permissible. This point is 
one of the subjects considered in the next section. 
* Of course, this analysis cannot be carried too far. In 
the Lumumba case, for example,· Johnson and Dillon, who we.re 
Administration officials with no covert operation experience, 
construed remarks as urging or pennitting assassination, while 
other persons who were not in the Agency did' not so interpret 
them.
