to a halt and Rosselli said he was never in contact with 
the Cubans again.

the Missile Crisis, in June 1963, and had dinner with him 
in Washington that night. 
Rosselli mentions FBI had him under surveillance for several 
years. 
Roselli has two stories re Rowan wiretap from Maheu. Maheu 
told him he wanted Rosselli to get some bail money for two 
guys in Las Vegas who were in trouble and he had placed some 
taps in Rowan•s room because 1) Maheu was doing Giancana a 
favor, and 2) Maheu had the authority to see if Giancana was 
leaking to his girlfriend. 
Rosselli arranged bail money for the two men who were caught 
tapping Rowan's room. 
Giancanalaughed when Rosselli discussed tapping incident with 
him, but gave no clues to the reason for the tap.
