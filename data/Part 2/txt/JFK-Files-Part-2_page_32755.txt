the degree of divergence between the Navy and the Air Force versions 
that would be necessary to meet Navy specifications };I.ad not bee;n 
determined in the time available. Nevertheless, the Board recom-
mended~ and the Air Council, the Chi~£ of Staff of the Air Force, and 
' ' 
the Chief of Naval Operations proposed that a single contractor~ Boeing, 
should be .selected at that point to undertake a continuing "design 
definition" phase. The expressed need for the continuation 9f the 
definition process pointed up the fact that the purposes for whic;h the 
third evaluation were held had not been satisfied. 
Following the second anq. third evaluations of the TFX, it 
appeared to me not only that neither contractor was meeting Navy require.., 
ments, but also that my primary goal was not accepted or not fully under-
stood by the contractors or th,e Source Selection Bo;3.rd. That goal was to 
develop, if at all possiblet one plane to meet the needs of both the Navy 
and the Air Force. 
Therefore~ the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Air 
Force directed that work be cont~nued to establish d.etailed designs, from 
which they could better assess the probability of developing th~ respective 
versions into an effective weapon system acceptable to both the Navy and 
the Air Force. They also directed that the obvious disparity between the 
contractors' cost proposals and the Air ·Force standards be reconciled. 
Lastly, they restated my intent to reduce cost by maximizing sirriilarities
