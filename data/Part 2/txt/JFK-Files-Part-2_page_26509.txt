I 
1· 
I told the President it was my impression from information gained from 
clandestine sources that Franco had ma.de some moves to curtail trade 
with Cuba after my visit with him but that the Spanish companies were 
endeavoring to circumvent his orders by various surreptitious methods. 
'The President asked that I study the matter carefully and speak to him 
about it next week. 
ACTION: I have asked Mr. O'Ryan to contact Noel 
and I am asking Mr. Ball to contact Ambassador Woodw{lrd to . 
determ.ine whether the Spanish had taken any actions which they 
have announced or might communicate to us which would indicate 
an intention on their part to curtail or restrict shipping or trade 
with Cuba. 
5. The President then said he wanted to do everything possible to 
get me out of the cloak and dagger business. That he was tired of 
a situation that had been built up that every time my name or CIA's name 
was mentioned, it was associated with a dirty trick. He asked if our 
economic studies had stood up and I said yes, they had, and that they were 
reconfirmed and supported by an exhaustive article in TIME Magazine. 
The President seemed pleased at this., expressed satisfaction in CIA 1 s 
operations but was most emphatic in his feelings that we should get away 
from the cloak and dagger image and expressed a determination to bring 
this about by statements he would make from time to time.
