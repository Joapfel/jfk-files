Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence 
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination 
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices 
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassinatioJ. 
In answering this ~estion, please make appropriate 
references to the Cla..~destine .Se~ices Handbook (CSH3) 
and to any other materials (including organizational 
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional aJd 
organization reasons :or which CI and OS would have 
rnaintaiJed such files. 
Response: (U) I~ is believed that os holdings on.Lee 
3arvey Oswald began i:i 1.959 with his travel to Russia during 
which h_e renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in 
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the 
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts. 
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the 
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution 
of these reports. In the beginning this material was 
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number o: 
documents on this pe=son increased, a separate file was 
c=eated to be the reposito=Y of info::mation on the alleged 
American defector. The=e is a notation in the Defectors 
File that a separate file exists on Oswald. 
(U) Both the Defecto::::-s File (#0341008) and the fil~ of 
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D. 
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre­
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a 
majo~ity of them contai~ a notation or the initials of 
Marguerite D. Stevens, lead:ng one to believe she was the 
officer ~esponsible. fo~ the collection, analysis, and filing 
of this in:o~mation.
