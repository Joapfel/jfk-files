1. On September 22, 1975 in my law office I reviewed the

took place at certain governmental meetings: the Memorandum for 
the Record of the Special Group meetings 0£ June 30, 1960 and 
August 25, 1960; the Memorandum for the Record of the National 
S~curity Meetings of July 21, 1960, August 18, 1960, and 
September 21, 1960; and the Record of Actio9 of the NSC meetings 
of July 15, 1960 and September 7, 1960. As indicated in these 
documents, I attended all of these meetings except the NSC 
meeting of August 18, 1960, where I was represented by Mr. Hadyn 
Williams. I also reviewed the affidavit of C. Douglas Dillon 
dated May 21, 1975 which refers, inter alia, to a meeting at the 
Pentaeon in the summer of 1960. 
2. Even after attempting to refresh my recollection by 
reviewing the above-mentioned documents, I still have no direct 
recollection of the discussions which they memorialize. I do 
not recall any discussion of any assassination plan connected to 
the United States government during the entire course of my
