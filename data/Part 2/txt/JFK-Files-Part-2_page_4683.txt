controlled by the Hill. And it is today, I believe. But before you get money 
released by the BOB, somebody up there had to say OK. And that happened on 
every one of the operations I know about. In the Far East, I don't know about 
the European ones, I am sure the system is the same. It was a well-oiled 
machine. Sure, they didn't ask the kind of q~estions that are asked today, 
but they knew what the operation was. 
INTERVIEWER: There was a feeling between the Agency and the Congress that 
there was good liaison?· 
MR. HALPERN: Oh yes. It was overt. Completely. Always. It worked very 
we.11 indeed. And the system worked so that the Legislative Counsel, whether 
it was Pforzheimer or John Warner or anybody else, they knew who to call 
within the DDP, for example. If they were sitting up on the Hill and one of 
the members -- could be a Senator or Representative of the committees 
wanted to know something, they knew who to call, and _when I had the job they 
usually called me for the DDP because I was able to get them the answer and it 
worked very we 11. In case someone. di dn • t know everything, they knew where to 
get the information. And when Congress asked you gave it to them. 
INTERVIEWER: Do you think this was also a reflection of the view that the 
Agency and the Congress both saw the Soviet threat as a real threat? 
MR. HALPERN: I am not sure that was part of it. It may have been. But 
that's a conjecture on my part. I think it was more the people we were 
dealing with on the Hill had al so been through the same things most of us had 
been through. They are all part of the same generation. We were all working 
together in terms of protecting the country. At least we thought we were 
protecting the country. The business where some of this falls down is when we 
started, because we had to, start working operations more in the United States
