[ 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992] 
2 4 OCT 1975 
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 
SUBJECT: Supplementary Information on James Earl Ray 
REFERENCE: DDO Memorandum for DCI dated 23 October 1975 
Subject: • Background for Rather Interview -
James Earl Ray 
Dick Ober (then in CI) who wrote all the early Ray cables, 
recalls that he had numerous discussions with the FBI on the 
matter, and is certain that whatever we did was undertaken .at 
the request of the FBI. Because of the fast moving situation, 
most of his discussions with the FBI were on the phone, and 
not the subject of written memoranda. The paper clipped 
outgoing cable in referring to Eric Galt (the man initially 
identified by the FBI as the assassin of Dr. King) requests 
"addressees make every effort determine if Galt is or has 
been in your area. Information para one should be passed 
to liaison and any other likely sources. FBI requests that 
any inf'ormation reported be evaluated as to reliability and 
that as much detail as possible be provided. Cable any 
positive reply priority to HQS~ and pass to legal attache 
if any in your country." There is a scribbled note in the 
file, presumably in Ober's hand, which reads: "4. Ray 
fingerprints: FBI agreed to my proposal we send to field 
for liaison." Ober, also logically points out that the FBI 
would not have provided us later.with a fingerprint formula 
(see attached cable), a detailed physical description and 
photos unless they wanted this passed on to overseas liaison 
services. (Note that our cables did not go, for example, to 
\Ottawa or Mexico City])
