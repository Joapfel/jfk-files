The relationship between the vanguard party and the 
rnasscs is a secondary 1:elatioru,hip .. The· relationship be-, .. 
tween the n1crnbcrs of the vanguard party is a prii11ary 
relationship. It is irnpnrtant that the rncn1bers of the \{an­
gua rd g ruup 111<.1 int a in a· fac c- to-face re la tiunship w 1th each 
other. This is in1 po rta.nt if the ·party ·rnachine ry is tu $c 
effective. It is i1npossible tu put together functional party 
n1achincry or progra1ns without this direct relationship.

with the, correct approach to struggle throt.Fgh the activi­
ties of the vanguard_party .. Therefore, the n1asses n1ust, 
know that the party exists. The party n1ust use all n1.eans 
a va ila ble to get this information across to the n1a s se s. If 
• the masses do r:-iot have knowlcrigc of the party, it will b_c'. 
impos~ible for the n1asses to. follow the program of the

The vanguard party is never underground in the be­
ginning of its existence,· ·because th is would lin1it its ef-
'· fcctiveness and educational pr.occ_sses. How can you 
teach ·people if the p'eople do not know and respect you? 
The party 1nust exist above ground as long as the dog 
power strt1cture will allow, and hopefully when the party 
is forced to go und<!rground the m·essa~e of the party will 
already. have been put ac rosli. to tlw pt•o:plc. The vanguard 
party's activities on the surfilce w~ll necessarily be short­
