and by terror and a6grcssion they went on to occupy 80% in 
1948. Todcty, after the June 5 1967 aggression, the rest or our

the fruii.s of ma· sacrifice:> arc bc~4"i!mi11rr to show. The P~lestine 
Liberation :\fovcmcnt J,~s succeeded in aw:1kcning our people, 
in rekindling its liup!.! for a better fotu:·e with dignity and respect 
in our own hmd. \Ve ~re forcing the enemies of peace to ~dmit 
theh- failure to cxtii:gui:.h our r~volution, we 2rc winning battles, 
and we are starting to sh~.pe our dcst2ny .. \Ve are not swayed b)' • ·1 ) cmot1ona appc;1.,s, we arc not seekers of revenge, we arc not 
bloodthirsty terrorists. W c arc freedom fighters with clc:ir and 
m:,:,.ture go:1ls. We arc fighting today to create the new Palestine 
of tomorrow: A progress~ve, c.emoc~·:1tic, secular Palestine in 
which Christian, l'Aa.:;km and] ew will ,vorshlp, work, live peacefully 
and crJoy c'quai rights. This is no utopi~n clr<:am or false promise:, 
for we h;1.vc alw:~ys lived in peace, Moslcms, Christfans and Jews 
in the I·foly L1nd. Th{! Palestinian Arabs gnvc a refuge, a warm 
shelter and a helping h:md to }.:vis fleeing persecution in Christi2.n "-I' 
Europe and to the Armenians fleeing persecution in !vfos!cm C"'l 
Tm-key, as well as to Greeks, Circ:!ssfans ~nd ?--.faltcsc among others. 
Onr Palcstinbn revolution still strl!tches its wdcominO' hand 
to ~ll human beings who want to fight for, and live in, a <lemoc­
rat!c, tolerant Palestine, irrespective of race, color or religion. 
Dt!ring the fo..~t four years, some 500 of our people have r:iven } • J" b 
t 1cir .1vcs on the battlefield. During the s~mc period m::tny mo1·c 
~han that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish­
ment and disease. 
\Ve arc here to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to 
your people, that our people will not by dovm their arms until 
Paie~tinc is liberated and our right.3 restored. \Ve will not acceDt 
any settlement that denies us these rights, be it the Sccuri~y 
Council's resolution, or any other propq:ial or political settlement 
ensuing fror.1 it. \Ve will r.ot accept any substitute to a war 
of n~tional liberation and will ten:i.c~ously hold to it regardless of 
sacrifices ,and costs. Could a:nyboc.y have asked you to accent '. 1 h ~ r ~nytmng css t ::m total 1r.::cdom from N:a.ism, fascism or colonia-
hsm? We are confident the people of the world will back our 
struggl~ anh~ will support our revolution, for it is the struggle of
