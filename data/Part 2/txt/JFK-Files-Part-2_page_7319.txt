with thi~ agent by telephone. We do not know how they 
learned his true name or- his whereabouts. .We haV'& .. a1ready 
advised David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff 
of a .potential problem,"araa in connection·. with ~uch a . 
proposed-. m,eeting. . The agent in. question is,. of course, 
a·subject of interest to.the local intelligence service

conduct·. such . investigations wi t.hin 1 ts terri.tory without .· .
