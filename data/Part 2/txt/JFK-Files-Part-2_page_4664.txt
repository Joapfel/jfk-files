attitude that threat of the Soviet Union wasn't as great. Not necessarily 
seen that way in the Agency but outside the Agency? 
MR. HALPERN: Oh. By that time people were looking at Vietnam. They weren't 
looking at the Soviets. There is no question. I am talking '73. '74. There 
was no question about that. The spirit of Detente may have something to do 
with that. The spirit of Glassboro. do you remember Glassboro .. NJ? 
INTERVIEWER: Sure. yes. 
MR. HALPERN: Johnson. which began even before Henry and Nixon and what have 
you. But I think that all, I think, was totally overshadowed by Vietnam. I 
think that was one of the big problems, the Vietnam War. 
INTERVIEWER: And you saw this not only in the public but also in the Congress. 
MR. HALPERN: Uh huh. No question. No question. I don't think Congress ever 
really understood -- well, I know they never understood what Jim Angleton was 
talking about on counterintelligence. Hell, for that_ matter very few people 
in the Agency I think really understood that one. And I didn't have any 
appreciation of it either until I got into the job as the Exec for the DDP. 
Because unless you see an overall world picture it is hard to imagine this big 
thing happening around you when you are worrying in one l_ittle area. But 
' anyway, I honestly think it was Vietnam that upset the apple cart. Watergate 
just added to it. 
INTERVIEWER: Just added to it. 
MR. HALPERN: The frosting on the cake I suppose or the whip cream on the 
banana split. Whatever you want to call it. But I think with Vietnam that 
hurt most of all. 
INTERVIEWER: So even if Watergate hadn't occurred, it was moving toward 
investigation.
