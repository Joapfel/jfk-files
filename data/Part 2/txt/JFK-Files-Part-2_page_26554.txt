NOTES 
A. Oswald. Press stories to the effect that Lee Harvey 
Oswald recently visited Mexico City are true,accord­
ing to our information. Oswald visited both the 
Cuban and the Soviet embassies on 28 September. He 
was trying, we are told, to arrange for visas so 
that he could travel to the USSR via Havana. He 
returned to the US on 3 October. 
B. Brazil A new round of military promotions and re­
assignments will be made public today. The present 
instability of the Brazilian political scene is re­
flected in the numerous reports of ·coup.plots which 
this event has precipitated. 
C. USSR At last report the three Soviet range in­
strumentation ships were dead in the water 500 miles 
south. of Johnston Island, roughly the same position 
they·occupied for last year's extended range ICBM 
shots. No announcement closing this area of the 
Pacific to shipping has been made and there is no 
activity as yet at the Tyuratam missile test center, 
but we look for some action in the next few days. 
(INTERCEPTS) 
D. Algeria We have a report from a good clandestine 
source that a group of army.officers is plotting 
with Defense Minister Boumedienne to overthrow Ben 
Bella. A growing estrangement between the two has 
been apparent for some time, but this is the first 
good indication that Boumedienne is making common 
cause with those who wish to turn Ben Bella out of 
office.
