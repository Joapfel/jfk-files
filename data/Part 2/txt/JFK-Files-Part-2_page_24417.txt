ting with the Bay of Pigs, and Phase II, beginning with 
William Harvey's involvement in late 1961. The distinction 
between~ clearly demarcated Phase I and Phase II may be an 
artificial one, as there is considerable evidence that the 
operation was continuous, perhaps lying dormant for the period 
immediately following the Bay of Pigs .. * 
In early 1961, Harvey** was assigned the 
responsibility for establishing a general capability within 
the CIA for disabling foreign leaders, including assassination 
as a 
11
last resort" (Bissell, 6/9, p. T3; Har_vey, 6/25, pp. 34-35). 
* Harvey said that he took over a "going operation" from 
• Edwards (I.G., p. 42; Harvey, 6/25, p. 67) and emphasized 
that: 
"I would like to make as clear as I can that there was 
no phase 1, phase 2 in this. This is an ongoing matter 
which I injected into .... (Harvey, 6/25, p. 90). 
Continuity was provided by retaining O'Connell as the case 
officer for the project well into May 1962. During interviews 
for the Inspector General's Report, 0 'Connell rec[~lle<l that 
there was "something going on" between the Bay of Pigs and 
Harvey's assumption of control, (I.G., p. 43). When testifying 
before the Committee, O'Connell firmly recalled several trips 
to Miami in the Fall of 1961, and "right up to the time I 
turned it over to Harvey I was in and out of Miamf" (O'Connell, 
pp. 89-90). 
** Harvey had a long background in clandestine activitie~. 
He had conceived and carried out the Berlin tunnel operation 
(Harvey, 6/25, pp. 8-9), and serv~d as Chief of the division, 
which was responsiblie for 11the .. surrepti tious acquisition of code 
information (Harvey, 6/25, • pp. 8-'9).
