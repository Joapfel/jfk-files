But after seeing the minutes of the Special Group meeting of 
Febnw.ry 17, 1960, Gray said that it was clear that in those minutes 
I 
"his associate
11 
referred to President Eisenhower. 
Gray said that he never used the phrase 11 associate 11 , that was 
Parrott's phrase. Gray was not aware the phrase was used at the time 
in those minutes and couldn't, without reconstructing each minute, be 
sure it referred to the President in each case. He said that when he . 
attended the meetings,he would refer to "the PresiJ.ent" directly. 
(Note: Since the phrase "the President" is never used in Parrott's 
minutes, it is fair to assume that at least some of the references to 
"Mr. Gray's associate!' are euphemisms for President Eisenhower.) 
NSC OOCUMENTS 
Gray· recalls that_ the President .called him, and perhaps Allen Dulles, 
• into his office shortly after' Gray's appointment and said that "no 
minutes, notes, or memos of Special Group meetings are to be kept, except 
by the DCI and they are to be kept in the· OCI' s files." Gray said that 
Dulles was not present at this meeting. He knows that he would have told 
Dulles shortly af tenmrds. 
Gray did not keep personal notes of the Special Group meetings. 
Although he did defy the Presidential directive in one specific instance, 
by deciding to make a memorandum of every meeting with the President relating 
to the subject of Cuba. These memoranda are on file at the_ Presidential 
Library in Abilene, Kansas. 
Gray said that he never reviewed 'Thomas Parrott' s minutes of the 
Special Group. But the NSC minutes were passed to the principals at the
