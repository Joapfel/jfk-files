to anti-Castro dissidents, November's plans called for 
an amphibious landing with armor and combat air support 
to establish a lodgement on Cuba soil from which a 
t½~ u~' provisional government ~approvedra,nd spoasored by CIA) 
could issue its clarion calls for US, UN,· or OAS inter­
vention. 
Encompa.ssed in this volume· are the· records of 
the policy level-meetings which considered such items 
as funding the operation, possible use of US personnel 
in combat roles, the use of tis bases for training or 
for operations~ types of direct action programs (e.g., 
propaganda drops vs sabotage), and the host of other 
problems related to Castro'· s overthrow. It also makes 
clear that various US.corporate interests played an 
active (sometimes overactive) role in support of the 
anti-Castro efforts of the Government. 
This volume also examines official records in 
light of the allegati~ns of the Senate Select Commit­
tee's investigations that the assassination plans being 
developed by the Mafia were a fundamental part of the 
official US Government program to overthrow Fidel 
Castro .
