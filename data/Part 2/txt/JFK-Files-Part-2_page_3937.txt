Whi°le my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only "practical 
--thing" for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a few 
old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary_ that Mr. Lucey . 
. has· portrayed). Nor was i-:t, _becaus-e of any .peculiar allegiance to those_ who had toss el me . 
- l on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 4¼ years earlier, iove of country, masoch~s- • •• 
tic tendencies.· or woni of further intrigue. ,_ And· while it remains axiomatic in my m!ind_ • • 
··that the sole requisite for. one 1 8 use by the Agency ie his qualification to .fit irto 
whatever may happen to be . the scheme of things, • even this did not apply inl_ my 
i:ircunustance, _not really. • I agreed to· go back. out into the cold, so to speak, .stricrly 
ii-or personal reasons and I think _the explanation is wisely left at that for now. . . • 
. . Jly mission inside Ee.et Germany ..;. if indeed it was a mission - was neither ae we' 1-
defined nor ae elementary ae Mr~ Lucey has perceived. I am sure the CIA knows all it 
ne;tede to lcrtow about American -defectors in Berlin and ·the· modus operandi of the llfS. I In 
fact, the mission wae nPt directed against Ee.et Germany, per se •. • Preparations bore the 
trademarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency pro-ject targeted in the main to anot~er 
1 
nation. That I was unable to comprehend the German language, that l had been a recent, 
unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public records, 
etc., merely served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather 
than by design. Paradoxically, the chinlcs .-• in the armor were that the cover was ~ot 
wholly untrue, the !US ( unlike the FBI) not in the least irresponsible to the laws ~nd 
polioiee of its government. 1n· the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence 
f.l.CtiYitiee hoaitie to other ·eocialiet states, to which - as an integral part of\my 
cover - I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglec;ed 
to t_el~ ~e during the briefings that these. previous. activities constituted a viola~io~-lof _ 
the criminal _et_ atutes of the GDR, warranting a _maximum penalty of death upon convictl.,n. :_' 
ay i~advertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unf'-amiliar predicament. If 
. I had co~feased to my real illieeion,:: assuming that it was genuine,.- without doubt I would.• 
_ i have been spared exe~utio~, _ probably even escaped. long-term imp?"iso?ment. _ . Instead, I I 
: selected what I considered to be a better alternative •••• and gained my freedom. . .As :

J With regard to my marital status and my.children, the foremost area that Mr. Lucey 
:' appears to have exploited, I have never claimed _that ... "Uncle Sam hides nry_ family" 
t stated that FBI • and CIA agent.a :deliberately i'eolated· me. from my wife and children; nor 
• I have I claimed that. the Agency ueed the promise of reurii ting nie with my family ae part of 
]-the incentive -tor accepting -.the assignment in the GDR. My accusations in this respect 
jc_entered ar~und my children and they were leveled at the State Dep~rtment as ~he result 
-·i of' a promise made to me shortly after. my release from_ the GDR. Since returning to the 
\United stateelae~ spring a reliab~e sour?e he.a. in~ormed me. that my wife was granted a 
;tinal decree ot divorce at some period during my imprisonment in the USA and although I

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to •··_ 
-~j ■ ay onl7 that. I have never in my life been certified peychOtic by any U.S. medical 
1authority or adjudicated mentally-incompetent in a court of' law, notwithstanding the 
. :contlic1.ing legal• and medical opinions as to my me_ntal condi tiori' on the da, ot my ar~ee~
