because of his activities. Kislov then went on to discuss L~~ 
the fact that the Sovlets had exposed seveml United States ~ 
Embassy officials as intelligence agents recently. Kislov 
told Jaffe that these were strictly retaliatory measures taken 
by the Soviets because of Soviet nationals associated with 
the United Nations who had been exposed in the United States.
