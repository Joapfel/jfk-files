A. An Overview 
Using broad authority under the National Security Act of 
1949, the Directors of Central Intelligence have established 
Government-owned·business enterprises, foundations and quasi-busi­

and covert action purposes. Chief among those purposes have been:

groups doing research supporting U.S. foreign policy positions.

relationship on occasion can entail using the Agency's commercial 
contacts for information or assistance. 
3) Provide supp·ortin·g s·ervi·ces for covert operations.

carriers has many advantages-~ flexibility, ability to implant 
photographic equipment and other sensors, etc. CIA agents, engaged 
in ha·zardous business ordinarily uninsurable, can obtain connnercial 
insurance at standard or subsidized rates via MHMUTUAL, a conglomerate
