Mr. Hunt. That's correct. 
Mr. Baron. Before we move away from Cuban operations, 
let me show you one cable that we have which is fro 
and it appears to be to CIA headquarters because it is marked 
IN 75100, and it is dated September 16, 1964 in handwriting 
that was put on the copy that we have by the Agency. 
This is not the original copy of the cable but it appears 
to be a copy that was deleted and paraphrased for the purposes 
of providing it to the Committee in the early days of our 
inquiry. 
We will mark this as Exhibit 7. 
(The document referred to was 
marked for identification as 
Hunt Exhibit No. 7)
