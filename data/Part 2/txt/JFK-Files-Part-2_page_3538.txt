CUBAN - CHINESE COMMUNIST RELATIONS - cont'd 
While he is, of course, a member of the Chinese Communist 
party, he is not a ranking party member. He appears to be 
a lower ranking person than newly assigned Chinese Communist 
ambassadors to such countries as the UAR and Algeria. The 
eariiest biographic references to him have him as a member of 
the Chinese Communist Army.in 1931. He subsequently became 
an. army political commissar and rose to the rank of general. 
It is not unusual, however, for Chinese Communist diplomats 
to be generals. He speaks Russian, but there is no informa­
tion that he speaks Spanish. For the last year and a half, 
however, he has been stationed in Peiping and he could have 
learned the language then. He accompanied Chinese Communist 
chief of state Liu Shoa-chi on the latter's visit to Cambodia 
last spring. (CIA FBIS Havana, 6 December, OFFICIAL USE ONLY;

Havana University's School of Social Sciences . ." Nikichev

Marti airport by the Rector and Deputy Rector of the univer­
sity, Juan Mier Febles and Mariano Rodriguez So.lve1:ra, and. 
the school's protocol specialist, Professor Pedro Canas. The

cow two months _ago.: That agreement provides for the loan 
of Soviet academici~ns and educational ·~dministrators to 
Cuban- schools, the exchange of students and instructors be­
