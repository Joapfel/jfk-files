HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED: 
Information regarding Congressmen and Senators is 
included in the official FBI files--totaling more than 
6,500,000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and 
Communications Division on an upper fl.oar of the J. Edgar 
Hoover FBI Building. 
The area where these files are maintained is staffed 
and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure 
continuous security. 
General Index 
Th~ essential key tg the effective use of these FBI 
files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58 
million index cards and which is located on a different floor 
from· the files themselves in the ·J. • Edgar Hoover FBI· Building-. 
To determine what files (if any at all) contain information 
regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is 
necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General 
Index. 
The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours 
a clay, 7 days a week, t.o assure continuous security. 
Rules Governing Use of Files 
. These official FBI files are available only to FBI 
personnel--and they are available on· a. 11need-to-know 11 basis
