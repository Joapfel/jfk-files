WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE 
INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD 
Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security 
field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our 
investigative respopsib~lities. Their number varies and as 
of this date we have:-1.~?. '.·wire taps in operation. In addition, 
at the specific requesivof the National Se~~rity Agency, we 
have electronic coverage on teletypes oft40 _foreign diplomatic 
eitablishments. s_ 
The itnportance of utilizing wire t~~-s in the internal 
se~urity field.cannot be overemphasized in ~~w of the dangers 
that exist in the internal security of the United States. The 
intelligence data obtained from such .cove_r,a:fe makes it· possible 
to keep appropriate officials of our 0'{5v-ernment currently 
aware of the activities, plans, strat~gy, and tactics of 
subversive organizations and individuals. Also, information 
gathered from these sources is of immediate inter~st to the 
United States intelligence agencies and officialF 0f the Govern­
ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field. 
We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances, 
mail covers, or trash covers in connection with our investiga­
tions. We are utilizing security informants and confidential 
sources to provide us necessary coverage. Currently, we have 
~_26lsecuri ty informants who are members of the Communist Party 
ana-"some of these are operating at the highest J.evel. In view 
of the valuable coverage these informants provide us, we place~ 
great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be 
interesting to note that during (!'965, 18of our security infor­
mants became members of the Communist Partv and this was 
increased to B<D. informants becoming members of the Party in \ij)GG J 
In th'is connection, we noted that during jhose two· years while 
["45Jinformants became membfrS of the Party ,J2.39J discontinued 
their association with the Party primarily due to personal 
reasons, thus leaving us a total gain ofl-six)informants in the 
Party. - P.
