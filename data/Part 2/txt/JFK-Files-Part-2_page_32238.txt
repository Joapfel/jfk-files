COORDitiA.TORts RECOMMENDATION 
I recommend approval of Alternative I. 
STATEMENT OF DOD REPRESENTATIVE 
I do not concur in the policy recommended by the.·· 
Coordinator. Alternative I does not make the overthrow 
of the Castro/Communist regime an objective of the u. S. 
In addition~ Alternative I does not sufficiently 
contemplate the creation of opportunities to effect the 
downfall of that regime. The specific actions 
recommended in Alternative I are consistent with the 
policy recommended in Alternative II and, in many cases, 
would be among the initial steps that would be taken 
in executing that poliey .. I re~ommend adoption of 
Alternative II.
