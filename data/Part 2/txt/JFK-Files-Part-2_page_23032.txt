Mr. Baron. We have just gone off th• record to straighten 
out the fact that wa ara both talking about the same Cuban'high 
military officer who was known to the CIA by the cryptonym of 
AMLASH. 
5 Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Halley, that you and I agree 
6 that we are referring to the same p~~on that we have identified 
7 off the record?

Mr. Halley. Yes, we have. 
Mr. Baron. Were you aware of contacts between /\MT,ASH-1, 
10 as he was known, and Artime? 
11 Mr. Halley. I think at the time that: this was going on, I 
12 do not know whether I was or I was not -- I was aware that the 
13 CIA was in touch with AMLl\SH. 
___/ 
14 Mr. Baron. Did· you deal directly with the case officers 
15 who ran AMLASH? 
16 Mr. Halley. I did not-.. My r~collection of this AMLASH 
-17 case is as follows. -At:some point in time~ I-had.a conversation 
18 with Desmond FitzGerald in Washington during one of m~·periodic 
19 visits to Washington from Miami. We discussed at that meeting 
20 ·the nature of our approach to the military establishment in 
21 Cuba. In the contbxt of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked 
22 me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet 
23 one of these Cuban military personalities, anrl he subsequently 
24 identified to me the personality h~ was talking about was 
25 AML/\SH-1.
