WIRETAPPING 
The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary 
Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone ~nd wiretapping 
were unn~cessary in connection with control of crime in the United 
StatesC> Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to 
legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a 
letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation 
proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and 
use of microphones with court approval in organize_d crime investiga­
tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would 
be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and 
would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being 
followed in connection with .use of such devices in national security 
matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining 
La Casa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves, 
and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa­
tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Casa 
Nostra sources of income. 
In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior 
microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals 
courts, there· has been to date no complete reversal of any of such 
cases which were actually brought to trialo In several casesj notably, 
Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washington, 
D. Co; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles 
Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami, 
Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each 
instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our 
position that these cases were not taintedo In the Black case and in 
the Sohipani case in New York, the Supreme Court has remanded for 
retrial and these are still under considerationC> '"
