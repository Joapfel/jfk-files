decision to cretlte ... this capability had bcc11 takc11 
without an outside request. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 67-68) * 
llun<lj: McGeorge Bundy als~ testified ~hat he had a coµversition 
with Bissell, during which the executive action capability was dis-
cussed (Bundy, pp. 4-5). l.lundy's testimony comports with 
llissell's on the fact that they spoke about an untargctcd c:;ipability, 
rather than an assassination operation (Bundy, pp. lf-5). nut llundy 
said thc1t the capc1bility included "killing 'the individual" ,(llundy, 
p. 5) _.,c:, Bundy's impression was tha.t the Cl/\ wc1s "testing my reaction," 
not "seeking authority" (Bundy, p. · 15). • lluµdy summarized his testi­
mony by saying: 
I am sure· I r;ave no instruction. But it is only fair to 
add that I do not r·ecall that I offered any impediment 
either. (llundy, p. 10) 
Bundy said that he did not take steps to halt the developmel"}t ·of 
the executive action capability or "pursue the .matter at all" (ll~ndy, 
p. 19) becau~e he ~as satisfied 
tl1at this was riot an operational activity, and would not 
become such without two conditions: • first, that there 
be a d'"sire or__a request or a gµi_<lance that there should 
be planning against some specific individual; and second, 
th~t there should be i decision to m6ve against the indi­
vidual. (llundy, p. 7) .. 
* For exmnple, Bissell te~tified that on his own initiative he 
had request:d a .Cl/\. of~icer to go to ~he ~ongo to "make plans .. ;nd 
~evelqp the capability. for an assassination attempt against Lumurnba. 
if ordered (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 55).

+:r Bundy also ·testified that he had a vague recollcclion of hearing 
about poison iri relation to Cuba, but he did not connect this to the 
conversation about executive action. (See footnote, p.· 6, Ken~edy:
