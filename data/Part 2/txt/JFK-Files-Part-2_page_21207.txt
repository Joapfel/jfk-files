ARTEMEV was seJ.ec.ted as Security Officer. for the 
delegation because he knew Engli~h and French. The 
2nd Section did not have anyone with language 
capabilities. This may explain why an officer of 
the 1st Section, would have been given the task of 
directing BELITSKIY in Geneva rather than an officer ~. 
of the 2nd Section which handled the case. It is also 
noted that BELITSKIY was the subject of investigation.
