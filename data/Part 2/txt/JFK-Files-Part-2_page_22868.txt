back·to'your:earlier;question, Mr. Bundy .. 
' . 
have a message through the courtesy of the Committee from the 
White House that there is no objection to answering· the 
question as to how the White House came to show me the NSC file. 
When I learned of some of the. interests of the Rocke'feller 
Commission, it seemed to me that it would be useful if I 
could refresh my recollection. I telephoned Dr. Kissinger, 
who-it seemed to me would be the right person both in his 
capacity as Special Assistant and.the capacity as Secretary 
of State, and he called me back to say that General Scocroft 
would show me the documents I needed, and he did not. 
Mr. Smothers. Just one question. 
This file contained w~at, now, other than the NSAM? 
Mr. Bundy. The only file that I had time to go through 
that I can recollect was the NSAM file, which is a relatively 
short one. 
Mr. Smothers. For which time period? 
Mr. Bundy. For the period surrounding August 1962. 
Mr. Smothers. It was given to us as an existing file, 
or matters that had been pulled, or organized --
i 
Mr. Dundy. No, they gave me the whole file, they were 
all documents that I have been involved with, it was nothing 
new to me. nut the ones I was looking for were the ones 
relating to this subject. 
Mr. Smothers. Were these only your documents?
