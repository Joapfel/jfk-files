And the next thing we knew suddenly the President told 
Colonel Goodpastor to say that this was descended from the 
State Department. 
And the next thing we kne\v the statement came out from 
the US from NASA which made no sense at all. 
And of course what had happened was that Hagerty -- that 
had been the routine thing, and when it came up Hagerty was 
to refer the press to NASA, and NASA, if they were referred, 
had the cover story. 
And Goodpastor -- I never quite found out what happened 
in the White House, whether Goodpastor didn't get to Hagerty 
or Hagerty didn't pay any attention to them, either way was 
more likely, because Hagerty was way senior to Goodpastor 
at that time, and t~ey had done this, and he didn't know, he 
had been at that little meeting with the President, he didn't 
know that it was supposed to be in the State Department. And 
that got everything off upside down. So we were trying to 
expl~in how the Js Government had put out this silly statemen~ 
I -which bore no relation to the facts, when we knew the facts. 
I And of course at that time the Russians hadn't yet 
announced that they had the pilot or anything. But we knew 
that was likely, too. We knew that would happen. I think it 
followed electronically. And but it was because of this 
White House bolix that htis had happened.
