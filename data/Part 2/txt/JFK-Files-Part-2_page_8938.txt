Asked while visiting the United S~ates if the Russian 
people had been told of the ABEL-POWERS exihange, Soviet 
mathematician R.V. GAMKRELIDZE replied to an American 
acquaintance that they had not been told officialli but 
they knew about it since there was "quite a grapevine" in 
Moscow. It was in this way;,GAMKRELIDZE stat~d, that he 
learned of the NOSENKO defection and of its significance. 
According to the "grapevine", the defection was ve·ry 
damaging to Soviet Intelligence in that NOS_ENKO was the. 
Chief of the American Section, and he knew the identities 
of all Soviet agents in th~ United States.
