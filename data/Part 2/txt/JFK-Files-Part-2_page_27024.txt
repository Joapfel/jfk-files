citizens abroad? How might these procedures be 
improved? What are the procedures and mechanisms 
external to the CIA for oversight of the CIA's intel­

U. S. or directed at U. S. citizens abroad? How might 
these mechanisms and procedures be improved? 
The annexed notifications set forth requests for additional 
documents and the names of persons the Committee presently 
desires to interview. In some cases the occupant of a 
position is not known to the Committee and the Committee 
requests that the CIA provide the name of the individual. 
In any case, where the individual is no longer with the 
Agency, the Committee requests that the CIA provide the 
individual's last known address. Finally, the notifications 
indicate the•names of the staff members who, in addition to 
the Committee's senior staff, will be working in these areas. 
The Committee, in the course of the next few months, will 
undertake other subjects for investigation as its work 
proceeds and will notify ~ou as appropriate. 
We look forward to your cooperation in these matters.
