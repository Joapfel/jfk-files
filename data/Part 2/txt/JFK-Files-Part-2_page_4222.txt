Third, the Soviets having accomplished one of their objectives, 
that of securing a U.S. guarantee against invasion, will increase their 
military and economic aid so that all military materiel will be work­
able at all times and the Castro economy will be reasonably well off. 
Under each of these alternatives, Castro's posture and his 
effect on the_ United States and_ other Western Hemisphere countries 
will differ vastly and I would suggest that your paper be oriented so· 
that it will project for the.benefit of policy makers the consequences, 
favorable or unfavorable, under these several alternatives. 
It is my personal opinion that Mikoyan will return to New York 
in a few days and will announce an agreement for some perfunctory 
Red Cross ground inspection of the missile sites and nothing else, 
will deny any intention of a submarine base, will dismiss the IL 28 
issue as wholly beyond the Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement, will 
indicate that all Soviets are leaving Cuba except economic and 
agricultural advisers, and will state most persuasively that the 
Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement has been fulfilled to the letter and 
demand our non-invasion commitment. 
He will then build Castro up and indicate Soviet intention for 
supporting in every way and to go right down the line with him.
