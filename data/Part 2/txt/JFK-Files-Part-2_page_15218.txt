ADDENDUM BY MR. TOLSON· 10/13/61 
Iain inclined to the view that we should ·not send the attached. 
communications to the Attorney General and Deputy Under Secretary 
of State Johnson concerning our'. proposal to expand our intelligence 
coverage in this country with respect to countries in Central and 
South America. After all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson, 
indicated what we could do and he, in turn, advised that the requested 
clearances would not be granted. Jt ~s_!!.9t the Bureau' s_!?.~sic 
~spo~sibility to develop information concerning_t!iese foreign co~_nt!~~§: 
It is obvious tliat someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has 
talked is opposed to our doing this. We have been told that if there is 
a specific country or individual involved and a request was made ·by the 
Bur-eau, consideration would be given to such a request. I think that we 
should let the matter stand on that basis. 
Mr. Belmont does not agree.· This matter presently rests on 
an oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record.
