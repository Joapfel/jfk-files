1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE 
*TALKING POINTS TO BE USED IN THE PRESENTATION TO THE<JFK> 
*<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD. 
2. AMBASSADOR MONDALE, THE EMBASSY AND THE STATION STRONGLY 
OPPOSE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A 
CIA STATION IN JAPAN. SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES 
FOR US-JAPAN RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY 
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING 
EARLIER CONTROVERSIES OVER ALLEGED CIA WIRETAPPING OF THE MAN WHO IS 
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER AND OVER PAST CIA FUNDING FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT, 
DISRUPT COOPERATION WITH JAPANESE LIAISON SERVICES ON IMPORTANT 
COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES. BY MAKI~G THE 
STATION THE OBJECT OF GREATER. PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY, 
IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF EXISTING AND NEW SOURCES IN OUR 
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEI~ IDENTITY AND SECURITY, 
3. IMPACT ON US-JAPAN RELATIONS: .THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT DOES 
NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS .INTELLIGENCE, AND AS A COROLLARY, 
DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES. TOKYO AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT 
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IS ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE JAPANESE 
POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMI.SSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH WAS THE 
RULING PARTY FROM 1955 TO 1993 AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION. ANY 
OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT CONTRADICTED EARLIER JAPANESE GOVERNMENT 
SECRET
