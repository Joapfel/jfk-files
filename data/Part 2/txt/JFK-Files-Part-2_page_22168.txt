In a Presidential rreeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONJ;:, HELMS, AND COLBY 
in attendance. •• The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested 
that in the Ambassador Is absence, HARKINS, TRUEHARI1, andfW\~m-ns}Et@ffiv act as a 
corrmittee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view thatlffliimtrishould 
'" 
not be involved in such -a-pol-icy-making function, although he would be 1n a position-tu--------­
provide technical advise to HARKINS and 1'RUEHARI' as well as carry out their instructions 
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces 1n Saigon were not 
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General 
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy evidence. The OCI stated his view 
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregnrum, confusion which might 
only be solved by a second or third coup.
