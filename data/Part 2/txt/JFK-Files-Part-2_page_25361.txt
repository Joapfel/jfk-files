Trafficante reportedly has f.old 
investigators that he first met Roe­

Trafficante was a major gam­
bling figure in pre-Castro Havana, 
where he ran a casino. In 1959. it: 
was estimated that $1 million o.r $2 
million was bet nightly in all the 
Mafia-run casinos in Havana. The 
gambling stopped when Castro 
took over in 1959.

sassinate Castro. .
