Mr. l1ides. Were you ever aware, whether you were formall 
notified or just got a rumble or heard through the grapevine, 
that the CIA was getting some information about these threats, 
or some information about groups who might pose a threat in the 
Washington area, not from Bureau sources or military sources, 
but from CIA sources, did you ever hear any rumble of that kind 
Mr. O'Connell. Yes. 
Mr. Wides. What did you hear? 
Mr. O'Connell. The only way I got involved in it was that 
Howard Osborn would have a nine o'clock meeting every 
morning with his deputies. 
And they had a proprietary organization in the Office of 
Security which I think had informants. 
Now, I don't know their identities, but it would come out 
in the meeting·, and they would have some names for them. I 
c_ouldn 't tell you what they were. 
Mr. Madigan. What was the proprietary called? 
Mr. O'Connell. The name that strikes me -- and I 
know part of it, but I couldn't tell you exactly -- I think it 
was 
Mr. Madigan. 
Mr. O'Connell. something like that. 
Mr. Wides. You say you think they had informants? 
Mr. O'Connell. They obviously did, I guess, because the 
way this would come out, so-and~so advised at a meeting last
