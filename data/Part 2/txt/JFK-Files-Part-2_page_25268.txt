Breckinridge actually put together the I.G. Reports and he did so in 
response to a March 1967 Drew Pearson column to the effect that the agency 
was involved with criminal syndicates to assassinate Castro. As a result 
of discussions caused by the Pearson column, staff members in the I.G. 's 
office were directed to put together reports on CIA involvement in the 
assassination of Castro, Trujillo, and Diem (50).
