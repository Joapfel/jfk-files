Mr. Wides. And except where there's a question of an 
agent under cover who would be possibly exposed to harm or 
that kind of thing in regard to the mention of other Agency 
p~ople, certainly at the level of Mr. Shackley or other 
officials, Mr. Dimmer, and so forth, that the general procedureJ 
I 
have been that people at the Agency or retirees have not I 
i 
refused to disclose names. 
Now, you certainly have your rights --
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. I am not questioning you, or anythin, 
except I've been in this business a long time and I've never 
mentioned anybody's name. Now if somebody were to tell me, 
if Seymour Bolton were to tell me that I could tell you all the 
names of all my supervisors and everything, it's perfectly all 
right. But I've never mentioned a name and I feel that I 
shouldn't mention a name. 
Mr. Wides. Well, we may have to take a break and do that, 
but let me go on. 
With regard to the~program, the Cubans were 
not contract agents of the station, is that correct? 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. 
-
Mr. Wides. They were proprietary employees essentially of 
essentially? 
Mr. Sarno. was a group -- that proprietary was 
set up in September of 1968. Prior to that time they were a 
bunch of Cubans just living down in Miami.
