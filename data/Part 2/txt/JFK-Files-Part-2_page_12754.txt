SECTION 87. SECURITY INVESTIGATIQNS 
~ , .• 
The Communist ~Y, USA, is divided into dis~;- and state 
organizations, then into -county, city, section, and club 
organizations. The number and nature ,of these subdivisions 
are dependent on the number of members in the various localities. 
Every party member must belong to a party club. 
The Communi·st Party strategy and policy is based primar~ly on the 
loyal support and defense of the Soviet Union. The part-y line 
changes from time to time de-pending .upon .the current program of 
the international communist movement. 
b. Socialist Workers Party 
•The Socialist Workers Party was founded at a convention held in 
Chicago, Illinois, from 12-~l-37 to 1-3-38. The following statements 
are taken from the "Declaration of Principles and Constitution of 
the Socialist Workers Party" which was adopted at .this convention: 
"The purpose of the party is set forth in its declaration of 
principles: Its purpose shall be to ~ducate and organize thfr ~orking 
class for the abolition of capitalism anq the establishment of . 
a. workers government to achieve Soci,ali·sm. 11 (From article 11 under 
the caption "Purpose.") •• • 
"We call upon all revolutionary militants to join with us to build 
the SWP into the mass revolutionary party which will lead the work­
ing class of the United States to power; and which, together with 
the revolutionists of all countries united in the Fourth •International, 
will achieve the victory of the internati·onal revolution and of world 
·Socialism. 11 
"The main specific task of the SWP is the mobilization of the .American 
masses for struggle against American Capitalism, and for its over-
.throw •••. 11 (Part III of above pamphlet.). . 
Shortly after the Fourth International was founded in Switzerland on 
9-3-38, .the Socialist Workers Party in the U. s. announced that it 
was the "American Section" of the "world· party of the Socialist 
revolution" (Fourth International). At. a special convention on 
12~21-40, the Socialist Workers Party passed a resolution ending 
its organizational connection with the •Fourth International (because 
of the pas sage of the Vo or his Act). • • 
This organization follows the Marxist-Leninist-Trotskyist line. 
Statements made by functionaries indicate that in the evE1nt of war 
between the U. s. and the Soviet Union, the_ Socialist Workers Party 
would defend· the latter.
