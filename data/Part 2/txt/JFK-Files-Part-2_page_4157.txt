MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: Clandestine and Covert Activities Against Cuba 
The objective of the U. S~ Government is to overthrow_ 
the Castro/Communist regirn:e in Cuba. In accomplishing its 
objective, the U. S. is not willing to risk nuclear war or, at 
this time, substantial deterioration in its relations with its 
Allies, or. significant escalation in tensi~ns between this . 
country and the Soviets. Thus, any covert u. S. program 
should be set at a level that is not likely to incur such risks. 
Such a program would appear to be a low-risk, clandestine 
program of harassment and sabotage directed against Cuba. 
In addition, a program of higher riski:; seems justified when 
it is directed against • Cuban subversion of Latin America. 
Actions Against Cuba 
1. Sabotage. A low level campaign of sabotage and 
harassment against Cuba might include such targets as the 
Canete Saw Mill, smaller POL storage plants (such.as the 
one at Pilon}, the Nazabal warehouse and pier, and ships 
(such. as barges or Cuban patrol boats}. Where possible, 
it would. seem desirable to. make the raids appear to have 
come from within Cuba. . Cuban ships <:mtside Cuba can be sabotaged 
by discreet means (such asplacing sand in gears or sugar in fuel). 
2. Harassment of Fr:ee World Shipping to Cuba. 
a} Initiate a more comprehensive program of 
. overt and covert pressure against Free World firms trading 
with Cuba. In this connection, develop. a comprehensive list 
of firms doing business with Cuba, check th'em_ against known 
DOD off-shore and foreign purchase suppliers so that 
appropriate retaliation can be applied ag~st those suppliers·. 
b) Place unactivat~d incendiary and. explosive 
devices in cargoes and ori ships bound for-Cuba and· subse­
quently "tip 1 off" port or shipping offiFials so that they will 
search aid discover the _devices with.the attendant publicity.
