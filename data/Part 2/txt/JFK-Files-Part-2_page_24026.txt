plan, since the cable had arrived that morning. However, General Haig 
had no recollection of the meeting with Karamessines on the 19th. Nor 
did he believe he had been informed of the Valenztlela·• plan. "This 
is all very new to me. I hadn't seen any of this, and I was not familiar 
with this particular plan ... or $50,000, or any of the characters that 
are described in here." (Haig testimony, pp. 38-39) 
Similarly, Kissinger testified that he had not been informed of 
the Valenzuela plan. He said he "was informed of nothing after October 
15th .... " (Kissinger testimony, p. 65) He indicated that, according 
to his daily calendar, he had no conversation with either Karamessines 
or Helms between the 15th and the 19th. (I.laid,, p. 53) He indicated 
that he never knew that the CIA was in the process of passing guns and 
tear gas to Chilean military conspirators. He said " ... there was no 
further meeting on that subject. In anybody's record, mine or theirs 
(the CIA's), none of the information from the 16th on was familiar to me .. " 
(Ibid., p. 62) 
Kissinger further testified he did not know that the United States 
was dealing with Chilean officers who plotted a coup which involved 
the abduction of General Schneider: 
Senator Hart of Colorado. I ·am-·not sure that 
the record clearly shows you answer to the direct 
question of whether you knew or did not know that 
we were negotiating with mili~ary officers with 
regard to a plot that did.involve the abduction 
of General Schneider. 
Secretary Kissinger. I said I did not know. 
(Kissinger testimony, p. 86) 
Nor did General Haig believe he had been informed of any abduction 
plans before the fact.
