HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the 
basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organi~ 
zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which 
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied 
the whole thing was a waste of her timeo 
In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN 
worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and 
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and 
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very 
criTical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as 
"resource people 11 for the groupo She said she thought this 
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a 
situation that was quite different in that she was working 
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented 
individuals and it was a real learning experience .. ELAINE 
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while 
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and 
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs 
of America~ women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist 
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,
