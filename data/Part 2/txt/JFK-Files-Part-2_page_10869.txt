material may make any necessary changes as they occur in this 
list by typing the appropriate change on a strip. of paper which 
will be taped over the item to be corrected. [The date of the 
revision will be typed on a strip of paper and will be ~aped

correction may then be reproduced on Xerox equipment and the new
