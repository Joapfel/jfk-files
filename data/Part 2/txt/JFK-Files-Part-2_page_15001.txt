by the FBI resulted in the indictment of 15 members of the 
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on June 22, 1966. The 
indictment charged these Klansmen with violation of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Statutes. Those

of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi. 
A motion was filed on behalf of 13 of the defendants

array of the jurors. Based upon this action the facts were 
re-presented to a Federal Grand Jury at Jackson, Mississippi, 
which resulted in the indictment of 12 members of the White 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan .. of Mississippi on February 27, 1967.
