Dick: 
While the attached resume of Ms. Miriam Rudder does 
not reflect experience related to office duties, I 
know her well and certainly trust her. Therefore, 
I strongly recommend that she be hired for me to 
train as a mail clerk working along with 
Patricia Price. Again, as I indicated above, the 
most important thing to me in this instance is that 
I have the utmost trust in Miriam. 
Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.
