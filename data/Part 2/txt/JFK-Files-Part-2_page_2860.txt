MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Commendation of Mr. William Keat 
During the last five months I have turned to Mr. lent 
on two occa ■ ioa ■ to help the Latin America Division in 
connection with Senate Select Committee's invaatigatioa 
of covert action in Chile. When confronted with a need 
to produce a paper on C~ile in a short timeframe, I 
instinctively turned to him. It was not only becanaa he 
bad expertise on Chile, due to service in the Chile Branch. 
but because he is highly skilled in written praeeatation. 
He Q~ganizee his material well and p~esenca it in a lucid, 
hig~ly readable manner, On the first occasion, be helped 
us prepare a paper that was eventually used by tha Director 
in his presencatioa before the Senate Select Committee on 
14-15 July, On the second occasion bis contribution was 
used by the ODO in bis appearance before the Senate Seler.t 
Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers were 
excellent and have wichstoood critical scrutiny, 
Aside from Mr. Kant's ability to write I would like 
to•take this occasion to record my overall high esteem 
fQr Mr, Kent a9 a profeaaional and aa a perscn. I have 
always considered him to be one of our more able and pro­
mising officers. Bia dedication is exemplary; he bas spent 
untold extra hours of bis time carrying out his duties. Ha 
• baa good judgment and common sense. Mr. Keoc baa a very 
attractive personality and excellent personal praaance, 
From all standpoints be is an excellent officer that dea•rvea 
to move ahead in the organization, I am convinced ha bas tba 
ability and potential to do so.
