viewed as a serious issue in the Agency? By those ... 
MR. HALPERN: Who were then serving? From what I gather it 
was. And the Agency even under Turner objected to it. The 
Carter Administration even objected to it. And even going back 
into that period, Colby objected to it when he testified. All 
the Directors have objected to it. You can't do it even with 
an overall fjgure. The only budget figure that I know of that 
is actua 11 y published every year is· the budget figure for the 
Intelligence Community Staff. And that do~sn't matter whether 
they have a hundred people or a thousand people. What the 
hell. That's simple enough ~ecause they don't get engaged in 
any activities. You can't split the CIA budget up into this 
much for DOI, this much for S&T and this much for so on and so 
forth. The minute you start mucking around with that_. you take 
the next year and the year after that and the year after that, 
people start asking. iots of questions. And foreign governments 
try to figure out, ~hy is it going up, why is it going down? 
And pretty soon there is going to be demands for more and more 
more and more breakout. And you can't have that kind of stuff 
if you're going to run an intelligence organization. I 
remember many years ago the British Parliament use to pass a 
one penny, a one~. budget for confidential matters. 
Period. And the British penny, not our penny. But anyway, one 
penny. That's the best way to do it. The country wants a 
budget figure, we'll give them a budget figure.
