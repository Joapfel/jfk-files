Hedgeman stressed that in this period, 1960-1961, the 
Congo was fraught with utter confusion; he sais that what 
they were running was a Scotch tape and baling-wire opera­
tion. As for paramilitary operations, Hedgeman said they be­
gan seriously in the end of 1962 with the arrival of a number 
of T-6's that he and Ed Gullion had asked for. He said that t 
aircraft were not intended to be used in combat, but only to 
reassure the Congolese that the United States was with them a 
provide them with a bit of black magic. Hedgeman professed t 
the paramilitary combat missions of 1963, in support of anti­
rebel activities, were really quite minor affairs. 
FITE: 
Some specifics. Hedgeman contended that he had no knowle ge 
of the approval of funding of South African mercenaries and 
tribal leaders capable of resistance as approved by the 303 
Committee. He also said, though, that he had important conta t 
with Mike Hoare mercenaries, they gave no direct or indirect 
support to them. He also said there was Re, repeat no, com­
plicity or support on the part of the CIA in the ouster of 
Kasavubu by Mobutu in November of 1965. 
Throughout the conversation, Hedgeman interspersed the 
most hair-raising tales of his and his daughter's brushes wit 
death in their dealings with unruly mutinous Congolese, rangi g 
from being placed before two different firing squads during 
one day and his evening as the selected victim of a hit con­
tract given by the Union Miniere. 
As for CIA employees who might testify well, should the 
Committee handle the Congo issue in executive session, Hedgem n 
recommended Edward Korn-Patterson, Bronson Tweedy, and Glen 
Fields.
