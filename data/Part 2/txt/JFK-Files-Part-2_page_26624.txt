3. USSR-Cuba a. In the past week we inter­
cepted Cuban military messages which 
show that Cuban interpreters are now 
posted at several surface~to-air mis­
sile (SAM) sites on the island. 
b. We think this means that 
on-site training of Cubans has begun 
on schedule. Field training is to 
last six months, after which the 
SAM system may be_ turned over to 
Castro. 
c. In the past month some 
1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba. Most 
of these were probably SAM experts, 
sent to monitor the training. 
d. Prior to their coming, we 
had detected no more than a few 
hundred Soviet military personnel 
entering Cuba since the October 
crisis last year. 
e. We estimate that at least 
15,000, and probably closer to 
18,000, have been withdrawn in the 
intervening 13 months, leaving, very 
roughly, 4,000 to 7,000, Those re­
maining are for the most part ad­
visors whose main functions are to 
train and supervise Cubans in the 
use of weapons turned over to them.
