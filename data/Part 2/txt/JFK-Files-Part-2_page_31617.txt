The March 1, 1954, issue of the 11Young Socialist Challenge," 
published as page three of "labor Action, !I an official publication 
of the Indpendent Socialist League (ISL), contained ~n article 
concerning the creation of the YSL, which pointed out that at a 
unity conference occurring February 12-14, 1954, at Labor Action 
Hall, New York, New York, a merger occurred between the Young 
People's Socialist League (YPSL) and the Socialist Youth League 
(SYL). The new organization was named the YSL. 
A source on June 15, 1954, made available the minutes of 
the YSL's National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954, 
which reflected that one -s. SITEMAN, "Chairman of SP (Socialist 
Party) Youth Committee," had objected to a statement appearing in 
"Co-.nmcrce," a New York University journal_. which indicated that 
the YPSL merged with the SYL to form the YSL. He explained that 
the YPSL did not merge with anyone; that it continued to exist as 
the youth section of the Socialist Party. He explained that a 
small group of the YPSL was dropped, expelled, or suspended from 
that organization and joined the SYL, which he characterized as the 
youth group of the "Trotskyite ISL." He explained tra t after these 
few former members of the YPSL joined the SYL, the SYL then pro­
ceeded to change its name.for its own pu.J;"'.poses. 
_ On April 9, 1956, a source advised as follows: The YSL 
has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the 
ISL toward similar objectives, although each major issue given 
mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations 
individudally. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the ISL, 
but the ISL selection of members from YSL ranks is made man 
individual and p8rsonal basis. In many instances YSL members are 
also members of the ISL. The YSL and the ISL utilize the same 
printing house in New York City and the YSL publication is printed 
as an insert in "Labor Action.

Frequently, lecturers before the 
YSL are ISL members.

Challenge," which appeared as page five of "Labor Action, '

contain-
ed an undated statement from the National Committee of the YSL 
which indicated that the YSL had been dissolved. The satement 
appeared under the caption

Join the Young Peoples Socialist League." 
The YPSL is publicly known as the youth affiliate of the 
Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation. 
A cource advised on June 12, 1958, that the Berkeley, 
California, unit of the YSL was formed in 1954~ following the unity 
convention held in New York in February 1954, which combined the 
forces of the SYL and the YPSL. The source stated that the YSL 
in the San Francisco Bay Area continued to operate under the 
leadership and guidancecf ISL members.
