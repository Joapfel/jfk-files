ANNEX C - CHILE 
On 28 October 1962, at the height of the mis­
sile crisis, a homemade bomb exploded during assembly 
in a downtown Santiago apartment house. The Chilean 
police who searched the apartment found four members 
of the extremist Social Progressive Group (SPG), 6 
cases of Cuban propaganda, 30 sticks of dynamite, 38 
fuses, and one small bomb already assembled. 
One of those arrested, an SPG leader, who had 
his hand blown off, had earlier been photographed 
with three Cuban diplomats. At least two of these, 
Orlando Prendes Gutierrez and Raul Zayas Linares, 
have been reliably reported as Cuban intelligence of­
ficers. The Chilean police told .the press that the 
group had planned bomb attacks on the US Embassy and 
residence, US firms, and local public utilities. ·This 
incident occurred two days after a clandestine Havana 
broadcast urging Latin American Communists to attack 
US property and installations wherever possible in 
Latin America.
