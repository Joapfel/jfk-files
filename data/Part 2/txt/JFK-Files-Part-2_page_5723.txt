,.,.CIA-IR-01 Personnel assigned to post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199). 
This request, originally made in November 1996., was raised at the 00 follow-up 
briefing on April 1., 1997. It is our understanding that the DO believes that it is 
not able to answer this request. The ARRB staff does not find DO' s response to 
be credible. We believe that with all of the resources at the Agency's disposal -­
including ready contact with individuals who should be able to answer this 
question from memory - this question can be answered. 6 1he ARRB staff has 
provided suggestions as to how this information could be obtained., including 
suggesting the types of files and cables that coul<;i be searched. 
CIA-IR-02 Location of cable identified in JFK 1993.07,20.10.18:29:650630. 
The cable was delivered to the Review Board on March 20, 1997. No further 
action by CIA is needed. 
CIA-IR-03 Full computer search for list of documents in HrLINGUAL file. 
CIA should undertake a computer run for all HIUNGUAL documents. All 
computer searches for these documents should be ~ocumented in a formal letter 
for the record. 
CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton's files. 
The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to 
account for any files thatJames Jesus Angleton possessed. or controlled that· 
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived 
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files., the Review Board · 
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he 
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to 
explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to 
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided 
by the OC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any 
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the 
disposition of Angleton' s .files. 
6The ARRB staff has spoken with a retired CIA official who claims to be able to 
answer this question from memory, but who refused to do so.
