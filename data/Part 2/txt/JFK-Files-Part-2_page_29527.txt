• October. An examination of ·:he documents does not clarify 
this question but rather add:; confusion to the issue. 
Several documents and cal,les deal with the tapes and 
a voice comparfsoo of the re-:orded conversations. In 
Oswald's "P" file there is a newspaper clipping of an 
article from the 21 October 1964 Washington Post. The 
artlcle, by Robert S .. Allen ind Paul ·Scott, is entitled 
"CIA Withheld Vital Intellig~nce from Warren Commission." 
One paragraph .from that arti:le says: 
The invest1gators also are trying to determine 
why the CIA in its preassassination ~e~ort to 
the State Department on Jswald's trip to Mexico 
City gave details·only of the defector's visit 
to the Russia~ E~bassy an~ not the Cuban Embassy. 
The CIA did not report the latter visit until after 
Kennedy's assassination in Dalla~. 
Next to ·that paragraph Ann Goodpasture wrote: 
The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidenti·­
fied until HQ sent traces~~ Oswald and voices 
comp a red by ( Ta r a so ff ) . 6 1 7 / 
That statement is very· clear in sayi·ng that a voice 
comparison ~as_made. The cable traffic that w~nt from 
Mexico to CIA-Headquarters after the assassination is 
not so clear.
