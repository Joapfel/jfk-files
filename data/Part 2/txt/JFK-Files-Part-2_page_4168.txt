COMMI'ITEEMEETING FRIDAY, MARCH 29 at 12:30 p.m. 
Dear Mr. President: 
I am concerned that·hit and run raids by Cuban exiles 
may create incidents which w0rk to the disadvantage of our 
national interest. Increased frequency 0f these forays 
could raise a host of lJroblems· over whi.ch we wou1 d not 
have control.. 
Actions such as yesterday's exile attack which 
ceused substantial damage t-1 a Soviet vesse 1. may 
comTJlicate our relations with the USSR without net 
advantage to us. 
I therefore Propose several measures which c~uld 
impede or deter further attacks of this nature. 
First, the intel.ligence community cnul.d increase its 
efforts irt Miami to develop hard information about 
__ projected raids. This is currently connnunicated to Customs 
authorities charged with investJgation of violati0n of 
arms control. 
Second, Customs and the Coast Cruard, on the bas:i s 
of this information can stop and search the vesse 1 s. 
(They now do this, and ~icked un ·about 50 men and four 
boats last year.) Anns and vessels are c0nfiscated, 
and participants arraigned ifa violat:i.on of 1 aw has 
The President, 
The White House.
