by activity. As applied to proprietaries, the CIA, perhaps, 
should have been providing a whole family of schedules for the 
proprietaries which actually do business (i.e., excluding 
"notionals.") 
Then, there is the question of the program impact of propri­
etaries. Table I indicates that proprietaries in fact have been 
heavily involved in CIA intelligence collection and covert action. 
None of this is shown in the CIA budget submission. Yet a bona­
fide policy review of the budget requires programmatic judgments 
of the necessity and appropriate use of proprietaries in· overseas 
areas. 
The Angolan. question has brought into sharp focus the role 
of the CIA's Contingency Reserve. All U.S. aid to forces in 
Angola came from this fund. The only place in the budgets of CIA 
where proprietaries have taken on even a limited visibility is in 
those years when supplemental financing was needed to establish or 
strengthen a proprietary. The budget then shows, tersely, that 
for a past year or for completed portions of the current years 
that Contingency Reserve drawdowns had been made for such purposes. 
For example-, one past budget showed a certain.- amount for "RFE," 
meaning a subsidy for Radio Free Europe, but providing no justifica­
tion materials. In turn, this practice reflects the unwritten, 
post-hoc nature of the Contingency Reserve financing process -- in
