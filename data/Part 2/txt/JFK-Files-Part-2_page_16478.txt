power structure, which is prepared not only to combat the 
resistance of.the people with n1assivc brutality, but to 
totally annihilate the bl'ack conununily, the black pop;Jla­

I£ it-is learned by the power structure that black peo-
ple have "x" an1ount o! guns in their possession, this will 
not stiinulate the puwer structure to prepare itself with 
guns, because it is already n1ore than prepared.
