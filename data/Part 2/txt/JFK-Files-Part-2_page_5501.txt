RE: Foreign Government Liaison 
Dear John: 
' 
This morning, Jack Tunheim, Phil Golrick, and I met with Kenneth Duncan and several 
State Department representatives regarding how best to implement the JFK Act as to 
information obtained from foreign governments through liaiso11-channels. We had a 
very constructive discussion of the affirmative role the State Department could play ·in 
encouraging foreign governments, through appropriate diplomatic channels, to agree to 
the release of such information pursuant to the JFK Act. Tlte Review Board believes 
that Section 10(b)(2) of the JFK Act contemplates that the State Department play 
precisely suc:h a role. 
As for now, we will hold in abeyance requests for evidence on foreign liaisdn 
postp6nements to which ·the FBI has not yet responded. This will give us the 
opportunity in~e near future to work with the State Department and the FBI to • 
establish orderly procedures to persuade the foreign governments in question that it is 
in our countries' mutual interests to release liaison information in assassination records. . . . 
Until such procedures are in place, we request that the FBI not make further contact 
with foreign law-enforcement or other government officials regarding the release of 
liaison information in assassination records.
