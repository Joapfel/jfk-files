cussed, nor did he pu~~ort to have higher 
authority to do it. \~•~onne-13, 6/9/75, p. 15.)

I then left his office, and I went back to 
Mr. Bissell's office and I told him in no 
way would I have any part in the assassina­

absolute terms that I would not be involved 
in a murder attempt. f'Donnel~ 9/11/75, p. 43.)
