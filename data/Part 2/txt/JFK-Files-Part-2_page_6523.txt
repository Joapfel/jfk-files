While we 1-er~ur with the paper prepared by the. 
Department of State, we do not believe that the proposals contained 
therein present a sufficiently wide- spectrum· of options or activities 
to impede and s~ .Caatro/Comm.mdst subversion in Latin America. 
Specifically, we recommend the following additi_onal actions: 
(1) Measures to attrit Cuban resources: 
(a) Purchase the clefe-ctiOD of persomi.el, . . :.:. _.,. ... -, ... _. -
aircraft, ships, boats and other valuable items. 
(b) Conduct non-attributable actions -against 
• " • . . 
petroleum resources, opon which much of Cuba's economy depends. 
These- actions -should extend all the way from. direct destruction to 
sabotage- through chemical and bacterial contarnina+ion of carriers 
and storage. 
(c) By means of intelligence indications (aircraft 
fiights, agents, clear radio transmission, beach jwnpers) cause Cuban 
military force-s to stand continually at high al8'l't level and thus·. to 
conswne- supplies which could otherwise be dedicated to subversive 
training. 
(d) Consider introducti~ of counterf~it currency 
, 
. in large quantities, to distort the Cuban .financial posture, and to 
unden¢ne confidence.
