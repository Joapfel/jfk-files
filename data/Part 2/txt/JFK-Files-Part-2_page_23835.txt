proprietaries appeared in the budget presentation. They have 
been hidden, and the object is to identify them in the·budget 
as a line item, fo~ example~ 
Mr. Maxwell. One suggestion might be, be listed, that 
implies a list of proprietaries. 
Senator Huddleston. Where does this list go? 
Mr. Kirbow. What you want to do is to require them to 
include a discussion of the proprietaries in his annual report 
to the oversight committee is.what you want to do, isn't 
it, ·because they don't have that now. They don't report to 
the Armed services.:.Committee. They only report to Appropriatio s 
Senator Huddleston. How would it be listed.in the budget 
under your proposition here, Joe? 
Mr. diGenova. Well, I'm just assuming -- well, I am 
assuming in terms of oversight the· Committee is going to want 
to know, even though this is not going to be published,. where 
this money is going and what, it is goin.g to'be used for, 
if they are going to authorize it. 
Mr. Aaron. I think the term really should be 
Mr. Kirbow. I think it ought to be more than in the 
budget. 
Mr. diGenova. I know that's not· just what they are going
