educational purposes only and present · solely the personal-, 
academic views of the individual authors. The final 
responsibility for accepting or rejecting an article rests 
with the Board. Its criterion for publication is whether 
the article makes a contribution to the literature of 
intelligence. Articles submitted to Studies are not 
" required to be coordinated through channels and, indeed, are 
not vetted through management by either the Board or the 
author. In addition to senior Agency officers, the Board 
also has membership representing other agencies of the 
Intelligence Community.
