you the Central 
Intelligence Agency? 
Mr. nundy. I had a brother who worked for many years in 
the Central Intelligence Agency. I occasionally talked with 
members of the Agency during the forties and the fifties, both 
about substantive questions of what one thought about the 
conditions in the Soviet Union, and occasion.ally also about 
efforts that they were then making to recruit talented 
graduates of colleges. 
Mr. Schwarz. ,You ~enti~ned your brother. To put some­
thing of a different ~ind in the record than we have gotten 
recently, would you recount the position taken by l\llan Dulles 
in connection with the problem that your brother had in the 
1950's. 
Mr. Bundy. Well, my brother came under attack from 
Senator Joseph McCarthy. And the grou~d WJS, as I recall 
it, in general that he had been a friend and supporter of 
Alger Iliss and was therefore not to be trusted in a place 
as sensitive as the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Allan Dulles -- and my impression is that this was 
quite characteristic of him -- took an extremely firm stand 
on this matter, and stood by his estimate that my brother was 
in fDct in no sense a security risk, rather, to the con-
trary. And the defense was successful, and my hrothcr 
continued in the Central Intelligence Agency until the Kennedy
