has happened to the a_1rcraft instead or the US trying to 
"sell" the incident. 
9. It is possible to create an incident which will make it 
appear that Communist Cuban MIGs have destroyed a USAF aircraft 
over international waters in an unprovoked attack. 
a. ·.Approximately 4 or 5 P-101 aircraft will be dispatched 
in trail from Homestead APB. PlOl'ida. to the vicinity of Cuba. 
Their mission-:will be to reverse course and simulate fakir 
airol'aft for an air defense exercise in southern Florida~ 
These aircraft would conduct variations of these flights at. 
frequent intel'V'~s. Crews would be briefed to remain at 
least ·12 miles oft the CUban coast; however. they would·be 
required to· carry live mnmunition in the event that hostile 
actions were taken by the Cuban MIGs. 
b. on one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly 
tail-end Charley at considerable interval between aircraft. 
While neal' the Cuban Island this pilot would broadcast that 
he had been Jumped by MIGs and was going down. No other 
calls would be made. The pilot would then fly cH.z:ectl.y 
west at extremely low altitude and land at a secure -base, an 
Eglin awd.liaey. The aircraft would be met by the proper - • 
people, quickly stored and given a new tail number. The 
pilot who bad performed the mission Ullder an alias •. would 
resume his proper identity and return to his normal place 
ot _business. The pilot and aircraft would then have 
disappeared. 
c. At precisely the same.time that .the aircraft was' 
presumably shot down~ submarine or small surface craft· 
would disburse P-101 parts. paracm.1te. etc .• at approximately 
15 to 20 miles ott the Cuban coast and depal't. The pilots 
re~ to Homestead would have a true story as tar as 
they lmew. Search ships· and aircraft coula b.e dispatched
