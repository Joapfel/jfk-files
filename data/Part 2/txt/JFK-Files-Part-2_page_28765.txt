THE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20220 
Hon Louis B. Stokes 
Chairman 
May 27, 1977 
Select Committee on. Assassinations 
U.S. House of Representatives 
Washington; D~ C. 20515

time. In other words, I was attempting to clear the date of 
May 23 as a starting date for the new employment. 
At that time, Mr. Howarth advised that I had been terminated
