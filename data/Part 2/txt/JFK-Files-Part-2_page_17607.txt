ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION PVD: dkP/4-14-7 5 
Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division 
concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to 
counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the 
Legal Counsel Division has the following observations: 
j{, (1) Based on our analysis and conversations this 
Pl.#-;/.l'•'\isr.I)ivision has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it 
,:pr·111111,ffeippears that the information contained in this memorandum may be 
t,o1tr·...- classified confidential under Executive order 11652. 
f4 (2) Before making any determination as to whether we 
make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it 
would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to 
such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be 
consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted 
Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested 
he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is. 
(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast 
position that this information not be made available to the Committee or 
that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for 
this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such 
as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the 
Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.
