Dear' Mr. Wallach: 
As decided in our phone conversation today, I am 
writing to you about a convcrs,i.ti.on I had last week in • 
Paris with an official of the Royal Government of Cambodia. 
He informed me that CIA-directed activities hostile to his 
government nre presently occurring in his country, .:ind that 
these activities are being launched from bases i:1 Thailaad. 
I would greatly appreciate your assistance in finding out for 
me whether any agency of the U.S. Government is presently 
carrying out activities against the Royal Government of 
Cambodia. 
I greatly appreciated the op~ortunity to talk with 
you in person recently, and thank you for your interest 
and help.
