tol;i=ie-New York Office in 1963 what he interpreted as a recruit­

concerning his association with KGB officers in Moscow. /}here 
is no ii1for111a tion in Jaffe 1 s file that he was ever reported 0~1 
by Col. Penkovskiy, as Jaffe reportedly has claimed]_. During 
the interviews with Jaffe, he denied any overt actITielpful 
to the KGB, although he admitted a continuing relationship wi .. h 
l 
several KGB officers·. Both the New York and Washington Field 
Off ices came .to the conclusion ttia.t Jaffe was a KGB agent whi _e 
in Mosco,v, but that there was doubt as to ,vhether he continued 
in that role after he was expelled. . . • . . 
• Our relations wi•th Jaffe were tempered byf&_mroy' s3 II-~ 
allegation, and Bureau Agents in contact with him were circum-1'\ 
spect in any dealings with him thereafter. Jaffe very liltely 
detected a clrnnge in the Agents' ·attitude which accounts for' 
his st;:t tement thn t he felt his relationship with them had 
cooled off. 
There is 110 evidence contained in Jaffe's file that 
either New York or Washington Field or the Bureau has ever taken 
.auy action which would affe<?t Jaffe' s· livelihood. Following 
his return from Hong Kong, Jaffe to.Id his handling Agents thnt 
he was e;~periencing difficulty in finding a job, He several 
times mentioned his conc~r11 that 1~1s associatio11 with the FBI 
might be the rPasou. On each occasion, he was assured that 
the FBI had never divu.lgc::d his confidential rcla tionship and
