individuals are presently active or inactive." This

CIA-5 -- Queries About Some Information

CIA-6 -- Request for Systematic Review of Traffic 
(U) This request was dated September 1995 and was 
for "the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and 
dispatches for ... September 26, 1963 through October 
20, ,1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30, 
1963 between": .. Mexico City and Headquarters and 
Mexico City and JMWAVE . 
.. 
(C} The DO provided a classified response in 
January 1998. All cable traffic and dispatches for the 
period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and 
N"ovember 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between: 
, , (a) the Mexico city Station and Headquarters, and (B) 
the Mexico City Station and JMWAVE are not available as 
a chronological collection. The Office of 
Communications (OC) only held cables long enough to 
ensure that they were successfully transmitted to the 
recipient. Because processes and resources to perform 
cleanup activity varies, cables were sometimes held for 
longer periods but not with the intention of becoming a 
long-term reference collection. The offices of record 
for the origination of cable traffic and dispatches did 
not create files in this manner. The desks maintained 
a temporary paper cable chrono. These were not usually 
retained for more than 90 days. There is no electronic 
repository for cables and dispatches from the stations. 
Cables were printed out and went into specific files 
dealing with subjects or operations. Accordingly, it 
is not possible to recreate as a collection all of the 
requested cables and dispatches.
