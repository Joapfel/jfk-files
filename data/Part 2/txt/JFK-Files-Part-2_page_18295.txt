ADDENDUM:. LEG:A.I; COUNSEL. DIVISTON PVD: lad • '8'/26 / 7 5 
On 8/25/75, SA Daly determined from Michael 
Epstein of the Senate Select Committee that this 
particular interview was not considered an "abuse" 
interview and if the Bureau so desired, they could have 
a representative present during the interview. Accord­
ingly, Recommendation #2 in this memorandum should be 
changed to show that an Agent may, in fact, be present.
