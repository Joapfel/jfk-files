(i) Dulles' January 1960 Statement to the Special 
Group Suggesting Contingency Plans for the Overthrow of the 
Casto Government, but Ruling Out "Elimination" of Castro.. 
January 13, 1960, Allen Dulles, in what was apparently 
the first Special Group discussion of a covert program to over­
throw Castro, emphasized that "a quick elimination of Castro" 
was not contemplated by the CIA (minutes of Special Group meet­

first "noted the possibility that over the long run the U.S. 
will not be able to tolerate the Cas.tro regime in Cuba, and sug­
gested that covert contingency planning to accomplish-the fall 
of the Castro government might be in order." Then, in response 
to the State Department representative's comment that "timing

"emphasized that we do not have in mind a quick 
elimination of Castro, but rather actions designed

foothold." 
(ii) Dulles' Alleged Recission of the July 1960 
Airplane Assassination Plan Upon Learning of It. 
As discussed in greater detail above (seep. ___ ), 
in July, 1960, Tracy Barnes, Bissell's assistant, approved the 
sending of, in July, 19&0, a cable to the Havana station stating 
that "possible removal of top three leaders_ (was) receiving 
serious consideration," and instructions were giveh to carry out 
a plan to kill Ra~l Castro. That plan was, hqwever, abandoRed 
shortly after it had been approved.
