that Senator DODD v;c::.s a r.,~mber of ~=he S,-:!nate Ihte::-n2.l

FPCC. 
The December 27) 1963, edition of "The lfaw Yo:."'k 
World Telegr2.m and Sun 11 newspaper stated tha-:: the :µro-Castro 
FPCC was see~i~g to go out of business ~nd t~at its prime 
activity dur:.i_r:~ its lif P.time· had b2en sponso:t•ship of pro­
Castro street rallies a:1.d mass picket lines, and the direction 
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to­
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of lif~ was 
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion, 
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing 
by Castro I s United Nations Delegation, ,::;,nd ultimately, the 
bad publicity whicj the FPCC received from disclosure of 
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin 
_LEE H. OSWALD. 
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned 
second source advised that V. 'I'. L:C:E had recently rei::n-=irked 
that the FPCC.was dead and that there were no plans to 
organize another similar organization. 
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that 
there had not been any F?CC activity in many months and that 
the FPCC had been dissolved.
