Operation Mongoose 
Cub a r.____,,-
CCURRENCE: With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale' s memorandlilll to SC',A dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on 
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lans<lale's memorandum conccmin~ a report for the CIA which he , 
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to 
a telephonic- conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever 
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference mcmorandu. ~1 
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandlilll. 
During t)lis conversation the1--e_w,as_no discussion of previous operations except a hrief 
discussion of the CORRA and1-P.$ffl'®nlil![O,. teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's 
recollection, any specific lqt1est:ions concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the t1mr STAPF. 
of the Matahambre operation.·- •
