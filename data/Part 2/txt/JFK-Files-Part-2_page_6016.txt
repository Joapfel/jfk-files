SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
(S) A name trace was run. The resultant 
information was included in an IMS/ESG/HCS 
"clarification memo" for the ARRB. The text, which was 
classified "Secret," reads as follows: 
"Oswald LeWinter is a naturalized US citizen and 
a man of at least four other names -- George 
Mearah, Oscar LeWinter, Razin LeWinter, and 
Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the 
East German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never­
had any official affiliation with LeWinter. 
LeWinter was the subject of an Agency "burn 
notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the 
intelligence community. In tnis case, the alert 
advised that LeWinter was an intelligence 
swindler, peddler, and fabricator. (C} 
CIA has a r~port of an episode involving an 
intelligence fabricator and convicted drug 
dealer Oswald LeWinter, AKA George Mearah, born 
2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1990, 
a CIA representative overseas reported that 
LeWinter, using the name of George Mearah, 
contacted him and offered to put high-level GDR 
officials wishing to defect in touch with our 
representative and in turn the CIA. This 
contact.would be in exchange for help and a 
presidential pardon that would wipe the slate 
clean and leave LeWinter (Mearah} without a 
record as a convicted felon. LeWinter (Mearah} 
claimed this was important [because] he was 
married (for the third time} and starting a new 
life; he was reportedly considering quietly 
acquiring Israeli citizenship. This contact was 
not followed up because of the "burn notice." 
CXA-IR-30 -- Cherepanov Papers 
(U) This undated and undocumented request from the 
ARRB was derived from a passage in the book Molehunter 
(pp. 121-123) r~gatding the Cherepanov papers.
