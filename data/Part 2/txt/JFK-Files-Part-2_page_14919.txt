UNKNOWN SUBJECT 
RICHARD KENNETH KAUFMAN-VICTIM 
EXTORTION, 5-26-60 
Richard Kaufman, a student at Syracuse University, 
New York ,and son of Federal Judge Irving Kaufman, who 
presided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums, on 
3-1-60, received an anonymous threatening phone call. The 
unknown caller made reference to victim's father and threatened 
"Just wait until we get hold of you.n Kaufman received another 
call of a similar nature on 'l-4-60 and on 4-5-60 received the 
first of 4 threatening letters, all postmarked Syracus~, 
New York. The last of these communications bore an April 12, 
1960, date. 
AUSA Kenneth Ray of the Northern District of New York, 
has indicated letters coupled with previous phone calls 
constituted a violation of the Federal Extortion Statute and 
his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960. 
Extensive investigation has been conducted by our 
Albany Office in an effort to identify and loc~te the extortion­
ist. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and 
no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the 
• fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty 
I 
members, and advisors of the vietim that he prepared the 
communications· ia question. While no direct evidence cor­
roborating- these rumors has been uncovered, writing paper and 
envelopes similar to that used in one of the communications 
found in the victim's room. 
The Department has requested copies of all investig·a-
\ 
tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the 
• facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will 
be disseminated to the Department. •
