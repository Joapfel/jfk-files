• •• • • ' FINAL REPORT OF THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD 
Section B includes a discussion of the "Rule 
of Reason" that the Review Board ultimately 
adopted with regard to receiving evidence 
from the age.ncies. 
c. JFK Act requires the Review Board to 
balance evidence for postponement against 
public interest in release. 
Assuming that agencies did provide clear 
and convincing evidence that information 
should be protected from disclosure, the 
terms of section 6 required that information 
not be postponed unless the threat of harm 
outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 
As used in the JFK Act, "public interest" 
means "the compelling interest in the prompt 
public disclosure of assassination records for 
historical and governmental purposes and. 
for the purpose of fully informing the Amer­
ican people about the history surrounding 
the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy."20 The Review Board interpreted 
the balancing requirement to mean that agen­
cies had to provide the Review Board with 
clear and convincing evidence of the threat of 
harm that would result from disclosure. 
However, to the extent that the JFK Act left 
room for discretion in evaluating the histori­
cal significan~e, or public interest, of particu­
lar assassination records, it was the Review 
Board-not the agency that originated the 
document-that was to exercise this discre­
tion. The burden was on the agencies to make 
the case for postponement, not to judge the 
level of public interest in a particular docu- • 
ment. The JFK Act established the Review 
Board as a panel of independent citizens with 
expertise as historians and archivists pre­
cisely in order to secure public confidence in 
such determinations. 21 
d. Segregability and substitute language. 
When the Review Board determined that the 
risk of harm did outweigh the public interest 
in disclosure, it then had to take two addi­
tional steps: (1) ensure that the agency 
redacted the least amount of information 
possible to avoid the stated harm, or "segre­
gate" the postponed information, and {2} 
provide substitute language to take the place 
of the redaction.

3. Federal Agency Record Groups and 
the Standards Applied to Them. 
The JFK Act defines "assassination records" 
to include records related to the assassination 
of President Kennedy that were "created or 
made available for use by, obtained by, or 
otherwise came into the possession of" the 
following groups: the Warren Commission, 
the four congressional committees that inves­
tigated the assassination, any office of the 
federal government, and any state or local 
law enforcement office that assisted in a fed­
eral investigation of the assassination. 22 
When it passed the JFK Act, Congress 
intended for the JFK Collection to include the 
record groups that it identified in section 
3(2), but it also intended for the Review 
Board to consider carefully the scope of the 
term "assassination record" and to issue an 
interpretive regulation defining this crucial 
term.23 The Act requires government agencies 
to identify, organize, and process those assas­
sination records that are defined as assassi­
nation records in section 3(2). Chapter 6 of 
this report explains. how the Review Board 
interpreted its responsibility to define and 
seek out "additional records and informa­
tion." Set forth below is a description of some 
of the core government holdings on the 
assassination which were released under the 
standards of the Review Board. 
a.,:{he FBI's "core and related" files. 
The FBI's "core and related" files consist·ol 
those rkords that the FBI gathe:...,ecf in 
response to\fOIA reques.ts that it re(:eived in 
the 1970s for records relating to the assassi­
nation of President Kennedy. The "core" files 
include the FBI files on Lee Harvey Oswald 
and Jack Ruby, as well as the FBI's Warren 
~o~issi~n ~es an~~e JFK a~sas~ination 
investigation file. ~· •~lated" files include 
FBI files on Lee·1·'Harvey Oswald's wife 
Marina and Dtother MarguE:?rite, Oswald's 
friend George DeMohrenscltµ.dt, and the 
Oswalds' ,L>allas friends Ruth ~d Michael 
Paine .. Jli~ FBI began its proce;~~g of the 
core .~d related files in 1993. Thei\§:~view 
Bo,afd applied strict standards to its revi~~ of 
postponements in the core and related fires.
