(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
sums made available to the Agency by appropria­
tion or otherwise may be expended for purposes 
necessary to carry out its functions, including 
(1) personal services, including personal 
services without regard to limitations on 
types of persons to be employed, .... 
* * * * 
(b) The sums made available to the Agency may be 
expended without regard to the provisions of law 
and regulations relating to the expenditure of 
Government funds; and for objects of a confiden­
tial, extraordinary, or emergency nature, such 
expenditures to be accounted for solely on the 
certificate of the Director and every such certi­
ficate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher for 
the amount therein certified. 
It is my opinion that this authority permits the Agency 
to continue the two practices as set out above without 
fear of violation of the Anti-Pinkerton Statute. 
He closed, however, with the following admonitions: 
There are, of course, other dimensions to the question 
you raise. As a matter of policy I believe the prac­
tices should be· reviewed at the highest levels within 
the Agency and, perhaps, cleared with the Agency
1
s 
oversight committees. In addition, if one of these 
relationships became public, it must be recognized 
that there will be allegations that the law has been 
violated. On balance, it is my view that these consi­
derations are not so significant as to warrant a termi­
nation of the two practices with the three companies._ 
It is suggested, however, that any subsequent, projected 
association with a detective company or private investi­
gative company beyond the three present companies be 
reviewed with this Office prior to its ·initiation.
