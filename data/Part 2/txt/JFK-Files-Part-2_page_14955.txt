DOMINICAN SITUATION 
The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by 
the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used 
• in pre.venting communists from gaining control in that country. , 
We set up a staff of ten Agents. In August, 1966, at White· 
House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache 
office there, staffed with three Agents. 
. The six-month-old government under Joaquin Balaguer 
has brought abput a degree of stability. Nevertheless, there 
continue to be strong undercurrents of dissension. The 
rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer. 
Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election, 
has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs. 
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension 
but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup 
as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo 
Domingo, which began January 9, 1967; has attracted strong 
communist support and has served as a rallying point for the 
extreme leftists. Within two days, seventy perc~nt of the 
students in secondary schools had joined the strike. 
This is but one of numerous problems which beset 
Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one 
head on.
