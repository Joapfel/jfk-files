This memorandum recommends tha~~f.e attac~d 
draft of a paper pr~_~red by CIA entitled,~Ambiguities and 
~he_~~~4 " oe-rev1ewed bythe-Legal Counsel Division for comment 
and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI 
in future meetings with legal representatives from other u. s. 
Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments. The purpose 
of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes in 
existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby 
as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate 
Select Committee for their consideration. .<-. 
At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on ~(-_ ./~ 
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27 /75, a , , ..... 
draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed 
,.. i.l. to all members. This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of 
t,~ ~ CIA. It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence 
~1 ).t Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be 
~ changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary 
~a to clarify for the Congress and the American people the authori-
~ ~ ~ ties, the 1 imitations and miss ions of various member agencies

In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the 
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the 
paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered 
a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives 
of each agency or department of USIB review the document and 
submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency 
code 143, extension 4055. Following the receipt of such conpnents 
from the legal off ices of member·· agencies and departments, it 
was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to • 
begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community 
which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or 
proposals for new legislation_. ~::e: "!!;.:, .......;..iiA ~ " ,r:'} _
