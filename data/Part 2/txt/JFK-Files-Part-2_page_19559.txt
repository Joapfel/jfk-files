Thls report stated that public assistance grants in 
Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and 
12% ratable reductions, l. P •e 40% below the m1ri.imu,'!l 
standards for health and decency. Speaking of child 
welfare needs, the report sa1d: 11There 1s an excessive 
and 1ncreas1ng rate of referral of children to the 
Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency. 
There is an excessive and increasing trend for children 
to be removed from their natural families ond cared 
for ~lsewhere. 11 
WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS? 
The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967 
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring it's 
pricing stondnrd's up to 1967 levels. 
New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances 
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increase 
an average of 10-3/4%~Jn King County the total increase was 16%. 
Thus, Klng County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964, 
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are st1 
17% less than acceptable levels. 
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of 
two adu~ts, a boy 1.3, and a girl 8, is J285.80 a 
month--~3,429 a year. But recent changes 1n the 
Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even 
this figure. The local welfare officials will not 
offer any guess os to wh0.t f1'l.:T hnppcn ne:,:t,, NEW RATABLE 
REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. 
There 1s much tnlk of getting people off welfare by putting them to 
work. Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs fro 
$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.
