we referred to our ta~} in '59.and he said another talk might

be possible and useful:at this time, ind that was the first real . I , •

citizen but a government official and we agreed that the 
current situation was different, at the same time, things were 
a bit abnormal and he said the Cubans were very much annoyed at 
the-exile rate, the CIA rate on Cuba, as well as the freezing 
of their assets. 
The next step was my visit to Washinqton on September 24th 
when I came down to see Robert_Kennedy who was then Attorney 
General. His position was -- I showed him the memoranda, which 
I had prepared on what had happened up to that point. He said 
that a trip to Cuba which is what LaChug~ had suggested would 
be rather risky, said 1it was bound to leak and said it might 
result in some kind of Congressional inves~igation _or something.

Averell Harriman and Bundy about it. 
At that point, La~huga said he would be making a very 
violently anti-American speech.on November 7th and not to worry 
too much about it, so Stevenson asked me to help prepare a spee 
in raply. On the 27th of Saptember, I saw Lechuga again, told im 
I could not aecept any invitation to come to Guba, but I would 
be glad to keep in touch with him ~nd he could talk with 
_ anyone who wanted to come up and he said he would notify Havann.
