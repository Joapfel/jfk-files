c. Now the Peasant Party, one 
of the three in the.coalition, has 
voted to pull out, and probably will 
do so as soon as Inonu gets back from 
Washington. Another partner, the 
Turkey Party, has wanted to pull out, 
and apparently has stayed in only 
because of pressure from the.military. 
d. A new coalition is at least 
a theoretical possibilit~ with a 
number of independents taking the 
place of the Peasant Party, but 
Inonu probably would not be prime 
minister. 
e. The military are working 
for an all-party coalition. This 
way, they feel, they could keep 
tabs on the Justice Party, but the 
Justice Party is not likely to buy 
this arrangement. • 
f. As matters now stand, the 
military would take over the govern­
ment itself before it would let the 
Justice Party form one. 
a. Soviet President Brezhnev 
has told the Iran,ian prime minister 
that the decision to buy wheat abroad 
was taken to avoid lowering reserves, 
which he has described as ample for 
one or two years. We think the sit­
uation is more serious than that.
