Fleming. 
Senator Baker. I think that is right. But I think it:.· 
is important for us, Mr. Bundy, to try to establish, as the 
Chairman said, the range of available information or evi-
dence that sheds .,some light on the three alternative possi­
bilities, and the type of things that the President interested 
h:Lmself in is terribly important in that respect. 
I believe that you said you had no.information or no 
recollection of what particular situation, or what other 
deals that were made he was interested in. 
Mr. Bundy. I will put it more concretely than that. 
The President said, can't we do something more about Cuba? 
Why don't you get ahold of these people who are dealing with 
this and see if they can't do better, and pass the word 
that I am interested, that kind of thing. 
Senator Baker. Do I understand that to mean tha·t he never 
spoke of a particular practice? 
Mr. Bundy. I can't tell you that, because I know, the 
record indeed reminds me, that particular actions that are 
related to Cuba that came up through the group of ten 
went to him, and some were approved and some were not." 
So, he clearly looked at them. 
I would have to have the documents there in order to 
25 be precise, and I don't have them with me.
