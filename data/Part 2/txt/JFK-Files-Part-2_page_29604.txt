_ information and com~leted the appropriate 
application form; ard the declarant, ad~ 
mittedly exceeding ter responsibilities, 
informally telephoned the Russian.Consulate, 
with the intention cf doing what she could 
to facilitate issuarce of the Russian visa 
to Lee Harvey Oswalc. However, they told 
her that there woulc be a delay of about 
four months.in processing the cas~, which 
·annoyed the applicart since, according to 
his statement, he wcs in a great hurry to 
obtain visas that wculd enable him to travel 
to Russia, insistin~ on his right to do so 
in view of his back~round and his loyalty 
and his.activities ifl behalf of the Cuban 
movement. The declcrant was unable to re-

telling him that "if it were up to him, he

and t~e other~ that he had to oet to Russ.1a
