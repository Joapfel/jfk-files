Volume I Undated to September 1960 
1-:- Cable suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife 
and children from CIA rather than through the FRD IDey' pay large future 
dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960. 
2. Cable to Director 
From: MASH 
19 September 1960 
Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by 
KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY. 
Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be 
noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with 
no apparent difficu1ties. 
CHIBAS' sources of information: 
Mason in u. s. government 
Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives 
Nino Diaz as Alianza representative 
Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative. 
This should get a good picture of the u.s. anti-Castro activities. 
3. Sum!Der 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member. 
-:t-CIA considered him an important political asset. RAU.CHIBAS, Ray's 
assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization 
inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with 
Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to 
Ray and would check with him.

5. September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WH9 indicates MASH somewhat
