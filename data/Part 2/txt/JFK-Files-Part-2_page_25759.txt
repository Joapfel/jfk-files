It the plan works, ,this'. 
would represent a satis~ 
tactory solution of·the 
CUbaD problem, especially 
i:f the Soviet presence • 
could thereby be eliminated.

Disadvantages

,, 
1' 
a. As plan al.most:: sure not 
to work, it would have grave 
consequences throughout 
Latin America as well as 
serious. domestic political 
repercussion11 • 
. 
b. Even if plan ultimately 
successful there would 
be short term domestic 
political losses and 
short term weakening 
U.S. position ill Latin 
America. • 
2. Do nothing. No spe<:ii'ic efforts will be made 
to arrange a rapprochement with Fidel but we would . 
remain receptive to any;advances made by him. No 
covert operations would·be undertaken and intelligence 
operations would not include black maritime operations 
into CUba. It would be hoped that Fidel, recognizing 
the good faith and good.will of the new Administration, 
would make his own adva.t1ces leading towards a sat,is-
factory detente. • 
Advantages 
As in 1. above. 
Disadvantages 
a. Aa in l. above but less 
short term domestic and 
Latin American losses. 
b. Even less chance of 
success. 
3. The present level of intelligence operations, 
includin - over a wou d e continued. B1ack 
mar n trat ona a trat ons o agent:s and 
caches of intelligence gear would continue but no action 
operation.a would be conducted. We would be "keeJ>'.ing an 
eye on" J'idel both in Cuba and abroad but would be making 
no af:f~rt to hinder his internal development. . ,.
