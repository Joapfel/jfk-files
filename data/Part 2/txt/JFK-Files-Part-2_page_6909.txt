the public can continue to use the Freedom of Information Act to 
request from the agencies documents related to the assassination. 
Mr. Chairman, this Resolution may appear complicated, but the 
matter of disclosure is itself complicated. It cannot be 
accomplished arbitrarily or summarily. The process established by 
toe Resolution, in my view, is logical and takes account of all 
the interests and equities in the disclosure of these documents. 
In the end, I think it will result in all of the pertinent 
information pertaining to the assassination of President Kennedy 
being made public in a prompt and orderly way, and, in doing so, 
will help restore confidence among the public in our Government. 
Since the Joint Resolution was introduced, comments have been 
received fro"in the- Justice Depa·rtment as well as others suggesting 
the need f6r change. 
With regard to the reaction of the Justice Department, I must 
say I found it very unfortunate that the Depa~tment chose to take 
" what I found to be an extreme, hard-line po~ition in opposing many 
of the key provisions of the Resolution. Rather than showing the 
flexibility needed in this unique circumstance to deal 
cooperatively with the Congress on a matter that is a serious 
concern for many Americans, the Justice Department chose to 
reassert familiar claims of Executive privilege and all of the 
other reasons asserted over the ¥ears to block the release of 
government information.
