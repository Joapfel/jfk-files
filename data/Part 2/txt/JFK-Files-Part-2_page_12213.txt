Execution of party questionnaires] 
a. Informants, :particularly in Commu·nist Party~ ofJ&t:i.mes must execute 
"Party" questionnaires and in doing so should b· instraoted to be

b. If necessary, each item in questionnaire should be discussed with 
infor~ant ·to be certain his identity as informant is pr·oteo·ted. 
Informant's ac·i;ivity in organizations] 
a. Informants in organizations must be impressed with necessity of 
carrying on normal activity, such as canvassing, sale~ and itis­
tribu.tion. of literature, leaflets, eto.

from leaders; request instruction and interpretation of th~ organiza­
tion's precepts; request leaders to fur~ish source· for study 
purposes; and enter discussions, no·!; quietly sit b,·.11c as observers .. 
o. Changes in the organization's conduct!, polioy 1 or ~~rategy shou~d 
be reported on as they occur. Rave informants give thf.. :.r opin:i , ... ,s 
of the motivation behind such changes, bu.-'i; be cer·hain o , nions ·· d 
suggestions given are labeled as such. 
d. Informants must be encouraged to increase contacts wi thi ,. thei •

.Action by informant ·when uncovered: . 
a. If infor·mant is uncovered by subversive elements, .he s:b.ould be

informant acti vi·!iy.

to baok it up and by bluffing inf ,·~ant may confuse the iss: 
the point nhere his services may net be lost. This proceduz JUld 
be carefully handled and each situation considered on its me -~. 
o. In some cases it may be necessary for informant to acquiesce o 
charges of de,iation :from the strict discipline cf the organization 
involved:; as 'by so doing he may cast off suspicion •.
