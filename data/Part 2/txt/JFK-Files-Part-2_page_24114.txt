need for proprietaries has declined as a result of a g~neral shift in 
emphasis away'from covert action; transfer of Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty to the Board of International Broadcasting with funding 
through State Department; continuing liquidation of the assets of the 
Air America complex as requirements for CIA support in Southeast Asia 
have diminished; the sale of Southern Air Transport and the continuing 
liquidation of assets of Intermountain Aviation with their exposure 
in the press and the decreased need for contingency air capabilities. 
The evidence establishes that activities of all proprietaries, 
directly or indirectly, support the Agency's foreign intelligence collectio: 
or covert action missions. Some of these proprietaries are located 
within the United States for reasons of operational or administrative 
necessity, but their ultimate impact is overseas. Some of the question­
able domestic uses of these entities is dealt with in the sections of 
the Report on "Chaos" and related programs. And in one area, MHMUTUAL, 
serious questions .remain as to the propriety of using such a mechanism 
to provide insurance and retirement benefits. This problem is detailed 
later. (See Section VIII). 
A. Oeerating Proprietaries 
As discussed in greater detail later, operating proprietaries 
conduct business in the commercial sphere, but they are not in direct 
competititon with privately owned corporations to such a degree as to 
deprive the private companies of legitimate income. There is no doubt, 
however, that they were and are in competition. The Agency has been 
careful to limit the amount of commercial business engaged in by these 
proprietaries to only that necessary to support the viability of the 
commercial cover and keep it alive in the commercial world. Revenues
