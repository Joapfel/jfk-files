February of '7& and it's called the Bush paper. It wasn't. I 
mean, Bush couldn't possibly, even with his staff, have written 
a new Executive Order in the couple of weeks that he was in the 
office. It had to be the one that was prepared by Colby and 
his staff or his staff officers. So that was basically the 
order .that came out in '76 with a Bill Colby related order, an 
attempt to do something. But again, why should the White House 
and all of it's parts gone out of its way to work with a guy 
they weren't sure of? Now when Bush took over in '76 it's a 
different story. But by-that time the damage had been done. 
It was 
1
75 when the damage was done, not '76, because by '76 
the Hearings had died down, the coverage had died down, and it 
was only starting to come up again when they started to show 
these green books and the reports and the Hearings anct by that 
time it was the middle of '76. But it doesn't take long to 
destroy an Intelligence Community. You know, boom. 
INTERVIEWER: Did you ever hear anything of the role of Mr. 
Haig? 
MR. HALPERN: Not much. Not much. At least I don't remember. 
I think by that time Al was out of town. Wasn't he in Europe 
at that time? By '76? 
INTERVIEWER: By 
1
76, he would have been. 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, he would have been in Europe by that time. 
So I don I t remember hearing ·.of Al very much.
