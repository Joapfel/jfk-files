RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of • 
New York, we· originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on 
3-30-67 and we have received no i~ormation indicating that an appointment 
has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity 
has _attended the failure· to appoint a judge for this district. 
\ '~ .

of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's 
attentio1:1 on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information 
indicating these judgeships _have been filled.

advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue 
to bring these matters to the attention of the _Attorney GeneraL
