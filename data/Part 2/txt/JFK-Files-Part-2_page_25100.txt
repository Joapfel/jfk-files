MEMOMNDUM FOR SENIOR STAFF 
SUBJECT: Ins9ccti'.m 'Jf Clnssified Dc:,cwnents at LBJ Library ReLDted t'.J 
C'Jvert J\cti·.ms J\gainst Cuba 
FROM: L'Jch J'Jhns'Jn 
A1w:mg the many d'.Jcuments which I exDmincd at the J'.Jhns'Jn Library in 
Texas thi.s v:ist week is '.Jne that I find particularly alarming. I wish 
L'J druw it t'.J y'Jur attcnti'.Jn. 
The d,JcLunent in c1uesU.'.Jn is fr'Jm the JCS t'J the Secretary of 
Defense, dated 30 OcL'.Jber 1964. The subject is a prop'.Jsed c'Jvert 
Dcb'Jn against Cuba, with the C'.Jde name SQUARE DJ\J\JCE. 
On 21 March 1964, the Jes resp'.Jnded to a Presidential request for 
new ideas relative to Cuba by advising the White H'.Juse that any neH 
pr'Jmising C'.Jurses of acti'Jn t'J undermine the Castro regime w'Juld be 
br'Jught t'J the President's attenti'.Jn. Apparently their first bright 
new idea was S1~UARE DAJ\JCE, outlined in the 30 Oct'.Jber cl'.JctlI!lent (attc1ched). 
The pr'Jp'.Jsal envisi'.Jned the destructi'.Jn 'Jf the Cuban ec'.Jn0my by intra­
ducine; aerially from 'Jff:-share a sugar cane plant parasite called 
Bunge. The program Hauld begin with D 30 per cent reductian '.Jf antici­
pated Cuban sugar pr'Jducti'.Jn (see page 6) and within three-t'J-six 
years the ruina tian of the sugar industry would be achieved. "The 
econ'.)mic and palitical. disturbances caused by this attack could be 
exacerbated and explai Led,

c·:mtirnies the JCS mema, "by such measures 
DS spreading hoCJf-ond-mauth disease amang draft animals, cantrolling 
rainfall by cloud seeding, mining canefie1~s, burning cane, and direct­
ing ather acts '.Jf canventional sabatage against the cane milling and 
transp'.Jrtation systems" (6, emphasis added). In sum, SQUARE DAJ\JCE 
"wauld furnish anather 'Jption ta the United States in bringing about 
the C'.)Llapse of the CastrCJ regime" (7). 
In Appendix A af the SQUARE DANCE propasal, the memo n'Jtes that 
the appraval f'.Jr implementation '.Jf the prac;ram "would introduce a new 
dimension into c:)ld war methods and would reqL1ire a major change in 
notiancil palir.y." Incleed it wouLd-ar at least ane hopes we have not 
used such methads befare! The propasal is nathing less thun a variant 
af germ warfare which w'.Juld have had serious C'.Jnsequences for the 
civiliin papulatian. 
At this point we da n0t knaw what happened to the SQUARE DANCE 
concept. It may never have been implemented at all, even ~ortially. 
(The covering mema written by Ba\·nnan, an J\JSC. staffer, ta Bundy suggests 
that the White House was skeptical towurd the idea.) To me, though,
