There follows a description of the disposition o~ entities 
sold or o.therwise disposed of during the referenced period. Twenty­
nine (29) of the entities were sold or given t;o witting individuals 
(former officers, employees, managers, contractors, etc.) Five (5) 
were sold or given to wit.ting individuals who had no formal rela­
tionship with the proprietary. Ten (10) proprietaries continued to 
provide goods or services to the Agency after the disposal. Thirty­
four (34) proprietaries did not continue to provide goods or services 
to the Agency after disposal. In nine (9) instances the provision 
or offer to provide goods or services were formal or informal condi-
. . 
tions of the sale or gift. In thirty-seven (37) instances this was 
not the case. Six (6) proprietaries were sold to unwitting individuals 
or organizations and thus no provision for services or goods was indi-· . 
. , ~ cated; Several miscellaneous.dispositions developed which did not 
fit neatly into any of the above·categories. For·example, there 
was one merger of an Agency proprietary with another Agency proprie­
tary. In two instances the Agency retained a non-proprietary rela­
tionship with a former employee. On two occasions the Agency turned 
over proprietaries to other government departments and on one occasion 
it sold a proprietary to another government ~epartment. There were. 
several instances where the Agency gave the assets of a proprietary 
after liquidation (books, materials, etc.) to previously uncompensated 
participants in the various ventures. On occasion, the corporate 
shells were given to attorneys in lieu of fees for dissolution. Some 
participants were permitted to retain proceeds of sales in order to 
continue the original effort of the particular proprietary. And
