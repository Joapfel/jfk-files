When asked his opinion about the truth of the testimony received 
by the Committee that poisons were delivered to the Congo by 
(co~·~~-~eb), who carried instructions that they were to be used in 
the assassination of Lumumba, Tweedy replied: 
There is nothing in my experience with the 
Agency which would really bear on that 
point whatsoever .. (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 39-39)

Tweedy added that if ~ottlieb)went to the Congo as a courier, 
"I will bet I knew it, but I don't recall it" ('I'l,eedy, 9/9, p. 35). 
Tweedy testified that it was "perfectly possible" for lethal bio­
logical substances to have been sent to the Congo, "but I don't 
recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 30). 
In response to a question about whether he knew about a cable 
C.•w from headquarters informin_g Hedgman that a messenger was to come to 
the Congo with instructions for him, Tweedy said that he would be 
"very surprised if I didn't [know], but I certainly have no recoll­
ection of it whatsoever (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 31). 
Tweedy said that he "was not going to gainsay" the testimony of 
the fhief o~ Station that a cable was sent to headquarters through 
a special channel requesting confirmation that the instructions 
were to be carried out but he did not recall it (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 
32-33). 
Tweedy commented that rather than questioning the truth of the • 
testimony of .the ~hief of) Station,* the discrepancies in their 
1,* Tweedy expressed a high regard for the general credibility of the 
\~hief ofi Station. Tweedy said that he never had occasion to doubt 
Hedgrnan •'s veracity or integrity, adding, "I would trust his Memo:ry 
and I certainly trust his integrity." (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 36)
