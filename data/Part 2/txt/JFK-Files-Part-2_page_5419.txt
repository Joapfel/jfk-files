Mexico City Station History 
The Mexico City Station History contains at least 99 separate cryptonyms, for the most part 
concerning projects, but in some cases, individuals, covering the period{1_947)o June 1969. In 
every case, there is identifying information included with the crypt, ranging from a brief 
parenthetical phrase to several pages of detail. Since the information far exceeds that thought 
relevant to the. JFK story, both in time and substance, an approach designed to provide a maximum 
amount of information and guidance for historians concerned with the JFK assassination, with a 
minimum of gratuitously useable leads for curious or hostile FOIA requestors concerning CIA 
activities generally, was chosen and is reflected in the. version the Board has for consideration. 
The norm in handling cryptonyms when the entire crypt is not released is to protect the 
digraph - the location indicator. What I've done here, to avoid unraveling, in effect, the whole 
history of Station activity for subsequent curiousity seekers, is to reverse the process, releasing the 
digraph and protecting the root - specifically because the text identifies each crypt. The Board is 
familiar with the decision to release almost all Lkrypts in full - while protecting identifying 
information. The major relevant LI projects (LIENVOY, LITEMPO, LICALLA, etc.) have had both the 
full cryptonym and most of the details released. N~ • .

in the Agency. They are very tightly controlled within the area divisions - they are not available to 
cleared employees in other directorates or, traditionally, outside of the division within the Operations 
Directorate. Thus concern about the release of the Mexico City History pages that, viewed through 
the widest of lenses, do not appear to be relevant to the JFK story ,is very great.
