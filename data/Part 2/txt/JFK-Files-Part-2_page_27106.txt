The freezer in which the toxin was found is located under one of the 
work benches in the laboratory. The Fort Detrick material was the only thing 
in the freezer and was in two one-gallon cans along with several smaller con­
tainers. There were no labels on the gallon cans, but on top of each was a 
folded piece of paper with pertinent information about the contents. This 
information provided the types and amounts of material and the date on which 
it was put into storage. The shellfish toxin was, according to this information, 
put into the freezer in February 1970, and the cobra venom, in February 1961. 
The shellfish toxin was packaged in several different forms including two 
individual doses in tablet form. 
The discovery of the material was a result of·repeated attempts by Boston 
to determine what disposition had been made of Agency BW materials held by Fort 
Detrick. In making one more check on this, he ca 11 ed Nate Gordon, a former Chief 
of the Chemistry Branch, who retired in September 1972, and asked him if he kne11 
what the disposition had been. Gordon stated that he thought that ·perhaps some 
of the shellfish toxin might not have been destroyed and was in storage in OTS. 
In following up on this lead, Boston found the material in the freezer. 
Though hard to understand, such material could in fact be stored for so long 
without anyone being a1~are of it. The laboratory is no longer used for the type 
of work for which it was originally built and had become a disordered storage 
facility. There have been no requirements for use of the freezer in the inter­
vening years and. it is indeed possible that no occasion arose to investigate the 
contents of the freezer. There have been no reported functioning difficulties 
with the freezer during this ~ntire period.
