The culmination of the Special Group discussions, 
which had taken· place with increasing frequency between 
mid-November 1960 and mid-January 1961, was the report 
of the Joint Planning Committee issued by Willauer on 
18 January 1961. The conclusions were predictable 
there were decisions that needed to be made, but these 
could not be made until the new administration became 
fully aware of the extent of the anti-Castro programs 
that had been evolving. As Willauer himself said in 
his final memo: 
In the ~bsence of these decisions, or 
at least most of them, there is a grave 
danger that the:oecernber 6 plan {updated) 
' may have to be abandoned, -as an effective 
means of overthrowing Castro without more 
overt support, and that the only practical 
course of action for ·the physical overthrol,) 
of Castro, will be either: (1) open U.S. 
war with Cuba, or (2) a.seven~month overt 
training by the.u.s. on United States soil 
of a Cuban-Latin American invasion force, 
which will be planned to strike with at 
least overt U.S. logistical support.* 38/ 
* Willauer probably meant to refer to the 8 December 
1960 plan. See pp. 173 ff.
