It was good to hear from you, to learn 
you are-still a~ the old shop; etc .. 
I got your letter yesterday in New York, 
and ,v-hi_le driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my 
subconscious would perhaps c6me out with a peal of 
a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But 
no bellsrang. 
I have only.asmall·hunch --·a piccolo-toot 
in my memory. Whoo I worked· for the shop I one e went 
to see Mr. James Benn~tt, Director of Federal Prisons, 
( with whom I had·once shared a table on an ocean 
liner, years before). You.can guess why I wanted to 
·sec Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out 
of cages. Bennett mentioned a guy ( with a questionable 
record, as fai ~she was conc~rned) who claimed to 
know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc. 
He had aproached.Bennett "as from us". Ed Nagell 
-- the name -- rin•gs a piccolo-toot on tfns, but only 
that. ~ncidentally, I filed a report on the in6ident_ 
when I got back to the shop. 
I am often in New York -- at the Harvard 
Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me a ring. 
It ,rnuld be fun to see you. I met ;rarry ·osterweis in· 
a restaurant the other day -- fater some many, many-- ---
years. You.may remember him. 
I have recently become an author CUl Wines. 
After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French 
wines whi~h was. published by Knopf,, and a_m about to bring 
out one on wines of .the world with MacMillan in September. 
That _is about the· extent of 'my news. 
My best t,o you.
