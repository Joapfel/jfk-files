CURRENCE: COLBY stated that the United States sought to put pressure on President DIEM 
and the governrrent, particularly to rerrove NC-n DINH NHU from the country, to bring about cer­
tain changes of policy in August of 1963 that was thought necessary to improve the perfor­
mance of the government of South Vietnam. Arrong these were the suspension of Public Law 
480 aid the susp~nsion ...of the comnxxtlty irrport. program. And also through various contacts 
with dissident generals, the United States was requested whether it would stand aside if 
the generals ran their own coup, and they were given the response in general terms that, 
_"Yes, we would stand aside, and yes, we would continue the aid program if a successor gov­
emrrent took over and looked reasonably able to carry on the war. • This can only be read as 
a green light to the generals. This nEssage was passed through a CIA officer, but his cre­
ditentials were checked by the generals recei vtng this kind of a nEssage, with the Arrbassador 
and with the Chief of the Military Aid group in Saigor1 so. that there was no uestion 
SOURCE: about what U.S. Policy was, nor that the CI.'. -Jffice STAPF: 
was speaking for the Ambassador with his knowledge d consent." R • DAWSON
