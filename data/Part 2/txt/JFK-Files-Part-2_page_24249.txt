ltf" THE AIR PROPRIETARIES 
Lawrence R. Houston, the former General Counse·1 of the Agency, 
was involved in the establishment of the first set of proprietaries 
.of the Agency back in.the late 1940's and early 1950's. As noted 
later on in section 10, page , Houston has co~cluded that. 
proprietaries should be a mechanism of last resort. He asserts 
that the· Agency learned ·this in part "the hard way and almost all 
of the lessons involved probabl? carr.e out one way or the other in 
connection with a major aviation proprietary in the Far East. 
Others ·had there own special problems, but I think the Air America 
complex had pretty near everything." 
The theory of the acquisition of Air America in 1949 was denial 
of the assets to the Red Chinese. The CIA first arranged advances 
to the company to keep them going when they were running· short of 
0 cash in 1949. These advances were used up and were actually credited 
to the purchase price eventually. The airline at that time had 
been organized by General· Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer. 
• It was a joint venture with the Chinese.Minister of Transport and 
was called Civil Air Transport. Houston described it as follows: 
This normal aviation organization, this would have no 
meaning ~tall, was completely ~tall, it would have 
not standing in international law, .aviation rights, or 
any of that. But it worked for what they wanted, which 
was to take supplies up-country into inland China and 
then to bring back whatever cargo they could get commer­
cially: tallow, hides, bristles, all that sort of trade, 
and then they traded that off for their own account. And 
for awhile the operations was fairly successful, the C-47

s 
and C-46' s. 
To finance this activity and to facilitate the trading of produce, 
their lawyer, Thomas Corcoran, had organized a company. That company 
was known as C.A.T. Inc. In addition there was a Panamanian
