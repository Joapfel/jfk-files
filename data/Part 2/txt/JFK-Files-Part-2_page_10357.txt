SUBJECT : Reported . Identity 61 , Burglary 
1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know aboLtt the 
reported break-in of Identity 61. _An investigative report 
by an officer of the Executive Protective Service states that the 
offices were_ ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.-
I • 
(JJ_.J ·2. The attached stunmary also des'cribes a separate audio _ 
A~l~ operation conducted against Identity 61 . by the FBI, at the 
J';\~:_L.;~gcncyiJ behest and with its technical support. This presents a 
Q, elated question that should be noted. James McCord' s· testimony 
indicates that he placed telephone calls to the_ Identlty 75 arid Identity 
61. He says he picked the nwnbers at random, hoping 
that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge 
the evidence as being ta'inted. Another witness, John Caulfield, 
says l\.1cCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sµre" 
they "were subjects of national security wiretaps. 11 
3. In fact, there has been a long- standing telephone tap on the 
Identity 75 , 1·un O}' the FBI, about \vhicltJ;I Stag}>elieves McCorcl 
knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sorl of operation 
ag.!•~nst Identity 61 ·, and assumed that it '\Vas als_o a telephone 
tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping 
that bolh his telephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, 
that one way or another his case wo_uld be dismissed or dropped 
because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive 
operations. At this point, given the publicity of the Iden bl br~ak-in, 
and the testimony of McCord and Caulfield, t~1e current investigations 
may lead to exposure of the operations.
