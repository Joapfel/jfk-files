Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Compliance 
Program and Requests for Additional Information and Records 
Dear Barry: 
I am writing to memorialize the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA's 
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records 
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section 
70)(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act). • 
It is important that everyone at the Agency who is responsible for providing answers to 
our requests for additional information and records understand that the answers will 
need to be incorporated by reference into the Agency's Final Compliance Statement. 
Essentially, CIA will need .to attest, under oath, that it has made aU reasonable and 
diligent searches and that its answers are true and correct to the extent of the best, 
reasonably available information. In this regard, is important to note that when the 
Review Board requests,·for example, a 201 file, it is not asking that you identify relevant 
records within the Sequestered Collection. Rather, it is asking to review the original 
201 file in its current and most complete version.1 
1The Review Board has no basis for assuming that.a 201 file as it appears in the 
Sequestered Collection today is necessarily complete. It is fully pbssible that a relevant 
document was not identified by CIA or the HSCA in 1978-79 and therefore is not 
included in the Sequestered Collection, or that a relevant document that was initially 
placed in the Sequestered Collection in 1978-79 may have been misplaced at some point 
during the subsequent twenty years. Therefore, in response to requests for files, it is 
not suffici.ent merely to point to places where responsive records appear in the 
Collection. On a case-by-case basis, we are very willing .to hear your explanations for 
the possible h.urdensomeness of any particular search or your analysis of why a search
