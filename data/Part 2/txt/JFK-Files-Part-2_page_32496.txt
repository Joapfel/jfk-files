Extremist And p oU.ce Act i vi ties In Venezuela 
Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several 
months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions. 
Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are 
connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,• 
the Venezuelan Communist Party 1 and the Armed Forces 
of National Liber~tion -- the Castro-Communist group 
credited with the d0struction at the Maracaibo oil 
fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are 
probably designed to discredit and weaken ~he Betan-
court Government. 
The police have demonstra~ed considerable proficiency 
in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly 
to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists 
r~sponsible for the holdup and looting of a printing 
/ supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint 
warehouse an~ have captured the Communist leader of 
guerrilla bands operating in the Falctin area of 
northwestern yenezuela. (CONFIDENTIAL)
