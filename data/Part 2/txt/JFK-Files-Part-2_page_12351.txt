Inquiries of discreet nature concerning individual's personal history 
(date and place of biri:h, etc.}, patriotism, health, reliabi_J.i ty, • 
stability, integrity, general reputation, present and past employments, 
and business connections. Investigation must definitely establish that 
individual can be used without danger of future embarrassment' due 
to instability or unreliability. Securing background information from 
individual is not sufficient; his background must be established by 
investigation, including discreet inquiries among persons personally 
acquainted with him. 
Check of loca+ ·credit and arrest records. Submit FD-165 to Identifica­
tion Division to obtain any record he may have and to place sto.p 
against fingerprints if on file. 
Review armed services record if applicable. 
Check draf·!; status or status in armed forces reserve. 
Check domestic status and, if any marital difficulties, obtain: details. 
Persons being considered for use in espionage and foreign nationality 
cases may present special problems which limit s·cope of inv_e§!tigation. 
{See instructions re co_ntact cases and deseco program, section 105, 
volume IV f of this manual.) However, where practical, cover above i terns~-
Leads must be handled by auxiliary offices within 30 days. Investigati6n 
must be completed prior to any request to guide, direct, or designa-te in­
dividual as potenti~l security informant. 
APPROVAL, INDOCTRINATION, AND DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL INFORMA.NTS 
1. When background information obtained, transmit results to Bureau in same 
numerical sequence set out in subsection C, and request authority to des­
ignate individual as Bureau-approved potential security informant and to 
proceed with.development. Do not submit on UACB basis. Include physical 
description. 
2. After designation as Bureau-approved potential security informant, fol­
lowing matters should be made clear to him: 
a. His assistance is strictly voluntary and he is to understand there is 
no coercion· or intimidation involved. 
b. He is ·not and cannot consider himself employee or 11undercover Agent" 
of FBI. Seriousness of violating impersonation statutes must be 
impressed upon him. 
c. His cooperation must be strictly confidential at all times and if 
he should feel he cannot maintain this confidence, he should so 
advise. There should be no doubt left in mind of potential informant 
that his relationship must remain on confidential basis and if he 
violates confidence he will be of no value and by so doing .. Bureau's 
investigative activity may be jeopardized. If he has special 
problem which would require revealing his assistance to his wife or· 
other pertinent individual, this should be ascertained and appropriate 
reco~.mendation made to Bureau. 
d. If potential informant is connected in any manner with labor union, 
inform him that Bureau is not interested in employer-employee relation­
ships as such and is only concerned with obtaining information on 
infiltration of unions by subversive elements. 
e. If potential informant is student, teacher, or has any similar 
relations with.school, college, or university, in initial intervie~ 
and subsequent handling, follow current instructions concerning in-
vestigations on campuses. . 
3. Do not interview female potential informants in their homes or apartments 
unless necessary and any such interviews should be conducteft by two 
Agents after specif.ic approval of superior in field office responsibl_Ei 
for development of informants. This instruction is not applicable where 
active investigation has established that potential informant is of good 
character, there is no indication of affiliation with subversive groups, 
and· there will be no embarrassment to Bureau. 
4. Except in espionage and foreign nationality matters where contact. is 
maintained on a periodic basis dependent on circumstances, contact 
potential informants personally at least once every two weeks.
