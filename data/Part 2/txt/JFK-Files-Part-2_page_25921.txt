Committee about th~l recent death of Samuel Giancana. As 
I 
you are no doubt aware, his name has been raised in the

context of allegati~ns concerning the Central Intelligence

Agency's possible involvement in so-called political 
assassinations. 
Based on information available to the Committee, 
it was obvious that''. he might be knowledgeable about the 
' 
politi(;'.:al assassination matter. Although Mr. Giancana 
had not actually been_subpoenaed to testify by thi~ Com-

Since this might involve viola~ 
'i'i 
tion of federal statutes pertaining to obstruction of a

Congressional Commi:ttee investigation, the Select Committee 
is requesting that ~ou instruct the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to keep it fully informed of all information 
coming to the Bureau's attention pertaining to Mr. Giancana's 
death. In making this r.equest, the Committee is not _conced-
,., ' . "'---"'---- ........... 
? ing_ its right to co~duct its own investigation of_this 
matter~ Ho~ever, it is acting in the spirit of cooperatiori 
on a question of mutual concern to the Executive and Legis­
