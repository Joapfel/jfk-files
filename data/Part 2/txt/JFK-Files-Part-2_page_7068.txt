assassinati9n during the time period 
between the date of the assassination­
November 22, 1963-and the date that the 
Warren Commission issued its report in Sep­

CIA assassination records.

Board released CIA installation locations in 
CIA documents relevant to Oswald's visit to 
Mexico City. CIA • did not raise significant 
objections to the Review Board's release of its 
installations in these records. 
When the Review Board began to vote to 
release the location of additional CIA instal­
lation locations, the CIA did object, but did 
not offer evidence of the harm to national 
security that it believed would result from 
disclosure of the information. The CIA
