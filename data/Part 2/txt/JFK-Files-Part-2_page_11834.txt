Receipt of unemployment compensation 
a. At times informants and/or sources temporarily lose their jobs 
and become eligible for unemployment compensation. Where un­
employment regulations require listing of all sources of income as 
prerequisite for unemployment compensation and informants and/or 
sources who a.re being paid by Bureau fail to comply, situation is 
potentially embarrassing. Bureau cannot be placed in position .of 
condoning violation of state la,·1 on part of any informant or source. 
Field office must determine from state unemployment compensation 
officials effect of unemp),oymcnt compensation la.ws on paid informant~ 
and/or sources. Depending on local requirements, informants and 
sources must be alerted accordingly. 
b. When pa.id informant and/or source becomes unemployed or has knowledge 
of impending unemployment, discuss all facts with him and submit 
recommendations to Bureau on UACB basis. At· same time, vreigh seriously 
possible need for informant to apply and accept unemployment compen­
sation to protect his security. Fellow membe:::-s of su.bversive organi­
zation may be aware of his unemployment status and would expect him· 
to apply. Where state requires notification of Bureau payments to in­
formants that would necessitate disclosure of identity, discontinue 
Bureau payments during period of unemployment compensation benefits.
