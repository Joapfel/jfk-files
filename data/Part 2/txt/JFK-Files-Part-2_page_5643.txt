S WHILE SERVrNG IN VIENNA UNDER TOM : -~ _ 
l<AR1¥ISSIN'rS, I WAS ORDERED BY HQ TO REVEll~--!ffIIITAR~' 
rN'!'ELLIGENCE THAT A LOW-RANKING AUSTRIAN PIPLOMAT SERVING AS THEIR 
INFORMANT IN BUDAPEST HAD ALSO BEEN RECRUITED BY US AND WAS REPORTI , 
NG TO US. , I REFUSED TO , CARRY OUT THIS ORDER AND OFFERED MY '• 
RESIGNATION. TO ME, IT WAS DISHONORABLE TO BETRAY A YOUNG AGENT WHO 
HAD ACCEPTED OUR RECRUITMENT AND PUT FAITH IN OUR PROMISE OF 
SECRECY. TO MY MINO AN AGENCY WITHOUT PRINCIPLES CANNOT SURVIVE AND 
INDEED SHOULD NOT SURVIVE. TOM ~ISSINIS, PERHAPS ONE OF THE 
LAST HONORABLE MEN TO SERVE WITH US IN HIGH POSITION, FIRED A STRONG 
ABLE BACK AND THE SHAMEFUL ORDER WAS RETRACTED. 
9. I HAVE INVESTED ABOUT $50,000 IN MY APARTMENT, IN KEY MONEY AND 
IMPROVEMENTS~- _F I LEAVE, I WILL LOSE ALL OR MOST OF THIS. OUR 
LAST MOVE TO VIE_NNAJ COST ME ABOUT $15, 000 IN SEA FREIGHT AND 
INSURANCE. I Iu;---'NEVER GET ON MY KNEES AND ASK TO BE MADE WHOLE IF 
YOU EXPOSE ME, BUT I MAY REPORT TO THE COURTS. I AM A RETIRED 
MEMBER OF THE.VIRGINIA BAR. 
10. LET ME REGALE YOU WITH_AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE HISTORIANS 
MINDLESS DRIVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING CAN LEAD T,()_____A__PROUD COON RY'S 
DISGRACING ITSELF. , DURING WWII WHEN WE WERE INTERROGATINg~q"J~~ 
POW' S, WE PROMISED ~-wot:Jt;D--EVER---t.Emur-THEr--HAD....CUSP~LL , 
nt-GUTS,-AND-W'E·ALi, BELIEVED WE WERE BEING HONEST. BUT ALMOST 
25 YEARS AFTER WWII THE BRITISH DECLASSIFIED ALL THE ADI(K) REPORTS 
(THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE CALLED, AND EVEN THE "ROOM CONVERSATIONS," 
TRANSCRIPTS OF THE CONVERSATIONS POWS HAD IN THEIR ROOMS, EVEN 
INCLUDING THE EXTREMELY VALUABLE SPEECHES MADE BY HIGH-RANKING 
.LUFTWAFFE OFFICERS TO THEIR HIGH-RANKING FELLOW.,POW'S AT 
"COCKFOSTERS" MANSION. NEWCOMERS WERE VISITED BY THE OLD HANDS FOR 
A MONTH TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T STOOL PIGEONS, BEFORE THEY WERE 
GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON SOME 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WAR. THE EXCELLENT BRITISH MIKE~S~::.&.-1,,-..::.u....--&....1.-­
ALL UP. 
IN RECENT YEARS, AT LEAST ONE LUFTWAFFE VETERAN ASSOCIATION, 
THAT OF J.G.2, THE RICHTHOFEN GESCHWADER, SENT PEOPLE TO LONDON TO 
GET COPIES OF THE INTERROGATION REPORTS OF THEIR PILOTS. THEY DID 
IT CHRONOLOGICALLY AND WERE SO SHOCKED AT THE VAST AMOUNT OF VITAL 
DATA REVEALED BY THEIR BUDDIES THAT, IN ACUTE REVULSION, THEY 
STOPPED LOOKING. I ASSUMED THEN THAT "EVERYONE" HAD "TALKED," WHICH 
, IS TRUE. 
11. I AM 75 YEARS OLD PARTLY PARALYZEQ ON MY LEFT SIDE FROM A 
STROKE IN DEC. 1993. I WAS NEARLY FULLY REHABILITATED WHEN, IN MAY 
1994, I WAS HIT BY CONSTANT MUSCLE SPASMS ALL UP AND DOWN MY LEFT 
SIDE. THIS RATHER RARE CONDITION, BASICALLY A SUDDEN SUPER-HUMAN 
TIGHTENING OF ALL THE MUSCLES, WITH AFTER EFFECTS LASTING UNTIL THE 
NEXT SPASM, HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO STAND UP, 
WALK, OR EVEN SIT UP FOR VERY LONG. IN AFEW DAYS, WHEN ALL THE 
MANY MEDICINES ARE HERE, WILL BEGIN A 20-WEEK HOMEOPATHIC CURE FOR 
THE SPASMS UNDER DR. SCHRAMM, A LEADING SPECIALIST HERE. I CAN'T 
VERY WELt, LEAVE FOR 20 WEEKS. 
YOU WILL BE CONTACTED MOMENTARILY BY ONE OF MY ATTORNEYS. I 
WILL ALSO BE IN TOUCH WITH MY CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS. 
WITH BITTER RESOLVE,

"CABALESE," BUT BECAME TOO TIRED TO FINISH IT. NONETHELESS, REF 
IDEN ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS MESSAGE ALSO BE PASSED:
