The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr. 
·Chairman 
Committee on House Administration 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I have approved a salary increase of $1,980.00 per year 
effective April 1, 1978 for Louis Paris•i, a staff investigator 
for the Select Committee. 
As Mr. Parisi's basic salary and benefits are paid by 
the New Jersey State Police, his additional salary from the 
House is paid in the form of a monthly expense allowance per 
prior agreement with your staff and the Clerk of the House. 
This was to avoid Mr. Parisi from earning retirement benefits 
from both the Federal Government and the State of New Jersey. 
Accordingly, Mr. Parisi's monthly expense allowance will 
increase from $625.00 to $790.00 effective April 1, 1978 .
