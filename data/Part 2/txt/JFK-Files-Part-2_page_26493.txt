1. Mexican nationals traveling to Cuba totaled 
238 in 1962 and. 157 in the first two months of 1963. 
2. A fairly reliable source reported in mid-
1962 that about 150 Mexicans were receiving guerrilla 
training at Minas del Frio, Cuba. A,defecting Cuban 
Army lieutenant told the press in Brazil that -70 • 
Mexicans were trained at his base at San Julian in 
late 1961. These reports are regarded with reserve, 
however, particularly in the light of our knowledge 
that Cuba does not wish to damage its relations with 
Mexico as long as Mexico City is the principal Cuban 
"window" to Latin America. 
3. Arrests for subversive activities have not 
been numerous. In. the most recent case, six professors 
and two students at the University of Morelia were ar­
rested for participation in Fidelista protests over the 
dismissal of the University's Communist rector. One 
teacher, a Guatemalan Communist militant who visited 
Havana for 17 days in 1961, is still imprisoned and 
will probably be deported. Another professor had prob­
ably visited Cuba. 
4. A Nicaraguan Communist was deported in 
January and an Argentine Communist newsman in November 
1962 for ·pro-Castro activities. Two Cubans were ar­
rested on arrival in_February 1962 and deported as 
agitators. 
5. Mexican government agents on 24 May 1962 
killed Ruben Jaramillo, Mexican Communist and guer­
rilla fighter, at Morelos, and subsequently arrested 
one of his guerrilla associates, Jorge Martinez 
Rosillo, who had been a friend of Raul Castro since 
the Castros' training period in Mexico. Jaramillo 
had been invited to Cuba in 1961, but there is no 
record of his travel: Martinez Rosillo was in Havana 
for 20 days in 1961. 
6. Communist factions have touched off numerous 
disturbances at the national university in Mexico 
City and provincial universities. Anti-Communist
