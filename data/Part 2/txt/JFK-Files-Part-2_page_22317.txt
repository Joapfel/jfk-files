Mr. Madigan. You have no inclination or no feeling at 
all for what his assignment was? 
- ' 
Mr. Maheu. No, I do not. 
Mr. Madigan. In covert terms whether it was an espionage 
assignmant or whether it was a PR kind of assignment? No idea? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't know. 
Mr. Madigan. Was there ever an island involvsd with that 
assignment to your knowledge? 
Mr. Maheu. Not to my knowledqe or recollection. 
Mr. Madigan. You never heard of an island called 
Mr. Maheu. Not to my recollection. 
Mr. Madigan. During the 1960's did you employ a fellow 
by the name of Jack Buckley? We may have discussed this 
Mr. Maheu. I believe that from time to time a Jack 
Buckley did work for Robert A. Maheu Associat.es. I don't 
believe he was an employee. 
Mr. Madigan. Would he be on a kind of an intermittent 
contract basis like Frank was? You would use him every once in 
awhile? 
Mr. Maheu. My r~collection is that he did some work for 
Robert A. Maheu Associates and, as I say, not an employee. 
Mr. Madigan. Do you know what types of assignments he 
did?
