that the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) planned on a 
demonstration in Washington 1 D.C. on January 15, 1968, the 
day the United States Congress reconvenes. According, to 
the source, officials of the JRB want to assemble ori the 
steps of the United States Capitol and present a petition 
to officials of the United States Congress but the United 
States Capitol Police has refused to grant them permission 
for such an assembly. The source further stated that 
attorneys for the JRB have petitioned the United States 
District Court to grant an injunction prohibiting the 
enx0rcement by the United States Capitol Police of a 
Congressional ruling prohibiting demonstrations on the 
United States Capitol grounds. 
The above source stated that plans for the 
demonstration still consist of assembling at Union Station 
at 12:30 p.m. January 15, 1968, marching to the Capitol 
where they will present a petition to Congressional 
officials and also confer with various Congressmen and 
will hold a meeting probably at the Shoreham Hotel
