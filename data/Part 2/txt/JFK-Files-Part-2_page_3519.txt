SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR CUBA: 
Argentina is reportedly attempting to stop one of its ships-­
the SS ANAMAR--from delivering a cargo of coffee to Cuba, despite 
the fact that there are currntly no legal restrictions against 
Argentine ships calling anywhere in the world. The ANAMAR left 
Brazil on 1 November with a cargo of Brazilian coffee, purchased 
by the USSR and destined .for Cuba. (See Daily Summary of 8 No­
vember.) The Argentine Foreign Ministry informed US Embassy of­
ficials that it was determined to' prevent the ANAMAR from going 
to Cuba because of potential unfavorable press reaction. Argen­
tina warits to avoid legal and financial entanglements in the mat­
ter; however, it is determined to stop the ship and is reportedly 
even considering some type of provocation which would force the 
ship to put into Puerto Rico. The owners of the ANAMAR are 
equally adamant that the ship will not go to Cuba; reportedly 
they bad agreed to ship coffee from Brazil to some Central Amer-
ican country to pay some back bills, and were only informed later 
that the shipment would go to Cuba. According to the owners, the 
ship is now lying off the coast of Brazil awaiting resolution 
of the problem. The owners reportedly stated they will sink the 
ship rather than go to Cuba. (Am Emb Buenos Aires 1017, 4 Decem­
