• SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
You will, I hope, permit me some personal, but I think 
not unimportant observations. I hope that you will complete your 
work as expeditiously as possible as I feel very strongly the need 
for a viable Central Intelligence Agency operating, of course, within 
its charter. I believe that the present furor about C. I. A. is 
impeding it in the performance of its mission and the sooner it is 
able to go about its business, not in a fish bowl, the better our 
country will be served. I believe that we will continue to need 
effective, intelligent collection and analysis for our policy makers 
and I think there will be occasions when covert activities should be 
undertaken in the interests of our National security. 
Finally, one thing that bothers me, Mr. Chairman, is that 
there is tremendous concern now -- and I don't suggest that it is 
improper -- with the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
while at the same time people seem not to be equally concerned 
about what the Soviet Union is up to in this country, especially 
through its. very many KGB agents here~· I would hope that a 
Congressional Committee would be interested enough to investigate 
this most serious matter.
