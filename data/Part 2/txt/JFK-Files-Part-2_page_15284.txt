-~,i. This program was 1.nitiated in 1954 and expanded in . 
/ 1955 and 1958 to provide for the acquisition of positive in­
telligence data as well as other information which would assis-t 
FBI investigations through three principal phases: •. • (1)' Regular 
notification ·from U11 S$·intelligence agencies-as to arrival in· 
u. s. of _intelligence personnel from non-Soviet-bloc countries; 
·: (2) Maintenance of technical surveillance of official estab-
• ... lishments of selected non-S"oviet-bloc countries with aporov-al 
of State· Department; and.• (3) Development of 'live sources 
within such diplomatic establishments. 
SCOPE AND COST: 
The first phase consists chiefly of file revj.ews 
and indexing at the Seat of Government at nominal cos.t. · 
Under the second phase we .are presently operating . 
27 ,technical surveillances covering establishments of 17-non­
Soviet-bloc countries a .. The countries are: . Brazil, Chile, . 
Colombia, _Cuba1 Cyprus, Dominican Republic, ·.Guatemala, Haiti,

the program consists primarily of monitoring the technical ._ 
installations involved and the-translation of the intelligence 
product.· These costs are. analyzed each time the technica1-
surveilla.nce is justified {on a quarterly basis after the,·, 
first month's. operation) •. The cost appears io b~ fully· ~--·• -... -
