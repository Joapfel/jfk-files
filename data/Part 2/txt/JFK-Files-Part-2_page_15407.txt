Re: INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE: /6F. FRIENDLY 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES (SEMIANNUAL EVALUATION) 
FIELD EVALUATION AND EXPANSION CONSIDERATION 
Hulet 6/29/59 requested. 12 field offices directly or 
jotentially involved in this program to ~~aluat~ live source 
develo_pment under third phase and offer suggestions for improve­
ment. As result three s_pec ifi c questions arose for~ consideration. 
.-... 
1• • Are our targets too restrictive? . 
2. Are our interviewprocedures too consefvative? 
J. Shall we endeavor to extend program to reach 
higher-level noncommunist officials and possibly· 
communist off~cials? 
The first question relates to whether we should attempt 
source developments in establishments outside Washington,. New 
York City and San Francisco and whether we should alter._present 
instructions that .Potential sources be limited almost exclusively 
to employees of foreign establishments who are U.S .. citizens. • 
. . 
.. 
Second qu_est ion relates to tifether we should relax· ,present 
requirement that all authorized interviews with ,potent·ial sources 
be initially conducted under a suitable _pretext, _preferably in 
conne~tion with. a criminal mat·ter unrelated to the employment of 
the _person interviewed. • 
. Third question relates to whether we should utilize 
_present sources, who generally occupy clerical ,positions, to 
identify noncommunist officials who are (1) strongly pro-Western, 
and (2) in social or business contact with communist officials, 
for pur,pose of approaching the noncommunist officials and working 
through them to reach the commu_nists for defection or double agent 
purposes. 
:.l · not he 7 i!7"z&d--~~f-~d}§.n~2:af!-i~tt~~!!t~~~~-;~:~ .. ~;~~~-e;~7zwi-t is '.

level officials, bearing in mind the risks invol~ed. However, 
the ex.pert ence of the fi e-ld would be invaluable in a thorough. 
discussion of these matters and accordingly they will be scheduled 
for disc·ussion at next conference with field security supervisors· 
and recommendations thereafter will be submitted.
