·sECRET 92 
(l. You said there was a previous inquiry? 
A. Yes. The rrevious inquiry came froM Archie Roosevelt 
who is now retired and was at that particular time the Chief of 1 
European Division. 
(l. When was that inquiry received? 
~ That was about a year ago, I guess. 
BY MR. OLSEN: 
~- About the first time these photographs began to be 
circulated? 
A. Yes. 
Q. About the bUr.ts in Dallas? 
A. Yes, and actually I think this Archie's inquiry 
came from some magazine or newspaper man in Europe. Archie was 
for a long time and he apparently 
made a lot of acquaintances over there among the media. 
(l. This 'is something you are relating to Der Stenn 
Magazine? 
A. That is right. 
~ And did I un<lerstand you to say thqt in checking with 
the Office of Finance that it was positively ascertained that 
Hunt was on sick leave on ~~oveMber 22nd? 
A. Well, I will have to check that. That is the way 
I understood it but I did qet this through our Budget people whoJ 
I 
have the contact with the Office of Finance. 
O And that he was on annual leave the day before?
