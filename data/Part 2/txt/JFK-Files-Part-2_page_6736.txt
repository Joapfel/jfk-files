2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 
The Honorable John Conyers, Jr. 
Chairman 
Committee on Government Operations 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
tittH f 
The Director has asked me to respond to your letter of 
April 6, 1992 requesting certain information regarding CIA 
holdings of records related to the assassination of 
President Kennedy. We do have a significant number of records 
relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 
although many of these records were originated by the FBI or 
by investigating committees of the Congress. We believe that 
a significant portion of our records could be released if H.J. 
Resolution 454 were enacted into law. 
I should also point out that the Central Intelligence 
Agency is currently embarking on its own review of 
assassination records. I would expect that this review will 
result in the public release of a significant body of 
information. 
To help the committee understand the nature and number of 
CIA records pertaining to the assassination, I am enclosing 
the answers to the specific questions you raised in your 
letter. 
Enclosure 
Sincerely, 
Stanley M. Moskowitz 
Director of Congressional Affairs
