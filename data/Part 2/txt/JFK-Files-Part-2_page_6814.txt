As we carry out our program to declassify Kennedy 
assassination documents, our goal will be to release as many 
documents as possible. In fa~t, I recently approved new CIA 
declassification guidelines for our Historical Review Program 
which specifically direct a presumption in favor of 
declassification. I believe we can be very forward leaning in 
making these documents available to the public, and I have 
instructed the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to />Jd,R',, p ~l,fu 
heart. • -r.:1 d vr :~­

To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in 
reviewing these documents for declassification, it is important to 
place them in some context. The CIA's collection of documents 
related to the assassination of President Kennedy consists of 
approximately 250,000-300,000 pages of material. This includes 
64 boxes of copies and originals of inrormation provided to the 
Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald 
accumulated after President _Kennedy's assassination. 
Unfortunately, and for reasons I do not know, what we are dealing ,, 
with is a mass of material that is not indexed, is uncatalogued, and 
is highly disorganized- .. all of which makes the review process 
more difficult. The material contains everything from the most 
sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane news 
clippings.
