document an 00 interest in Oswald upon his return from the Soviet Union. While 00 was 
interested in interviewing tourists to the Soviet Union for general information in the l 950's, by 
1962 only travelers with special access, knowledge, or skills were of intelligence interest. 00 
had no specific policy covering contacts with returning defectors ~though a l<><?al. field office . 
could initiate a contact if justified by a particular situation. According to the records located, 
00 only made contact with three of twenty-three defectors in the 1954~1962 time period. No 
ll records or reporting showing any 00 contact with Oswald could be located; The Office of. 
Operations did interview re-defector Robert Edward Webster in June 1962 on his work atthe 
Pl~cs Institute of Leningrad. • 
While a DCD '"A" file on Oswald does exist in the CIA's sequestered collection, most of the 
documents in the file are from the mid.:. l 970's, none predate the assassination, and the file 
appears to have been created as DCD personnel attempted to locate any evidence of contacts 
with Oswald in response to various congressional investigative bodies. This file has.been 
processed for inclusion in the JFK Collection at the National Archives.
