It has been suggested by several of your committee staff in their role 
as witnesses before the committee that much ado about nothing has been made 
about the so-called issue of commonality. It has been suggested to you that 
the only reason for common structures or common parts is so that money could 
be saved by use of common tooling. Such a conclusion overlooks the basic pur­
:pose of attempting to get one airplane instead of two. Two airplanes increase 
costs at every stage beginning with development itself. 
As the Fourth Evaluation Report stated, the design approach adopted by 
Boeing would "require separate documentation, (drawings; loads, stress, flutter, 
and fatigue analyses; etc.); separate static, dynamic ·and fatigue test programs; 
and more extensive developmental flight testing for the USAF and Navy versions. 11 
Separate production lines or unique production operations would be required 
earlier in the production process. Supply and logistics problems become compli­
cated. It is evident that the less the divergence, the greater the savings in the 
logistics a:rea. 
I 
These future savings are not susceptible of precise measurement, involving 
as they do. such factors as training, supply processes, future usage rates, 
common technical manuals, and the.Hke. 
If I had approved what was essentially two different airplanes, the prospects 
of saving one billion dollar swould have evaporated. The issue of minimum diver-
gence is fundamental. The effort to attain the highest possible degree of commonality"
