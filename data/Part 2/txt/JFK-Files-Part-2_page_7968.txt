5. Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a 
sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that 
morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on the case 
of Martin Luther King was white. 
6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The 
chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another 
speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned 
out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert 
Forman and .someone whose name sounded like "Ed Kirkley".

7. The chairman announced that all the s pee che s would be 
tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the 
audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these, 
"Burn", was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement 
would be shown at local movie theaters.. The latter were connected 
with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the Presidentis murder 
was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the 
organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their 
attention upon the Oswald case. 
8. The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every 
speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of 
November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman 
Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular 
attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below. 
9. A table at the back of the audience presented recommended 
literature. The books included H. Weissberg's Whitewash and 
Peter Noyes' Legacy of Doubt. For some reason there was a copy 
of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's "Assassination Tapes". 
There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword 
to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the 
Committee.
