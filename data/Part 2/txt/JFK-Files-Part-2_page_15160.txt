CLIFFORD Ao JONES 
PERJURY 
• 
Clifford A. Jones, former L'ieutenant Governor of 
Nevada who is closely allied with Nevada gambling interests, 
was indicted January 5, 1966, on three counts of perjury 
as a result of his having testified falsely ·before the 
Bobby Baker grand j~ry. • This testimony concerned payments 
Jones arranged through one of his companies of $10,000 to 
Baker through Wayne Bromley, a close associ'ate of Baker. 
U.S. District Court Judge Gasch .presently has taken under 
advisement pretrial motions of Jones for continuan~e of 
trial and change of venue •. 
On March 25, 1966, in response to request of 
Criminal Division, Bureau monito~ed telephone calls from 
Bromley to.Jones and Baker. Bromley· and his attorney had 
asked that this be done~ Department held such monitoring 
· would be legal. On Marcb 26, 1965, Department requested 
we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and 
Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles. Purpose of meeting was 
to get Bromley, a Government.witness, to tailor his. 
testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given. 'Bureau 
declihed to monitor this meeting because of lack of security 
of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure 
of the coverage. Department then got Bureau of Narcotics 
to assist in monitoring of the meeting. 
Recently we have responded to Department's request 
regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones. Such coverage 
involved twenty conversati@ns over four Las Vegas- and one 
Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential 
and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This 
-coverage will be subject matter of future pretrinl pro~eedings.·
