the pseudonym without harming the indi­
vidual. The CIA did not object to the Review 
Board's po,licy to release pseudonyms.· The 
CIA did identify several pseudonyms that it 
believed to be particularly sensitive, and 
demonstrated to the Review Board with clear 
and convincing evidence that release of those 
pseudonyms would do irreparable harm. 
c. CIA crypts. 
i. Review Board guidelines. The Review 
Board released some CIA "crypts" --code 
words for operations and individuals. The 
Review Board also generally released CIA 
"digraphs" -the first two letters of a crypt 
that link a particular crypt to a particular 
location. CIA often created crypts to refer to 
other U.S. government agencies; for example, 
the FBI was "ODENVY." The Review Board 
made a blanket decision to release all U.S. 
government crypts. The Review Board nearly 
always released CIA crypts where those 
crypts denoted operations or individuals 
relating to Mexico City or Cuba. (The 
digraph for Mexico City was "LI," and for 
Cuba, it was "AM.") For all other crypts, the 
Review Board protected the digraph and 
released the remainder of the crypt. The 
Review Board established a few exceptions, 
and where exceptions applied, the Board 
required CIA to provide crypt-specific evi­
dence of the need to protect. 
ii. Commentary. The Review Board had 
to determine whether it believed that release 
of CIA crypts would harm CIA operations 
and individuals. Section 6(1)(B) and (C) of 
the JFK Act provided the standard for post­
ponement of CIA crypts. The Review Board 
required the CIA to provide crypt-specific 
clear and convincing evidence that CIA cur­
rently used, or expected to use the crypt and 
that CIA had not previously released the 
crypt. Thus, in order to convince the Review 
Board to sustain postponements, the Board 
required CIA to research each crypt to deter­
mine whether CIA still used the individual or 
the operation and provide that evidence to 
the Review Board. 
As it did with CIA agent names, CIA initially 
requested the Review Board to sustain post­
ponement~ of all CIA crypts-even 
"ODENVY"-the CIA's old crypt for the FBI 
that CIA had already released in other CIA 
·:52 
records. CIA argued that its use of crypts was 
an operational method that should remain 
secret, even though CIA had replaced most of 
the crypts at issue years earlier. CIA believed 
that if the Review Board released the crypts, 
researchers would be able to piece together 
the records and determine the identity of 
operations and individuals. CIA further 
argued that the burden of locating evidence 
on each crypt was too heavy. 
The Review Board, conversely, believed that 
CIA conceived crypts as a code to hide the 
identity of an operation or an individual, and 
so the Review Board could release the crypts 
and not compromise the operation or the 
individual. As with CIA agent names, the 
Review Board allowed the CIA ample time to 
locate evidence on each crypt. Finally, the 
Review Board released a group of .£IA crypts 
from Mexico City with the "LI" digraph. CIA 
eventually agreed to release its crypts and 
digraphs in assassination reco-rds, and the -
Review Board eventually agreed to protect 
certain sensitive crypts. 
The Review Board recognized that it could 
not conduct a crypt-by-crypt review for 
every CIA record that it encountered. CIA 
records contain hundreds of thousands of 
crypts. Given the need to finish its work, the 
Review Board decided that, for all crypts 
except the "LI," "AM," and "OD" series 
crypts, it would agree to postpone the loca­
tion-specific digraph and release the actual 
crypts. Thus, the Review Board released most 
crypts in the collection and the most relevant 
digraphs. The Review Board did make three 
exceptions to its general rule: if protected the 
digraph in non-core files when (a) the crypt 
appeared next to a true name that had been 
released, (b) when the crypt appeared next to 
specific identifying information, and (c) 
when CIA provided clear and convincing 
evidence that the Review Board should pro­
tect the digraph. 
d. CIA sluglines. 
i. Review Board guidelines. "Sluglines" are 
CIA routing indicators, consisting of two or 
more crypts, that appear above the text in 
CIA cables. (See illustration.) The Review 
Board released CIA sluglines according to the 
same criteria it applied to crypts and 
digraphs.
