S1 87. SECURITY TN"VESTIG.ATIO, 87D 
During the first contact, the interviewing Agent 
will introduce himself as a SpeciRl Agent of tho 
FBI by use of credentials or badge ana will open 
the conversation by using an appropriate pretext 
or by reciting the Bureau's responsibilities in 
the security field and asking the subject whether 
he can be of assistance to the·Government. If the 
indivtdu~l has been a member of a basic revolutionary 
organi~ation and indicates he might cooperate, he 
may be questioned during the initial contact about 
his own activities in order to further ascertain 
the extent to whioh he will c9operate. This 
original interview is for the sole purpose of 
allowing the Agent to determine whether the 
individual being interviewed might be cooperative.

ports in key figure cases.
