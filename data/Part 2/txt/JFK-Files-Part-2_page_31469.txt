The "Daily People's World," now known as the "People's 
World, 11 a west Coast Communist newspaper, of November 2, 1950, 
page 10, columns 1 and 2, contained an article entitled, 
"Northern California Committee for Foreign Born Planned." This 
article stated that plans for the organization of a Northern 
California Committee for Protection of Foreign Born would be 
made at a meeting on November 6, 1950, at 150 Golden Gate 
Avenue, San Francisco, California. 
A source advised on April 25, 1962, that the Northern 
California Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, although 
an independent organization, carries out a program of activity 
in Northern California which coincides with the aims of the 
American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (ACPFB). 
The source further advised that the Northern California 
Committee for Protection of Foreign Born continues to be active 
in defending the foreign born in deportation proceedings and in 
securing support for the repeal of the Walter-McCarran Law. 
The ACPFB has been designated by the Attorney General 
of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.
