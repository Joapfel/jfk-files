Independence to see ·Mr. Truman. 
2. We departed Kansas City airport in the early afternoon

was that Mr. Truman was in some respects senile and living 90% 
on memories and his past. I stated that I thought there was certainly 
nothing wrong with Mr. Truman's mind or alertness but that I felt 
some caution should be exercised in just how Mr. Truman's assets 
might be utilized. The President made no comment except to note
