Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever ;:,artici-

Cuba? 
A On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this 
Agency. 
Q How did you learn of those operations? 
A Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports. 
Q Now, are these recent FBI reports?

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop 
over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and 
by the Bureau office in Miami. 
Q Do you know ~ho financed his activities?
