the views of others for the benefit of the 
President; 
That as a justice he had dressed down 
a prominent businessman who had criti-
cizt.'<i war spending,' though whether his 
call was made at the President's request 
he could not say and remain faithful to 
the Separation of Powers; • 
That the businessman had retracted 
-his statement, though in the end it 
proved to be accurate; 
That the justice could not answer 
questions concerning his judicial opin­

members of Congress muy nol be ques­

than in Congress; • 
Timi despite this usscrrcd Consri111-

that he had no permanent brain injury. • 
Moreover, the fact that he stood trial 
implies that he was legally sane. Re­

The publication of the Epstein article 
came at un ·opportune time _for Cluy 
Shaw. Obtaining advam:c copies, his at­
torneys entered it as evidence before a 
three-judge federal panel which was hear­
ing arguments that the DA wus "con­

panel was unimpressed, for it unani­
