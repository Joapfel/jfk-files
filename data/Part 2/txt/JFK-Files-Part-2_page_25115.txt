~dge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone comnented 
Jhat he believed that we should move ·cautiasly, that we should talk seriously to Diem 
i:iand that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic 
~iew of the effects of suspend.ing aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach

asked OOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsrran paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent 
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish som2 
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
