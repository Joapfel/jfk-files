OCCUlfrlENCE: C0L15Y stated that: "As part of' the pressure :on the governnent m the Augus: 
perlod, in response to the fact that these SPECIAL FDRCES' with Vietnarrese military and wiL 
Vietnarrese police had conducted the raid on pagodas, CIA was directed to suspend its assis1

military who were involved in that, but CIA is an easy thing to turn off, tum on and off. 
The other prograJTE are much more difficult to turn on and off. In a simple way, I think tl

units outside of Saigon when we said we would con½inue to support them.
