One CIA employee whc was involved in Cuban 
operations in ·Mexico City temembered that there were 
taps on the telephone of tlie Cuban Consulate.213/ -It is 
p os·sible that"the-employee, Mr. Phillips, wh·o 'w"a·s ··sJtationed 
i n Mex i co C it y from l 9 6 l • t c 19 6 6 , was i n corr e c t, after 
a fifteen-year hiatus, in 1lacing· this tap in 1963.214/· 
As the above notes, an exaniinati·on of the project 
files fails to support·· Mr. Phillips' memory, 
although those files do shew that the Consulate 
telephone was tapped in 19{4.-
