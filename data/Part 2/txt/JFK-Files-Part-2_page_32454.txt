Cuban Developments 
Following·tidel Castro's call for revolution in 
Latin America in his 2 January speech, other Cuba:r;t 
speakers are emphasizing the same theme. Che Guevara 
told a group of Central American delegates in Havana 
recently that they must prepare for simultaneous 
revolutions in all Central American countries and pointed 
to Venezuela and Chile as major targets for revolution. 
Long-time Communist leader Blas Roca, on 23 January, 
praised Venezuelan Communists for their recent 
acts of sabotage and pledged continued Cuban 
support for the struggle of the people against the 
Betancourt "tyranny." Venezuela has long been a 
major Castro-Communist target, and Blas Roca's 
remarlrn imply Cuban support for the present upsurge 
of Communist activity there.
