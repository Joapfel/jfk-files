We operated informants in Cuba ~hen we hnd a 
Legal Attache's Dffice in Havana. Infor6ants reported 
on acti vi tie~; of coT::mm.1ists and other subvcrsi ves in 
that country. During the period we operated these 
informn,nts, ·we did not: coo!'dinn. te our • aper~ ti1:;n~i th

subsequently told CIA about p~st Durenu operations is 
unknown. This item is being cited in the event CIA had
