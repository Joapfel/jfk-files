As to (c), member governments could take this course on an 
individual basis, but it would be necessary to convince them that· 
11exceptional circumstances" prevailed which would justify this 
action under the OAS Charter. • • 
COORDINATOR0 S RECOMMENDATION 
In selecting the optinrum combination of actions to take with 
respect to the OAS, the political feasibility and international 
complications were key factors which I have carefully considered.· 
Courses of action (2) (3) (4) (9) (10) and (12) would advance 
us toward our objective, would be politically feasible, and wou.ld 
involve minimum adverse international effects. We could probably 
obtain a near-unanimous vote in the OAS for these courses except 
(10) and (12). 
Courses (2) (5) (6) (9) (10) (11) and (12) would advance us 
considerably further toward our objective, .but (6) a.nd (11) 
particularly could create a split in hemispheric unity, and would 
involve adverse international effects, including al-probable acute 
confrontation with the USSR. • 
I believe courses (1) (7) and (8) will not serve our best 
interests at this time. 
I recommend that we take immediately courses (4) and (9). 
Course (4) calls for (a) a COAS/OC resolution under the Rio 
Treaty which condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to 
endanger the peace, deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns 
the presence of Soviet troops and recommends continued surveil­
lance and continued vigilance against subversive activities, and 
(b) terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This would still 
leave COAS 14th its responsibilities under Resolutions II and VIII 
of Punta del Este which provided for a Special Consultative 
Committee on Security and for the COAS to study the further sus-
pension of trade. • 
L_ 
Course (9) calls for~· resolution in COAS under Resolution 
VIII of Punta del Este which would recommend: 
(a) extension of ·arms embargo to all items of trade except 
food and medicine (Fallback position: extension of 
arms embargo to all strategic items); 
(b)
