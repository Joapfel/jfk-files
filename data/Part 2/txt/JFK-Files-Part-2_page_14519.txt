Dear Mr. Hoover: ltitiiiiJ 
On occasion it has proved important in connection with Uv..ited State's·-';,' 
interests in and relations with the other American Republics to obtain 
\- intelligence information on activities taking place within the United 
1 statese Specifically, it is important that the Department keep track of 
I the movements · and contacts of selected La tin Americans while in this 
~ country when· _there are reasons to believe that subversive activities 
directed at the other Governi11ents of . tllis Hemisphere are being plarmed 
and coordinated hereG Such activities-are against the national interests 
of the United States in so far as they may result in developments which 
could endanger United States lives, threaten United States business 
interests and cause friction within the inter-American systems 
' 
In the past the FBI has always cooperated in furnishing the Department 
in specific Latin American cases with information available from estab­
lished sources, but it has sho-wn understandable reluctance to become in-
\ volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in cases where 
; \there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive activities 
\ directed against the United States or violation of United States lawse 
J It is felt th?,t while this information is helpful, it does not completely 
i: fill the gap in the intelligence ini'orma tion importa."'l.t in the condttt of 
\ foreign relations. It is understood that the CIP., while interested in 
I foreign intelligence, does not carry out surveillance operations within 
the confines of the United Stat.es* 
, It would be most appreciated if you could e~ress an opinion· as to .. ,,r,,_. __ 
ll
how surveillance o~ s~~cted Latin Am~rican visitors to this country might ,;;:L:>-
be arranged on an individual case basis. . ( · . ____.{) 
An identical letter is being sent to th~ CIA in the hope that a---· -
coordinated approach can be ma.dee
