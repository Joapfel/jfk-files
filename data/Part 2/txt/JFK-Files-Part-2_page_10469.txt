My total contact with other agencies in terms of assistance 
with domestic operations has·been in the field of audio sur­
veillance countermeasures, anti-hijacking, or dr~gs. Speci­
fically, I participated in TSCC and R&D Subcommittee meetings 
which included technology excl1"anges and some equipment ex­
ihanges 6n a temporary basis ostensibly for testing or trial. 
I also assiste~ in x-raying the office walls of the Chairnan
