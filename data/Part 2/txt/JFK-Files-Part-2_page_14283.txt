Memorandum to Mr. w. R. Wannall 
Re: SENSTUDY.- 75 
62-116395 
to) reports, letters, correspondence, airtels, Lill'.is, inserts, 
executive conference memoranda, 302s, Assistant Director memos, 
notes, routing slips, etc." This letter, also on Page 3, 
recognizes that the request is substant~al but urges the 
executive agencies to apply sufficient manpower and attention 
to enable pr0mpt responses. Prompt response is defined by the 
Committee as having most of the materi~l available within 10 
days and all of it shortly thereafter. Mr. O'Connor advised 
hat he was aware that the imposition of such a condition upon 
the responses created an impossible task. He advised that on 
onday, 5/19/75, he would contact SSC Chief Counsel F. A. o. 
Schwarz calling attention to this time factor and al-so the often 
b+oad and ambiguous manner of many of the requests appended 
to the May, 14, letter. Mr. O!Connor hopes to negotiate these 
requests as well ~s the conditions qttached to the responses 
by the SSC to the end that the requests are more narrowly 
defined and that the deadline imposed "by the Committee be 
relaxed to a more realistic time frame. 
Pending receipt of results. of Mr. O'Conno+'s inter­
cession with SSC we are proceeding with an analysis of the SSC's 
requests and attempting to separate components for specific 
assignments to appropriate divisions within FBIHQ so that our 
responses may be forthcoming in as coordinated and timely 
a fashion as possible. 
ACTION: 
None. For information purposes.
