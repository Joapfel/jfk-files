Wallach then asked if I had ever talked to any 
other newspaper people. I told him that I once talked to 
Irving R. Levine many years ago. He wanted to know if I 
knew of any other Agents of the FBI who were talking to 
people in the news media. I said that I did not. 
Waliach then made reference to newspaper articles 
of recent date concerning the FBI's relationship with 
newspaper people friendly to the FBI. In response to inquiry 
I told him that I knew absolutely nothi~g about this. 
At the outset of the interview Wallach asked if 
I told the FBI about his visit and I said that I had called 
the Atlanta FBI Office and that as soon as he left I would 
again call the Atlanta FBI Office and give an Agent a rundown 
on the interview. He said that the FBI had notified the 
Select Committee about my call. 
He wanted to know if I had called the FBI in 
Washington and I gave a negative reply. He also wanted to 
know if I had talked to John Willis. I had not. 
Before leaving Wallach commented that he did not 
know who cost Jaffee his job, but that he, Wallach, was certain 
someone caused Jaffee to lose his job. 
I believe I have covered the interview in its 
entirety, however, I did not make any notes and the possi­
bility of some minor omission does exist.
