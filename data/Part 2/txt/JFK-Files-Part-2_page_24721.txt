approval if an assassination operation were mounted (Dillon, 
9/2l60, pp .. 42-43). 
Richard Bissell stated that in his opinion the language 
of the Special Group Minutes of August 25, 1960 indicated 
that the assassination of Lumumba was part of a general 
• strategy at the NSCand within the CIA for removingLumumba 
from the political scene (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 29, 32). 
Bissell added: 
The Agency had put a top priority, probably, on 
a range of different methods of getting rid of 
Lumumba in the sense of either destroying-him 
physically,incapacitating him, or eliminating 
his political influence. · (Bis se11, • 9 / 10 / 75, 
p. 29.) 
Bissell pointed to the Special Group Minutes of August 25_, 
1960 as a llprime example" of the circumlocutious manner in 
which a topic like assassination would be discussed by high 
government officials: 
_Bissell: When you use the language that no particu­
lar means were ruled out, that is obviously what it 
meant, and it meant that to everybody in the room. 
Meant that if it had to be assassination, that that 
was a permissible means. 
You don't use language of that kind except to mean 
in effect, the Director is being told, get rid of 
_the guy, and if you have to use extreme means up 
to and including assassination, go ahead. (Bissell, 
9 I 1 o / 7 5 , pp . 3 2 - 3 3 . ) 
Bissell add~d that this message was, "in effect", being given 
to Dulles by the President through his representative Gordon 
Gray (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 33) .
