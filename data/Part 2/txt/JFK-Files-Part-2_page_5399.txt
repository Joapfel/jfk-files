Dear John: 
As you know from our meeting with you on May 18, 1995, as well as from previous 
meetings with ARRB staff members, CIA's current practice ot redacting the sh.1glines 
from its cables in the JFK Assassination Colledion is of interest to the Assassination 
Records Review Board. As a result of discussion on this topic at the May 18 meeting, 
the Board in fact asked those present from CIA to provide it with any additional 
information available in support of this practic~. 
If you have any further information in support of redacting otherwise releasable 
. cryptonyms when present in cable sluglines,we would appreciate receiving it by this 
afternoon, so we can present it to the Board at its meeting tomorrow morning. 
With m~y thanks for your assistance in this matter. 
Sincerely yours, 
Sb G r}L___J__ 
David G. Marwell 
Executive Director
