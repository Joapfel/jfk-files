"it"'would have been in the custody of the State Department!'

·O'Donnell said that he did not recall that Hedgman mentioned 
the source of the virus (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 8) .·k But O'Donnell 
assumed that it had come from Sidney Gottlieb's office: 
It would have had to have come from Washington, 
in my estimation, and I would think, since it 
had been discussed with Gottlieb that it 
probably would have emanated from his office. 
(O'Donrtell, 6/9/75, p~ 28.) 
Hedgman did not recall discussing Gottlieb's trip to the Congo

O'Donnell.was "certain" that the virus had arrived before he 
did (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 24). He was surprised to learn that 
such a ~iius was being held at the Leopoldville staticin because

the visit of Gottlieb to the Conp:o and the plot to poison Lumumba, 
he said, "I believe absolutely in its credibility" (O'Donnell, 
9/11/75, p. 53). O'Dorinell found nothing in the facts as he knew 
them, nor in Hedgrnan's character to raise a question about that 
testimony. O'Donnell regarded H~dgrnan as ''an horiest and·a decent 
man" (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 19) -- "a totally truthful man" 
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 56).
