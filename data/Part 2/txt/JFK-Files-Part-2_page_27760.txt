Dear Mrs. Lazin: 
June 27, 1977 
I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding re 1 ati ve 
to my position on your back salary. I have consistently held that 
any employee would receive back salary if such could be worked 
out~before the employee terminated services wfth the Committee. 
You were paid the maximum sala.ry possible for the eleven days 
you worked in April. Unfortunately, your termination date of 
April 11th precluded you from receiving the full amount you 
,.would have been.,ent-itled to if you had stayed with the Committee 
•• 1 onger. 
The Rules of the House prohibit paying salary to anyone not 
actually employed by the House. ·Furthermore, keeping you on the 
payroll after your termination while you were actively working in 
your husband's political campaign could prove very embarrassing 
to the Committee. 
-
You did fine staff work with the Committee and if you 
decide to return at some future date we shall be happy to give 
you every consideration. •
