The Chairnian~-::I h,ave· some questions at this point, please. 
Item 4 of this memorandum reads: "The NSC 54/12 Group 
will be kept closely. informed·of activities, and will be 
available for advice and t~corilmendation" •• 
Does this suggest to you that the regular channel was 
supposed to operate with respect to MONGOOSE, that id to say, 
a central role was to be played by the Special Group in 
connection with its activities? 
Mr. Bundy. It is a puzzling sentence to me as I read 
it now. And I can't ~ive you a precise ans~er on that. I 
think the general answer has to be that the 54/12 Group continG,:. 
through this period. General Taylor was the chairman of 
both. The overlapping of membership was extensive. And 
I think you would get a more precise answer as to the exact 
relation from General Taylor than I am in a position to give 
you. 
The Chairman. I have a very clear memory of General 
Taylor's testimony. And his testimony was that the Special 
Group Augmented was the group that had charge of operation 
MONGOOSE. It was further his testimony that all plans, all 
operations, were to be brought to the Special Group Aug-
mented for its approval. And the approval of that Group 
was necessary before any such plans were actually implemented.
