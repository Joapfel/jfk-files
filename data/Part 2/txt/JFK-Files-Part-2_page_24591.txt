discussed above in section ___ , however, it was the testimony of all 
witnesses except Helms that such statements did not include assassination. 
Lansdale's statements to O'Leary and Martin appear consistent with his 
sworn testimony that it was his own idea to request an assassination plan 
from H~rvey and that he did not discuss this idea with anyone except Harvey. 
(seep. __ above). With respect to this latter point, however, it is 
a fact that Lansdale's request for an assassination plan followed almost 
immediately after the August 10 meeting, where the question of a Castro 
assassination was raised. Hence, it is not unreasonable to conclude that 
the raising of the question of a Castro assassination at the August 10 
meeting prompted Lansdale to request an as¾ssination plan (although it 
was the finding of the IG Report as well as the testimony of Harvey that 
the August 10 meeting had no relation to the question of authorization for 
the 1962 assassination plot).
