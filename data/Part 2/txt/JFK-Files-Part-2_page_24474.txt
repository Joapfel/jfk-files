2. Richard Bissell's Testimony 
l I' l
ll 
' 
(a) Lack of Personal Knowledge. Bissell testified that he knew 
nothing of clearances outside the CIA for the Castro assassination effort. 
(Bissell, 6/9, p. 30). Indeed, Bissell met fr~quently with the Special 
Group in the Fall of 1960 for the purpose of discussing Cuban operations, 
I 
but never informed the Special Group that there was a plot underway involving 
use of underworld figures to assassinate Castro, (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 25-26); 
nor did Bissell inform President Eisenhower or Vice President Nixon or any 
other person outside the CIA (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 26-29). Bissell testified 
that his reason for riot doing so was that as Deputy Director of Plans, he 
reported to the Director and under Agency procedures relied upon the Director 
to inform the appropriate persons outside thEi,..Agency. Thus, the question of 
President Eisenhower's knowledge rests on whether Allen Dulles personally 
informed him of the Castro plot. 
(b) Assumptions Concerning Dulles. Based upon his belief that 
\ ) Dulles had been briefed about the operation involving underworld figures 
( \ 
\,._.) 
and understood that it involved assassination, Bissell assumed that Allen 
Dulles would have sought authorization above the CIA level. As Bissell 
testified: 
"I went·on the assumption that, in a matter of this 
the Director would handle higher level clearances. 
I mean authorization."* (Bissell, 6/9, p. 26.) ~/
