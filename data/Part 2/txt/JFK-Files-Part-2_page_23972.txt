A Chilean military court found that high-ranking military officers, 
both active and retired, conspired to bring about· a military coup and 
to kidnap General Schneider. Several of the officers whom the CIA had 
contacted and encouraged in their coup conspiracy were convicted of con­
spiring to kidnap General Schneider. Those convicted of carrying out 
the-~ctual kidnap attempt and the killing of·General Schneider were assoc­
iates of retired General Roberto Viaux, who had initially been thought by 
the CIA to be the best hope. However, later the CIA discouraged General 
Viaux because the Agency felt other officers, such as General Camilo 
Valenzuela, were not sufficiently involved. General Viaux was convicted by the 
military court and received a twenty-year prison sentence for being 
the "intellectal author" of the Schneider kidnap attempt. General 
Valenzuela was sentenced by the military court.to three years in exile 
for taking part in the conspiracy to prevent Allende's assumption of 
office. The military court found that the two Generals had been in 
contact throughout the coup plotting.

of which are discussed in more detail below) are as follows: 
1. By the end of September 1970, it appeared that the only feasible 
way for the CIA to implement the Presidential order to prevent Allende from 
coming to power was to foment a coup d'etat$

tary entaifCd the removal of General Schneider by one means or another.
