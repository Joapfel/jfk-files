, ., special circumstances. We will make full use of all 
,€.,Yr-~P-''" possifile.~exc~ons· to FOIA-mandated declassification in

of President Kennedy. As Deputy Director for operations, I 
am of course committed to fully supporting·· the DCI in 
meeting this requirement, but I also appreciate your concern 
about the files on you that are related to the ,, 
assassination. I have therefore directed a senior officer
