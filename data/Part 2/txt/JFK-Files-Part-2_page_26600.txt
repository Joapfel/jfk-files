NOTES 
USSR Simultaneous activity this morning on the 
Tyuratam missile test range, satellite tracking nets 
and Soviet space support ships in the Atlantic prob­
ably represented an attempt to launch an unmanned 
earth satellite. The launch apparently failed on 
the pad or was cancelled at the last moment. It 
may be tried again soon. (INTERCEPrS) 
Rumania-US Rumanian officials are about to award 
a US firm, Ferguson and -Company of Cleveland, Ohio, 
a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati 
ste.el plant. The Rumanians are pressing ahead with 
this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis­
courage it in various ways, most importantly by re­
fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial 
degree. • 
Turkey The New Turkey Party has followed the 
Peasant Party in withdrawing from the present three­
party coalition government. This means that the 
coalition has to all intents and purposes collapsed, 
even though no formal action will be taken until 
Prime Minister Inonu returns from Washington this 
weekend. 
Thailand The Thai doctors attending Sarit now ad­
mit for the first time that the Prime Minister is in 
critical condition. Our doctor agrees with this 
prognosiso US officials -in Bangkok believe that the 
most likely successor would be Thanom Kittikachorn, 
now deputy prime minister and minister of defense. 
Thanom is not likely to last long, however, since he 
is neither a strong personality nor a figure of great 
weight in the military.hierarchy.
