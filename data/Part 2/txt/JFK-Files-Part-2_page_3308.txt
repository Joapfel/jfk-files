aside from, apart from, and independent of .the formal 
anti-Castro program which was undertaken by CIA. At 
most, four or five senior officials -- Alle1;1 Dulles, 
Richard Bissell, Shef Edwards, Bill Harvey, and pos­
sibly, Tracy Barnes -- probably were knowledgeable 
about the Mafia connection and Mr. Maheu. 
In terms of Project JMATE itself, the .few bits 
of information which indicate the possibility of as­
sassination· attempts against the Cuban leadership also 
fail to demonstrate any respo~ibility for·their ini­
tiation on the part of WH/4. If anything, the evidence 
would indicate that WH/4's position was one or watchful 
waiting and wishful thinking· that dissident Cubans 
would.themselves ·eliminate.the Castros and Che Guevara. 
The possibility, of course, that Agency-supplied .weapons 
' . 
might be involved in such an attempt cannot be ruled 
' out. 3/ 
Obviously it would be foolish to contend that 
those principally responsible for developing CIA's 
anti-Castro program would have objected to the as.sas­
sination of Fidel Castro. On the other hand, this 
was not one of the .basic concepts nor intentions of 
the official program of the Central Intelligence Agency.·
