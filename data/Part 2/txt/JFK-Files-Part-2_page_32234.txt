opportun1ties present themselves or can be created, 
until the Castro/Communist regime is overthrown.

Castro/Communist regime from the Free World and from

in the hemisphere; increase the cost to the Bloc of 
sustaining the regime; and obtain the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Cuba.

further advance toward our ultimate objective.

survive, which threaten the present regime, and whose 
aims are compatible with those of the U.S.
