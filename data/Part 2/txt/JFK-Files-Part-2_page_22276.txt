the first man contacted by Mr. Maheu, worked through a 
Cuban exile leader. And he offered -- and he said that he 
could do something of this nature provided he got some funds

And I think again we have some doubt~ as to the accuracy of 
his reporting. 
I I 
Mr. Schwarz. In ~lovember 1961 did Mr. l3issell indstr_uct 
a William Harvey to take charge of the gambling syndicate 
operation design~d to kill Fidel Castro? Page 3 of Mr. Greer's 
report, which is at the beginning of your report. 
Mr. Colby. I believe so, yes. 
Yes. That is what our evidence says, the summary 
sais, "of the evidence available". A.'1.d this is the evidence 
available in 1963. And there have been some minor changes in 
some of the details of this sumrnary,very minor changes. 
But the essence of this report is still roughly accurate, I 
believe. 
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Harvey -- was Mr. Harvey the man that 
had hired an agent in order to kill Lmurnba? 
Mr. Colby. Mr. Harvey was the head of Staff D, Staff D 
of the Operations directorate
