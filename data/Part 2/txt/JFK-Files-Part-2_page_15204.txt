.It is the Bureau's feeling that contacts with persons 
with other than·American citizenship and who have not displayed 
any loyalty to the United States Government or indicated· sympathy 
with our investigative responsibilities are extremely risky and 
could result in impairing relations between the United States and. 
Indonesia if a contact with the FBI was disclosed. 
NOTE: .. Bureau in memo 6~15-60 captioned II Indonesian· Activities in 
the United States, IS -_Indonesia" pointed out that·we needed . 
informant coverage in the Indonesian field. It was also noted in 
the memo that there have been differences between the Indonesian 
Army and President Sukarno of Indonesia over the composition of the 
• new Indonesian Parliamento Sukarno is said to have personally 
appointed certain communists to the new bodye On 3-8-60 Khrushchev 
and Sukarno issued joint communiques calling for relaxation of 
tension, peaceful coexistence and general disarmament. The Soviets

parties agreed to increase mutual trade and cultural exchanges. We 
requested liaison to discuss this matter with appropriate official. 
at State with possibility of this Bureau developing live sources 
within Indonesian diplomatic establishments in the United States and,
