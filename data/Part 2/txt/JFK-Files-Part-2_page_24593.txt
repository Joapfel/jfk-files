Missile Crisis. An interagency "Cuban Coordinating Committee'' 
was established within the State Department with resrmnsibility 
for developing covert action proposals. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 148.)

1963 Crtba policy. These are: (1) the Standing Group's discris­
sion of possible developrnerits in the event of Castro's death; 
(2) the Standing Gr6up's discussion of policy options; (3) th~ 
covert action program approved by the Special Group; and (4) the· 
diplomatic .effort to explore the possibility of reestablishing re~ 
lations with Castro. The first three of these took place in the 
Spring or 'early Summer of 1963; the fourth aspect -- the effort 
to communicate with Castro -- took place at-the same time as the ... , 
1963 assassination activity.
