The Committee seeks ·to determine the nature of 
the reldtionships between FBI intelligence 
activities and state and local law enforcement 
·agencies. This subject involves the delicate 
balance between the necessary centralization 
of certain law enforcement activities and the 
Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of 
general law enforcement responiibility. It is 
necessary for the Committee to evaluate the 
centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as. 
the FBI's role as a·check on local law enforce­
ment abuses.
