In December, 1963, the CIA learned that 
a Cuban American had crossed the border 
from Texas into Mexico, on November 23 
and arrived in Mexico City on November 25. 
He stayed in a hotel until the evening of 
November 27, when he departed on a 
regularly scheduled·Cubana airlines flight 
to Havana using a Cuban courtesy visa and 
an expired U.S. passport. He was the only 
passenger on the flight. In March, 1964 
the Agency received a report from a 
source which alleged that the same Cuban 
American had received a permit to enter 
Mexico City on November 20 in Tampa, 
Florida. The same source said the Cuban 
American was somehow involved in the 
assassination. 
The Agency did not follow up on this 
report other than to ask a Cuban 
defector about his knowledge of the 
Cuban American's activities. The FBI 
did investigate the reported unusual 
travel but did not fully report the 
results of their investigation to their 
Warren Commission. Their investigation 
showed that this individual had lived 
in Tampa and Key West and was pro-Castro. 
He had traveled to Cuba in May of 1962 
and had a brother in the Cuban military 
who was studying in the Soviet Union. 
On November 17, 1963, the Cuban American 
was at a get-together at the homi of a 
member of the Tampa chapter of the Fair 
Play for Cuba Committee. This was the 
same Fair Play for Cuba Committee that 
Oswald had possibly contacted in May of 
1963.
