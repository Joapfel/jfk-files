The "working files" is a group of records that was assembledi~~i;h'ti:~-l'X::::·:.':

to create this separate records group, he did so in otder to facilitate·Jt>. :, (:?--rt~ 
his work and,_perhaps, to satisfy his own curiosity. t:he group , • ·d-',.'.·· . :.·--~·· • :: • 
. . .. . . contains many original records·(copies of some of which are __ .<,,;;: ·/. •• 
already in the collection) and it includes som~ records of which w~\{~~~ ><· 
are aware of no other copies. _Itis the best-organized :collection of.:,-,'? ·•t~i ._ 
assassination records held by CIA. Its value as a referenre;tool.-is '· 
greatest as a collection.· Therefore, th,ough the ~ contains m.any ,:k~i 
duplicates of records found in the JFK collection; the ARRB staff 
• recommends that it be preserved as a single group. Duplicates and 
open-in-full documents should be ~tecl in the s~e manner as 
they are in the rest of the JFK Coll~on. • As.with the microfilm 
• from the Sequ~tered Collection, the ARRB staff has no objection to 
the records being identified on the folder level provided that all • 
~ords in the folder are open-in-full. -H there are records in'which 
CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified 
individually. The remainder of open in full records may still be 
identified ·with one RIF as being the contents of the.same folder.
