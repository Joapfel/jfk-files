However, both General Taylor and Admiral Burke stated that neither 
Bissell nor Dulles infonned them of the assassination plots (Taylor, pp. 72-73; 
Burke affidavit, 8/25/75, p. 3). 
When asked if Richard Bissell ever infonned him that undenvorld figures 
had been offered a large sum to assassinate Castro, General Taylor responded, 
"No, I never heard that, and it amazes me" (Taylor, p. 72). Taylor said that 
during his review of the Bay of Pigs operation no mention was made of an 
assassination effort against Castro (Taylor, p. 72). Despite the fact that 
Dulles met with Taylor on the Board of Inquiry thirty or. forty times, Taylor 
testified that Dulles never told him about ·the plot (Taylor, p. 73). 
(iv) MEMJRANDUM TO THE ATTORNEY GENEAAL 
Bissell's testimony that he had not disclosed assassination plots to 
the Kennedy/Taylor "court of inquiry" was consistent with his statement that 
"I have no knowledge that Robert Kennedy was 
advised of this (the plot to kill :Mr. Castro)." 
(Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 41). 
The Committee tested this statement against other parts of Bissell's 
testimony. An attachment to the May 22, 1961 FBI memorandum (regarding the 
Las Vegas tap) which Director Hoover had sent to the Attorney General* had 
quoted Edwards as saying that Bissell in "recent briefings" of Taylor and 
Kennedy, 
"told the Attorney General·that some of the 
associated planning included the use of 
Giancana and the underworld against Castro." 
(Bissell, 7 /17 /75, Ex. 3). 
When first shown this document, Bissell said, 
* A handwritten note from the Attorney General to his assistant on the 
face of the memorandum indicates that he had actually·seen the.document": This 
memorandum is discussed in detail at Section , infra.
