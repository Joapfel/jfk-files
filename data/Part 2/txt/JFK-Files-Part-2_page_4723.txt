message back, and the first thing it says is, "Didn't get your reference . 
. What are you talking about?" So we had to h1t them again. You know, explain 
what happened. And, but that's an example of. He's reluctant. You know, 
if he's got a firm view of something, it's tough to get him to change his mind. 
INTERVIEWER: When did you work with him again after that? 
MR. HALPERN: Oh, actually --
INTERVIEWER: Saigon. 
MR. HALPERN: That was '61 and I guess the next time I worked with him again 
very closeJy was when I was for three or-~four months his his Exec. When he 
came back from Saigon, and Dick make him the Executive Director Comptroller, I 
had some dealings with him because I was the Exec in DDP and just working with 
him. It wasn'•t that close in terms of the way I did in Saigon, the way I did 
later in his own office ... I .just saw him the other day as a matter of fact 
at a meeting. I was in town. We're still friends. We say hello to each 
other. 
INTERVIEWER: And you were his Exec for three or four months. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, he took over from Tom in February of '73 and I was 
. 
reassigned out of his office, I think it was May '73. So it's March, April, 
May -- three months for sure -- and a couple of weeks in February and a couple 
of weeks in May. SO it's roughly three, three to four months. 
INTERVIEWER: So you were there when that memo was being prepared? 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah. 
INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. 
MR. HALPERN: That's why I keep saying, I keep telling my friends, "You're 
blaming the wrong guy!"
