(Whereupon, at 12 :_00 
hearing room. ) 
The Chairman. All right. 
You understand that the oath still applies t.o this part 
of the testimony? 
Mr. Schwarz.will renew th~ questioning. 
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, I want to call your attention now 
to 1963, the Missile Criais is over. Was there another reassess~ 
m~nt of Cuban policy in the winter and spring of '63? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes, there was. 
Mr. Schwarz. Again, did that reassessment of Cuban policy 
involve a lot of reassessment of a lot of options? 
Mr. Bundy. That is my refreshed recollection. 
Mr. Schwarz. All right. 
We've shown you a lot·of documents, mostly by you in that 
period, but some to you as well, and was one of the options the 
consideration of the possibility that Mr. Castro might defect \ 
I 
I 
18 or might be communicated to in a way that would bring him around 
19 more closely to the United States? 
20 Mr. Bundy. ·The question of opening communications with 
21 Fidel Castro arises in 1963, I think at more than one time, 
22 and without having my attention drawn to specific.documents, I 
23 wouldn't b~ able to spell that o~t very much. 
24 Mr. Schwarz. But you agree that it is in there, and it 
25 is in there?
