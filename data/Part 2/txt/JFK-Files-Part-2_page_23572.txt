MEMORANDUM FOR MR. RICHARD GOODWIN 
SUBJECT: Cuban Covert Plan 
Analysis of this plan shows that it envisages {a) "an island-wide 
resistance organization responsive to Agency direction 11 ; "internal 
assets under close Agency control and direction"; {b) "support and 
guidance to those anti-Castro groups who are revealed to have a 
potential for clandestine operations"; a~d (c) "primary operations 
bases 11 in the US. In short, what i.s intended is a CIA underground 
formed on criteria of operational convenience rather than a Cuban 
underground formed on criteria of building political strength sufficient 
to overthrow Castro, : • 
Despite the pretense of political impartiality, the effect of these CIA 
specifications is obviously to favor '.those groups most willing to accept 
CIA identification and control, and to discriminate against those groups 
most eager to control their own operations. I.e., the plan discrimi­
nates in favor of mercenaries, reactionaries, etc., and discriminates 
against men of independence and principle. Thus these criteria elimi­
nate the Manuel Ray group; yet I tan find nowhere in the documents 
any explicit exclusion of pro-Batist~ people. 
Leaving aside the moral merits of this discrimination, the practical 
effect is to invest our resources in the people least capable of generating 
broad support within Cuba. The Agency fails to confront the key prob­
lem: i.e., that those most capable of rallying popular support against 
the Castro regime are going to be more independent, more principled 
and perhaps even more radical than the compliant and manageable 
types which CIA would prefer for operational purposes. 
My recommendation is that" you stop this paper in its pre sent form and 
demand that it be recast to make political sense. The key is the
