Israeli intelltgence activities in the United States, which has

of Is.raeli- diplomatic represe:nt;a_tiues. •. ·In the spring of ·1954, when 
the Guatemalan revolutton was brewt~g, we opened rather extensive 
coverage of the Guatemalan Embassy and developed intelligence. • 
information of interest to other.Uo So agencieso We have developed 
i,n/orma_nts in the diplomatic establtshments 'of China., Indonesia, 
Japan a:nd ·Korea,· and are making efforts to. develop inf.arm.ants in the· 
embassies o/ Ceylon and India. • •

the codes and cyphers oJ' /ore-£~ countries, we, have obtained code· 
material of India., Israel., Nationalist Chtna, Japan, ·Yugoslavia, 
The Philippines, Swit2erland, Guatemala, West Germany, and Spatn, 
which has been of inestimable value in ·the cryptanalysis field. 
While we have. stayed away from Untted Nations as such,

OBSERVATIONS 
1:..£ The Bur~u is an 'l ntelligence organt:iati on and a large portion 
, of our prestige is the result of intelli,gence-type operations 
( successfully handled. It is far better /or us to consider this 
1 
problem now rather than to have someone else raise the issue 
.later and perhaps /orce us into a program we do not want.· 
. 2. Whi,le the coverage o/- the ''friendly" diplomatic establishments 
re/erred to above has met with some success, particularly insofar 
s the Anagram Progran "£s concerned, the /act remains that there 
is no u. s. agency presently attempting to cover, on a continuing 
asis, the diplomattc .establishments o/ • ''friendly" countries tn 
he United States, to .the extent that the Untted States might be­
ware o/ thetr intelligence activities in this coU,ntry, their 
actual attitude toward the u.s., their relations with the Soviet 
bloc, and their plans in internatt onal affair~, particularly as 
they relate to the u.s. •
