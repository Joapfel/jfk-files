**Foll.owing .the September 4 election, the CIA' s Di rec tor ate. of Intelli-• 
gence circulated an in~elligence community assessment of the impac_t of 
an Allende gOver·nment on U.S. national interests. That assessment, 
dated September 7, 1970, stated: 
.Regarding threats to U.S. ~nterests, we conclude that: 
1. _The U.S. has n6 vital national interests within Chile. 
There would, however, be tangible economi~ ·losses. 
2. The world military balance of power would not be sig­
nificantly altered ·by an Allende government. 
3. An Allende victory wOuld, however, create conside.r­
able.political and psychological costs: 
a. Hemispheric cohes.ion would be threatened by 
the challenge that an Allende government. 
would pose to.the OAS, and by the reactions 
that it would ~reate in other countries. 
We do not see, howevei, ·any· likely threat 
to th~ p~ace of the region. 
b. An Allende victory would represent· a defin­
ite psychological set-back to the U.S. and 
a definite psychological ~dvance foi the· 
Marxist idea. (Intelligence· Memorandum/
