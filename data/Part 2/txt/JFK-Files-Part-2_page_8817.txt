on the situation in Puerto Rico after the assassination 
of President Kennedy. SANTOS, the agent who actually 
receives all messages transmitted to PAMELA was to 
contact AB--N (illegible) and have him report on the 
development of any of the following situations: 
a. if a contingent of gusano (worm) Cubans has 
arrived there; 
b. if mobilization of resident gusano Cubans is noticed; 
c. if mobilization of U.S. forces is noticed; 
d. if the Cubans who arrived and those who were there 
before have "developed circulation;" 
e. if activities of repressive organs against popular 
forces have increased. 
A special transmission was scheduled for the following 
Thursday at the same time. As there were no adverse develop­
ments in the situation after the President's death, 
this subject was not dealt with in the special transmission 
made on 29 Nov (1963).
