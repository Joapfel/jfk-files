first meeting, although it is certainly expected that it could be 
completed much more quickly~ The point is to proc~ed 
expeditiously, while still doing a careful job. 
We faced a difficult choice in deciding who should appoint 
th~ Review Board, and I am aware your Committee is looking at 
other alternatives. I am certainly amenable to this, but let me 
give you some id~a of why we came out as we did. Given the 
allegations of government cover-up and the potential for perceived 
conflict of interest, allowing the President or Congress to 
appoint the Board did not seem appropriate. We settled instead on 
the special three-judge federal court division that appoints 
independent counsels for criminal investigations~

Chairman Glenn, worries that "it is not clear" that our approach 
to appointing the Review Board is constitutional. In addition, 
some may feel that a judicial pa~el is ill-suited to make 
appointments for this task. The judges themselves, who have very 
II 
small staffs and other concerns, might well prefer to avoid this 
assignment. In short, we r~cognized that this approach would 
raise possible constitutional objections, as well as practical 
ones, but, on balance, we felt the appointment authority should 
rest with an impartial source without no interest or stake in the 
outcome. I believe a strong argument can be made that the 
appointment process is constitu~ional under the principles 
enunciated by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654
