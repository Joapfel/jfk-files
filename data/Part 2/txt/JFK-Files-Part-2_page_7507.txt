SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and 
Unidentified Man 
That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with 
the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet 
Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man" 
was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of 
"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964. 
According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the 
USSR in 1964.; in the U.S. in Q.::tober 1963 . 
MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist 
and often attends international conferences. He 
has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in 
the U.S. 
MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of 
"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved 
in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims: 
he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in 
Dallas on 20 November. 
That he hi:.d been to Mexico City, had a contact in 
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew tr,e 
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been 
fingered to him in Mexico City.
