2. Cable to JMWAVE from DIR, 7 May 1964 - After looking at AMTAUP material, 
it is obvious nuch of conspiratorial talk in JUP3 is for internal consumption 
only, the purpose being to protect myth that JURE is independent as basically 
hostile to CIA. In a desire to obtain proof of any anti-CIA or U.S. govt. 
activity by Ray, urge every effort to check accuracy of AIIIT.AUP / P.JAOT reporting 
and follow through for any overt manifestations of many allegations made.
