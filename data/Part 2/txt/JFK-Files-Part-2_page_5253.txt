and the U.S. Government, I wiil be the recipient of information which, in itself, or by the im­
plications to be drawn therefrom, will be such that its unlawful disclosure or loose handling 
may adversely affect the interest and the security of the United States. I realize that the 
methods of collecting and of using this information, as well as the identity of persons involved, 
are as secret as the substantive information itself and, therefore, must be treated by me with 
an equal degreeofsecrecy. 
2. I shall always recognize that the U.S. Government has the sole interest in all informa­
tion which I or my organization may possess, compile or acquire pursuant to this understan­
ding. No advantage or gain will be sought by me as a result of the added significance or value 
such information may have, due to the Government's interest in it. 
3. I solemnly pledge my word that I will never divulge, publish, nor reveal either by word, 
conduct, or by any other means such information or knowledge, as indicated above, unless 
specifically authorized to do so, by the U.S. Government. 
4. Nothing in this understanding is to be taken as imposing any restriction upon the nor­
mal business practices of myself or my organization: i.e., information normally possessed by us 
or gathered in the regular course of business will continue to be utilized in accordance with our 
normal practices.
