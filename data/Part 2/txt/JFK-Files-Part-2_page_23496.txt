TRUJILLO 
"I am sure there was no discussion with EISEMlO\VER about the 
assassination of TRUJILLO." 
"I don't see how the DCI and the Department of State could have 
approved anns shipments without going up to the Special Group. The 
DCI should have taken a suggested course of action to the Special Group 
after checking with State." 
Gray said: ~hig~ -powered weapon with a telescopic site would 
connote to me that it would be used for the purpose of assassinating an 
individual." 
CUBA 
Gray said that Prcsic.lent EISENHOh'ER would frequently remark at 
mcetii7.gs on Cuba that an operation should be planned so that it would be 
carried through successfully, othen-1ise it should not be planned at all. 
Referring to the minutes of the Special Group meeting of February 17, 
1960, Gray said. that at some point during that period. of time, Allen 
DULLES brought his sugar mill sabotage plan to President EISENHOWER, who 
listened attentively. Aftcn-,rard, the President said, "I don't think 
sabotage of sugar mills will do something significant. Bring me a complete 
plan." Subsequently, DULLES brought the President a four-point program: 
propaganda; economic sanction; sabotage; and the training of Cuban exiles. 
GRAY said the Presic.lent approved this memo. (Note that Gray also said that he 
made a memo of this meeting and subsequent meetings on Cuba.)
