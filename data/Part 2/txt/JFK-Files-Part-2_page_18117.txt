WASHINGTON, D.C. 20530 
SEP 91975 
TO: Joff~z, Assistant Director 
Le Counsel Division 
Fe ~ral Bureau of Investigation 
'L FROM: Michael E. Shaheen, Jr. 
/7 Special Counsel for Intelligence 
Coordination 
SUBJECT?'senate Select Comrtlttee Request' 
The attached letter is self-explanatory and, put in distilled 
fo:rm, asks the following question: 
Are employees of the IRS who supplied tax returns or tax 
return information to agents of the FBI in response to formal or 
informal requests made by Bureau agents to be characterized as -
"confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed I\ y 
by the Select Committee? µ' 
Because the Attorney General and the Bureau have previously 
addressed the Bureau's position on the nondisclosure of its sources 
for interview purposes by the SSC staff, and because the issue raised 
in the attached letter may represent a clear exception to the earlier 
resolution of the Bureau's COINTELPRO-sources problem, I am forwarding 
this to you for your prompt attention and views for early transmittal 
to the Attorney General. I shall appreciate the receipt of your 
views on or befor~ COB Thursday, September 11, 1975.
