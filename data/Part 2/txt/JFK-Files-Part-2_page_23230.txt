This leaves us With one or two elter-
natives,eithcr ·the Chief of Station who has appeared and 
testified although not necessarily reluctantly, but certainly 
reluctantly as to substance of his testimony, in not telling

privy to what was going on. 
Mr. Tveedy~ Or I literally don't recall it. Thie ie my 
problem, I will tell you quite frankly with these things~­
Mr. Davaon. It ia 15 years ago. 
Mr. Tweedy. I really am having trouble with this, I 
had to be reminded of so many things about the things that 
I rocall the moet vividly about ~11 my African experiences 
were basically the things I wae basically concerned with all 
the time which was putting this •ctivision toge~her and the 
reet of it. 
When it comes to operational detail I start getting 
fuzzy and you would have thought with something like thinking 
about Mr. Lumumba in these terms, that I ~uld have gone to 
bed and got up thinking about Lumu~ba, I can assure you this 
wasn 1 t the case. 
I spent days in a row not even giving l,umumba ono 
~ingle bloody thought. This is my problem . 
Mr. Dawson. Let's try to jog your memory on this. 
Do you recall
