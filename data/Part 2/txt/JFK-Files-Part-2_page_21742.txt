Mr. Baron. Were there any precautions taken against 
dissemination in America of publications by CIA proprietaries 
in English? 
Mr. Hunt. Proprietaries, well, my only personal knowledge 
is the peration which I say was simply mailed 
out of Washington. That was the only precaution, rather than 
our people mailing them themselves. 
Mr. Baron. Were any techniques used to prevent contamina-
10 tion of American intelligence by picking up on things that the 
11 CIA was actually publishing or arranging to have published?

Mr. Hunt. I would assume so, and I would guess that that 
would be done in the first instance by the knowledgeability of 
the reports officers in the various geographic divisions at 
headquarters who would scan newspapers, for example, or they 
would receive raw reports from let's say, and see that 
there had been a big sale of a particular book which we had 
spon~ored, which they knew we had sponsored but nobody else 
knew. Of course, ould have known about 
it, too. 
So I would say that it was a pretty good fail-safe. The 
area of knowledgeability was high. For one thing, I traveled 
some in those days. I traveled to ~ombay. r: talked to the
