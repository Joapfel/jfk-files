SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination Records 
--=On the subject of ·cable, dispatch and file numbers,.:_there 
is no objection to the release of this information as it 
pertains to Mexico City, to include 201 numbers of key players 
in the JFK story. All hqs cable numbers can be released as can 
dispatch numbers to Mexico City. The release of cable/dispatch 
numbers from other Stations can only be done if there has been 
prior public identification of a Station in that location. The 
release of file numbers pe se, however, would reveal the 
methodology by which we file/store and retrieve information-· 
which is still in practice today and thus we cannot approve it 
on a blanket basis. Blanket release of 201 numbers reveals 
similar information as well as targeting/acquistion • 
methodologies which we similarly need to continue to protect. 
2. I realize that the above guidelines continue to mean 
that much information will be "blacked out." As bad as it may 
appear, none of this information· is subs tan ti ve· and its 
omission does not detract from the "story ... 'Its release, 
however, could permi~ detailed analyses of our commo, 
methodology, contacts and staffing which we cannot accept. 
New Subject: Release of William Pawley's name 
3. It is agreed that an attempt will be made to locate 
P~wley's next of kin to request their permission to release 
information pertaining to his relationship with CIA. If the 
next of kin cannot be indentified or located, the subject can 
be revisited. (Note: the information in the Congressional 
record or in the.book "Deadly Secrets" notes that there was 
contact and even support between Pawley and the CIA but does 
not identify the full extent of that relationship.)
