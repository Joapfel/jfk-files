This is controlled program to develop 1 ive sources --~'~f-,-~ 
in diplomatic establishments of countries outside Sovf_et bloc {-\·?:~-.(fU> 
aimed at producing investigative and intelligence data on countrie·s{\J"'f. 
drif..t ing toUXlrd Soviet bloc and on "trouble spot" countries. ·,l ··• 
.. , .,· 
. We have recogn ~ zed de~ icacy of deve_l oping sburces wi thi~ __ ·!.riia ' 
establishments of ostensibly friendly countries and in view of fi[ -
close interrelationship with questions of foreign policy we have v 
in past regularly consulted Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs 
in State Department to be certain we were not running into risky 
foreign policy situation whereby, if State not consulted, State could 
later say our activities had posed serious problems. To insure our 
efforts did not run afoul of foreign policy considerations we adopted 
"]-step" procedure: (1) we had liaison check with State orally when 
we selected particular country as logical target; (2) if State agreed 
on target country we, by individual letters, secured State clearanc •·. 
prior to investigation of each potential source; and (J) if . J 
investigation favorable we, by individual letters, secured State ~' 
clearance ;/ot. i'nitidl. interview with potential source to assess ·l j 
potenti~l, reliability, stability, etc. This gave State three poi s\ 
where they could advise us our objectives were too risky considering 
foreign policy implications. As noted in my memo 5-29-59 this has 
not worked satisfactorily because State has consistently UXlited until 
step (J) to decline clearance after we had expended considerable effort. 
It u:as noted that in dealing with Bureau of Sec~rity and Consular 
Affairs we were dealing with super-cautious group which lacked real 
authorityo In view of UXlsteful expenditure of effort created by this 
situation it 1.IXJ,S\recommended we have liaison go to Deputy Under 
Secretary of State Robert Murphy, vho is knowledgeable of intelligence 
junctions, to work out something practical. • 
On 6-2-59 this UXlS discussed with Murphy by our liaison 
representative, o. Ho Bartlett. Murphy did not know we had been 
,.r having this problem and said he would appreciate our coming to him 
<:t. on these matters and depending on each individual case he would make-. 
-~ determinationo He suggested Bartlett come to him and give him facts 
\\.\by letterhead memo or any other system Bureau desired and he would. 
1 ··~t;;! then grant approval immediately or check where n.ecessary. . .'
