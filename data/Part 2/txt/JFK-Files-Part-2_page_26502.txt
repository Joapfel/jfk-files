27 March 1963 
URUGUAY 
1. There were about 115 legal travelers to Cuba 
from Uruguay in 1962, and an additional 20-25 in Janu­
ary 1963. About 25, mainly Paraguayan exiles resident 
in Uruguay, are believed to have traveled illegally. 
2. Probably no significant portion of the Uru­
guayan travelers went for guerrilla warfare training. 
Cuba apparently wants to preserve Montevideo, which is 
host to the most extensive Communist diplomatic mis­
sions in all South America, as a gateway and base of 
operations, as in the case of Mexico. 
3. Cuban subversion activity oriented toward 
Uruguay appears to consist largely of developing and 
maintaining enough political action and propaganda 
assets to counter any Uruguayan inclination to oust 
or restrict the activities of Cuban and Bloc missions. 
4. The only· arrests for sabotage occurred during 
the recent electricity and telephone strike, which 
arose from worker grievances and had no Cuban connec­
tion. All of those arrested were released within a 
week.
