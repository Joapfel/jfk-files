8. Dominican Republic 
The country's two militant p~o-Communist or­
ganizations, the 14th of June Political Group (APCJ) 
and the Dominican Popular Movement (MPD), are faith­
ful supporters of Castro. Havana Radio quickly 
voiced support for last December's abortive APCJ 
guerrilla campaign, but we have no firm evidence 
of Cuban material support for this effort. The 
quiclt response from Radio Havana suggests, how-
ever, the existence of a communications link with 
one or more pro-Castro organizations in the country. 
Quick response by Havana to unrest in the Dominican 
Republic also was reflected during the transit 
workers strike in early May. 
One Dominican who has received guerrilla train­
ing in Cuba organized the 14th of June Revolutionary 
Movement (MR 14J) earlier this year out of the old 
APCJ and MPD. The immediate aim of this new or­
ganization is to promote urban terrorism. Ater­
rorist captured by police in mid-March is said to 
have told police that this group is receiving arms
