Re: Interview with James Douglas on Lumumba Assassination Case. 
I spoke by phone today with James Douglas, who was 
Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration 
from early Dec~mber 1959 untii January 21, 1961. 
Mr. Douglas served under DOD Secretary Thomas Gates. 
I interviewed Mr. Douglas because of a reference to him 
in Douglas Dillon's testimony (Dillon, p.19). Dillon said that 
in a phone conversation with Gates about the Pentagon meeting 
(at which Dillon said someone raised the question of assassi­
nating Lwnumba) Gates named James Douglas as a person likely 
to have attended such a meeting. 
Never Heard Suggestion of Assassination 
Mr. Douglas said that during his tenure in office, he 
never heard a suggestion of the assassination of Lumumba raised 
in his presence. "I never heard speculation that it was even 
on anyone's mind," he said. 
Pentagon Meeting 
Mr. Douglas does not recall a meeting at the Pentagon 
in the summer of 1960 (as recounted by Douglas Dillon) where 
the question of assassinating Lumumba was raised. Mr. Douglas 
says that it was possible that he attended such a meeting, but 
he has· no recollection of it. 
Special Group Meetings 
Mr. Douglas attended Special Group meetings with some 
regularity. Frequently, however, these meetings were attended 
by Mr. Irwin,· who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter­
national Security Affairs during that period. Douglas said 
that Irwin was "more actively in contact with the State Depart­
ment and the CIA during this time." (Irwin is now practicing 
law in New York.) 
Mr. Douglas said that the question of assassination of 
Lwnwnba was not raised in his presence at a Special Group meeting.
