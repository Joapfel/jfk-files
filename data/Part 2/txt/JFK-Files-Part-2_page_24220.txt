VI. ProJe·c"t · MHBOUND 
In 1958, at the time construction of the new CIA headquarters 
building in Langley was begun, a small counterintelligence opera­
tion was established to maintain surveillance of activities to 
prevent hostile penetration and sabotage. It was successful in 
its objectives and, therefore, upon occupancy of the· building 
in 1962 the Project, now known as MHBOUND, was established as an 
outgrowth of the initial effort. 
From a single office in Arlington, Virginia, the project ex­
panded to four field offices (Arlington, Falls Church, Los Angeles 
and_St.- Louis). Also, it grew from a single corporate entity into 
J 
three separate corporations. The parent organization in 1962 was 
Anderson Enterprises, Inc., which operated in the greater Washing­
ton area and was set up to create a bona fide commercial corpor­
ation which would perform security services on a competitive basis 
for any and all individuals and companies which might require 
them, as well as Federal and local governmental units. In addi­
tion, it would conduct operations for the Office of Security of 
the CIA. This activity proved most successful, with customers 
utilizing it for document destruction, :for consultation, for 
guard work, and for investigations. 
Anderson Enterprises, Inc. developed legitimate business 
contracts with agencies of the Federal government and with commer­
