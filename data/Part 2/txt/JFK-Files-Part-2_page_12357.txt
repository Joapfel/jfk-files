cooperate with any public or private individual or agency, advise him he 
must make that decision himself, but if he has appeared as Government

such situations and results of any interviews conducted.

ment to Bureau, make arrangements to have former informant come to field 
office where he will be personally met by SAC. At that time, he should be 
impressed with fa.ct that his services were appreciated and were of consid­

ment when he was active as informant to maintain his relation with Bureau 
on confidential basis. SAC should stress necessity for informant to w~in-
