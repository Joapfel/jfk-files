WffiET APPING 
The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary . 
Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone ~nd wiretapping 
were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United 
. Stateso Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to 
legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a 
letter to the Department dated March 6, · 1967, concerning legislation· 
proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and 
use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga­
tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would 
be very benef icia~ to our efforts in the field of organized crime and 
would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being . 
followed in connection ,vith use of such devices in national security 
matters. Microphones ,vere of inestimable value in determining 
La Cosa N ostra ·weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves, • 
and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa­
tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa 
Nostra sources of income. 
In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior 
microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals 
courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such 
cases which were actually brought to trialo In several casesj notably,

Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami, 
Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each 
instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our 
• position that these cases ,vere not taintedo In the Black case and in 
the Sohipani case in Ne,v York; t.he Supreme Court has remanded for
