(2) War with China would in fact be a war of mutual attrition 
and even In the case of a formal Soviet victory and a 
change-over In Chinese leadership - the U.S.S.R. w1·1 I be 
unable to feed the hungry masses_of China.· Acco~ding to 
GVISHYANI, there are a hundred mil llon hunsry people in 
China, and In the U.S.S.R. there ls not enough food for 
the popu I at ton. A Soviet v 1 ctory \'IOU Id thus doub I e the 
needs ·of the Soviet Union In this respect and would put 
too great a strain on her economy. 
2. From some conversations mainly with KHALIPOV, Source concluded that 
t:-,o Soviet Union is preparing for· war with Western Europe rather than 
•ith China; here are his. reasons: 
a. The substitution of old weapons for new ones takes place first and 
foremost in the western parts of the Soviet Union, and not on the 
border with China, except in the VLADIVOSTOK area, and this not be­
cause It Is near to China, but, mainly, because it ts near to the 
U.S.A. 
b •. According to KHALIPOV, two or three days wlll be enough for·the­
Sov i et Army to conquer Western Europe and he e I aborated_: 
-England has about 920 tanks and 1500 planes; 
France - about 900 tanks and about 1500 planes; 
~ermany - about 500 tanks and about 1000 planes; 
Al I this put together Is but about a sixth of what the U.S.S.R. 
can put In the field against the West within 2 or 3 days; and 
• untl I the \'lest decides on counter-measures it \'Ii 11 be too late.
