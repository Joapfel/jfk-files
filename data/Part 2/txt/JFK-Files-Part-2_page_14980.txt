CRIME LEGISLATION 
The Congress is presently holding hearings with 
respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled 
"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967." This Act has its 
basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-
- mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. 
The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime 
in a Free Socj:e.ty" was released February 18, 1967. The pro-
• posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid 
program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the 
purpose of purchase of equipment, training, _education and 
research. It would also establish in the Department of Justice 
an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of 
Law Enforcement and Crin1inal Justice Assistance. Depending 
on how this nev1 legislation would be administered within the 
Department ·of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict 
with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law 
enforcement.
