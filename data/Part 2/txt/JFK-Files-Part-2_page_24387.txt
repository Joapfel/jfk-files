Based upon the record of our investigation, the Committee's 
single most important finding is that the system was such that assassina­
tion activity could have been undertaken by s.n agency of tl,1e United State·s 
Government without it having been uncontrovertibly clear that there was 
explicit authorization from the highest level. 
Alons with that paramount con~lusion, the Co,nr,1ittec r,1akcs four other 
major fimlin 0 s.* The first relates to the lack of direct evidence of authori­
zation of the assassination plots by Presidents or other persons above the 
Governmental a 0 ency or .:13encies involved. The second c;:plains wlty certain 
officials may have, nonetheless, perceived tTiat, accordinr, to their jud;:;r.ient

and experience, assassination was &n acceptable course of action. The third 
criticiz;;-;;~~~-c;;-;ff~~ials for failing on several occasio,1s to rie':{f 1Ehi'.fr ( 
plans and activities to superior authorities, or for failing to do so with 
sufficient detail and clarity. The fourth .criticizes Adr.,inistration officials 
for, on.occasion, siving vague and indirect instructions to subordinates, and 
for not making sufficiently clear that assassination should 
consiclera tion. 774,4::r 
- There is admittedly a tension within the four findin::;s. The first 
and third points tend to su;sgest a lack of authority uhile the second and 
fourth points explain uhy agency officials could nonetheless have perceived 
that their actions were proper. This tension reflects a basic conflict in the 
evidence.· Hhile there are some conflicts over facts, it is more irJportant 
that there may often.have been two differing perceptions of the same facts. 
This distinction nmy be the result of ci1e differin~ backgrounds anJ ex-
perience of those persons experiencecl in covert operations as distinquisheJ
