collect information from Mr. Sturgis? 
A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

American Division before they did anything since we do hold 
the file.

A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any 
information r,,lacing to an individual appearing in the press

A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
