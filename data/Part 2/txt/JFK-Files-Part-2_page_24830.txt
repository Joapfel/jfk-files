Colonel Roth. 'That was my impression at the time. 
Q. You understand from your work in the Defense Department

The CIA produced copies of several messages which identify 
Generals Bennett and Philpott as either the sender or recipient. Among 
these documents is a message relating to Track II which bears Philpott's 
purported signature. (Undated message. ca. 14 October 1970) General 
Philpott admitted that the signature appears to be his but doubted that 
it was and he could not recall signing it, or having s~en it. (Philpott, 
p. ) CIA also produced ~essages of October 14 (Headquarters 762) 
and October 21 (Headquarters 934) conveying instructions from General 
Bennett to the Army Attache_. General Bennett testified he did not 
authorize these messages: 
It is beyond the responsibilities which I had in the military 
assistance area. It goes beyond the responsibility which I 
had in terms that I· would have to get the au'thori ty or the 
approval of the Secretary through the Chairman for covert 
action of this magnitude. This message would not have been 
signed by me. (Bennett testimony, p. 21) 
According to Karamessines, only the White House had the authority to· 
issue the directives contained in those messages (Karamessines testi-
mony, p. 84) 
The Department of Defense was unable to provide any documents bear­

DOD file search under the direction of General Daniel 0. Graham, the 
present Director of DIA, produced no copies of communication documents 
for the September-October 1970 peri0<;L (Graham, p. 6) However, Roth 
testified that detailed memoranda for tl;ie record which he prepared on
