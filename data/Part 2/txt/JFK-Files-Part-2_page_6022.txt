SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
B. A "book cable," DIR 85133, dated 26 Nov. 1963 
(date/time group 262319Z) was sent. This message was 
sent "routine" but with ten addressees on a "prior-ity 
basis." The ten "priority" addressees were: Paris, 
Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, Brussels, The 
Hague, London, and Ottawa. This cable advised all 
stations and bases of the identity of the alleged 
assassin by name of Lee Harvey Oswald. This cable can 
be found in Oswald's 201 file, Box 1, Volume 4. • 
C. Neither of these two cables indicates that a 
"routing" coding was to be used to ensure that all 
responses, if any, would be classified to Oswald's 201 
file. 
8. (U) I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE 
FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT. 
Executed in Langley, Virginia on this 2nd day of September 
1998.
