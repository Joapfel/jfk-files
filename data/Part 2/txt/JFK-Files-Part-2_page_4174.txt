Notes on Remarks by President Kennedy before the National Security Council 
Tuesday, January 22, 1963 
I will start by reviewing areas or policy which will be before us 
in the coming months and indicate the general attitllde which I have toward 
them and to emphasize where we might put our emphasis in the next few months. 
·The responsibilities or the United States are worldwide and the U.S. 
is the only country which is recognizing its wide responsibilities. 'We are 
part of NATI, SEATO, etc. and support other pacts even though.we are not 
a part of them. Other nations are not doing their share • 
. Would like to say a word first about Cuba. 
The indications are that the importance or timing is or paramount 
importance in reaching judgments - both by the USSR and the US. Our big 
problem is to protect our interests and prevent a nuclear war. It was a 
very close thing whether we would engage in a quarantine or an air strike. 
In looking back, it was rea~ly that it presented us with an immediate crises 
and the USSR had to make their judgment and come to a decision to act . in 
twelve hours. In looking back over that four or five day period, we all 
changed our views somewhat, or at least appreciated the advantages end 
disadvantages ·or· alternate cources or, action. That is what we should do 
in any other struggle with the Soviet Union - and I believe we will be 
in one in the future. 'We should have sufficient time to consider the 
alternatives. You could see that the Russians had a good deal or debate 
in a 48 hour period. If they had only to act in an hour or tw, their 
actions would have been spa~odic and might have resulted in nuclear var. 
It is important that we have time to study their reaction. Ve should 
continue our policy even though we do not get Europe to go along with us.
