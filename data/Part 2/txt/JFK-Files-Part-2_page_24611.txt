S. ·Helms' Report to Rusk that CIA was not Involved with Amlash in a 
Castro Assassination Plot 
In March 1966, Helms reported to Rusk by memorandum on the CIA's re­
lations with Amlash. (RuskEx. 7, Memorandum, March 7, 1966, Helm.s to Rusk). 
In this report, Helms stated that the CIA's contact with Amlash was for "the 
express purpose" of intelligence collection. (Id.). Noting Cuban press 
claims that Amlash and a second Cuban had been involved with the CIA in a 
Castro assassinatioQ ~lot, Helms stated: 
The Agency was not involved with either of 
th~se two men in a plot to assas~inate 
Fidel Castro, as claimed in;-;;_ Cuban news 
release7 nor did it ever encourage either 
of these two persons to attempt such an act. 
(Rusk Ex. 7, p. 1). 
The Helms memorandum to Rusk made no mention of the fact that CIA officers, 
with Helms' knowledge, had offered a poison pen to Amlash on November 22, 1963, 
that CIA had supplied arms to Amlash in 196li, or that CIA had put Amlash in touch 
with B-1 to enable him to obtain a silenced weapon to assassinate Castro. 
In his testimony, Helms stated that this memorandum to Rusk was "inaccurate" 
and "not truthful". (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 115.) 
TI1e CIA's copy of the Helms' memorandum to Rusk contains a typed notation 
in which Helms' signature was recommended by the CIA's then Deputy Director for 
Plans, Thomas Kararnessines. (Rusk Ex. 7, p. 2.) Helms testified that the day 
before his June 13, 1975, testimony to.the Corrunittee he had asked Kararnessines 
why the memorandum to Rusk had been written as it was. Helms stated he and Kara, 
messines concluded they did not know the reason but Helms speculated that "it 
may be until we conducted (the 1967 IG investigation) somewhat later we didn't 
have the facts straight, or maybe we had the facts straight then but we did not 
'"have them straight later". ··(Helms, 6/13/75, p. 115.)
