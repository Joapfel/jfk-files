It was about that time that General Cushman was still 
assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem 
to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days. He 
was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we 
had shared an office at one time, but that was several years 
earlier. I would place it about early 1949. But I'm quite 
sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and 
involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I 
don't know. 
Now there are alive two close friends of mine who were 
then members of the PP staff, nd 
These are men who in effect established the pp s'taff for 
Frank Wisner and then left to go on to other things. They 
are both well known writers. 
Mr. Baron. Le.t me just return to one name that you 
mentioned and that is William Harvey. 
Did you -- first, generally, what was the nature of your 
operational relationships to William Harvey after this period? 
Did you have any? 
Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen 
him once in my life, to the best of my recollection. 
Mr. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked 
in 1961 with setting up an executive action ~apability at 
the CIA,tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out 
assassinations if required.
