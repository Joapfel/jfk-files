PART II 6A - B 
SECTION 6. PUBLICATIONS, PRESS, AND PUBLIC CONTACTS 
9. In cases involving bombings having an apparent racial or religiuus basis 
with the resultant public interest, the SAC should issue a statement to 
the press indicating the SAC has arrived at the scene or is en route to 
actively assist local investigative authorities, making available to them 
every possible cooperative service of the FBI, including the Bureau's full 
laboratory and identification facilities, to further assist them by han­
dling out-of-state leads, and to take charge of all investigative efforts 
that may indicate any Federal violation. At'no time should this statement 
indicate that the criminal act is obviously outside the investigative 
jurisdiction of the FBI nor should full investigative responsibility for 
the incident be either assumed or declared. The issuance of this state­
ment requires prior Bureau app~oval in every such instance, and the 
Bureau should be contacted telephonically and furnished known facts of 
the incident so a prompt statement can be authorized. 
10. In contacts with the press concerning a bank robbery, bank burglary, or 
bank larceny no information should be volunteered. concerning the 
amount of loot obtained. Specific que_stions by members of the press 
concerning a.mount of loot may be answered only following the a.rres-t of 
an individual or individuals for violation of the Federal bank robbery 
statute. 
11. Copies of Bureau press releases to be placed in case file and press 
release file if exists. 
12. In conneqtion with service awards to Bureau personnel, SAC's may provide 
news media with a photograph and a brief biographical sketch of employee. 
No employee may submit to a personal interview by a newsman in connection 
with such an award or under any other circumstances, for that matter, 
without prior Bureau authority. This does not preclude an SAC or other 
Bureau official from issuing news releases in accordance with existing 
[l3. 
FBI 
Bureau policy. 
Bureau personnel, including SACs and ASACs, are not to participate 
~n give-and-take news conferences without prior Bureau authority 
including c].earance by the Press Services Office. This will be 
permitted -only in the rarest of circumstances where mitigating facts 
cl~arly indicate it is to the BuFeau's best interests to participate.]
