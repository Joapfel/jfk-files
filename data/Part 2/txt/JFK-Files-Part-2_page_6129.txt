These are compelling examples of the American appetite for intrigue, but no 
other event in twentieth-century American history has generated such persistent 
notions of conspiracy as the assassinacion of President John·. F. Itennedy. More 
than four hundred books have been published on the subject;. n6 a major 
newsletter provides a continu- [*3] ing flow of new. theories about the 
assassination, n7 and a national organization, the Coalition on Political 
Assassinations, meets annually to debate the murder. ne Oliver Stone elevated 
the idea of conspiracy to epic proportions in the film JFK. n9 That movie 
claims, among other things, that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone; rather, he 
was part of a plot hatched by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 
collaboration wich organized crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 
and othar elements of the American government. nlO Stone's follow-up to JFK, 
Nixon, nll echoes this theme, .intimating a connection between the CUban burglars 
of the Watergate comp~ex and the assassination of President Kennedy. nl2
