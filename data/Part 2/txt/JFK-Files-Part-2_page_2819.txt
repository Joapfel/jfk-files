This report covers approximately five ,Ai:i.d o~e half months since I 
submitted the last report on Mr. Kent. Unfo·ftun·ately, and I do mean 
unfortunately, it will be the last fitness report written on Mr. Kent 
because he has elected to retire on 30 June 1978. 
Although his retirement was just around the corner, Mr. Kent did 
not slacken his pace. On the contrary, in the last four months the NOC 
Branch has been besieged with a myriad of statistical reports from DDO 
management. Had it not been for the legendary meticulousness of Mr. 
Kent, coupled with his excellent tribal memory, the NOC Branch would 
have been hard-pressed to come up as promptly and as efficiently with the 
figures and facts as was the case. Much of it Mr. Kent and his staff 
had to accomplish while he was acting for me while I was on a 4 week TDY. 
He definitely excelled at running the branch during these four weeks. 
In closing I would like to say that CIA is losing one of its finest 
officers in Mr. Kent. This may not be the proper vehicle for making 
the following statement, but I would like to state nevertheless and with­
out any equivocation whatsoevert that seldom in my career of 31 years 
did I receive the kind of support and loyal counsel I received from 
Mr. Xent during the past 13 months.

There is little to add to the thoughtful and accurate c0111Dents of the rating 
fficer. I share his sense of loss over the retirement of Mr, Kent. Mr. Kent performed 
nan exceptionally able manner throughout the period of time covered by this report. 
e was always quick and willing to respond and the results of his labors, without 
xception, were of a very high professional order, As indicated, he was of great 
ssistance to the rating officer and to me as well,during this time. It is indead un­
ortunBte that the clandestine service is losing the experience and talent of Mr. Kent. 
owever, he reached this decision on his own and, after careful consideration, opted 
or early retirement. Thus, I can only wish him well in his new endeavors and hope 
hat everything works out for him as planned.
