rate, they were not disposed of before Lumumba was "successfully 
neutraliz~d" by ·being captured and imprisoned by the Congolese 
government ·(H~dgman, 8/21/75, pp, 85-86) at the,beginning of 
December, 1960. Hedgman said that he does not recall taking the 
poisons out of his safe on any occasi.on other tha1f when he disposed 
of them on the banks of the Congo River: 
I think that I took thein out probably in a 
briefcase, o:t an air bag of some sort, and 
I believe that the things like the rubb~r 
gloves and the mask were thrown away in a 
bushy area or.something where, you know, if 
they were found, it didn't matter that much. 
I believe I buried the other matters. 
(Hedgmani 8/21/75, p. 84.) 
• Hedgman. tes-tif ied, however, • that in the intervening months, 
while the poisons were in his safe, he took "exploratory steps" 
in furtherance of the assassination plot (Hedgmarr, 8/21/75, p. 60). 
He said that he sent·several cables to CIA headquarters, after his 
request for confirmation of the assassination instructions, which 
"probably reflected further steps I had taken" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
pp. 59-60). 
Hedgman stated that his cables to headquarters on this matter 
were essentially "progress reports" on his attempts to f;ind a means 
of access to Lumlimba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 50). He also said that 
he "would bet on the fact that there was at least one or two more 
[cables] back" to him from CIA headquarters in response (Hedgman, 
8/21/75, p. 50).
