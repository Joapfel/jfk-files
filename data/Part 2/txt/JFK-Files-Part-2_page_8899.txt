7FRIPPEL was. a weak a9ent:: "he w.:is atraid and gave pract.1.­
cal ly nothing." NOSENKO ~,aid that alfH6ugh he had r1c~cru~.~ed 
him, "honestly spe.:ik111g, FRIPPEL was not an agent." The KGr. 
nevertheless hoped that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to Mos­
cow at some future date. (See p.137 for details of the 
FRJPPEL case.) 
Comment: 
a sensitive source 
FRIPPEL agrees with NOSENKO that they met twice 
in the USSR in 1963. However, FRIPPEL asserts 
he also met NOSENKO 1n Odessa in February 1962. 
which NOSENKO flatly denies. FRIPPEL 1.s known 
to have planned to travel to the Soviet Union 
at that t 1me, and tl,ere is no apparent reason 
why he would make a false claim on th1s m~tter. 
According to , FRIPPEL, who 1s now 
in New York City, 1 s a current target of the '41' 
Soviet intelligence service, 
Johannes PREISFREUND 
The I(GB co1:s 1 de red PREI SFP.!::mm compromised to A.'11er 1 c.rn 
Intelligence after GOLTTSY~'s defection [1n Deceraber 19611 and 
thus unsuitable for further use against 1\mericans at the Em­
bassy in Moscow. For this reason, NOSENKO was told to take 
PREISFREUND with him when he transferred to the Seventl1 De­
partment. As the age!'lt spoke only Finnislt"'and Russian, howeve!.', 
he was of no use against English-speaking tourists. NOSENKO 
met with PREISFREUND on the latter's visits to Moscow in 1962, 
but did not use him 1n any operations. 
Comment: PREISFREUND asserts that.he was no longer a KGB 
agent after the STORSBER~ operation (see p.1751 
and that although he saw NOSENKO on his frequent 
return visits to Moscow, it was only because 
NOSENKO sought a companion for wenching and 
drinking.
