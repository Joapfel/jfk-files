.I have received your letter of 1-.tiarch 20· concerning the 
desire of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. to develop intelligence -• 
sources in the diplomatic establishments in the United States of an 
additional 15 Latin American countries, and I have had arr opportunity •.

_ summary of our reservations about an across-the-board effort with 
Latin American.embassies. 1viy chief concern is related to peneu~ation . 
_through foreign nationals. It seems to n1e highly certain that a proportion .
