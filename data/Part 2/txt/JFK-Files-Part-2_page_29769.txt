Donald Deneslya Interview

is maintained by the CIA at Langley, Virginia headquarters 
and he thinks it was on the second floor in corridor "H. '.' 
The fact that the contact report was out of New York was 
not significant because the report could have originated 
in Moscow and was rerouted and rewritten in New York, again 
to conceal the point of origin. 
He also told me that it was his experience that some­
times the Agency, when they want to surface material in the 
"overt" side of the CIA, will say that it came from that side 
when in fact it did not. 
Deneslya said that it was also his information that the 
Russians sent over "dispatched" agents from time to time. 
He recalls that at one time there was discussion of an agent 
who was caught because the Russians stamped his passport 
twice at ditferent pages with the same stamp but with a dif­
ferent date and this game him away. He did not recall the 
agent's name. 
Deneslya said that the Committee should determine who 
made out the #201 on Oswald--who opened it and what division 
they were in. He said that about a year after he gave testi­
mony before the Senate Intelligence Committee (1975) he saw 
a report in the newspapers that someone in the CIA had recom­
mended that Lee Harvey Oswald be contacted. 
Donald gave the writer a written authorization to in­
spect his Senate Intelligence Committee testimony.
