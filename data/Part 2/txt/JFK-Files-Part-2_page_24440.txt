"Question: And would it.be accuaate to say that 
your recollections concerning what you now view 
as what Mr. Dulles' attitudes were ... are based 
on your general training about what had always been 
said [and] that after this incident, what you 
were told ... fortified that previous belief [in] 
that Dulles had nullified at least this particular 
cable?" 
"Officer: Correct.·" 
"Question: Do you have anything in your recollection 
or as a result of your informed opinion or experience 
that would indicate to the contrary; that is, that 
Mr. Dulles did .have assassination in his arsenal, so 
to speak?" ... 
"Officer: I have no basis for any such speculation."
