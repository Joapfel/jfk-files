testified that he recalled working for Generals Bennett and Philpott on 
"a priority requirement to identify Chilean personalities who might be 
helpful in preventing the election of Allende as President of Chile.'' 
(Roth, Vol. I, p. 6) Though Roth r~calls no mention of Track II as such, 
the goal of this mission is identical to that described in the message

Vol. II, p. )
