REMOTE. (CIA Cable IN 42478, Chief of 
Station to Twee~y.) 
Hedgman testified that all of his cable traffic about the 
assassination question ·would have beeri sent with the same 
. extraordinarily stringent security precautions -- presumably re.,;, 
£erring to thel?ROP channel -- which concerned Gottlieb's visit 
and the confirmation of authorization for his instructions: 
I would have sent in a special channel 
anything dealing with Lumumba, .at least 
that would touch upon his. removal in·. one 
way or another. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 62.) 
The Chief of Station also testified that sometime before 
leaving the Station, he destroyed all cable traffic relating to 
the assassination mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 89). Hedgman's 
best recollection was that he had received instructions to destroy 
those cables (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96). Hedgman said he had never 
befo~e in his tenure as Chief of Station in the Congo destroyed 
cable traffic because of its sensitivity (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 91) .. 
But he stated that the cables relating to assassination were 
destroyed because of their extremely sensitive nature.* He said 
* It is possible that. copies of cables.dealing with such a 
sensiti~e operation were also destroyed at CIA headquarters.
