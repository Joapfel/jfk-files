Item No. 107, 128, 129, 279 MSS pp. 12 3, 13 2, 13 3, 40 3 
(S) CCS states that all four items which refer-to 
- Fairways Corpor~tion as a CIA-owned propri~tary company 
are still tlassified since they describe intelligence 
sources .and methods by identi£ying an operational support 
facility located in the U.S. and are therefore exempt from 
declassification under Section.5 (B) (2) of the General 
Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652. 
(S) According.to CCS files, in April 1975 Director 
Colby was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA Sponsorship 
of Faiiways Corporation in connectiori with a planned TV 
documentary on Agency proprietaries. CCS files are unclear 
on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby 
may have responded to the question in a manner which 
could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of 
Fairways. In any case, CCS files contain other evidence 
that the matter was consid·ered to be still classified as 
recently as December 1976, when Director Bush wrote to 
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and asked that the. 
subject be withheld £rom public disclosure.
