File No. July 26, 1972 
NW 88321 
PHILADELPHIA WOMEN'S NATIONAL 
ABORTION ACTION COALITION • 
PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for 
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa., 
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National 
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago 
WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's 
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that 
they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut 
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this 
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy 
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with 
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC. 
An article in "The Sunday Bulletin, 11 Section 2, pages 
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates 
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with 
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals 
appeared and background information contained under each individual 
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist 
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the 
WUAR and /or WONAAC: •
