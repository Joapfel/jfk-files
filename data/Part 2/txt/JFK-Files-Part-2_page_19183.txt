BRIGADE FOR/'/,ED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS 
Helena, Hontana 
November 27, 1967 
'l'o all American Women: 
I am proud of the fact that my first 
vote cast in Congress was a vote 
against war. It was the first oppor­
unity for a woman to vote, because I 
was the first woman to be elected to 
Congress. 
I beli~ved then, as I do today, 
that women are the ones that must be 
concerned with the needs and develop­
ment of the .human race. I have always 
fought for the dignity of all human 
beings - for those of the present as 
well as those of future generations, 
I will continue to struggle as long 
as I live. I hope all women will res­
pond to the followi.ng call and join me 
in Washington on Januai:y 8, 1968, the 
opening day of Congress. 
Jeannette Rankin
