6. Czechoslovakia- I a. Czech President and party 
USSR boss Novotny has gone to Moscow, 
evidently for economic talks, judg­
ing by the composition of his dele­
gation.

Stalinist excesses have put him on 
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They 
also have given rise to control 
problems, particularly in the-fraG.-

Novotny is in Moscow the presidential I • • 
flag has remained up at the official
