that eventually 
I destroyed a great deal of traffic, because 
the Congo was a highly sensitive area in 
which -- at one period I recall we had all 
of our files in the burn barrels. I mean, 
when you wanted a file, you went over and 
dug it out of the burn barrell. (Hedgman,

At the conclusion of his testimony about the assassination 
plot, the ~hie£ o~Station was asked to give a general characteri­
zation of the advisability of the plot and the tenor of the times 
in which it took place. His response indicated that althou$h he 
was willing to carry out what he considered a duly authorized 
order, he was not convinced of the necessity of assassinating 
Lumumba: 
I looked upon the Agency-as an executive 
arm of the Presidency .... Therefore, I 
suppose I thought that it was an order 
issued in due form from an authorized 
authority. 
On the other hand, I looked at.it as a 
kind of operation that I could do without, 
that I thought that probably the Agency 
and the U.S. government could get along 
without. I didn't regard Lumumba as the 
kind of person who was going to bring on 
World War III or something. 
I might have had a somewhat different 
attitude if I thought that one man could 
bring on World War III and result in the 
deaths of millions of people or something, 
but I didn't see him in that light. I saw 
him•as a danger to the political position 
of the United States in Africa, but 
nothing more than that. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
pp. 110-111.)
