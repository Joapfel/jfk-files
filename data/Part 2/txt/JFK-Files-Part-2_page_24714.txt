that the President expressed himself, we will have 
to do whatever is necessary to get r{d of him. I· 
don't know that I would have taken that as a 
clearcut order as Mr .. Johnson apparently did.· And 
I think perhaps others present may.have interpreted 
it other ways .• (Dillon, 9/2/75, pp. 32-33.) 
Q: Did you ever hear the.President make such a 
remark about Lumumba, let's get rid of him, or let's 
take. action right away on this? 
Dillon: I don't remember that.· But certainly this 
was the general feeling of Government at that time, 
and it wouldn't have been if the President hadn't 
agreed with it. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 33.) 
Dillon said that he would have thought that such·a state­
ment "was not a direct order to have an assassination" (Dillon, 
9/2/75, p. 33). • But he testified that it was "perfectly 
possible" that Allen Dulles would have translated suc~1 strong 
Presidential language about "getting rid of" Lumumba into 
authorization for an assassination effort (Dillon, 9/2/75, 
pp. 34-35): 
I think that Allen Dulles would have be.en quite 
responsive to what he considered implicit autho­
rization, because he felt very strongly that we 
should not involve the President directly in 
things of this nature. And he was perfectly 
willing to take the responsibility personally 
that maybe. some of his successor.s wouldn't have 
been. And so I think that this is a perfectly 
plausible thing, knowing Allen Dulles. (Dillon, 
9/2/75, p. 34.)
