him to the jail. Balletti called Maheu in Miami, tying "1"13..heu into this 
thing up to his ear" (O'Co~ell, pp. 71-72; File R-505, FBI merrorandurn). 
Balletti's bail was paid by! Roselli (Roselli, p. 52). 
I 
(i) Evidence Cohcerning CIA involvement in the 'l'ap. The 
Committee received conflict~ evidence on whether the agency was consulted 
i 
! * prior to the installation of the tap. O'Connell testified that he 
' 
had called Edwards and cleared the placement of an electronic "bug" in 
Rowan's apartment prior to ;the installation of the tap (O'Connell, 
, I 
pp. 67-71). Maheu recalle9 that he had.initially asked O'Connell if 
I 
the CIA would handle the j~b, and that O'Connell had told him that 
I 
I 
"he would·call Mr. Edwards and see if they would have the 
I 
capability of accomplishing this, ... and that subsequently 
I 
he informed me tjhat Mr. Edwards had said thqt they would not 
I , 
do it, but approved paying for it if we hired an independent 
l 
private detectiv,e to put it on." (1"13..heu, 7/29, p. 37). 
i On the other hand, Edwards; in a May 14, 1962 merrorandum for the 
Attorney General (discussed at length, infra, p. ) , stated that 
i 
"At the time oflthe incident neither the Agency nor 
the undersigned;knew of·the proposed techpical installation. 11**

Regardless of whether thJ CIA initially authorized the tap, it is apparent 
~at the CIA paid for the tap. DuBois told FBI agents that Maheu had 
paid him a retainer of $1,000 (File R-505, p. 14). O'Connell confirmed 
that CIA "indirectly" paid for the tap because "we paid Maheu a certain 
annunt of money, and he just paid it out of what we were giving him. 11

"Q: 
A: 
! 
But it was understood, or you understood, that out of the roney 
the CIA made avhllable to Maheu, Dubois would be paid for the tap? 
Yes. ! 
* * * 
Q: And Colonel Ed knew somebody was being employed 
in order to acc~mp ish a tap? 
** • A: . That is right."! (O'Connell, p. 69.) 
A memorandum by J. Edgar Hoover states that the Attorney General said he had 
been told by Edwards that the "CIA admitted that they had assisted Maheu 
in making the installat~on" (Mero, Hoover, 4/10/62).
