fours on the docks and moved out in truck convoys. Refugee, exile·, and 
other human source reports suggested that, in cobtrast to the earlier arrivals, 
the new arrivals were Soviet combat troops. However, the intelligence com­

trainers, plus a number of civilian technicians and advisors associated with 
improving the Cuban ec onouzy-. The view was that they did not include signifi -

B. Identification of Specific Weapons and Equipment 
1. SA-2 Sites - About August 15, as a result of suspicions generated 
by human source reports, the Department of Defense focused special attention 
on suspected areas and requested that they be covered by the "next" high 
altitude flight. As a result, the next such flight, flown on August 29, estab­
lished positive identification of SA-2 surface-to-air •missile (SAM) sites at 
two of the suspect locations and at six others in Western Cuba, Flights from 
August 29 through October 7 discovered additional SA-2 sites. The SA-2 system· 
can engage targets at altitudes from about 3,000 to 8o,ooo feet and has a 
slant range of about 25 miles. 
2. Cruise Missiles - A coastal defense cruise missile installation 
was identified shortly after the flight of August 29. Three additional 
cruise missile sites were discovered by October 7. These are anti-shipping 
missiles estimated to have a. maximum range of about 40 miles. On August 29th 
KOMAR class patrol boats with 2 missile launchers each were identified in Cuba.
