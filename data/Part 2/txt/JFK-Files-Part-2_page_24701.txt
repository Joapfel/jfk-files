(a) High-Level Meetings at which "Getting Rid of Lumumba" 
Was Discussed 
(i} Dillon Testified that the Question of Assassina­
tion Was Raised at Pentagon Meeting: Summer 1960 
In late July 1960, Patrice Lumumba visited.the United 
States and met with Secretary of State Christian.Herter and Under­
secretary of State C. ·Douglas Dillon. While Lumumba was in Washing­
ton, D.C., Secretary Herter pledged aid to the newly formed Govern­
ment of the Congo (New York Times, 7/28/60; p; ) . 
According to Dillon, the impression that Lumurnba left 
with the Government officials was that of an irrational) almdst 
psychotic personality: 
When he was in the State Department meeting, either with 
me or w:i,th the Secretary in my presence . . • . he would. 
never look you_in·the eye. He looked up at the sky. And 
a tremendous flow of words came out. He spoke in French, 
and he spoke it very fluently. And his words didn't ever 
have any relation to the particular things that we wanted 
to discuss .... You had a feeling that he was a per­
son that was gripped by this fervor that I can only char-
. acterize as messianic . . . [H] e was just not a rational 
being. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 24.) 
Dillon said that the willingness of the United States Government to 
work with Lumumba vanished after these meetings:
