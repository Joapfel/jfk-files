It should ~ emphasized to the rei·.c:1 lc~e~·.s tha.t the U.S. does not eXpect 
the clock to be turned back v1th reG8,l"d to Gocial conditions .• 
Still later a cam,pl.ete orchestration should be woven together, 
coming to a crescendo through the optimal expl.oitation of' all the ma.in­
streaz.:s discussed in the categories above. Propaganda ,should reach the 
max:Sm•'" denunciation of' the regillle, er.horting to revolt, hoiding up the 
prospect of' peace and a better lif'e should the Cuban people join their 
resistance leaders. Subversion should be steppecl Up by introduction of' 
all avuilable externally trained ~-esi&ten::e fiahters, provision of max:Smmn 
logistic ::upport, etc-. J.t the &P:.::or-~·ic-:::: ·;ime 1 if this resi~ce oo~eat 
needs the assistance of' external forces there should be an OAS structured 
air strike, related to an appropriate Castro mis-step, to disarm Cuban . 
offensive and def'ensi-ve paver and to destroy all POL storaee. This attack 
shoul.d be coordiilated v1th all-out sabote ge. 
An invasion :tarce should be 1".ept in ::-eeilinoss f'or use, if' re­
qu.µed to save the resistance, once the all-ou.t interne1 resistance 
ettorta has been initiated. 
Criteria -- i'he pressures discussed in all categories above should 
be appropriate]¥ coord1118.ted. The period of' moderation should end after 
one or two months wen it is apparent that no :further Soviet m.11~-y 
persODDel are to be removed. Moderate pressures should then c0teence, 
la.sting f'or a period of' two to· three months, until some episode of' 
esca;Lation by Castro or other appropriate event, DSlces further pressures 
feasible. If' such an ewnt is not fo..--thcomng, 0.'8 major insistence should 
lead to esca:Lation of' pressures. Af'ter e."'lother s1-.ort period, e68,in pre­
ferable triggered by an appropriate C::stro episode or al.ternatiwly by a 
maJority OAS vote still more v.l.goroua pressures should be 1n1tia.ted.
