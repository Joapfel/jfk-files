Mr. Shaw. No problem1 
Mr. Goldsmith. I will say that we will pursue this by 
contacting the appropriate people at the Agency . 
Mr. Shaw. I think if you requested the Agency for those 
two names, it would probably produce them. I wouldn't want to 
be the guy. to say it. 
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand your position perfectly. 
I hope you understand mine. 
Mr. Shaw. I do. 
Mr. Goldsmith. I would not want you to go back to the 
A9ency and say that the· staff of this Committee attempted to 
compel an answer out of you.
