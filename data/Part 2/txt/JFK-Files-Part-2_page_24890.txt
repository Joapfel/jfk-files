upon our government, ·Jr the use of underworld figures involves 
the following dangers: 
a. The use of underworld figures for "dirty business'' 
gives them the power to blackmail the government and to avoid 
prosecution, for past or future crimes. For example, the 
. /°f>YN"-'C 
. figures involved in the Castro assassination operat~ tl~ 
their involvement with the CIA to avoid prosecution. The CIA • ~i.-,,,.,,,r 
also contemplated attempting to quash criminal charges against 
QJWIN in a foreign tribunal. 
b. the use of persons experienced in criminal tech­
niques and prone to criminal behavior increases tJe likelihood 
that criminal acts will occur. Agents in the fie~d are neces-
, I 
sarily given broad discretion. But th~ risk of i~proper \ I 
activities is increased when persons of criminal Hackground 
I 
are used, particularly when they are selected precisely to take 
I 
advantage'of their criminal skills or contacts. 
·kThe corrosive effect of dealing with underworld :figures is 
graphically demonstrated by the fact that Attorney :General Robert 
Kennedy, who had devoted much of his professional l'ife to fight­
ing organized crime, did not issue an order agains~ cooperating 
with such persons whefi he learned in May 1961 that the CIA had 
made use of Sam Giancana in a sensitive operation i;n Cuba. 
In May 1962, when the Attorney General learned that the 
operation had involved assassination, he did, according to 
a CIA witness, inform those briefing him that undetworld 
figures should not be rised before checking with hi~ first, 
but failed to direct that. they must never be so usTd.
