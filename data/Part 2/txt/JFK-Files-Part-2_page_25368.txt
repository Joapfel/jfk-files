they won't rest until Roselli's murde1 
is solv#d. In the last four weeks, with 
the he,lp of Washington agencies, Za­
trepal~k and Ojeda have reconstructed 
R~selU[~ life in hopes of understanding 
his death. For the third time in eight 
years· <\f marriage, Zatrepalek worked 
out of t pwn on his wedding anniversa­
ry; because of the "awesomeness" of 
this case, Ojeda spent his Labor Day 
holida};lat work. 
"MaY,be 10 years from' now," Ojeda 
says, "II want someone to look at my 
file and say, 'Hey, he talked to every­
body.' IAnd maybe he'll hear some­
thing a~d BANG! that's the arrest!''

down his home for the insurance mon­

to his family through an intermediary 
in Chicago so his sisters could attend 
college.[j • 
By th~ late 1920s Al Capone was well 
establis~ed in Chicago. Newspaper­
men, politicians and cops were on the 
Capone:payroll and a young man with

finding '.suitable employment; he hired 
on as allrumrunner with the Capone 
gang. At age 26 Roselli was arrested 
for selliqg morphine to an :undercover 
agent. ~e was acquitted because, after
