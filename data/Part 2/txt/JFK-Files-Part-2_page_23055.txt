infiltration tt1am. 116 was a UDT man. 
Hr. Baron. In the Harper's article, it says that Martinez 
indicated that "Hore than once ho was givt1n personal charge cf 
weapons drops in which special rifles with Rilencers and tele­
scopic sights were left in designated inland spots." 
Do you know of a factual basi.;>. for that statement? 
Mr. llalley. Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when 
he says he put caches on the·coast ofCuha that contained weapons 
I do not know how he would be ahle to tell what kind of weapons 
were in the cache. The reason I say that is that when one of 
these missions were planned, the cache was put toqether and 
pa'cked by our logistics group and once the cache was put 
togethei it was brought on board the vessel and the cache was 
then turned over to the team for infiltration so he would never 
have seen the contents of the cache, he would not have opened 
it up because it was always in a sealed container. 
It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that 
he got before he went down that he was told that we are putting 
in a cache containing a radio or putting in a cache containinq 
weapons because that would influence what he selected as a 
cache type. In other words, if it were a radio, we would want 
it higher and drier than we wot1ld a can containinq weapons that 
were wraped in cosmolene and so forth. lie might know that they 
were weapons, but he wouldn't k~ow that they were sifenced 
and they had a scope. I must honestly say to yo11 I doubt that.
