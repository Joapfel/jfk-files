fine points in his analysis, of government 
policy. It is incumbent upon us, the·re­
fore, to get the record straight in this 
manrier, .and, although Lt. Col. Egan may 
have had in his own mind the idea of a 
strike operation -- and I believe he came 
to us with· some idea on hitting the Isle 
of Pines -- this nevertheless was not 
approved Project or Agency policy until 
quite a ·few months later. In point of 
fact, as I look back over that period, I 
am sure during that period I found myself 
drifting along, devoting myself merely to

* In a discussion with the author of this history in 
the fall of 1975, •. Esterline introduced another thought 
·about the change in concept to wit: 
That the small team concept had been planned to 
be put into operation early in November of 1960, and 
Esterline seems to believe that this would have been 
feasible. 'However, the Presidential election of that 
year made the Eisenhower administration extremely 
cautious about anything·that might have an impact on 
the out{::ome of the election; and, consequently,•such 
delays as were incurred gave added time for the build­
up of Castro's internal forces. By the time that the 
election was over, it had become apparent that the 
small team concept was no longer viable.. Esterline, 
in fact, suggested that the emphasis for the buildup 
in the brigade forces came from the White House. But 
even though Gordon Gray -- in various meetings of the 
Special Group during the period from November to the 
end of the Eisenhower administration -- did support 
the idea of increasing the size of the force, there 
is no evidence to indicate that pressure to do this 
came from the White House. 22/
