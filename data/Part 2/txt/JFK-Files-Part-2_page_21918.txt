Q: Did Mr. Dulles tell you that President Eisenhower 
wanted Lumumba killed? 
Hr. Bissell: I am sure he didn't. 
Q: Did he ever tell you even circumlocutiously 
through this kind of cable? 
Hr. Bissell: Yes, I think his cable says it in effect. 
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 33.) 
As for discussions with Dulles about the source of autho­
rization for an assassination effort a8ainst Lumumba, Bissell 
s tate·d: 
I think ~tis probably unlikely that Allen Dulles 
would have said either the President or President 
Eisenhower even to me. I think he would have said, 
this is authorized in the highest quarters, and I 
would have known what he meant. (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
p. 48.) 
When asked if he had sufficient authority to move beyond the 
(_ consideration or planning of assassination to order implementa­
tion of a plan, Bissell said, "I probably did think I had [such] 
authority" (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62).

When informed about the 0hief of )station' s testimony 
about the instructions he received from@_attliej, Bissell said 
that despite his absence of a specific recollection: 
I would itrongly infer in this case that such an 
autporization did pass through me, as it were, 
if ~id ~ttli,:._b) gave that firm instruction to the 
StationlChiefJ (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40.) 
. . 
Bissell said that the DCI would have been the source of this 
authorization (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40).
