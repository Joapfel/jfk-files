event, McCone went no f~rther. He issued no general order 
banning consideration of assassination within the Agency. 
One of the.programs forwarded to General Lansdale by 
the Defense Department in the Mongoose program was entitled 
"Operation Bounty" and envisioned dropping leaflets in Cuba 
offering rewards for the assassination of Government leaders. 
Although the plan was vetoed by Lansdale, it indicates. that 
persons in agencies other than the CIA perceived that assas­
sination might be permissible. 
While the arnbiv2lcnce of Administration officials does 
not excuse the misleading conduct by Agency officials or 
justify their failure to seek explicit permission, it dis­
played an insufficient concern about assassination which 
may have contributed to the perception that assassination 
was an acceptable tactic in accomplishing the Government's 
general objectives. 
With the exception of the tight guidelines issued by 
the Special Group Augmented concerning Operation Mongoose, 
precise limitations were never imposed on the CIA requiring 
prior permission for the details of other proposed covert 
operations against Cuba. No general policy banning assas­
sination was promulgated_until Helms' intra-agency order 
in 1972 .. In light of the number of times in which the 
subject of as~assination arose, Administration officials 
were remiss in not explicitly forbidding such a_ctivity.
