NY 100-174481 
In view of instructions set forth in Bureau 
memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the 
Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest 
in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate 
dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision 
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued 
investigation of WONA~C as such is not justified. 
mhe New York Office further concurs with the 
Philadelphia view that continued investigation of the SWP 
and/or Y3A would produce the desired coverage and information 
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC. 
UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation 
of this organization.
