area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed 
\
the-current senior Bureau 0fficiaL concerned with operational 
matters t,o be Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams.~~ 
In addition, .Angleton advised that certain questions 
he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate 
the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct 
answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate 
agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented 
that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be 
happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate 
Bureau official concerning his testimony. He commented that 
he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William 
Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testimony~uk)

2--. It is not believed appropriate to ri?.quest 
Angleton to brief the Di~ector or other Bureau official 
conr.erning his testimony; particularly since Angleton has 
not seen fit to brief hi.s fprmer superiors at CIA. A request 
by the Bureau for a briefipg by Angleton might be misconttr.ued
