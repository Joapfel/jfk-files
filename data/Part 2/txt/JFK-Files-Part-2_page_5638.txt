could subject him to criminal penalties in~ustri~ He stated on 
several occasions _hould .. his affiliation become • nown, he would 
have to leave Austri~ Ono er occ. ions, he stated that he would turn himse in to the Viennese authorities and offer his 
services as a consultant tote po ice or intelligence service. 
He obviously was extremely distrau~ht and was voicing .what he 
believed were his options should his name be released by the 
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of 
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no 
matter what ha~pens he would never betray the CIA by telling 
anyone about his work as ail intelligence officer. (S) , . 
5. By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he 
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions, 
I had assured him that CIA was doing everything to prote.ct him 
and Gunn had stated he would argue for h~ protection to the 
Board. He clearly· looked upon Gunn and<..!)as his allies in this 
process and even stated that he had a "wonderful" day talking to us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident all would turn out well. (S) 
6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn 
about how this issue would be handled by the Board. Gunn 
: believed that it was more than likely that the Board would agree 
to protect him and that he would make the strongest 9X9Y:ment he 
• could to them. The Board will make its decision in ~ next . 
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for
