Subject: Suggested Qs & As fo~ Hearing on JFK Assassination 
Documents 
(Dave Gries suggests additional Qs and As along the following 
lines) 
Q. Many of the Oswald documents transferred to the National 
Archives earlier this week were said to have been in the 
Archives previously. Is this correct? 
Ans. Yes, but most of the documents were originated by 
other agencies, and we were not aware of what those agencies 
had previously released. 
Q. There appears to be little information of interest in the 
Oswald file that was released. Is this true? 
Ans. Yes this is essentially accurate. But the objective 
in transferring the file was to demonstrate our good faith 
commitment to release as many documents related to the 
assassination as possible, and as expeditiously as possible
