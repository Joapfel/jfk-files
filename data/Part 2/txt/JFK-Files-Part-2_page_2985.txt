agents dropped out of contact. Typical was Radio 
Habana's 12 May 1965 announcement that "31 counter­
revolutionaries, members of a CIA espionage network" 
had been arrested. Of the 14 actually named in the 
broadcast, WH Division identified six who had worked 
with Juan Bautista Perez Luis (AMTAUP-10), chief 
gardener at the naval base and principal agent for 
CIA. Although he had been debriefed in Miami in Jan­
uary, Perez' location. and status were not known in

<Probably the most successful political oper-
ation in WH Division's history was the Chilean elec-
tion of 4 September 1964 in which Eduardo Frei of 
the Christian Democratic Party decisively defeated 
Salvador Allende, Marxist leader of a Communist-
dominated coalition.* Drawing on covert mechanisms 
established by Santiago Station years earlier, plus 
new procedures and assets developed for the election, 
the campaign to assure Frei's victory cost CIA about 
$2,600,000. Its success kept Allende at bay until 
1970, when no such intervention by CIA was authorized.
