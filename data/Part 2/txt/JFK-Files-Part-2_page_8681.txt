On 15 July 1963 the Miami News carried an article ''Back 
Stage with Bobby" by Hal Hendrix, which related growing 
speculation in Miami and Washington that Attorney General 
Robert Kennedy was quietly backing a new anti-Castro 
operation with exiles Manuel ARI'IME, Enrique RUIZ Williams, 
and Roberto and Jose SAN ROMAN. All held high posts in 
Brigade 2506 (Bay of Pigs). Speculation linked Kennedy's 
close association with these exiles to a deal with 
Nicaragua through ex-President Luis SOtvOZA.
