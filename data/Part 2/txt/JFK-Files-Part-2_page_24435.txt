2. At What Level Were the Castro Plots Authorized or 
Knmm About Within the Central Intelligence Agency? 
(a) The Question Presented. As we have seen, first 
Richard Bissell and then Richard Helms, each .as Deputy Director of 
Plans (DDP), were aware of plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. The 
evidence set forth herein relates .to whether their superiors in 
the Agency, in particular Allen Dulles and John McCone, authorized 
or were m·1are of the assassination plots. 
Dulles served as Director crf Central Intelligence (DCI) 
from 1953 to November 1961. McCone served as DCI from November 1961 \ ' 
to 1965. ,•, The Committee to.ok considerable testimony on whether Dul­
les .and McCone ·(or their Deputy DCI's, General Cabell and General 
Carter, resµectively) knew about or authorized the plots against 
Fidel Castro's life. 
In summary, the evidence is as follows:· 
(i) Dulles: Bissell and Edwards both 
expressed the belief that Dulles (a,nd.his Deputy, General Cabell) 
authorized the initial phase of the assassination plot involving 
underworld figures. They acknowledged, however, that Dulles (and 
.his Deputy) were not told about the plot until after the under­
world figures had been contacted. The words said to have been 
used to brief them--"an intelligence operation"--do not convey on 
----
,'f Bissell served as DDP from January 1, 1959_,. to J::ebruary ... 17, 
1962. (President Kennedy decided to replace Dulles and Bissell 
because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 6-8).) 
Helms, who had been Bissell's Deputy, succeeded Bissell in 
February 1962 as DDP. He was appointed DDCI in April 1965, and 
DCI in June 1966.
