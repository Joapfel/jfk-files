appearances, was that there was no White !louse ur 0ing_ for th.e creation 
of the executive action project, although tacit approval fdr the. 
"research" p,roject was probably given by Bundy after it was. established. 
First, he was shown the Harvey notes which had been preserved 
and which, without any mention of the White House, inc.licated Harvey 
had received his assignment prior to January 25/26, 1961. Those 
dates -- just 5 days after the change of admiriist.ration -- made 
Bissell conclude that it was "very unlikely that.that assignment 
to [Harvey] was taken as a result of White House urging or consul­

p. 23).

about the capability after it had been created (Bissell: 7/17/75, 
pp. 10-11; 7 /2~/75, pp. 21--,22). But Bissell confirmed bis o'riginal 
testimony (6/9/75, pp. ___ ) that he did not brief ·Bundy on the
