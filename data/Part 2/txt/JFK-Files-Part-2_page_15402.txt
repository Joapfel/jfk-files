Three princi_pal _phases -of _program o_peratfng smoothly . 
with_no weaknesses. Name checks made on foreign intelligence 
personnel on advice of arrival by. other .U.S. inte11igence agencies; 
only nominal costs involved. Ten. ·separate foreign official 
establishments of five different countries _presently covered by 
technical surveillances at specific request of ne,p_uty Under 
Secretary of State at estimated monthly cost of $20,5]~; over 
one-half of this cost, however, arises from coverage required to 
meet Bureau investigative and intelligence needs even if State 
req·uest: were lacking. Bure.au _presently has 2? 1 ive sources in 
foreign establishments and· investigations on 26 additional _potential 
sources. Costs involved in this _phase arise princi_pally from field 
investigations of _potential sources and Agents' time in handling 
.established sources and are considered fully justified. • This 
_program supplements and is supplemented by other intelligence 
_programs, inclu~ing(~nagra~and In~ensific~tion _programs~ ~tis _ 
handled on Sectzon-JJzde baszs·and znstructzons to both Sectzon and 
field found to be both current and adequate. Program provides 
data a.ssisting State in formulating foreign _policy and handling 
international relations and assisting Bureau in investigative/°'nd 
intelligence responsibilities, as well as budgetary purposes.'-7" .. · 
. Consideration will be given to _possible expansion, of program ft// 
next conference with field security supervisors, aimed at _pos~le 
double agent and defector operations against offlcial$ of communist 
countries. 
RECOJJJMENDATION 
That _program be continued in· _present form. Re-evaluation· 
will be submitted in June, 1960.
