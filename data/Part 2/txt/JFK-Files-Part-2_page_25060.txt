In an informal conversation after Gen. Cabell' s departure, 
Mr. Gray expressed the opinion that the U.S. has taken publicly about 
all that it can afford to take from t.1-ie Castro governm.ent; that public 
opinion both here and abroad is probably beginning to feel that there is 
no limit as to how far this coW1try can be pushed around; that this 1nay 
encourage other small countries to take a similar tack; and that the 
louger we delay with effective economic and other action the harder we 
may make it for ourselves. 
Mr. Merchant and Mr. Irwin agreed, with the stipulation that 
the United States sbould not ta·ke affi.rmative action W1til it is prepared 
to follow through on a substantial scale.
