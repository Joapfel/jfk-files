The Fox of Mt. Etna and the Grapes 
Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of 
Mt. Etna, the great wlcano in Sicily. These slopes are ex• 
tremely fenile; the grapes that grow there may well be the 
most delicious in the world; and of all the farmers there, 
Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed 
and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes. But they 
grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside a 
vineyard with high walls, and the Fox had a problem. Of 
course, the Fox of Mt Etna had utterly no use for his fam­
ous ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach, 
called them sour, and went away. 
The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering 
Technology, So he went toe retired Engineer who lived on 
the slopes of Mt. Etna, because he liked· the balmy climate 
and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of 
watching his instruments that measured the degree of sleep­
ing or waking of Mt. Etna. The Fox put his problem be­
fore the Engineer.
