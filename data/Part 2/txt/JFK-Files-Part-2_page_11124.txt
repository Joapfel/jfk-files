which should be dissemina~ed to Secret Ser.vice, t·ogether with 
the current report. Gopie" of this_ letterhead. memorandum

quarters level. 
After initial disseminatiofi to Secret Service in security

FD-366 m~y bo used for this purpose. The letterhead memora~dum

Chi~~3e and Cuban aliens en the security index, in addition to 
dis:-• .. ,ina tion to Secret Service, al so advi.se the Ir:i.migra tion and 
Naturalizati:>n Service (ETS) locally, a:id furnish four copies of 
the letterhead memorandum to the Bureau for dissemination at the 
SOG. Bear in mind in filling out the 'reference that some letterhead 
memoranda have been expresslj prepared for dissemination to. 
Secret Service only ~nd have not·been fur~ls~e~ to the 
Department or INS; therefore·, the copy furnished I}IS locally 
and- tw9 of the copies furnished the Bureau should reference 
the last comnunication to INSo 
For instructions pertaini~g to dissemination to.Secret Service 
in other than security ind.ex cases, refer to section 13413, 
vol~~e IV, of .this manual. 
Upon transfer of office of origin in one of these cases, the 
.old office of origin is to furnish Secret Service locally v;i -th 
the subject's new residence and business aadress and advise the 
Bureau that such has been done by the suhcission of two conies 
of the lettcrhe:.,.d memorandum q.isseminated locally. The ne\:. 
o:ffi.ce of. origin need take no . action regarding dis semina -;i o~ to 
Secret Service until suph time as·further changes occu~ with 
respect to the subject's status or until ireparatien of the next 
periodic r~port in the case. 
Dissemination at the B~reau 
There arc some situations in which disse!llination is made at the 
Bureau instead of in the field. In the-majority of instances, 
infoi·ma.tion received .b:, tl:e FBI should ?rcperly be furnished 
immediately t~ so~e otter agency within the executive branc~ of 
the Govc~nment so that t~e responsibili~ies 9f the other agency 
might, be fulfilled ·properly. Care must be ta.ken, however, r:ot 
to disse;ninate info.rmation ·to any field branch of another 
Gcivernment agency n~erc s~ch.a procedure is deemed inadvisable 
because of the inadequacy of security meas~res in that br~nch. 
In these insk,nces the da";a should be "bro-u.ght to the immediate 
attention o.f_ the Bureau f'.Jr diss·eminaticn at the SOG. .An • 
example of the latter is,· of cour::ie, the Atomic T.!;1crgy CorrJnission, 
which receives renorts only through the Btrca.u, :~,; noted in 
section 87.0 7c (3) of -~}1:i.G ffic.>'\Ua.J.,. Inf0rm2.tion relating -l:o
