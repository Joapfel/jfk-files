lagency material for nearly three decades without problecs. Recently, 
• however, the Office·of General Counsel has ruled that an "Official Use 
Only" caveat will not bar such tr.atcrial from the general public under 
the Freedom of Infornation Law and we are accordingly looking into 
alternative measures, ~ong which arc: (1) the purchase of ·nc~-:~ services 
with rights to publish and disseminate; and (2) the classification of 
those itcl'!ls vital to the govern'!!!ent I s business which we 1:n.ist continue 
t6 monitor and report. An ultjmate decision will be weighed against 
the risk of present procedures~ 
4. The routine fBIS monitoring of _foreign radio broadcasts often 
involves statcn~nts or speeches macle by U.S. citizens using those radio 
fad.lities. Examples are statc:ments made or allegedly raade. by Awerican 
POW's in Hanoi,• by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Ra~scy Clark in Victnan. 
At the request of FBI and the Department of Justice, and yith the 
approval of. the CL\ Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-
. mjtted transcripts of such bro~dcasts to the Department of Justice as 
part of that Department 1 s consideration of a possible trial. In such 
: cases, we have been required to sub~it naocs of FBIS raonitors involved, 
.[ 
i 
• presumably because of the possibility they r.tight be required as witnesses. •

(In one case in 19.71, an FBIS staff employee \,•as rlirected to uppear as 
! an expert witness in the court-:r.artial of a N.uh1e. cnlistcd-r.i.an charced 
with aiding the enemy in a broadcast frcm Hanoi .. ) FBIS vfows all this 
' with misgivings. Honitoring of such broadcasts is incidcntnl and we 1 • 
rue attributic,n of their news to FBIS, ond we should not. be ctmsidercd 
pqlicemcn t:'.aintaining surveillance of traveling Americans. 
5. FBIS is an overt organization, but one aspect df its operations 
is under Dcpa:rt;nent of Cor.-.merce cover. The ,Toint Publications Research 
, Service (JPRS) was ~stablishcd in 1957 to provide the ~ean~ through which 
great volumes of ma·terfal from unclassified foreign publications could 
be translated by large numbers of independent contractors in the United 
) States o_n a piece rate basis, Contra.ctors arc 11ot .witting o_f • their .C.IA 
I 
·, employment. This use of cover is a~ anor.mly j,n !-'BIS and contains some 
' risk of embarrassment to the Agency and to Cotr.!l('.rce if it becomes public 
knowledge. The surfacing of JPRS was given study in 19~9, but after 
consideration of all the pros and cons it was decided at the Executive 
Director-Comptroller level not to proceed at that time. FBIS is presently 
taking a second look.
