JFK release-~tation(SI 
/\ I • 
'.:__./ 
I just spoke with EA legal and informed her about the latest release by the JFK Board of~station and the fact that we have a letter 
from the Ambassador objecting to the release. She indicated that~would be a good candidate to go down to speak with the 
Board auheir next meeting (what are the dates?) to request that they reconsider. It might also be more persuasive if we could arrange 
for a State Department person ~desk) to come to the Board with us and present the Ambassador's letter. (SI 
' 
I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this course of action. If we plan on doing this, we need to arrange it with Marwell and then 
brief the appropriate people in the DO and • State Department as soon as possible. (SI
