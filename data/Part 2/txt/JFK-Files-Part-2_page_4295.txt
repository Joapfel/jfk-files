2~ ~aiti - Political Action C/6 
Mr. McCone and Colonel King reported that the following changes 
have taken place in the Haitian picture since the Special Group 
approved, on June 20th, the proposal .to reach a covert understanding 
with President Bosch on the use of Haitian exiles in the Dominican 
Republic. The developments are: 
a. It has been demonstrated that these exiles are of 
very little use, because of insecurity, lack of cohesive purpose or 
of adequate leadership, etc. 
b. President Bosch has now decided that he is unwilling 
to allow such an exile force .to use his country as a base foq;military 
operations against Duvalier. 
c. Duvalier's own capabilities have improved greatly, due 
to such things as: the widespread purge of potentially-dissid~nt Army 
officers; clearance of the border areas; and, most recently, the 
elimination of the Barbot brothers. 
• Colonel King said _that everyone concerned with the project 
agrees that Duvalier must be removed in some manner or other. However,!: 
' in light of the factors mentioned above, operating elements have con-
, eluded that the existing plan is unworkable~ and that it is best to 
switch to a different kind of operation. This would include in the ii 
first instance, training of selected exiles in intelligence collection,. 1

in communications, and in cross-border operations. Such trainin!iJ -'/
