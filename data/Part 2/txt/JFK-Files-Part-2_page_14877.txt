NATIOH!:.L B.t\NKRUPTCY ACT 
This is the case in which a half million dollars 
of Terunsters Union funds were transferred to a Florida bank 
in 1956, which then made loans in a·similar amount to Sun 
Valley, Inc., a Florida real estate developmen.t in which 
Hoffa had an option to purchase 115 per cent of the stock. 
During the past week Hoffa furnished this option, which is 
dated April 15, 1965, to the l\IcClell.an Committee, claiming 
he had recently located it in his old records. 
Teamsters Union records were subpoenaed for 
production before the grand jury in Washington, D. C. 
January 14, 1960. Some records were produced in response 
to the subpoena and others are said to be in the possession 
of the McClellan Committee. The Crin1inal Division will 
obtain such records from the McClellan Committee. Our 
Washington Field Office is making an accounting investigation 
of the records that were produced before the grand jury and 
will examine those the Criminal Division obtains from the 
McClellan Committee. 
The Criminal Division has arranged to have another 
grand jury impanelled to take testimony in this case at 
f Orlando, Florida, beginning February 15, 1960. The Criminal 
Division expects this grand jury will be in session at least 
sixty dayso
