*DISCLOSURE OF<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS OR PARTICULAR INFORMATION IN 
*<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS TO· THE PUBLIC MAY BE POSTPONED SUBJECT TO 
THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS ACT IF THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING 
EVIDENCE THAT·-
(1) THE THREAT TO THE MILITARY DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS, 
OR CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES POSED BY THE 
*PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>IS OF SUCH GRAVITY THAT IT 
OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND SUCH PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WOULD 
REVEAL- -
(A) AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT WHOSE IDENTITY CURRENTLY REQUIRES 
PROTECTION 
(B) AN INTELLIGENCE SOURCE OR METHOD WHICH IS CURRENTLY UTILIZED 
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY

CONDUCT OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES; OR

THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THAT PERSON;
