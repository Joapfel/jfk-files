• Preside·nt stated, that the Congolese did not want 
UN support and the maintenance of order. Secretary 
Dillon reiterated that this was State's feeling 
about the matter. The situation that would l;)e 
created by a UN withdrawal was altogether too • 
ghastly to contemplate. (NSC Minutes, 8/18/60) 
This is the only statement about Lumumba which the.memorandum of 
the meeting attrib_uted to the Pre 9ident. 
As reported., it clearly does not contain an order for the • .,~ · 
assassination .of LumU:mba. But the statement does indicate extreme 
Presidential concern focused on Lumumba: The President was so 
disturbed by the situation in the·Congo that he was willing to 
risk a fight with the Soviet Union and he felt that Lumumba was 
the "one man" who was responsible for this situation, a man who 
did not represent the sentiments of the Congolese p~ople in the 
President's estimation. 
After reviewing NSC documents and being informed- of Robert 
Johnson's testimony, Douglas Dillon stated his "opinion that it 
is most.likely that the NSC meeting of August 18, 1960 is the 
meeting referred to by Nr. Johnson." (Dillon affidavit, 9/15/75.) 
However, Dillon tes t_ified that he did not "remember such a thing" 
as an explicit rresidential order for the assassination of 
Lurnumba (Dillon, 9/2/75, ·p. 32). Dillon explained how he thought 
the President may have expressed himself about Lumumba: 
Dillon: . It could have been in view of this 
feeling of everybody that Lumurnba was [a] very 
difficult if not impossible person to deal with, ahd 
was dangerous to the peace and safety of.the world,
