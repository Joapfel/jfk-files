Therefore, please submit the CIA' s official initial Statement of Compliance to the 
Review Board as soon as possible, but no later than March 16, 1998. 
After formal submission of the CIA's initial Statement of Compliance, we would 
schedule an informal interview with you (and perhaps other meinbers of the Historical 
Review Group) fo ask questions regarding the Compliance Statement and regarding the 
sufficiency of the CIA' s record searches. After addressing any outstanding issues, the 
CIA wo~ld thereafter submit its Final Declaration ·of Compliance. 
I recognize that you are extremely busy proces~ing CIA records for inclusion in the JFK 
Collection. However, it is essential that the CIA devote sufficient time and attention to 
its Final Declaration of Compliance because, as we have stated before, ~he ·Final 
Declaration will constitute the CIA's representation to the American public, under oath, 
that the CIA has diligently searched for records relating to the JFK assassination and 
that the CIA is not withholding any materials regarding the assassination. 
Sincerely, 
Ronald G. Haron 
Associate General Courisel
