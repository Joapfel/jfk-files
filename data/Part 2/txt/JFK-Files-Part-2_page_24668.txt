The Question of a Connection Between the Assassination 
Plot ancf Other Actions of GIA Offfcers an_d Operatives 
rn the Congo ' -
Ju'stin O'Donnell, a senior CIA officer in the clandestine 
operations division in 1960, testified that during this period h~ 
had been asked by DDP Richard Bissell to go to the Congo to carry 
o~t the assassination of Lumumba (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12). 
O'Donnell said that he refused to participate in an assassination 
operation, but proceeded to the Congo to attempt. to draw Lunn.1i.-nba 
away from the protective custody of the UN guard and place him in 
the hands of Congolese authorities (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 13-.14). 
Shortly after.O'Donnell's arrival in the Congo he was 
joined by a CIA agent with.a criminal background who was used the 
following year by the CIA as part of a program to develop a stand-by 
assassination capability. Late in 1960, one of the operatives of· 
the Chief of Station in Leopoldville approached this agent·of • 
O'Donnell's with a proposition to join an "execution squad" (CIA 
Cable IN 18739, Leopoldville to Director, 12/7/60). • 
Despite the fact that O'.Donnell was initially approached 
to be part of the plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, it is un-
. likely that O '·Donnell was actually involved in the implementation 
of that plot by the Chief of Station. Whether there is any connec­
tion between the assassination plot and either of the two operatives 
QJWIN and WIROGUE -- is less clear.
