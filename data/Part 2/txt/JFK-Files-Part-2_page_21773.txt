Mr. Wides. You never heard of any plots, nor of any 
arrested people attempting to shoot a bazooka when he was 
giving a speech at Havana Stadium? 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. 
Mr. Wides. Let me go to the period when you went to

Mr,-. Sarno. wasn't there. When I arrived in Florida,

Mr. Wides. Who was the station chief? 
Mr. Sarno. I don't think I should give you his name. 
I don't know. You have the rest of all of them, but I can't

I can state that there were two station chiefs between·

Mr. Wides. Shackley came in when, 1963? 
Mr. Sarno. 1 6 2.

Mr. Sarno. If I am not mistaken, it was in '64, I think. 
June, July, I think, something like that, of '64. 
Mr. Wides. And then Mr. Dimmer was replaced in 1 66 by 
Mr.
