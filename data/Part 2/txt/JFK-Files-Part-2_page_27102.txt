of SOD. Finally, there is little evidence of much specific program definition 
on the part of the Agency. Though occasional specific requests for material 
or for investigations relating to the solution of a hypothetically posed 
operational problem can be found, the Agency with one or two exceptions through 
the years appears to have ridden on a program 9enerated internally by SOD largely 
on the basis of Special Forces requirements. There are one or t\'lo exceptions 
which will be discussed below. 
Activities of Peculiar CIA Interest. 
Though discussions with people associated with the project reflect an 
overriding interest in incapacitants, particularly· in later years, available 
records make it clear .that CIA interests included maintaining a stockpile of 
lethal materials and delivery systems. The evidence indicates that the Agency 
relied upon the use of specific BW agents and toxins being investigated as a 
normal part of the Army's BW program. However, directions were given to 
investigate such matters as agent stability over varying periods of time, the 
suitability of specific agents for preparation in dry form, the development of 
dart coatings, and the preparation of materials in a form suitable for dusting of 
clothes, pillows, ·etc. 
Primary Agency interest seemed ·to relate to the development of·dissemination 
equipment to be used with a standard set of agents kept on the shelf. A number of 
such dissemination devices appear to be peculiarly suited for the type of clandesti 
use one might associate with Agency operations. Some of these were included among 
hardviare stored for the Agency at Edgewood Arsenal subsequent to the closure of 
SOD: attache cases rigged to disseminate an agent into the air, a cigarette
