this impressi_on was derived solely frlm Gottlieb's meetings 
with Bissell and Tweedy. Neither Got1lieb nor the Chief of

Station had first-hand knowledge of Allen Dulles' statements 
about Presidential authorization. Ribhard Bissell assumed

DCI Dulles knew about and authorized bhe plot to assassinate 
Lumumba. However, we are unable to mlke a finding that 
• d E. h • • 11 I h • d • • Presi ent isen ower intentiona y aut orize an assassination 
effort against Luu1umca because of the lack of absolute certainty 
in the evidence. -~-----,.
