equities in the records, declassify them. and simply haruf them across the table to other 
agencies for their review. It has been our own experience that sessions of thia sort 
greatly simply the review process by giving agencies the opportunity to speak with 
each other and quicldy to resolve questions. • 
Because these papers will need to be reviewed by the Board at its August 5-6 meeting, 
we believe that an arrangement such as is proposed above will provide all agencies • 
with a full opportunity to identify their equities in the records and to make 
determinations regarding the need for continued classification. fi. the Joint Staff and the 
Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Baud will 
take the responsibility_f~r contacting all non-military agencies with equities in the 
records while the Joint Staff and DoD make arrangements.for all approp~~ military· .. - . .. · 
entities to be present. • 
We are, of cowse, veiy willing to consider other ideas or"SuggeStions that you might 
have. However, because the cloclc is ticking, it is important that we promptly develop a 
plan that will provide all agencies with equities in these Joint Staff/JCS papers to have 
an opportunity to review and declassify their equities. 
I look forward ~~~J!isue withyou.
