T P SECRET 
Mr. Dawson. After an intelligence operation blows, in 
the sense that it is uncovered in connection with the Govern-
ment of the US is found, are you aware that oftentimes a 
routine order goes out to estand down intelligence, to take 
positiveactions in that area, are you aware of that standard 
operating procedure? 
Mr. Dillon. I don't quite understand what your question 
is there. 
Mr. Dawson. After the U-2 crisis did we for a period of 
time stop agressive intelligence actions against the Soviet 
Union? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I think that was natural. 
Mr .. Dawson. That was my question. That is a routine 
matter? 
Mr. Dillon. That was a natural thing. Obviously we 
stopped the U-2 flights because we knew they had the capacity 
to shoot them down, and so it was no use doing it ag~in. 
And I would imagine we probably eased off on the eledt~onic 
flights along the coasts of the Soviet Union, and kept them 
further away, or disconinued them for awhile. 
Mr. Dawson. Are you aware of a similar stand down order 
having been issued after Lun1umba was captured? 
Mr. Dillon. No. 
Mr. Baron. Mr. Secretary, you mentioned earlier that you 
might have been away from Vvashington in August of 1960 ,.,..rhen
