LISAMPAN/BAKER: 12 November 1968: When Mercedes 
was on the phone with the maid, Santa, the conversatinn 
appeared to concern gossip over Jesus' family. Mercedes 
indicated that "-that will change the matter, Jesus said 
yesterday, we are going to maintain our distance, she 
is just bringing a story, and there are many in CU.ba 
living in this way." Later Merced.es said her in-laws 
were in CUba and a problem. Mercedes tells a fellow­
employee the problem she has had with Jesus' family. 
They were very religious, and racists. When the 
Revolution was a success, they wanted Jesus to obtain 
jobs for all of them, and Jesus told them he hadn't 
made the Revolution to get jobs for them. They had to 
resolve their own problems. Her mother-in-law hadn't 
wanted Jesus to marry Mercedes and did not attend the 
wedding. Later Mercedes said, "it seems clear that 
when she (probably the sister Digna) came it-is because 
the vieja (mother-in-law?) has asked for a visa. 
( See HMMA 36 071 ) 
In view of UFAA 603, this conversation is probably 
referring to the visit of Digna, Jesus' sister to Cuba 
to see about visas for the :ftmily to get out of Cuba. 
Par UFAA 603, Digna was in Mexico in November- ·1968 and 
saw cruz at the Embassy re visas. She begged him to 
help her so that these relatives could leave CUba, and 
Cruz refused. He said he also wanted his parents with 
him, but he could do nothing to·help them. (Source: 
sister, commented she believed Jesus probably did not 
want his parents to leave Cuba as it might compromise 
him or might affect his own (wife and children) family.' s 
freedom to leave Cuba with him.) 
UFAA 603: Sister believed Mercedes has great. 
influence on Jesus. 
b. Miscellaneous: 
Mercedes' personality: 
April 1968: Mercedes complained that when she arrived 
home in the eveing she had to wash diapers .. Complained 
about the soap in Mexico, and the high cost of living.
