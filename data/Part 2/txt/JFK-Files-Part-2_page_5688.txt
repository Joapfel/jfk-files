MEMORANDUM FOR: Information Review Officer, 
Directorate of Administration 
VIA: . Deputy Director for Administration 
Director of Facilities and Security Services 
Chief, Facilities Management Gro_up, OFSS 
FROM: Chief, Warrenton Training Center, FMG/OFSS 
SUBJECT: (S) Warrenton Training Center Cover 
Considerations 
1. (S) This memor.andum is written pursuant to yesterday's 
discussion with regard to the release of JFK-related documents 
that refer to ·"Warrenton" and/or derivatives of a Records Center. 
It documents executive-level "evidence" as to why "Warrenton" 
cover needs to be protected. In brief, significant damage to 
mission, people, and the very existence of the Warrenton Training 
Center (WTC) would occur as a result of the second- and third­
order effects of any confirmed affiliation.with the Agency. 
2. (S) As background, the Central Intelligence Agency has 
gone to great lengths to protect sensitive missions and prevent 
identification of covert personnel as Agency employees. The 
latter is est;recially profound as the very lives of 'these 
employees are:·often placed in jeopardy at hostile overseas posts. 
The anonymity provided by cover is essential to their protection. 
Furthermore, the Warrenton Training Center (WTC) provides the 
sanctuary whereby Department of State and Diplomatic 
Telecommunications Service Project Office (DTSPO) personnel can 
train alongside Agency employees without fear of being "tagged" 
as working for the Agency. 
3. (S) The cover mechanism itself is very fragile. Per 
mandate of the cover providers, the National Communications 
System (NCS), and the Department of the Army, the affiliation of 
WTC and the Agency, is classified SECRET vice CONFIDENTIAL. WTC
