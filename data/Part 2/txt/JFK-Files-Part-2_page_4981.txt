dUNDs-FoR-DEN"'I-A-I:;--WERE-TH-J\T-□LZl::-Z-AAD-NOT-SUBMITTED-StJ"FF-I-e-I-EWI' 
IDENCE TO JUSTIFY THE VISA. ROCA WAS HEARD TO TELL DIAZ THAT 
HIS REQUEST HAD BEEN UNDERMINED BY FELIX ( (BONNE)) CARCASSES, THE 
1
FCC LEADER. BONNE DENIED THIS ACTION, SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE 
rAD NO INTE:~STI:NE:::R:~::~GJ::::·GONZALEZ, A CLOSE FRIEND OF 
1
ROCA, INFORMED THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT AN AUTHORESS, IDENTIFIED AS 
,MARIANA ((BADELL)) (PHONETIC), WAS PREPARING A BIOGRAPHY OF CUBAN 
PRESIDENT FIDEL ((CASTRO)) AND WANTED TO MEET BONNE. THE REASON 
FOR SUCH A MEETING IN CONNECTION WITH A BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO WAS 
NOT CLEAR, BUT THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN GONZALEZ' HOME, AND 
INCLUDED BADELL, BONNE, AND MARTINEZ-AMORES. THE CCC LEADERS 
NOTED THAT BADELL APPEARED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE COURSE 
OF THE MEETING. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD HAD LUNCH WITH AN 
OFFICIAL OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA, WHO WAS ASSISTING HER 
WITH THE BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO BY PUTTING HER IN TOUCH WITH ONE 
CARLOS ALBERTO ((MONTANER)) IN MADRID, WHO WOULD EDIT THE BOOK. 
SHE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE SPANISH OFFICAL, BUT DESCRIBED HIM IN 
SUCH DETAIL THAT BOTH BONNE AND MARTINEZ-AMORES RECOGNIZED HIM AS 
JORGE ((DE ORUETA)), A LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE CCC. WHEN THE 
CONVERSATION WAS RELAYED TO DE ORUETA BY THE CCC, HE RECALLED 
BADELL HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIM BY VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE. HE 
FURTHER RECALLED THE LUNCH AND MENTION OF THE BOOK, BUT DECLARED 
THE MONTANER INFORMATION TO BE SPURIOUS. THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
SUGGESTED TO CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT THERE WAS COORDINATION 
AMONG INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF BEING DIRECTED BY CUBAN SECURITY. 
C. IN 1993 A GROUP OF DISSIDENTS, INCLUDING BONNE, WAS 
1 
NVITED TO THE HOME OF PIOTR ( (MIKISKA)) (PHONETIC), FIRST 
{oECRETARY AT THE CZECH EMBASSY, TO ATTEND A VISIT FROM THE CZECH 
YICE CHANCELLOR. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS KIND OF CONTACT WAS 
lj\NATHEMA TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.) THE CZECH INVITATION TO BONNE 
'fAS SENT THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE BY WORD OF MOUTH VIA ROCA. BY 
~OINCIDENCE, ANOTHER CCC REPRESENTATIVE VISITING MIKISKA WITHIN A 
BAY OR TWO OF WHEN THE INVITATION WAS RELAYED TO ROCA WAS ASKED 
I 
]}BOUT THE INIVTATION TO BONNE, AS BONNE HAD NOT RESPONDED TO THE 
qzECH EMBASSY. THE CCC REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDED THE QUERY 
~EGARDING THE INVITATION IN HIS REPORT OF THE MEETING TO THE CCC, 
GIVING BONNE HIS FIRST NOTIFICATION THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN AN 
I 
INVITATION. ROCA FINALLY PASSED THE MESSAGE TO THE HOME OF 
I 
yEORGINA DE LAS MERCEDES ((GONZALEZ)) CORBO, ONE OF BONNE'S CHIEF 
AISSISTANTS, TWO HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FUNCTION. 
D. IN MID 1995, REINALDO ((ROQUE)) MALHERBE OF CCC 
REPORTED THAT VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE WAS UNDERMINING ELIZARDO 
I 
SANCHEZ BY PASSING AROUND STORIES THAT HE HAD BEEN WITHHOLDING 
I 
<tJRGANIZATIONAL FUNDS, INTENDED FOR THE SOCIALIST CURRENT, FOR HIS 
fERSONAL USE. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS RUMOR CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE 
*G::ONTRIBUTED TO SANCHEZ' REPORTED RESIGNATION FROM THE<EXECUTIVE> I , 
CTOMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST CURRENT.) (
