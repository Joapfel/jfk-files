September of 1960, Lumumba was in the custody of the United 
Nations troops, who were actually protecting him at his 
residence in Leopoldville, not restraining him from leaving, 
but there was a Congolese guard surrounding the UN troops 
who were prepared to arres.t Lumumba if he did leave his 
residence. 
Mr. Dillon. I think I recall that now, because it is 
rather unusual circumstances. 
Mr. Baron. And then apparently in the middle of October 
the UN had refused to surrender Lumumba to the Congolese Army,' 
who had come with:.an:.arrest warrant for Lumumba. Is it your 
understanding that during this period of time, even after 
Lumurnba was in the protective custody of the United Nations, 
he was still considered a potential threat and volatile force 
in the Congo by the US? 
Mr. Dillon. I would imagine so. And I would not be at 
all surprised if the then rulers or officials of the 
Congolese Government that succeeded Lumumba were concerned 
about it, because he had this tremendous ability to stir up a 
crowd or a group. And if he could have gotten out and starte 
to talk to the battalion of the Congolese Army, he probably 
would have had them in the palm of his hand in five minutes. 
Mr. Baron. We had testimony from a CIA officer, who said 
he had been dispatched to the Congo by CIA Headquarters for 
the purpose of trying to secure Lumurnba's escape from UN
