In.his initial appearancesbefore the Committee on June 9 and-
11, 1975, Bissell made statements that tended to indicate that m1ite 
House authorization had been given. In response to the "twice urg~d" 
'quotation·of Harvey's notes in the Inspector General's Report, 
Bisse11 said, "I have no reason to believe that Harvey's quote is 
wrong." (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 51). Bissell accordingly said in his 
initiil testimony that as far as he knew, it was true that he was 
asked by the White House to. create a general stand-by_ assass.inatiori.

Based again upon Ilarvey 's missing notes ("ivhite House urging"), 
and his initial statement that he had no reason to challenge their 
accuracy, Bissell initially gave the opinion that McGeorge Bundy 
(Id., 6/9/75, p. L~9), Special Assistant to President Kennedy ,for 
National Security Affairs, and Walt Rostow (I~, p. 51), Deputy 
Assistant to President Kennedy during.1961, were the two peo~le frcim • 
whom such a request was most likely to have corn_e (Id., p. 53) because 
they were "the two members of' the White 1louse staff who were closest 
to CIA operations." (Id., p. 54). 
At another point in his .initial testimony, 13.issell said that

doubt in my mind that Project RIFLE was discussed with 
possibly Bundy" (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 46).
