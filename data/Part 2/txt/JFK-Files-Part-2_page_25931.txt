Testimony in the 1 %fl l'f') rings of the Senate Select Committee 
on ImpropDr Activitil's 111 !H~ labor or Management Field identified 
Santo Trafficante, .Tr., in tJw gpcrgtjpp of 01'½ Sws Sonri rrqm)>)inrr 
casino in Hava114. That testimony stated that Trnflicante took onr 
the Rans Sonc1 fron 1 the Mannarino brothel"? in Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Gabriel i\fannarino was a fellow delegate with Santo Trafficaiite, Jr., 
to the Apalachin crime convention in Hl5i. 
Ad<lit.1011al testimony named Traffica11te, .Jr., as the key figure in 
the l\fafia. in Tampa. stating, as the Tampa police had long known, 
that he succeeded his fat her as the major racketeer in the city. 
Other information substantiated hy our files reveals that Traffica.nte 
is an associate of such notorious criminals as l\fo,~ Lansky, ,Joseph 
Bonanno, S:ul.l G.inpcana, Aniello Dellacroce, ,Tosep~tasst, ~am Man­
narino, ,Joscpt Arcuri, and of Joseph Hi<·cobono, also known as Staten 
Island Joe, who had been closely allied with the elder Trafficante, 
and was also disco,·erPtl at the Apalachin meeting. 
"'hrn .Toseph Profaci's clnnghter Carmella married Anthony Tocco, 
fon of Drtroit mob,,ter \Yilliam "Black Bill" Tocco, in Brooklyn on 
.I unc 4, H)fin, one of ! he g11Psts at the reception in the Hotel Com­
modore in New York was Santo Traflicante, ,Tr. :\mong those who 
also attended were 1:1 other persons "·ho later attended the Apalachin 
c·onference, as well as other notorim1s ::\fo.fla figures, snch as Frank 
,Lirnrsi, Thomas and ,John Dioguardi, Tony and Allwrt ·Anastasia, 
and Thomas "Three Finger Brown" Lucchese. 
There have been at least two known at.tempts 011 the life of Santo 
Trallicante: On ,fonnary 2, rn:-,:3, he was shotgnnnetl in a rar on the 
streets of Tampa, receiving wonnds in the arm. Later, in Cuba, four 
American mobsters who int.ended to kill Traflicante "·ere told by 
Cuban police that they \YOUl<l have to do it on American soil. 
TraITTcante has been arrested in 'l'ampn. several times for investiga­
tion, because of our knowledge that he was deeply involved in gam­
bling, e,·en though we have not yet been able to obtain the quantum 1Jf 
proof necessary to a s11cccssfol prosecution. He has also been picked 
up by the police for questioning abont the gangland slayin«s of Rene 
Nunez, Angelo Giglio, aml ,Joe Antinori. "' 
Traflicante wns a suspect in the Albert Anastasia munler on Oc­
tober 2fi, 1D57, in :.:-,;cw York because he had appeared in New York 
just before the murder. He was considered a likely sust)ect because 
there had been reports that Anastasia was then attemptmg to more
