U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO· INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
. .... , 
Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7, 
1975, and specifically to Item 1 of an accompanying Document 
Request of same date which requested all materials contained 
in the files of William C. Sullivan pertaining to Martin Luther 
King, Jr., and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
(SCLC) which have not previously been made available to the 
Committee. Excluded from consideration in connection with this 
request were any portions containing transcripts or summaries 
or tapes of electronic surveillances of King. 
The purpose of this, memorandum is to effect delivery· 
to the SSC of materials in response to Item 1 of the Document 
Request .. 
With respect to the excisions in materials being 
delivered herewithY- where no notation appears as to reason 
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the 
information actually summarizes or .quotes from conversations 
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some 
cases it can be ascertained precisely what information in these 
materials came from electronic surveillances of King; however, 
there exist areas where documentation of the information is not 
precise and no accurate determination can be made. The·ref ore, 
no assurances can be given that portions of the materials 
being furnished -do not contain information developed as a 
result of electronic surveillances of Ki~g.
