over the six years of our review process. The National 
Archives ground rules called for release of every copy for 
inclusion in the NARA collection; therefore, each of these 
47 copies is included as part of the total collection. As 
duplicate copies were found, comparison with- the 1993_ 
released version revealed not only inconsistencies but 
textual phrasing which,· in a mosc3.ic of related documents, 
made iikely the identification of a protected individual or 
action. As a result, much re-review of the files was 
required and did occur. 
Another time-consumer was the question of the 
identification of overseas station locatiqns, traditionally 
not revealed--both to protect Agency individuals, activities 
and sources and to avoid foreign relations difficulties with 
foreign governments. In these cases, a window of time for 
acknowledgment of such facilities was negotiated, directly 
.relevant to such actions as Oswald's travels and post­
assassination requests for foreign government assistance in 
the U. s. investigation. 
Except for redaction of names of CIA employees, true 
names of clandestine agents (otherwise identified with 
traceable cryptonyms), and currently-sensitive cooperation 
with specific foreign intelligence services, the final 
collection in the National Archives will contain very 
limited redactions and, in our opinion, none that would 
affect an historian's understanding of the Agency's 
information on, and relevance to, the event.
