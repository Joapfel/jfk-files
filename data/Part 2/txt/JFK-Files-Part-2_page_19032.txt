ask~d .Jaffe his attitude toward the Hong Kong c:d.sis and how 
the British had reacted and wheth~r or not.their hostility 
had tauered off. Jaffe stated: "I said I 'was pretty so1'e 
about the British newspaper man being held in Chirrn." . Szeto 
replied that the British were holding one of thej_r (Chin0-'s) •

When Jaffe was pac~ing to return to the United 
States, he contacted Szeto and Szeto suggested that they get 
together. Jaffe indicated he would like to introdnce his 
wife to Szeto. This was agreeable and Szeto took them to dinner 
.. on the eve of the Chinese Anniversary. Szeto brought ·up the 
subject of keeping in touch witb.Jaffe, indicating that he did 
not desire to contact him through ABC. It was decided that 
after Jaffe got settled in the United States, he would write 
.Szzto at the Chinese News Agency office in Hong Kong and furnish 6' 
his mailing address. Jaffe again indicated to Szeio his strong 
desire to get assigned to China. Jaffe said he had cleared

·showed me a report on him (&eto). He told about taking groups 
or:_-Jieo·p1e~ to China: He had been abroad but never to this 
cou-1it"ry-(United States). He obviously was a liaison man wj_th 
the Foreign press. I think it was a surprise to CIA and the 
State Department that he (Szeto) would see us (the Jaffes)."
