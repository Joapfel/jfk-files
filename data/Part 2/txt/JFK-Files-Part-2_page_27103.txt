case rigged to disseminate an agent when lighted, a fountain pen dart launcher, 
• an engine head bolt designed to release an agent when heated, a fluorescent 
light starter to activate the light and then release an agent, etc. Available 
records do not indicate whether or not all these were developed specifically for 
the CIA, though the DOD investigation has identified the head bolt device as 
( 
falling into such a category. The easy association of this equipment with 
specific Agency requirements because of its nature is apt to be misleading, 
however. At a meeting ,in June 1952, at the very outset of the Agency's associa­
tion with SOD ~1hen CIA representatives stated they as yet had no specific re­
quirements, a list of SOD priorities for work on dissemination devices was 
provided. This dissemination list included such things as cigarettes, chewing 
gum, cigarette lighters, wrist watches, fountain pens, rings, etc. Presumably 
work on these devices was already underway in response·to Army Special Forces 
requirements. Nevertheless, the Agency clearly showed an interest in such devices 
and levied requirements for the special preparation of some. 
One development pecuHarly associated with the CIA was the '1microbioinoculato1 
which was an extremely small dart device which could be fired through clothing to 
pen~trate the skin so as to inoculate him with an agent. of some sort without the 
target's perception of being hit. An added fillip to this development was the 
requirement that no indications of the use of such a device be discernable in 
the course of autopsy. A large amount of Agency attention was given to the 
problem of incapacitating guard dogs. Much of the equipment delivered to the 
Agency and some of the testing ·undertaken by it involved a dart del Ivery system 
carrying dog incapacitants, and an antidote used subsequently to restore the dog
