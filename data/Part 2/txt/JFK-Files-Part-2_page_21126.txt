I. New Cases and New Information 
The current interrogations of NOSENKO _have developed 
six new cases involving nine people which were previously not 
uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation 
has identified six of these persons and one [_ooMENICO CANALAU(§) 
has been inter~iewed and admitted the allegations. This case 
is considered significant ccirroboration of NOSENKO. 
Additional significant data was developed cm three 
cases previously mentioned by NOSENXO. Data.in one case (the 
Brussels case) may assist in the identification of .a KGB ~gent 
who supp 1 i ed NATO code.s . 
Considerable interesting, new and. confirmatory data 
was obtained during the current interrogations .. Twelve examples 
are cited 
COMMENT: The new cases,· ~w information and 
\ 
confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-
rogations and collateral inquiries also. clearly 
establi. sh that the previous interrogations were 
deficient and collateral i.nquirles inadequate. 
Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO's 
personnel id~ntifications and organizational data_ 
denotes lack of obJecc'ivity in CIA
