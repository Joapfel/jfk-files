I~DEPENDENT PROG?tSSIVE PA?TY 
The 1955 Peoort of the California Com~ittee on 
Un-American Activities, Page 46, stated, "The Independent 
Progressive ?arty in California was quickly captured by the 
corrnunists, 2nd by the time the :\lallace :'°"or President campaip.:n 
had swung into high gear was being o~erated lock, stock, and 
barrel by the CoJ11munist Party of California. Time after time 
the co~rnittee in questionin~ witnesses throughout the State 
discoverec 1, that the leaders of the Comrr.unist Parties in various 
localities were identical with the leaders of the Independent 
Progressive Party in the sarre area. It is true, of co;rse, 
that in the Indeoendent Progressive Party there were many 
sincere liberals who, because of dissatisfaction with the two 
major nolitical org~nizations registered 2s Inr.ependent 
T.'rocrressives and continued their affiliation until the true 
control of the I.P.P. became obvious. These people invariably 
resipned, many of them having given the benefit of their 
experience to various official agencies interested in the 
exnosure of subversive activities."
