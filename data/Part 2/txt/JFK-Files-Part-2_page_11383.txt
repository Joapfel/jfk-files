not necessary to reque3t the off~ce originally obtaininf 
the information to document it further ·by furnishing 
information showing the location of the original in 
the office files. If all documentation, except the 
latter item, is not in the possession of the office 
preparing the report, it should be obtained. 
If it is found desirable to include in a report the 
identities of individuals who are known communists 
and have been associates of the subject to lend 
weight to evidence of the subject's potential 
dangerousness, only the source of the inf~rmation 
showing the associate to be a communist need be 
identified. 
In a very limited number of instances it may be nfrcessary 
to obtain a thumbnail sketch or characterization of an 
individual or organization from another office or the 
Bureau. When such information is received in your 
office, it sh6uld be placed in thumbnail sketch files 
so that it will be available to and can· be readily

among our responsibilities as an inv~stigative agency. It is the Bureau~s

in line with the Delimitations .Agreement and Presidential di rec ti ve s which 
·provide for the dissemination to other agencies of information relating 
to espionage, sabotage., subversive activities, and related matters where 
the speoifio agency has a present or p~tential interest in the information,·
