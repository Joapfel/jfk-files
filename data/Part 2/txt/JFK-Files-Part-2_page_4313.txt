SUBJECT: 
PRESENT: 
Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Special Group, 
5 November 1963 
Kr. Bundy, Kr. Johnson, Kr. Vance, and Kr. McCone. 
The Attorney General, Kr. Helms, Kr. Cheever, Dr. Wheelon, 
and Colonel Steakley were present for Items ·:1 ·and 2. The 
Attorney General and Mr. Helms were present for Item 3. 
1. Cuba - Sabotage Operation in Southeast Pinar (No. 3105). 
Kr. Helms briefed t.he Group on the background of the mission and 
on events leading up to the infiltration attempted on 21-22 October. 
On the basis of available information, the best estimate is that Castro's 
security forces penetrated the reception committee and laid a trap which 
resufted in the capture of some personnel. 
The subsequent press coverage of this affair renders the further 
operational use of the mother ships REX and LIDA to be undesirable in 
the immediate future. 
2. Cuba - Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations 
Kr. Cheever presented a low-key sabotage operation, No. 3111, against 
a warehouse and pier on the north coast of Cuba. This activity is to be 
carried out by a small commando team which will land.on the pier and the 
warehouse. 
Mention was made by Kr. Cheever of some problems with British patrols 
which have unwittingly exposed some of CIA's operations. Kr. Bundy stated 
that he would mention this to the British Ambassador and CIA would follow 
up on a service-to-service level in order to prevent further unnecessary 
incidents . 
.. In addition, the Special Group tentatively approved two other operations. 
these are No. 3112, a sabotage operation against a sawmill located in northern 
Oriente Province and No. 3115, the infiltration of a radio operator to provide 
comnunications for a ratline. 
Kr. Bundy has placed the above three operations on a "fail safe" basis 
pending concurrence in each case by higher authority.
