Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Board will 
. take the-responsibility for amtacting all non-military agencies with equities in the 
records while Army and DoD make arrangements for all ·appropriate military entities to 
bepesent. 
We are, of a>Ul'le, very willing to amsider other ideas or suggestions that you might . 
have. However, becaUSC! the clock is ticking, it is important that we promptly develop a 
phµt that will provide all agencies with equities in the Califano papers to have an 
opportunity to review and declassify their equities. 
I look forward to discussing this Js!;ue with you.
