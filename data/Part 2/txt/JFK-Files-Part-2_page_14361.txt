INTE·RAGENC.Y: REGISTRY 
• 
Attached is a_merriorandum from Mr. Colby to all USIB 
principals dated 4/10/75 describing the establishment of a 
registry to. insure 'that the community is kept :informed as to 
materials which will ·formally be 'provided to the SeTe·ct Committee 
by all elements -of the intelligence community. The Colby 
memorandum notes that ,in order to make ·the. registry useful it 
is es·sential that it include the following: • 
File copies of documents or other materials which each 
intelli·gence community element provides to a Select Committee 
wherein the originating agency considers the material t0 involve 
aspects ·of cominuni ty activities·.· (The ·Bureau would have very few 
items ·of this nature ·other .than agreements. -or understandings 
the Bureau might have with ·other· elements; ·of the intelligence 
community. ) • 
The second requirement of the registry is ·tha-t an 
al:>stract of each response· to a se·lect ·comini ttee be provided to 
the registry for its retention. The Bureau has ·already established 
a procedure 'for providing such ·abstracts to the r~gistry . 
• RECOMMENDAT·IONS·: 
1. In light .of the Church statement in "The Washington 
Post"· and the subs'equent conversations the White House· has ·or 
contemplates· havi!lg with 'Sehators Church and Tower_,-. it .is 
recommended that we ·continue to. diss·eminate all responses to 
the SSC except .in those sensitive matters that require close· 
administrative ·control. In those instances ·it is recommended 
that we advise the Staff Director that such information responsive 
to their request is available at Bureau Headquarters and may be 
reviewed by himse·lf or a senior staff member of the SSC.
