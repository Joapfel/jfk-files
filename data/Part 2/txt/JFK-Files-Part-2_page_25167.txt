~'The question was raised as to whether there had been such a significant chanr;e in the Vietnam 
:Situation that it really appeared desirable to dump the NHU's and possibly DIEM himself. Prin­
Clcipal points discussed were: ADMIRAL FELT's concern over the danp.;ers inherent in the current 
5VS action in South Vietnam; the fact that LODJE had not seen DIEJ'-1 to discuss the future role 
of the NI-KJ's; the meaninp; of the phrase 'give direct support to military corrmanders' in DEPI'EL
