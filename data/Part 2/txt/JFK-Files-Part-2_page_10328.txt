1, FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the ·Ellsberg 
and Watergate cases. ' 
2, FBIS operations occa.sionaliy extend to the domestic arena. From 
time to time, FBIS linguists arc m~de available to ODO or Office of 
Coaruunica.tions·co~ponents for special operations (usually abro~d) involving 
close-support. SIGI~rr work or translation of audio take. ·On one occasion . 
recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several 
FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for tha FBI on a short­
term proje.ct here in Washington. The arrangements were mo.de by ~Cr. Oberg 
of the DUO CI Staff. He said the project was very highly classified and 
that FBIS participation was approved by Hr. Colby and the Director. !-'BIS 
particj_pation w.:,.s. a?provcd by the Director of FBIS af tcr a check with 
the ADDJ.. Other. examples of sensitj_vc lin:;uistic support. ,,·ork are help 
·in the h.3.ndling and resettlement of c!C'fcctors, the recent assjgnmc:nt of 
an employee c6 the Bureau of Narcotics and D~ngcrous Drugs to transcribe 
recordings :in a rare Chinese dfalcct, and the detailing cf another 
Chinese lj_nguj_st on two occasions to assist in the u:s. military training 
of Chinese Nc.1.tionn.list cadets. 
3. Within its responsibility fC>r monitoring press agency .tr.ans­
m1.ssions for intelligence information, FDIS publ ishcs and distributes 
some material which··falls in a 11g·ray 11 area of copy1.·ight protection, libel, 
and privacy of international communications. Press services controlled 
by national governments and transmitted b:,· radiotclctype withou·t 
specific addressees, e.g. the. Soviet TASS service and the PRC's ~ICNA, 
are monitored by FilIS und the 1natcrial is disseminated without restric­
tion. The legality of this has been af[irmed by decisions of the 
Off ice of General Counsel. Howe\•er, we also monitor some in-house, 
corrcspondcnt-to-headqua1.·ters dispatches \-.'hich are considered private 
point-to-poi11t trnn_smissions. FBIS therefore avoids public distribution o·f 
mat.erial r.1onitored from these circuits by labeling them with an 110fficial 
Use Only'..' caveat, The sar.1e cav~at is used on material which we monitor 
from other press agencies which arc· protected by international copyright, 
e, g .• • Agence France rrcsse (AFP), the ?·liddle East News Agency (t•IENA), and the 
Iraqi N\?s Agency (INA). This procedure has allowed FBIS to disseminate news
