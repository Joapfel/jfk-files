Re: CIA Compliance With the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 
Dear Messrs. McNamara and Stem: 
The Review Board considers it essential that certain remaining obligations of the CIA . 
under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 199Z, 44 
U.S.C. § 2107 r'JFK Act") be identified and memorialized before the Board.ceases 
operations on September 30, 1998~ 
I therefore am enclosing, for your agencies' consideration, a draft Memorandwn of 
Understanding setting forth the outstanding obligations of CIA under the JFK Act. ·we 
believe that it is in the interest of the CIA, the National Archives, the Review Board, and 
ultima~ely the public to put in writing our collective. understanding of the additional 
workthat CIA must undertake and the reasonable time frames within which it should 
be completed. It is our intent to reduce any future ambiguity or disagreements that 
may potentially arise as CIA completes its work. We also believe that this MOU will 
facilitate the ability of the Archivist of the United States to carry out his statutory 
obligation to certify to the President that all assassination-related records have been 
released in accordance with the Act (see 44 U.S.C. § 2107(12)). 
The terms of a Memorandum of Understanding have been discussed among the staffs 
of the Review Board, the National Archives, and CIA. We believe that the enclosed 
draft proposal is a fair accommodation of competing interests. Please review the
