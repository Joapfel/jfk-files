Dear Professor Blakey: 
Pursuant to our conversation of yesterday, 
August 22, 1977, and my subsequent conversation with 
Donovan L. Gay, Chief Researcher, of August 23, 1977, 
•I hereby tender my resignation with the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations effective September 20, 
1977. 
I have enjoyed my work at the Committee and I 
hope that my research as well as that of others will 
aid in finding the truth and in bringing a satisfying 
end to these investigations. • 
Sincerely '· 
•. / ..
