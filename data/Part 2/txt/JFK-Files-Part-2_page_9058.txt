costly to achieve abroad. Further,· such coverage is on 
targets which affect directly the national interests. 
For several years your Bureau had been recep­
tive 'to requirements and leads which resulted in valuable 
coverage, The quality of your production proved that 
which cannot b~ duplicated by any other U.S. agency. 
On 2 October 1969 two rel;te<l reque~ts £or audio "" 
coverage were submitted by this Agency pertaining to 
positive intelligence targets, one of who1n had KGB connec­
tions. (I refer to the case of ~"Eri.~nd ~~,re 
~~~.) Your Bureau replied that henceforth the 
Agency should refer all such cases dfrectly to the Attorney 
General for approval. 
It is suggested that the question of audio coverage 
beJreopened between representatives of your Bureau and 
this Agency. I would welcome your thoughts and observa-
tions on this subject. •

I 
I wish to assure you that I believe that this sensitive 
-- type of collection ~hould be implemented under rigid and 
- stringent controls. This is absolutely necessary in order to 
maintain the highest standard of security both in instituting 
the coverage and for the exploitation of the product. (An 
excellent example of this is demonstrated in your effective 
and secure production of fcoPE.jfe)
