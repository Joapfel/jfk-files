(U) b. There is no comprehensive readily 
available record of precisely what information 
has been declassified and released in accordance 
with the Freed6m of Information Act. and the 
Privacy Act; there are separate collections 
with a limited capability to retrieve some such 
information; 
(U) c. There is no available record of 
the information that officials of the Executive 
Branch of government, with authority to 
declassify information, have said or written 
in public either before Congressional 
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows, 
college symposiums, the general' lecture 
circuit; other public forums, etc. 
In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee 
that those items which are still classified by the 
DDO components have not been deliberately or 
inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as 
"official public disclosure." 
(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A 
lists those items of the DDO ·deleted items which have 
been declassified by "official public disclosure." 
These thirteen complete and parts of fou~ other items 
c~n therefore be released from the court injunctioti. 
(S) 4. Attachfuent B (seven parts) contains 
eleven deleted items (seven subjects) which are still 
classified but about which there may be some possible 
question. These are highlighted here so that 
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with 
due regard for all legal and policy aspects. 
(U) S. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining 
items which the DDO cqmponents advise are still 
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amended and 
cannot be released from the court injunction.
