They also have available a considerable amount of anti-tank guns and light 
antiaircraft guns suitable for use against low flying aircraft. How much of 
the large numbers of additional crew-operated weapons af the types mentioned 
above are now in Cuban hands is apparently not known or estimated. 
The Soviet organization has a powerful modern array of weapons in plen­
tiful numbers. There are 24 SA-2 sites of 6 launchers each, in a tight knit 
perimeter air defense of the entire Island of Cuba. These weapons are similar 
to our NII<E-HERCULES and are very good indeed. Their fire control system is 
also estimated as of a high order of effectiveness. They have brought in a 
large amount of ammunition for these units. The SA-2 system which is quite 
complex is manned by Soviet troops. It would take over a year of intensive 
training, including quite technical schooling, for the native Cuban troops to 
replace the Sovie ts in the SA-2 system. Probably associated with the SA-2 si teE' 
for low level air defense, as well as in local defense of other important sites, 
are some of the large additional numbers of light antiaircraft guns brought in 
by the Soviet Expeditionary Force. Whether any or all of these weapons are 
manned by Soviets is apparently not known. 
There are four cruise missile sites, with missiles of a range of about 
30 to 40 miles from their ground launchers. The missiles are placed as part 
of the coastal defense system of Cuba, which is the normal Soviet employment 
of these weapons. They are manned by Soviet naval crews. As an added feature 
of these missiles, there are at least one hundred fifty (150) of them in Cuba, 
far more than could be logically associated with the known missile launching 
sites. It may be speculated that the launchers for these missiles may have 
been in some of the bloc shipping turned back by the October Quarantine and 
thus failed to reach Cuba.
