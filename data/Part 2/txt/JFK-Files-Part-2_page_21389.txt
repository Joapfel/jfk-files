The following references in the file captioned 11Lee Harvey· 
Oswald 11 set forth infbrmation pertaining to the activities of Richar~ 
Thomas Gibson during the period March~ 1960 through 12/9/63, in New~ 
York, Algeria, Cuba, France and Switzerland. Gib~on, a journalist,\ 
had been head of the FPCC in the US and reportedly was a possible link 
between the FPCC and the Chinese communists. He vrnrked as a journalist 
in Cuba and later in Algeria where he reportedly worked for the 
Algerian Government. From a reported conversation between Gibson and 
~nother individual iri Switzerland there appeared a possible indication 
tfi~t Gibson had been acquainted ~ith Oswald. Gibson was interviewed' 
at the American Embassy, Paris, where he stated that he had no 
.correspondence or knowledge of Oswald ,under.the latter's full name. 
However, he had received a lett·er from one Lee Bowmont who had 
indicated an interest in organizing a FPC~ in Ft.-Wprth, Texas, who 
_ possibly was Oswald. Oswald-allegedly had been connected· with the 
FPCC. The interviewer suspected that Oswald's pictures may have ~ 
looked familiar to Gibson.
