j NEW FBI ACADEM ... l 
In May, 1965, the Dlrector submitted a proposal to the 
• Attorney General for tae building of a new FBI Academy on the 
Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virgi.nia. This suggestion was 
im1nediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney G:neral. 
The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead 
of training 200 local la,v enforcement officers annually at the FBI 
N~tional A~ademy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local la,v 
enforcement officers in specialize~ courses. The Congress has 
appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility. 
The planning and engineering work on the site is in 
progress and it is anticipated that the contr~ct for the construction 
of the Academy will be let sometime during the sum1ner of 1967. It 
is believed that the new A.caden1y will be ready for occupancy during 
fiscal year 19 69.
