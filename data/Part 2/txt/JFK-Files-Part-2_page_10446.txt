8. Provision of forged documentation to non-DDO requesters, 
whether they be CIA or other Agency reques tcrs, always· requires 
approval of non-TSD offices. Support to the military for instance 
would be validated by FI Staff/Departmental Coordination Group 
~t Headquarters or by the COS overseas having responsibility for 
coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated 
with DDO/NARCOG. Requests for documentation of Immigration 
and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs 
Staff. 
9. Authentication items are issued o:ti a loan basis and must 
be returned to TSD or accounted for. After any documentatio.n has 
been issued, TSD retains photographs and records of such support 
until the documentation ha? been returned to TSD.. If the material 
is not returned after a reasonable time, the requester is reminded 
of the outstanding documentation.
