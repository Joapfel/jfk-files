Asks for her husband whom she hasn't seen. 
Said "he was here, but he left." 
Said she has been waiting for him for a while 
because she has to give him a list of people 
to review (or revise). 
Told LLAGOSfERA that he should turn on the 
radio . 
.Again rejoices and says how great it is. 
Became serious and asked if LUISA knows the 
consequences. 
Says "good." 
Said she felt sorry because he was a man 
and the father of a family. 
Said she felt sorry because he was a father, 
but he was "a degenerate, m1fortunate, an 
aggressor." 
Apart from his politics with Cuba, she 
didn't believe anything had been resolved; 
"one nrust now wait to see what will happen." 
After asking her to wait, asked what more was 
said. 
Said they have now been given the news; he 
has died, was shot three times in the face. 
Said perfect. Now I'm going to come down. 
Replied, good.
