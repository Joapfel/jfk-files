that it would be impossible to bring a big group to 
Algiers and would in fact be dangerous because of the 
attitude of the Moroccan government. Wiley belibves 
that it would be best to have a small team of 3 lo 6 
trained individuals who could proceed to the Youlh 
Festival at Algiers and who would be directed no} at 
disruption or propaganda, but would aim at intelligence 
gathering. Wiley himself stated that he would akain 
volunteer to go to Algiers at this time, not ost~nsibly 
connected with the aforementioned group, and onl~ as a 
free lance newspaperman. Wiley pointed out that/ • 
undoubtedly he is now the top news authority in ~he U.S. 
on CP Youth Festivals. Wiley states that he bel~eves 
he can arrange financing from private organizatVons and 
individuals for the 3 to 6 individuals mentione~ above 
and possibly enough for travel by himself althoJgh this 
may not be obtainable. Wiley requests a study o:f this 
matter and advice. )

that the Director of Security gave his approval on

Algiers trip. He would, as in the past, utilizle this 
fund to cover any deficit for his own travel cdsts; not 
for any of the group which he supervises at t~~ festival. 
Wiley also inquiried as to extending his trave] in 
August to include 4-6 weeks in South America. /Also,
