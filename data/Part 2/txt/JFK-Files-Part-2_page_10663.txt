Re: senate Select Connnittee on Intelligence {SSCI) 
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and. 
International Affairs (OLIA) and the 
Counterintelligence Situation in west Berlin 
DETAII.S: 
Mr .. Hale opened the session, advising Mr. Eliff that, on his recent trip to Western Europe to visit certain u. s. 
Embassies and establishments, including the u. s. Mission in 
West Berlin, where Legal Attaches were desired and needed, he had conferred with appropriate u. s. military, u. s. Department of 
state (USDS) and central ·Intelligence Agency (CIA) ~ersonnel in 
order to present the FBI's case for representation in . West Berlin. During these discussions, Mr. Hale· was advised that 
staff members of the SSCI had recently visited West Berlin 
concerning counterintelligence issues·and Mr. Hale, in that 
context, wished to brief Mr. Eliff regarding the FBI's 
perspectives on opening a Legal Attache, particularly from a 
counterintelligence point of view. 
Mr. Eliff stated that although he had not recently 
visited West Berlin, he was intimately- familiar with the . 
intricacies of the counterintelligence atmosphere in West Berlin 
and supported the FBI's presence there. He indicated he was well aware of the g~p which existed in the counterintelligence 
coverage of u. s. civilians, ):)oth students and businessmen in 
that neither the u. s. military nor the o. s. civilian , 
intelligence intelligence components were addressing the threat 
to these individuals and this for two reasons. 
The first involved the basic functions of the u. s. 
intelligence components in West Berlin, a function he described as being the collection of positive intelligence as opposed to counterintelligence, the latter being at best a secondary 
requirement.
