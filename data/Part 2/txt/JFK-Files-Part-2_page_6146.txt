History offers uncertain guidance about how the Board should weigh these grounds 
for postponement against the public's interesc..in knowing the facts about the 
assassination. The Framers of the United States Const_itution did harbor doubts 
about government, doubts precipitated by their experience in the English Empire. 
n107 James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, among others, testified eloquently to 
the proposition that public accountal:>ility wae an appropriate measure of the 
success of a republic. nl08 Still, ·the Framers were also sophisticated statesmen 
who valued secrecy in fostering the public g.ood. n109 For example, the . 
Philadelphia Convention of 1787 conducted its deliberations in secret without 
any complete record of its debates. nli0 The Constituc.ion provides for the 
maintenance of an executive journal for both Houses of Congress and permits 
government to publish its accounts and revenues from "time to time-,• rather than 
on demand. nlll Even more fundamental was President George Washington's 
assertion of a broad degree of presidential discretion in dealing with foreign 
relations, war, and peace. n112 In certain circwnstances, secrecy could be 
justified to attain ends superior to a completely in- (*18] formed public. 
Indeed, the Constitution's Preamble declares that insuring "domestic 
Tranquilityn and providing for the •common defence" are objectives 'equal to 
securing the •Blessings of Liberty.a nl13
