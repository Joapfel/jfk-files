We are sending this letter to you and olhe-r~, from whom we have not heard much 
recently, in the hope of re-enlistinG your efforts in the Women for Peace , 
movement. It has been too long since we 1~.1.st heard directly from in.any of you, 
and our meetings with those of you whom W1' have seen recently have been brief. 
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of fructration we all feel occasionally, 
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is' -only 
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. 1\a women, we bear the major 
responsibility for the preservqtion of life, and thus a major responsibility 
in the peace movement, 
Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort 
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperuting in raising funds 
to send representatives to ~ushington. We hope that you v.rill also support this 
effort, to insure re:pr.esentatjcn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon 
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort, 
In addition, we will haven supportive peaceful demonstration 
in Portland at 
NOON, Monday, Ji\NUi~RY 15th

available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,

':le hope, if you cannot go to Washington,yourself, that you will contribute to 
help someone else to go, a,nd that you will also join with us e.t the Pioneer 
Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th.
