1. About 500 Argentines are estimated to have 
traveled illegally to Cuba for training in subversive 
activities. One training group alone, given guerrilla 
warfare training over a six-month period in 1962, 
varied in number from 34 to 50. For the past four 
months departures from Argentina for Cuba have averaged 
35-40 a month. Argentine intelligence says 80 of the 
500 are known to have received guerrilla training; 
the number is probably considerably higher.

cords no arrests for guerrilla activity. There were 
155 arrests and three convictions for sabotage in 1962, 
and 14 arrests, but no convictions, to date in 1963. 
Records on terrorist activity show 468 cases, 60 arrests, 
and 27 convictions in 1962; 121 cases, two arrests and 
two convictions in 1963. Argentine police also list 
628 arrests in 1962 and 1963 on the broader charge of 
"subversive activity."

of sabotage or terrorism, of which 425 were committed 
by. unknown persons. Police have no evidence that any 
of those arrested or convicted are known to have re­
ceived training in Cuba.
