therefore, he knew it could be done~ (Station to Hqs cable, 
3/21/61) Two days later, Headquarters cabled that the pistols 
and ammunition were being pouched. However, the Station 
Chief was instructed not to advise Dearborn. (Hqs. to Station 
cable, 3/24/61)* 
b. Reason for the CIA Instruction 
Not to Tell Dearborn 
Owen testified that he believed the ''don't tell Dear­
born the pistol is being pouched" language simply meant that 
the sending of firearms through the-diplomatic pouch was not 
something to be unnecessarily discussed. (Owen, pp. 78,79) 
Dearborn said he never doubted the pouch was used, since he knew 
Owen had no other means of receiving weapons. (Dearborn, 
7/29, p. 33) 
c. Were the Pistols Related to Assassination? 
Dearborn testified that he had asked for a single pistol 
for purposes completely unrelated to any assassination con-
sideration. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp. 29-31) He said he had been 
approached by a Dominican contact-who lived in a remote area 
and was concerned for the safety of his.family in the event 
of political reprisals. Dearborn testified that he had believed 
* The Inspector General's Report, issued in connection with 
a revie-.'of these events, concludes that: 
"There is no indication in the EMDEED operational files 
that the pistols were actually pouched. The request • 
for pistols appears to have been overtaken by a sub­
sequent. request for submachine guns." (I.G. Report, p,• 60) 
This conclusion is difficult to understand in light of the March 
24, 1961, Headquarters to Station cable;,w~ich provides: 
"C. Pouching 1. revoi vers :.,and:.,ammo<requested TRUJ 04 62 
(in 20040) on 28 March. • Do not advise (name Dearborn deleted) 
this material being pouched. Explanation follows.''
