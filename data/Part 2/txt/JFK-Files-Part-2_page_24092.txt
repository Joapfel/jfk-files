The Committee notes that many of the occasions on 
which CIA officials should have informed their superiors 
of the assassination efforts but failed to do so, or did 
so in a misleading manner, were also occasions on which 
Administration officials paradoxically may have reinforced 
the perce :i'.:ion that assassination was permissible. 
For example, when Bissell spoke with Bundy about an 
executive action capability, Bissell failed to indicate that 
an actual assassination operation was underway, but Bundy 
failed .to rule out .assassination as a tactic. 
In May of 1962 the Attorney General was misleadingly told 
about the effort to assassinate Castro prior to the Bay of Pigs, 
• but not about the. operation that was then going on. The Attorney 
General, however, did not state that assassination was improper. 
When a ienior administration official rai~ed the question 
of whether assassination should be explored at a Special Group 
meeting, the assassination operation should have been revealed, 
but a firm written order against engaging in assassination should 
also have been issued by McCone if, as he testified, he had ex­
hibited strong aversion to assassination.
