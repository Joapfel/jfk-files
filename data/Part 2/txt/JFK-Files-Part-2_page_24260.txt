however, did not maintain· any jet equipment at that point. This 
cargo system which they ?eveloped was getting heavily into a mil­
_itary air transport contract system. The system was first known 
as MATS, and then it became MAC. 
They got MATS contracts, and Air America got these, 
and these were very good to keep a constant utiliza­
tion at a good rate, the MATS rates were usually good, 
because the policy was not to do competitive bidding 
for the lowest bidder because then you got the poorest 
service, but give good rates to the carriers, and then 
require the carrier belong to the Civil Reserve Air 
Fleet. 
In 1956 MATS changed its policy and· required that bidders on 
the contracts to be certificated. Of course, there was no real way 
that Air America could become certificated and so the Agency decid­
ed to purchase Southern Air Transport. While it was technically 
~) a separate entity, ·not involved in the Air .America complex, it was 
actually an integral part from tremanagement point of view, in that 
all management decisions were centered again in George Doole and 
the advisory team in the Agency. MAC eventually also decided to 
require that bidders not only have to be certificated, but had 
to have equipment qualified for the Civil Reserve Air Flee_t. and 
this meant jet equipment .. As a result. the Agency went into the 
acquisition of Boeing 727

entirely useful for these purposes. "So the theory was that the
