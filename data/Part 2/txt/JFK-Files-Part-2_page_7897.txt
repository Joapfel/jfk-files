_ Dear Mr. Lesar: -,. 
--, 
21 JUN 1976 --
This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976 
on behalf of Mr .. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions 
of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records 
dealing with Dr~·-Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray __ • 
and any of his-alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr.•King•s· 
assassination. • 
I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in 
further communication with you once the search has been completed 
and any records found reviewed.for releasability under the Act. • 
As you may know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Information 
requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back­
logs. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated 
by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject 
to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee. It would seem 
more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request 
and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could 
be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we 
w_ill_ assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis. 
For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule. 
If the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you 
with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance 
of processing. 
Sincerely, 
/s/GFW

Information and Privacy Coordinator
