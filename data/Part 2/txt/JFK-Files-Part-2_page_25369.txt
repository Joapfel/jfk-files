Roselli bought twin star rubies, had •

Cohn, who considered it a good luck 
charm until his death. Once, when Chi­
cago mobster Willie Bioff moved to 
Hollywood and began making life mi­
serable for movie studios by shaking . 
down executives in return for labor 
peace, Roselli stepped in and saved 
Cohn from a lengthy strike. 
When Cohnl refused to pay tribute to 
Bioff and his union, Bioff tried to halt 
production at . Columbia bY, calling a . 
sudden strike'. Desperate, Cohn called 
Roselli who marched into Bioff's office 
and• confronted the hoodlum who sat 
•. behind his desk wearing a hat and 
coat, chom ·" • on a cigar, a gun rest-
ing on th . . in front of him. 
"Listen, Willie, I don't know what 
you're trying io prove but it isn't going

spite thing and you're not going to get

Robert Maheu( • the ex-FBI agent who 
parlayed a ~ashington private eye 
business into a stormy career as How­
ard Hughes' i,nan in L~s Vegas, ap• 
proached Roselli on behalf of the CIA 
in 1000. . ;I . 
(Another per:son Roselli met in that 
era who would later surface to talk of 
Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken­
nedy was a young party girl named Ju­
dith Campbell.): 
Maheu and Roselli would later tell 
. Frank Cqurch'.s Senate Intelligence 
Committee theldetails of their plots to 
kill Castro. Matieu told investigators he 
had known Roselli since the late 1950s 
and, while he didn't know of his un­
derworld connections, "it was cer- • 
tainly evident to ~e that (Roselli) was 
able to accomplish things in Las Vegas 
when nobody else seemed to get' the 
same kind of attention."· • 
Over dinner at the Brown Derby in 
Beverly Hills 1~ years ago, Maheu ex­
plained to Roselli that his government 
needed his services. Roselli, who was 
born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not 
patriotic. (Sam! Giancana once said, 
"Just wave a fl~g. and Johnny'll follow 
you to any canal.''JMaheu recalled that .1 .
