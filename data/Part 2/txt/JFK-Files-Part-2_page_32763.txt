thrust reversers to the aircraft design, but we have the flexibility to under-
take this development on an exploratory basis concurrent with the overall 
program, and terminable at will if costs should exceed anticipated benefits. 
The second area in which Boeing's approach seemed likely to produce 
more complicated development problems was its proposed power 1>lant-i11st~1,­
lation with top-mounted inlets. The Fourth Evaluation Report commented that 
Boeing's location of the inlets on top of the fuselage, in combinaUon with the 
Boeing subsonic diffuser design, results in significant distortion of the air 
flow at the engine face under most conditions, and prohibitive distortion during 
I 
high angle of attack operation. The Report noted that the effect of this 
distortion on engine operation is virtually impossible to predict accurately, 
and it can only be determined by actual testing of the engine in flight under 
the distortion conditions delivered by the induction system. 
In contrast, General Dynamics chose a conventional "straight thr~ugh" 
installation and inlet design which the Evaluation Group considered to be a 
good selection for the TFX aircraft -- one which should give the best 
trade-off in terms of performance, complexity and operational problems. 
The top-mounted inlet does minimize the problem of foreign object 
damage during ground operations, but there is no reason .to believe that 
the more conventional General Dynamics solution for this problem will not 
be effective, and it avoids all of the other uncertainties of the Boeing approach.
