Memo • to: C/HRG 
Subject: Mangold Litigation 
,~ 
Today I alerted OGC ,(Theresa Wilcox/. ) that 
the JFK collections contains a significant number of 
documents on Nosenko (5-6000 pages) which may impact on the-·­
Mangold litigation. As I understand it, the Mangold 
Litigation is over the Angelton files and is-several yearJ3 
old. According to JFK reviewers at the FBI, documents on 
Nosenko's d 7fection and treatment are part of case. I 
talked with·Theresa Wilcox.who is the para-legal hangl.ing 
the litigation, however, she was not familiar_ with tne ,,, _ 
document~ involved. She will consult with~4dlp;; the laWyer 
on the case, and get back to me. - -
I consider the ball in OGC's court. I propose that we 
continue to review the Nosenko files. If there are Mangold 
or other consideration to address, we can do so after the 
HRG review is .complete.
