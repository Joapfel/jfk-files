forget which one of the guys said that. But I said, "Yeah, he was an MD." 
His job was tb help us in operations from a medical point of view. He wasn't 
a Ph.D, he was a medical doctor. "Oh really." You know, they just had signs 
of and visions of Buchenwald and Auschwitz and God knows what else. But yeah, 
I took the case officer to see the doctor because I knew the doctor pretty 
well. A lot of activity. A lot of assassination activity. He needed medical 
support of all kinds. You'd be surprised how much you need .medical support in 
operations. And it was the doctor who came up with idea of the Black 
Leaf-40. I don't think the Church Committee should have published that. As 
it was I don't know whether it's still available but it was a publicly 
available poison that you could buy in any drug store. And to tell the whole 
world how to use it to kill somebody I thought was crazy. Totally unnecessary 
to get their point ac~oss. They did not have to revea) that. I thought that 
was ill advised on their part. But yeah, I took the case officer there and 
the doctor who spent, I think he was up all night making that damn acid, which 
LASH didn't take anyway tci begin with. He thought it was crazy. It may have 
. been. But you know, the assassination didn't surprise me. 
INTERVIEWER: Had there been any of that kind of talk before Kennedy, in other 
words, the Eisenhower Administration? 
MR:. HALPERN: Oh yeah, sure. If you look at the Church Committee report 
you'll see it's there. 
INTERVIEWER: Last time we were talking about, just as we were winding up, we 
were talking about assassinations and'LASH,.and so on, and wondering at that 
time, that time being discu-ssing. LASH, was there much of a sense of anxiety 
about this kind of approach?
