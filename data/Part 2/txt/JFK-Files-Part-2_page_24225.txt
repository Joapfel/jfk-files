trations. A security probe is a testing of the current effec­
tiveness of all or part of a security system within an Agency 
or Agency contractor's installation. A security penetration is 
an internal covert investigation and search targeted at possi-
ble subversive elements within a facility who may be engaged in 
foreign intelligence or acts of sabotage or who by lack of security 
discipline or gross malfeasance may be weakening the security 
structure of the project or facility. It is, in essence, counter­
intelligence against a domestic installation. Eastman Kodak, for 
example, was the target of a probe. An agent was sent under the 
natural* cover of a union construction man to Eastman to gain 
employment as a pipefitter. He succeeded in gaining access to 
the target, .and developed information on the installation and 
its personnel in surrounding areas of the union hall, bars, cafes, 
and in other appropriate places around the target area. Similar 
probes were conducted against Pratt and Whitney in West Palm Beach, 
Florida, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in Burbank, California, and 
other targets in New York, Nevada, and Arizona. 
These entities serve a useful function within the scheme of 
necessary security required by sensitive Agency operations. Their 
utility, however, as in the case of nearly all proprietaries is 
relative to policy and "flap" demands. As one Agency commentator 
phrased it. when Newsweek revealed the rela.tionship of L. Lee 
Bean and Paul Hellmuth of the Boston law firm of Hale and Dorr 
* He was in fact a legitimate tradesman.
