27 March 1963 
BOLIVIA 
I. ~bout 500 Bolivians traveled legally to Cuba 
in 1962, and 25 in the first two months of 1963. There 
have been no arrests of pro-Cuban agitators for sab­
otage, terrorist, guerrilla, or other subversive 
activities in Bolivia to date. 
2. We can identify by name 214 of the travelers 
to Cuba. The individuals who killed a number of anti­
Communists during a pro-Cuban demonstration on 26 
October 1962 were identified as having visited Cuba. 
Six of these agitators were indicted but released 
when government investigators placed the blame for 
the incident on anti-Communists. 
3. Otherwise there have been no known incidents 
which might be attributed to Cuban training. 
4. Zenon Barrientos Manani, a national deputy 
belonging to the Bolivian Communist Party (PCB), 
since his return from Cuba has been reported with­
out confirmation to be organizing guerrilla forces 
among Bolivian peasants. The same untested source 
said Barrientos was active in supplying weapons to 
Peruvian guerrillas and had aided Peruvian guerrilla 
leader Hugo Blanco during a reported Bolivian visit 
by Blanco. 
5. Other Bolivians in positions of influence 
who have been in Cuba long enough to receive train­
ing include: 
Daniel Saravia Quiroz, secretary-general of 
the Bolivian Labor Confederation (COB). (Saravia, 
however, is reported to have changed his beliefs 
since his travel to England.) 
Baldomero Castel, COB leader. 
Oscar Salas, mine leader. 
Oscar Sanjines, leader of the Cochabamba 
Labor Federation. 
Ofelia Altamirano de Sabrabi, factory wor­
kers' leader.
