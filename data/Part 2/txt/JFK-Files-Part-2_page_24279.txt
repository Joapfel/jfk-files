The budgetary presentation and review procedures only par­
tially focus upon proprietary profits. MUTUAL1 s profits are 
invisible in the Agency budget; they are taken into account and 
subject to scrutiny only within CIA; operationally, the DDO annual 
operational review has the most detailed grasp of MUTUAL at the 
Agency review levels. A stadard set of public enterprise fund 
schedules, as prescribed by 0MB Circular A-11, would be appropri­
ate for making MUTUAL visible in the Agency budget. Other conrrner­
cial proprietaries should show these schedules as well. The 
Agency has indicated that the Comptroller ~s working with DDO and 
DDA to develop a new style and content of budgetary presentation 
and review procedures for CIA proprietaries in future budgets. 
To what extent can these new procedures prevent abuses of 
proprietary profits? To what extent do they preclude the need 
for legislation in this area? What form of Congressional oversight 
is needed here-- at what point should Congress exert control? 
Improvement of visibility in the budget of proprietary resources 
and provision for review of the major proprietaries as a regular 
part of budget review by CIA, 0MB, and Congressional Committees 
would seem to preclude most of the dangers of abuse. On the other 
hand, there is one type of abuse for which additional Congressional 
scrutiny and safeguards may be needed: the possibility of a small­
scale, high-risk covert project directed by the President or DCI 
which is not covered by the regular appropriation but financed by 
proprietary profits. No foolproof preventives can be designed by 
law or regulation; nevertheless, the possibility of such abuse or 
avoidance of Congressional review can be minimized by requiring
