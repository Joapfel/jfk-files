WORKING PAPER 
Notes from meeting w/ AR.RB staff Sept. 11, 1995 
AR.RB Attendees: Marwell, Gunn, Mary+ one 
CIA Attendees : Barry, Ellie 
Issue: Inconsistency between Mexico City Chrono item 
#132 and ARRB document #31 
Gunn proposed that the Agency release the information in 
document 31 that was released by mistake in the Mexico City 
Chrono. Otherwise, the staff would have to take the 
document back to the AR.RB for reconsideration which they 
felt would undercut the credibility of the CIA and the 
( 
staff. The Board will not uphold a postponement in a 
specific document if that information is released by mistake 
in another copy of the same document. 
_Ellie's response - because the information deals with ~ex_~-=_ _ 
__ liaison,, she will have to take their proposal to a higher 
levei. ~[response needed by 16 September] 
They also requested a "new" highlighted version of the 
Mexico City Chrono which reflects all information released 
to NARA in the multiple copies of the Chrono and in the 
documents referenced in the Chrono. 
Issue: The three documents of concern. 
\ GilfSON--- ElIIe -re-vi-e-we-a--the -Gib8-6n- :CS-Sues-- the fact that he 
had denied in court his affiliation with the CIA, etc. I 
noted that since the document would not be included in the 
_deten:t1ination list would the Board be willing to reconsider. --
Marwell said that we could make an addition pitch to the 
Board to reconsider, but he did not think it would have any 
effect on their decision. 
PROENZA - Ellie explained that out goal here was to protect 
the "asset" not the method and that the deletions could be 
reduced to those words that could result. in the 
identification of the agent. 
Marwell said that the Board may reconsider based on the need 
to protect a source. 
Mary ask who was the asset? Was it LIRING? 
Ellie said she did not know (it could have been some "AM" 
source.
