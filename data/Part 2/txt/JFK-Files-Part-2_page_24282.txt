reason in law, although there may well not be another era or 
set of occasions when CIA will find proprietary expansion to 
be operationally desirable. The Congress should be a partner 
in the process of reviewing such expansion, if it should occur, 
by providing for changes in the charter process. Another approach 
is the setting of substantive guidelines for proprietary operation. 
This approach is typified by the post-Katzenbach guidelines that 
prohibit CIA operation of tax-exempt foundations. 
Lawrence R. Houston, the former General Counsel of the Agency, 
was intimately involved with all of the proprietaries for his 
entire tenure with CIA. Consequently, his views have been invalu­
able to the Committee in reviewing and evaluating the history 
and the role of these mechanisms. In the course of a far-ranging 
interview with the Committee Houston concluded that proprietaries 
"should be the last resort for use to backstop Agency activities. 11 
He grounded this opinion on the fact that: 
they are cumbersome. To be properly run they take 
many, many man-hours of many, many different parts of 
the Agency, so they are expensive in man-hours. There 
are built-in difficulties in running what appears to be 
a normal business for operational purposes. There's 
really a built~indichotomy there that leads to a contin­
ual conflict with policies. And due to the number of 
people involved, there is a security problem on the 
old grounds that security doesn't go by the mathematical 
increase in the number of people. It.goes geometrically 
as to the number of people_, the security risk. 
This assessment seems correct based on all the evidence. 
The current Director of Central Intelligence has insisted on 
the streamlining of such operations_, and is keenly aware of the 
potential for abuse. (See appendix F). It is, for example,
