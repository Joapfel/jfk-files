INl'ERVIEW AND MEETill1 SUMMARY 
an alien, a form was submitted by ·FB_I~_, "~d~-1:;Ren 
got FBI data on the alien and FBI had notice so 
it could protect any operation. 
Regarding possible spies in foreign intelligence 
agencies, if the FBI discovers any it evaluates 
the potential for a double agent or the possibility 
of recruitment. FBI usually goes to the agency and 
tells them the. situation to prevent access to 
sensitive information. Also, the agency can give 
FBI assistance. The CIA Office of Security is 
"paranoid" on this subject. It is very concerned 
if there is a report on a CIA employee associating 
with bloc nationals. Before telling the FBI, it 
would do as much as it could on its own so there 
would be something to discuss. In one case the 
CIA was absolutely convinced an employee was a spy, 
predicated on its analysts' conclusions from a 
photograph. FBI refused to move on the basis of 
this alone. There were other cases where FBI and 
CIA had different evaluations of evidence. It 
depended on what CIA gave FBI. CIA was "jumpier" 
than FBI. 
If CIA did any electronic surveillance of its own 
employees, it never checked with FBI. The same was 
true for physical surveillance of its own employees. 
If the FBI had known, it would have raised hell, 
but it never came to FBI attention and there was 
no policy discussion of the subject. If the CIA 
wanted to do something with its own assets with 
Attorney General or White House approval, it would 
not check with FBI. But it would coordinate with 
FBI if it saw a risk that FBI would discover. 
Papich recalls no CIA surveillance of newsmen. 
Papich adds his view that every newsman assigned 
to Moscow is useful to the KGB. A newman who may 
have been recruited by KGB in Moscow may become a 
target in the U. S. 
Papich did not recall any problem of CIA activity 
"tainting" a criminal case. CIA would make sources 
available for criminal prosecutions.
