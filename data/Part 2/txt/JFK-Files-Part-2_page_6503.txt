The ten-or oam,pa:lgn oould be pointed at OUban refugees aeek:lnS 
haven· 1D the United states.· we oould sink a boatload ot CUbanB 
81U'OUte to li'lorida (real or a1mulated). We oould foster attempts 
on Uvea ot Cuban re.f'ugees in the United States even to.the 
extent ot wound1ng 1n instanoes to be widely pubUoized. 
Exploding a few plast1o bombs in oaref'Ully ohosen spots; the 
anrest ot Cuban agents and the re:Lease of prepared doouments

s11111Jlated aga1Dst a ne1ghbor111g Oaibbean nation (in the vein 
of the- 14th ot June 1nvaaion of the Domin1oan Republio). We 
know that Castro is baolc1ng subvel"sive ettorts olandestinely 
aga1nst Ba1t1, Dom1nioan Repub11o, Gua:temala, and Hioaragua at

additional ones oontrived ~or upos\11'8. For example, advantage 
oan be taken pt the senaitiv1ty ot the Dom1nioan A1r Foroe to 
intrusions w1th1n their national air spaoe. "CUban" B-26 or

be produced from US resources in about three months.
