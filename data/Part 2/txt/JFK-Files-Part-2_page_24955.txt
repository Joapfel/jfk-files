Douglas Dillon Interview 
August 28, 1975 
I spoke today by phone with Douglas Dillon, who was on vacation 
in Maine, concerriing a paragraph in an affidavit he supplied to the 
Rockefeller Commission on May 21, 1975. The paragraph records Dillon's-
recollection that 
"On one occasion in late July or early August of 1960, shortly 
after Patrice_ Lumumba' s visit to Wc~shington, I attended a meet­
ing in the Pentagon at which the overall Congo problem was dis­
cussed. During the discussion, which covered a grec1,t variety of 
matters, my recollection is that a question recarclin~ the possi­
bilitj of an assassination attempt against L1m1wnba was briefJ.y 
raised. The CIA repre~entative indicated that the Agency did 
not undertake this sort of operation. 'rhis ended consideration 
of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any 
discussion of assassination attempts against anyone." 
I explored the subject of this meeting generally with Mr. Dillon on the 
phone and set an appointment for him to review docwnents and testify on 
Tuesday, September 2, at 3:00 p.m. in Room G 308. 
On the phone Dillon gave the following background information 
on the meeting at the Pentagon: 
1. This was not a small meeting; eight or ten people attended. 
He did not think it was a meeting of a small body. He sairl it was 
not a Special Group meeting or NSC meeting. But he was .clear that
