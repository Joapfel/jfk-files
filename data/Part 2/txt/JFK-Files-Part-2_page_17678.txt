Memorandum to Mr. Adams 
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been 
reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that 
Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last 
meeting of the Committee, a,lthough he was unable to attend. The 
Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia 
the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's 
representative. 
I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaldng 
the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the 
Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring 
into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney 
General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that 
the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was 
his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be 
willing to undertake that responsibility. 
It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was 
interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed 
a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as 
possible with the Deputy Attorney General. 
RECOMMENDATION:: 
For information.
