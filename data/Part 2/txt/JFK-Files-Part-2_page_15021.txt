. H. R. 421, INTERSTATE TRAVEL TO INCITE RIO : • · • • . 
,',;,'. /,> 
This bill was passed by the House on 7-19- 67. It provides for 
Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite 
a riot. Its practical and legal usefulness has b8e11 .. qnesti0ned by a numb~:i: of 
f: people, including many-Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining 
..... evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the 
, .. Bill Gould be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it 
more practical. These sources concede the Bill ,vill pass the Senate without 
.: difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it 
: politically unwise to vote against it .. We took no stand on the Bill with the 
Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes 
• and hate group leaders to areas where strtle developed. The Bill, if passed, 
could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of 
course, on the policy established by the Department. 
H. ·R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRThiINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE 
ACT OF 1967: 
This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe 
Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by 
Republican- sponsored amendments made. when the House passed the bill· on • 
8-8-67. One of these a1nendments by Congressman Roberf McClory (R. -Ill.) 
which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to 
engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive 
police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local 
· ··: and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on 
, t-. 
;';,:; the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and

stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill
