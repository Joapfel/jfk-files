: . . . . • 
- Sheridan and Townley both made up their' minds, 
·along with most of the news media and the Justice 
De:iartment, that_ Gax:rison had to _be stopped at all 
costs. They decided to really go .to work· on Perry 
nuss6, since his testimony was all important.

fice, and met him at.other places. They badgered 
hicr ;:ind attempted to bribe. him. They pressured and 
threatened him. They used every trick in the book 
to try to get him to. change his testimony. 
They threatened him with being discredited, made 
to seea insane, and perhaps fired from his job. They 
011cred him a ~honce to work closely, for.high re-

after the assassination and asked hi~ to represent,.· 
Lee Harvey Oswald. Andrews told so many different :

Frank. McGee asked Andre1~s on the program about 
Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews 
said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar 
Ol'lner in New Orleans. Sheridan's coup quickly blew 
up in his face when Davis denied the whole thing. 
lo/hen the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged 
as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as· 
Clay Bertrand. • •
