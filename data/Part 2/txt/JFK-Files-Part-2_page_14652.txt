The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will 
provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (·6,638 agents and 9,142 
clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year 
employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) ,when compared to 1967. 
Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks) 
are for assignment to the field to assist ·in the handling of a heavy 
volume of civil rights werk. (This is the second increment of a 
total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and 
• equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights 
work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents 
a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for 
assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utiiized to handle the 
.• tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received. 
. . The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is· an increase of 
$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current 
fiscal year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated 
and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about 
by costs growing out of new legislation increasing.our payroll 
costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation·increasing the costs we 
must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service 
($1,610,000). 
') 
Most careful consideration was given to our request for 
additional.personnel in 1968. We are absorbing much work ·and will. 
endeavor to make further absorptions .. When confronted with a 
one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in 
name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we 
have no alternative but to ask·.for additional manpower if we are to 
meet our responsibilities in these areas. 
The Bureau's growing.work .is:not limited to these particular 
areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new 
all-time peak Q.Uring the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi­
cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal 
security of t~e country has continued to increaseo We ~re going to 
do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our 
existing staff. In addition, new items.of legislation continue to be 
passed adding to our worko
