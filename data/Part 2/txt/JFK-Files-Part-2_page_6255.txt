CIA JFK Collections 
1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release) 
1) JFK hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release) 
2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review) 
The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff 
either requested or had access to. A great deal of the 
material is duplicative of that found in the 63 hard copy 
boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are 
also files not related to the assassination story and files 
not reviewed by the HSCA. 
HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page) 
with the exception of the Oswald 201 file. The Microfilm 
collection has been divided into to two parts: 
1) documents reviewed for release and being prepare 
for NARA (records related to the assassination, the 
investigations, or the various conspiracy theories), 
2) documents reviewed but being held pending 
discussion with the board (see attachment).
