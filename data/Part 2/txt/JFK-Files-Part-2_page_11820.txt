source file) is taken to develop them as sources or inforrr~nts.] 
c. Indi;riduals to whom permanent symbols assigned are not to be advised 
of such symbols. 
cl. Cover name should be used by informant in signing his s.tatenien·l;s ·and 
in communications between informant and· field o£fice. Advise Bureau 
of cover name. 
e. Prefix of symbol number consists of appropriate field office teletype 
abbreviation. Suffix of symbol number will consist of letter 11s11 for 
security informant; letters "PSI" for potential security informant; 
letters "CS 11 for confidential source.

be changed to appropriate letter or letters indicating this change 
(NY 000-S to NY 000-C or to NY[OOO-E).) 
[g. [.A.n asterisk should not be used to designate certain highly sensitive 
informants or investigative techniques. Do not include asterisk 
in reporting information from such sources.] 
2. Communications - use of symbols

tions true name of informant should not be set forth; use symbol 
number. 
b. In all communications after initial letter, Bureau and field office 
file numbers for informant must be set forth. 
c. In communications between offices, follow same procedure. 
d. Informants and sources entering another division 
(1) Active informants and sources entering another division on 
temporary basis should be referred to in initial[secure teletype) 
to interested office by true name and symbol number if necessary 
for other division to know identity. [Sµch a teletype should 
not be routed to a Resident Agency.) Office receiving such 
[teletype ]should make appropriate index cards for "Infornants 
and Sources in Other Divisions II index. Subsequent letters 
between interested offices may then identify individual by symbol 
m.u~ber only. • 
{2) Individuals who lea-ve division where they have been furnishing 
inforr.~tion and do not plan to return should be immediately 
discontinued, their symbol number, if any, should be cancelled~

his identity must still be protected. 
e. In communications concerning potential security informant when a 
symbol number is not[used,]name of potential security infor~ant 
and abbreviation "PSI" shall be used; e.g., "John Doe~ PSI." 
f. (Captions of co~.munications concerning informants and sources should 
contain a precise character designation to identify the organization 
with which they a.re most closely associated or on which they a.re 
most capable of furnishing information (i.e.,,Security ~~tter - . 
Students for a Democratic Society or SM - SDS, Security t~tter -
Young Socialis·l; Allio.nee or SM - YS.A, Security ttJ,t_ter - Comr.mnist 
INDEXING 
or SM - C, etc.).] In espionage and foreign nationality matters, 
caption of communication should also show character and country 
designation (i.e., IS - R for Russia or IS - PO for Poland, etc.). 
This facilitates routing at Bureau.

be indexed in general office indices as any other name. Index cards should 
shovt file number of informant, but such terms as "Informant" or "Po.tential
