MEf(ORANDmt FOR THE Aft91UmY GENERAL 
. . 
With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and 
the installation ot mlcropb.Ones, you will i-ecall tbat I adv1secl you 
that back under the '1t'lndn1stftt1C)D. ot Attorney General Clark I 
recommended that all Ooverment agencies rer.tialn .trom.w1:retapp1ng unless there was speclf'1c approval 1n each 1Dstance by the Attorney 
-Ceneral ·who .. is the ·chief law otfice1' ot the (k)vezmJ.ent. I repeated 
the see recommendation to each successive Attorney General f'olloving the adm1Jdstrat1cm of Attorney General Clark. 
I bave always telt that tbel'e was._a ver'tJ lax control' 1n the 
handling o~ wil'etapp1ng by Gove:rment agencies·. I am the only head 
ot- a Government 1nvestigat1ve agenCT. who does not have the authority 
to authorize a wiretap, but UJlder the system vhich :C personally set 
up. Thererore, reques;s to:r wiretaps are sent by me to the Attor-n91" 
Gjm.eral tor his approval or dlS&pJ)l'Oval. I kbow that no aueh s:rstem. 
18 i9'ollowed ;1.11 other branches ot the GovffDIJ18llt and, 1n tact 1n many 
instances ·subordinates QU!te .tar down the- Ube ot autbority tap tele ... 
phones without the specific approval ot the head of the agency and 
certalnly vithout spec1t1c app:roval ot the cabinet officer 1D charge 
ot the department. • 
I still reel CIU1te .strongll" that ·no Ooverment agency Dllould tap a telephone unless ft is specifically a~ved in each instance by­
the Attorney -General. fh1a would certa1D17 c!.roumscribe promiscuous v1retapp1Jl8 on the PQ't ot Government agencies and would centralize 
in one place, the Att01"ll8Y General• s- o:tt1ee, a record of any _phone taps 
which have beeti placed ·1,y a aovumnient agency. 
As ,ou are aware, in the case ot th$ FBI wa do not request 
phone -taps aeer,t in caaes 1nvo1v1ng k1dnaPina and espionage. fllia 
has been predlcatecl. :u~ my theoJ'Y' that. men the lite ot an 1nd1'V1dual 
·or the lite ot the Batton ls 1n pell a phone tap is 3Ustitied tor 
intelligence purposes as 8D1' 1Dtomat1on obtained over a phone tap cannot be used 1n the trial or a ~1m1nal case.
