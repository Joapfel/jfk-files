OVER-ALL VALUE 
For the most _part, this _program consists of a coordination 
of accepted investigative and intelligence _procedures for the 
_purpose of _pro.per direction, redirection when indicated, and 
administrative controls. On a continuing basis it _produces infor­
mation of value to State Department in its formulation of foreign 
policy and handling of international relations and to the Bureau in 
its investigative and intelligence re~ponsibilities. Frequently, 
the data are most useful· for budgetary purposes. • 
CONTEMPLATED ACTION 
. From current evaluation and analyses, no changes are 
indicated at this time. We will closely follow all phases of our 
intelligence coverage to assure that changes and redirection are 
instituted as the need arises.
