Higgins notes that Kennedy dispatched Krulik and Mendenhall to Viet Nam to make a tour of 
the country to determine the effect of the Buddhist crisis on the war against the Viet 
Cong. Returning to Washington, Krulik and Mendenhall each gave a different report on the 
effect. Higgins notes that Kennedy asked wryly, "Have you two fellows been in the same
