Ne,v indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire, 
support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt . 
or harass the Dcnocratic National Convention in ~fiarai, 10-13 
July 1972, arc limited to a reiteration by a member of the 
Secretariat of the Stockholm Co~fcrencc on Vietnam of a 
statement previously issued by the World Assembly for Peac~ 
and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina. The Assembly's 
• pronouncement generally endorsed the concep~ of international 
supp6rt to a campaign of anti-Vietnam War activities in the 
United States lending up to the De::1o·cra tic and Republican 
Conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis­
ruptive actions at the conventions themselves .

in private, the intern3tional anti-Vietnam War activitie~ • 
conducted on 1, 15, and 22 April. The Stockholra Confcrcrrcc 
member stated that these actions 1,-:cre part of an intern::ition~d 
-campaign in support of domestic American antiwar efforts 
during the period 1 April to 15 :,iay 1972, and "i\·ill culr:1in.1te 
?,t the election conventions in July and August." . 
. The World As·scmbly for Peace and Independence of the 
P~oples of Indochina, of which the Stockholr:1 Conference was 
a-~ajor organizer, had earlier enunctatcd a similar stateracnt 
in an appendix to the final draft resolution of the Asse □bly's 
··"Action Commission." The appendix called for international 
support to six weeks of domestic ant ii..-ar actions and der.lOn­
strations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with 
···the st3.teracnt: 
11
This car.1paign will lead up to the Democratic 
Party Convention at Miami on J~ly 9, 1972, and the Republican 
Party Convention in San D.ie~o on August 21, 1972."
