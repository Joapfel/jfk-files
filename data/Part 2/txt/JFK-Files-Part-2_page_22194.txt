CCUHITENCE: 
With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to Sr.A dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no infonnation on 
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerninr, a report for the CIA which he 
used as a basis for memorandum <lated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to 
___________ a_t_e~lephonic- conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and~Jii'('d°hfer-J 
which is referred specifically in paragrap112-on-pa·ges-1-and-8-of-my-reference-mcmoranclu. ________ _ 
I have discussed this matter in detail wi th@.iev~iJand clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that <late took place as reflected in my reference memorandum. 
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief 
discussion of the COl3RAt~~l:AJif:(6tfriil teams and Lansdale did not ask, according toQ@HrJ~i@t?.,WiU 
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
--s-buncE:would logically have lecl to the discussions at the timpsT/\FF: 
of the Matahambre operation." I
