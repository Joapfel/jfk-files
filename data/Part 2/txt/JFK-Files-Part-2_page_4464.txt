VII~ AGENT sum.IA.RIES 
The scope and nature of the Agency's Foreign Intelli­
gence operations is most clearly seen in the character, personal 
ambition an4 caprice of the human material present, namely the 
a.gents involved. The following slcetches of the individual agents· 
engaged in these operations have been compiled in recognition of 
the vital ingredient which these human beings bring to an appre·c1a­
tion of the Ar,-ency'a FI operations. It will be noted that a 
·majority of the agents work, or have been worked, out ~f Miami, 
the city which hns been the center of anti-Castro Cubans, the 
major pool of potential agents, since 1959. 
Other geo~raphical areas are represented in mathematical 
sequence, in fact according to the number of Cuban exiles in 
residence at a given place. This same mathematical order applies 
with reference to tho jobs these agents hold. Thus, if a Cuban 
has a function, the performance of which is important in sustain-
. ing the island, hence important to the Cuban Regime,· the Agency 
has· sought the servi~es of this mn.n as its agent. 21.\ For this reason, 
several agents arc in the employ of the ~irline~Jand of (merchant~-~ 
marine shippin~businesses. So too, with diplomacy. Every foreign 
diplomat now a~redi ted to . the Regime in Havana has been examined· 
by the Agency as,· a prospective agent. Forty percent of these diplo­
mats were approached. Of this number about one half took our bait 
-and have accepted assignments which range from marginal involvement 
in "intelligence" (e.g., using their diplomatic immunity to carry 
our materials), ~o active participation in our operations. 
Finally, one type of Cuban who played an influential, 
though limited, role during the past six months was the defector 
(who is not mentioned elsewhere in t~is paper). The defector is 
the official who for one reason.or another cannot remain in or be 
persuaded to·reinain in pln.ce and report ·on hls job.· OWing to the 
nature of this particular person, it is difficult to draw hard 
lines between those who genuinely reject thei~ Government and those 
who me~ely quit in self-interest, but du.ri~g the past Gix months, 
the Agency tapped in on t_he defections of at-o\lt • ten Cubans of 
consequence, pr~fiting from their inf~rmation in all cases and 
from their psychological.exploitation when circumstance would permit •.
