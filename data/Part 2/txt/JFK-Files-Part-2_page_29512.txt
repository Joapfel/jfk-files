to State, FBI and ~avy, we did not, and I 
wo~ld n~t normall~ even today, ~rovide 
those investigativ~ agencies with the 
physical descripti,>n of Lee Henry Oswald

gence, not with -Sttte ·Department intelli­
gence which ·gave tie stuff out about the

to me at the time ind this i~ the way those 
things were writte~ in those times, to say

possibly be identifiable and qualified

provide to the oth~r government ~gencies
