a. Peiping last week con­
tracted for some 300,000 tons of 
wheat (cost about $20,000,000) from 
Argentina. 
b. This adds to the 1,000,000 . , 
tons just contracted for with ,Aus- ' 
- tralia, bU:t, is still far below. 
the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have , 
normally imported in recent years. 1 .

c. A large sale, apparently 
involving some $56,000,000 worth 
of meat, is apparently also being 
arranged. This is interesting, 
not only for the sizeable foreign 
exchange outlay, but also for the 
concern it shows for improving the 
diet of the mainland's urban pop­
ulation. 
d. The same caloric value 
could be obtained from grains at 
a fraction of this cost.
