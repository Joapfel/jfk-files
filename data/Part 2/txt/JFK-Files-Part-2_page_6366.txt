Mr. David Marwell 
Dear David, 
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the 
Assassination Records Review Board's proposed• interpretive 
regulations as published in the Federal Register, February 
8, 1995. We recognize the value of providing guidance for 
those who are responsible for implementing· the Assassination 
Records Collection Act. 
Our general view is that the regulat-ions are 
comprehensive-in identifying the range of records that would 
potentially be relevant to the JFK assassination or the 
scope of the investigations into the assassination. 
In a few sections of the regulations the wording seems 
somewhat overly broad or the meaning is not clear. Attached 
for the Board's consideration are comments on these 
sections. In some.parts of the text we suggest possible 
changes in wording for purposes of clarification. 
We would be pleased to discuss these comments at the 
Board's convenience. It is our intention to continue 
cooperating fully with the Board and to make every effort to 
release assassination records held by the Agency.
