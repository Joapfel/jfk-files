historical understanding of the assassination by providing some background on 
CIA records. • 
CIA should now review the DO and DS&:T organizational material and 
re-examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been 
cleared by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or release with minor 
redactions.' The ARRB staff will consult with CIA to determine whether these 
records should be designated "assassination records';. or whether they could be 
made available publicly in a manner similar to the material from the 1996 Boston 
trip. HRG would like to discuss this issue before the materials are formally put 
before the Review Board. 
CIA-2 through CIA-5. 
These requests have been satisfied and no further action is needed by CIA.
