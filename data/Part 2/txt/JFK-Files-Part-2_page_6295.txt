THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS 
In identifying relevant records, we have followed the 
definitions in- the 1992 Act and the related rules which were 
p~:sished in the Federal Register. 
The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two 
major groups of fil~s. One group consists of the documents in 
the Lee Harv_ey Oswald f ile--sometimes ref erred to as the "Oswald 
201 filen·. These consist mainly of documents collected after the 
assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation. 
There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald 
file. All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the 
National Archives. 
-· The second group is comprised of the "sequestered 
collection•. These are the records that were made available to 
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the 
Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion 
of the Committee's investigation. 
_ Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts from 
minutes of the._ Director's morning meetings, and some working 
files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.
