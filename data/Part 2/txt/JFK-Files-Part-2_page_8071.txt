B. A subsequent check with the Japanese National 
Police Agency confirmed the biographic data supplied 
by the National Maritime Union official. A ward check 
indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan 
from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963. 
Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United 
States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about 
15 April 1968. His wife's address in the United States 
is listed as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria, 
California, 93013. 
c. A photograph of Richards obtained from the 
Japanese police was shown to the National Maritime 
Union official and identified by him as the individual 
in.subparagraph IA above who had applied for a seaman's 
berth. The photograph of Richards bears no apparent 
resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin 
James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation.

Attache of the United States Embassy in Tokyo.
