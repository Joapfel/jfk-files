at Seat of Government at nominal expenses~ Under second phase we are 
presently ·operating 46 technical surveillances covering establishments of 
25 non-Soviet-bloc countries at total estimated monthly cost of $47,259.73. 
These countries ar~ Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, British Guiana, 
Chile,· China, Colomqia, Cuba, Cyprus, _Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, 
Greece, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Syria, Turkey, 
United Arab Republic, Venezuela; and Yugoslavia. For details of technical 
sur'veillance coverage see Attachment _A. • 
Under.third phase of program we currently have 42 actual and 58 
potential live sources at establishments of 47 non-Soviet-bloc countries 
approved by State Department-· as "target" countries. For details see 
Attachment B. Costs of this phase arise chiefly from field investigations 
of potential sources and agents' time in handllng active sources. These 
costs are fully justified based on value of data developed. •
