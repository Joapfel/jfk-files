Mexican Government would likely be subject to criticism by 
groups and individuals opposed on nationalism and 
sovereignty grounds to such close cooperation with the U.S. ~•\ 
Government and, even more so, with the CIA. The continued 
success of CIA cooperation with the Mexicans, whether it be o..v..~ J\JA, ~ 
with ~h@ PrQ~~aeB&~ the intelligence service, or oe¾t@ pal±ce,· \ 
depends on the fact that those relationships are, and ~l~'Ar. 
continue to be, secret. \ 
10. (S) CIA requests that the Board continue to 
withhold this phrase from release and substitute in "other 
sources" or.something similar to this. Omitting the fact 
that the airport information was obtained from Mexican 
counterparts would probably leave the impression that the 
information was obtained unilaterally. Although this still 
presents some risk to national security, it does achieve 
some level of protection to the Station's equities with 
liaison. 
III. Phillip Agee 
(S) "That is, the variety and number of telephone 
taps, surveillance teams, photo operations and other 
technical operations is exposed by Agee in his book. That 
exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world by a lot ... " 
(Scelso, pg. 141) 
11. (S) CIA objects to the release of the highlighted 
phrase because, for reasons described in Section 1, it 
amounts to official CIA confirmation of the existence of a 
teltap operation conducted jointly with the Mexicans and 
with close collaboration with the President of Mexico. As 
thls Board is well aware, CIA has consistently requested, 
the protection of liaison involvement in this teltap 
operation. As the Board has agreed with CIA's position on 
this matter, the only issue is whether this statement 
reveals what we have agreed meets the criteria for continued 
protection under the JFK Act. 
12. (S) For the Board's convenience, several relevant 
pages from Agee's book (Inside the Company: CIA Diary) are 
attached. These pages explain in great detail the teltap 
operation and the fact that i,t was conducted jointly between 
the CIA and the Mexicans. Although such disclosures by 
former employees are disturbing, they do not amount to 
official confirmation of the underlying information. 
Standing by itself, Agee's book can be dismissed by the 
Agency as speculation, and do not comppomise CIA's ability 
to keep the information classified. Scelso's testimony, 
however, amounts to official confirmation of Agee's book,
