Sound counterintelligence coverage requires sources to 
produce not only investigative data but also intelligence data of 
value to us and other agencies in guiding policy and making 
decisions. Bureau is expected to produce intelligence data and 
we can anticipate criticism as well as operational moves by other 
agencies to fill vacuum if our operations do not produce necessary 
_ data. Sournl source programs are based on long-range planning and 
require forw:ird thinking to get results. Scrambling for sources 
in reaction to problems is too late and ineffective. 
• Vital part of·our coverage of friendly nations is 
continuing development of informants and sour9es (persons) in diplo­
matic establishments in U.So This is recognized intelligence technique 
and is aimed at all countries where need for data exists with emphasis 
on "trouble spot" countries that tend to drift toux.zrd, or are targets 
of, Soviet Bloc and those countries involved in situations with inter­
national ramifications. This program has paid off in sound benefits 
and existing sources represent effective outposts for gathering data 
in event of emergency as well as for investigative purposes.

Program is generally aimed at American employees and ha.s ~­
been tightly controlled as evidenced by lack of repercussions from 
approaches • . JYe first obtain State Department clearance to investigate 
prospect without revealing purpose. Ife then conduct extensive 
background investigation of prospect. If this reveals potential is_ 
good and risk element negligible, we secure State clearance for inter-
