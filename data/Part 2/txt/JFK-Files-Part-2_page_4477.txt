D. Paramilitary, Commando, and Guerrilla Type Operations: 
Given the assumptions in Paragraph I above, no wide scale 
program of such activity should be undertaken. However, we 
propose to maintain in being our present facilities and 
the capability of undertaking such operations in order to 
fully exploit any substantial change in internal Cuban con­
ditions or any substantial revolt or uprising which might occur. 
E. Economic.Warfare: It is proposed to continue and 
intensify the program already undertaken to deny through 
clandestine and covert means critical materials to the Cuban 
economy. This con.sists primarily of denial operations, possibly 
some preclusive buying and inducing friendly U.S. and allied 
firms and governments to prevent the shipments of strategic 
materials to Cuba. 
F. Counterintelligence: The current counterintelligence 
and counterespionage program against the Cuban G-2 and 
related services will be continued and as possible intensified. 
This program has developed substantially and it should be 
possible within the coming months to increase its effectiveness 
considerably in countering not only Cuban but Bloc intelli­
gence operations mounted against United States interests 
from Cuba. 
G. Political Action, Propaganda, Psychological Warfare: 
In this field the following tasks will be continued and where 
appropriate intensified: 
1. Assist and support State in any feasible action.
