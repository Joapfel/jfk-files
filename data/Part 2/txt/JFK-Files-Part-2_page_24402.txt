several sensitive covert operations in which "he didn't want to 
have an Agericy person or a government person get caught"* (O'Connell, 
p. 158). Maheu was initially paid a monthly retainer by the CIA 
of $500, which was terminated after his practice became more_ 
lucrative ( 0 'Connell, pp. 13-14; I. G. , p. 15). 0 1 Connell had 
served as Maheu's case officer since the Agency first began using 
Maheu 1 s services, and by 1960 thej had becom~ close personal

CIA. He testified that he contracted for a listening device to be 
placed on Onassis' room in Ne-w York after first consulting with the .A 
Agency, and that he provided the impetus for the ~ermination of~he Jk J 
contract by publicizing its terms in a newspaper in Rome that he -e 
said he purchased with CIA funds. (Maheu, 7/30/75, pp. 14~25.) . 
O'Connell testified that Maheu, at the CIA's request had also 
previously arranged for the production of a film in Hollywood 
depicting a foreign leader with a woman in the Soviet Union. The 
CIA planned to circulate the film, representing it to have been pro­
duced, but not released (O'Connell, pp. 159, 162-163). Maheu testi­
fied that he had located an actor resembling the leader and-had 
arranged for the production of the film (Maheu, 7 /30/75, pp. 39-42).
