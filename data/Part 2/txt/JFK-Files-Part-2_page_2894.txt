Generally, A/1 .was an interested pupil and it is believed that he 
will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner. He 
is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add 
to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/i-l correspondence and 
in the secure storage of his s/,1 materials when not in use. It is 
also knmm that A/1 practiced his S/w techniques in his hotel room 
after leaving the 22 August meeting. This is known becaUBe he had 
an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August. 
7. It should also be noted that the TSD technician who 
developed A/l's practice letters recommends that for best results, 
_ all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion 
in the developer.
