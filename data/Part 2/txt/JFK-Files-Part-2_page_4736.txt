wasn't ~itting there under oath, in the first place. And when I got under 
qath, yeah I told them the truth. They didn't like to hear it. I got into a 
big shouting contest with a guy called Gary Hart. He was sitting in the 
background. He wasn't even -- he was sitting with the staff, as a matter of 
fact. I guess that was.part of his popularism or something. And he made some 
remark tn the back there and I shouted back at him. I didn't give a damn. I 
made some remark about the Operation MONGOOSE we w~re talking about at the 
time and I said this was, as far as I was concerned, thts was American foreign 
policy made by the.President. And this voice in the back, I ·later found out 
it was Gary Hart, said something about, "Hey, well that doesn't make Ainerican 
foreign policy." I said, "As far as I'm concerned if the President says that 
is what we are doing and the Attorney General agrees; that's what we are 
doing. That's foreign policy." You know, and Church cuf off. 
INTERVIEWER:. Was Mathias there, do you remember at all? 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, yes he was there. He didn't bother me much. I think it 
was Mac that was there. I know Schweiker was there and I know Goldwater was 
there. 
INTERVIEWER: Tower? 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, Tower was there. He didn't say much. 
INTERVIEWER: No. 
MR. HALPERN: It was mostly Church and, of. course, F.A.O. Schwarz as the Staff 
Director. Yeah, that was a funny one too. I'd been called to talk to Schwarz 
on the Staff first in the morning; a crack of dawn kind of .thing. And I got 
down there. And this was ih the old; oh, what the hell is th~ building, the 
Senate building, not the Rayburn Building, the other one. 
INTERVIEWER: Cannon?·
