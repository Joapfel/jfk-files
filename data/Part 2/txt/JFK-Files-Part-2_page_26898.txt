Most of the paramilitary operations and the training was 
conducted by the Special Operations Group which is another 
entity of the 
Q ODO? 
A ODO. 
Q Now, the facilities that we have been talking about, 
training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special 
Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special 
Operations Group, is that correct? 
_'\ :vell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probabl!y 
some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic 
Training Station is under the Office of Training and but I 
would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would 
' probably staff the training facility with their people who hav~ 
the expertise in paramilitary operations. 
Q ;,ow, were the people that were being trained at 
these facilities basically Cuban refugees? 
rl Yes.

wer~ . .:\.merican citizens?
