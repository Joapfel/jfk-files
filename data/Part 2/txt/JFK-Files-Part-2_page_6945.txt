section 6, in which case release of the material shall be 
postponed, and this decision shall not be subject to judicial 
review." 
There is no limitation on the duration of postponement by the 
President. Suggest that the maximum period of time be that portion 
of the President's term which remains. 
Section 11. Rules of Construction 
Subsection (b) provides that nothing in the Joint Resolution 
shall be construed to eliminate any right to file requests with any 
Executive agency other than the Review Board or seek judicial 
review of the decisions of such agencies under the FOIA. 
One problem here is that transferring all agency records to 
the Review Board may mean that they are no longer "agency records" 
within the meaning of the FOIA." 
A second problem is that this provision eliminates the AMBR 
from FOIA c~verage. This sets a bad precedent and sets up 
circumstances of highest irony in which an agency whose overriding 
mission is openness wi·ll itself operate in secrecy. 
A • provision should be added here stating that in any FOIA 
action involving assassination materials the court is to apply the 
standards for postponement set forth in the Assassination Materials 
Disclosure Act in lieu of the exemptions provided in the FOIA. 
Additional Notes 
It may be a . good idea to expressly mention the Rockefeller 
Commission as s~bject to the Act.
