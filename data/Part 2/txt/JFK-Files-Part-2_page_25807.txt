Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach telephoned at 10:50 a. m. 
He said he had just completed talking on the telephone with Alexis Johnson, 
Deputy Under Secretary of State. John.son told Katzenbach that insofar as 
....... 
the investigation of this matter in Mexico is concerned, the State Department 
felt this should be coordinated and directed by the FBI. State took the 
position t~at the Presiden!'.~-~~c~jY:eJo the_ FBI ~xtended to any _activity 
outside of the United States, as well as within the cow1try. Insofar as the

Ambassador in Mexico is concerned, Johnson believed he should be kept .,· 1;, 
informed of any pertinent developments but that the Ambassador shY.1ld not . \..

With further reference to his co:iversation with Alexis .Johnson, " 
Katzenbach said he had been asked whether the State Department should make·": , , 
a formal inquiry of the Soviet Government for information concerning Oswald,,

and his wife, particularly as to their activities in Russia. He asked that tlns:J 
~uestion be considered by the Director, as Katzenbach felt his views mot_'.,· ;: :

In thinking about the matter himself, Katzenbach noted if we 19: 
did not ask the Soviets for information there wo•1ld '.Je no answer should the :j • 1 ·.r 
question of Oswald's stay in Russia be raised, other than to admit we had ~ l : 
made no inquiry. On the other hand, he observed that we could not place [a 1 ~ 
any reliance. on anything the Soviets said. (j • i l
