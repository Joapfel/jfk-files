the Kennedy·Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the 
books were numbered 39El, 39E2, 4~0E and 41E. This was two pages 
consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane 
cover had been riiped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure 
was torn at binder boles. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophan 
enclosure_and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen 
~evealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy 
Atitop~y photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was 
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check 
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing 
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out 
since Septem~er of 1977 according to the check out log. 
Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the 
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978 ' • 
if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They 
both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
