~") On 1 February 1972, Roberl M. Creed, SP4, 514-54-4745, Security 
Guard, C Team, 66th USA. Artillery Detachment, Datteln (LC8424), Federal 
Republic of Germany (FRG), was interviewed at his pl.ace of duty re~rding 
an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest, and stated substanti.aw 
as follows: 
(/J~)ource was approached by a man who identified himself as John the 
Dee Jay on 31 January 1972, in the Lord Nelson, a bar in Datteln. John 
the Dee Jay was the Disc Jockey at the Lord Nelsono John sat down with 
Source and began a normal conversation. The conversation soon turned to 
military subjects. John asked about CPT FNU l1yers and GPT FNU Jackson, 
who supposedly had been assigned to the unit at one time. John mentioned 
that he had taken pictures of Myers and his family. John asked Source about 
radar and other military subjects. John constantly mentioned Security 
Sergeants, phone numbers and personnel that were formerly at the unit. 
John stated that he knew the last Security Sergeant of C Team, and was 
interested in knowing who was now the Security Sergeant. At 2330 hours, 
Source left the Lord Nelson and proceeded to the Western Bar, Dattelno 
At the Western, Source met a man, name unknown, who owned the photography 
shop across the street from the Western, whom Source described as a "drinking 
buddy". Source and the unidentified man (UIM) left the Western about 0100 
hours and proceeded to the Lord Nelson. At the Lord Nelson, Source and UIM 
were joined at their table by John the Dee Jay. Upon learning that UIM 
was a Photographer, John asked him if he had ever taken pictures of a military 
installation. The UTI"i did not answer the question, but stated that he had 
taken pictures of a man named Julius (PHONETIC-NFI)o Julius supposedly had 
been an American stationed in Datteln with the US Army. The UIM became 
nervous because of John's questioning, excused himself, and.left the bar. 
Source did not see UDI anymore that evening. Source and John remained 
at the Lord Nelson. The conversation between Source and John returned to 
military subjectso John spoke about military subjects with authority and 
apparent proficiencyo John said many things about military subjects that 
Source had no knowledge of. Source was unable to recall any of the specifics 
of the conversation. Source felt dwarfed by John's military knowledge 
and at one time asked John if he knew about the XR-7l. John became very 
interested and asked Source what was the XR-71. Source replied that he was 
not allowed to talk about it, and the subject was dropped. John mentioned 
twice during the evening, that he had been kicked off Haard Kaserne, where 
C Team was located in Datteln, for being caught wearing a complete set of US 
fatigues in downtown Datteln. The first time John mentioned the incident 
he said it occurred twfi:. .c-~~X~~g,Q __ <W-9-.,. ?n_ -.~.t __ he:-·;$-~~.o~~-::-~~t.ipning he. said it
