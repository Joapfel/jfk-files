Stm111aiy of Covert Action Operations Targeted at 
Right-Wing Governments 
1. Pursuant to your request, fonvarded as attachment A is a paper 
providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing 
governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select 
Committee. 
2. All of the cases in the attached summary are considered sensitive 
by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to 
today. In many ways public disclosure of some of these operations could 
impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the..other dis­
closures on our foreign involvements .. For example, a disclosure of our_ 
. past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military­
base negotiations now 1mdenvay. With .this problem in mind, we have 
broken the operations into two categories: Category I are those oper­
ations about which full committee could be briefed, if -necessary, and 
Category II are those operations considered extremely sensitive about· 
which the committee Chainnan and Co-Chainnan might be briefed, if abso­
lutely necessary. 
-
3 . •• In addition to the attac~nt A s1.D1illary, we also approve the:·use 
(with the full committee) of the case stnmnary on our operations to assist 
the survival of the Betancourt government in Venezuela, whi.ch was pro­
vided to you directly by LA Division. 
4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this infonnation 
to the corroni ttee. However, should it· be necessary to do so; we -l'.Ould 
appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances 
of any use of this material outside of the Agency.
