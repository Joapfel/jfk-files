JFK ASSASSINATION RECORDS RIMEW BOARD RELEASES MILITARY 
RECORDS RELATED TO U.S. POLICY TOWARD CUBA FROM 1962-64 • 
The Assassination Records~ Board, an independent federal agency overseeing 
th~ identification, review, and release of records related to the assassination of President 
John P. Kennedy, today released approximately 1,500 pages of previously classified 
military records from.1962-64 that-relate to US. policy toward Cuba. 
"These documents further expand the historical record by illustrating the United States 
government's deep interest in developing a policy that would force Castro from power 
during the early 1960's," said 0r: Anna Nelson, a member of the Review Board. "We 
now have a new window into the policy options toward Cuba that were being 
con.sidered and debated at the highest levels of the military _services." 
The mandate of the Review Board is to make the record surrounding the assassination 
of President Kennedy as complete as possible. The Board has aggressively sought to 
uncover records on U.S. foreign policy that put the assassination into its historical 
context. 
The Review Board worked cooperatively with representatives from the Department of 
Defense (DOD) and the National Archives and ·Records Administration (NARA) to 
locate records stored at NARA that met the definition of being "assassination related." 
The documents are from the ~o served as General Counsel to 
the Secretary of the Army, the ~taff Chairmen Lemnil7.er, Taylor 
and Wheeler, and the central files of the Joint Chiefs• of Staff. 
The records have been transferred to NARA for inclusion in the JFK Collection, which is 
housed at the NARA facility in College Park, Maryland. These documents are now 
av~ble to researchers. • 
Copies of selected documents are available from the Assassination Records Review 
Board, 600 E Street, NW, Second Floor, Washington, OC 20530; telephone number: (202)
