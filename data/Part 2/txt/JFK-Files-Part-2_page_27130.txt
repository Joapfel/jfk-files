counterintelligence function, as a Staff function, to full 
parity with espionage and covert activities. One of the 
first undertakings of the Counterintelligence Staff was 
to determine who was doing counterintelligence work, what 
they were doing and under· what circumstances. 'rhis survey 
was launched in 1955 and completed in 1956. It established 
that except for the Counterintelligence Staff itself, the 
Operational Directorate had only 133 full-time counterin­
telligence officers, about 6 per cent of its total non-
clerical strength. The average grade of these officers was 
GS-09, and their average Agency experience was five years. 
Only one in four had had either basic or advanced training 
in counterintelligence. 
From the end of 1954 until April 1973, the apex of its 
development, the Counterintelligence Staff grew in numbers, 
skills and responsibilities. By the latter date its per­
sonnel strength, as I noted in my earlier report to the 
Commission, consisted of .130 officers and ,seventy-two assist­
ants and clerical personnel. This total of ~02 still con­
stituted only 3.7 per cent of the total Directorate of 
Operations strength of 5,662. As a result CIA could not 
meet its counterintelligence responsibilities adequately 
even at this peak of on-board counterintelligence strength. 
It is our view that the Operations Directorate ought to 
devote no less than 10 per cent of its manpower to 
counterintelligence and that no less than half of its
