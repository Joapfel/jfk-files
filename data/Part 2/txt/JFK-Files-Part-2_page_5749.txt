of all directorates. Following coordination with the ARRB 
staff, the Agency arranged for the staff to be briefed by a 
representative of each directorate concerning the nature of 
the files within the directorate -- how they are organized, 
maintained, searched, and how they have· been searched 
previously for assassination-related materials. Following 
,,. 
this effort, the ARRB staff asked for a number of additional 
searches by the Agency and they are in various stages·of 
completion. • • .. _ . ;-,- • - r 
g. In addition, pursuant to requests both·formal and 
informal from the ARRB staff, HRP has tasked various /;,, ._ -_. _ 
elements~ the Agency to conduct special searches for ·other 
materials thought to be relevant to the assassination story. 
Included in this category was the Oswald security file which 
was found and has been.examined by the ARRB staff.· Although 
a number of the requests are still outstanding, considerilble 
material has been provided for review by the ARRB staff some 
of which has been found to be relevant. These materials 
include the History Staff's histories on various CIA 
operations and Agency components; files on specific 
individ~als involved in either.the Warren Commission or HSCA 
investigation~; and the product of CIA internaLreviews of • 
programs and operations. Those parts of these.materials 
which are determined by the ARRB staff to have relevancy to 
the assassination story ,will be reviewed by HRP andi• 
released as completed. 
The status, results, and documentation of specific 
requests are to be addressed in a separate memorandum.
