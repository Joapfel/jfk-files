2. THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD (ARRE) IS A 
PRESIDENTIALLY-APPOINTED BOARD WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASING 
*ALL RECORDS RELATING TO THE<ASSASSINATION>OF<PRESIDENT KENNEDY> 
WITH A VERY FEW LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. THE MOST RELEVANT EXCEPTION 
FOR THE AGENCY IS WHERE THERE IS " ... CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE 
THAT THE THREAT TO THE CONDUCT OF US INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND 
FOREIGN RELATIONS OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT 
DISCLOSURE WOULD REVEAL AN INTELLIGENCE METHOD CURRENTLY UTILIZED 
AND NOT OFFICIALLY DISCLOSED." 
3. LAST WEEK, THE DDA AND THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE 
FOR ADMINISTRATION WERE CALLED TO TESTIFY ON THE CONTINUED 
WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION Q:i-iJ\T WOULD OFFICIALLY CONFTRj(f"::TI-I~CI"J.I.

s MADE DIFFICULT BY THE FACT THAT STATE COVER IS SO WIDELY 
DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA INCLUDING THE MANY BOOKS AUTHORED BY 
FORMER CIA EMPLOYEES; HOWEVER, THE USG HAS NEVER OFFICIALLY 
RELEASED THE FACT OF STATE COVER. ALTHOUGH THE ISSUE WAS BRIEFED 
IN DEPTH, THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED ADDITIONAL CONCRETE DAMAGE 
VIS-A-VIS THE COUNTRIES SPECIFIED IN THE DOCUMENTS AT 
ISSUE--MOSCOW, PARIS, MEXICO CITY AND BUENOS AIRES. 
4. ACCORDINGLY, WE NEED YOUR SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE 
DAMAGE THAT COULD ARISE IF OFFICIAL USG DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED
