nothing w1th the Church n~:>nsense and MHCHAOS. It was all in the foreign

Laos, 1t came out some money was involved, people were using Air America was 
used, all that kind of stuff~ These people were not representatives of the 
then Intelligence Oversight Committees ahd with the advice of the then 
Oversight Committees (the four of them we had) we had to be careful as to what 
we told these people from different comm1ttees of the Congress. The four 
oversight committees were jealous of their prerogatives you could imagine 
particularly in the days when you had real strong men running the Congress and 
they did not want all of these other committees, in terms of jurisdictional 
fights, mucking around in what they were supposed to be handling it. And so 
somehow we were caught in the middle of the jurisdictJonal fights in the 
Congress at the same time we were handling classified stuff we didn't know how

to what later became the Chµrch and Pike Committees. 
INTERVIEWER: Well, were these teams attached to particular committees or 
subcommittees? 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, well they were representativ-s of particular committees. I 
just can't remember what the committees• names were. 
INTERVIEWER: OK, right. 
MR. HALPERN: It didn't reilly matter to us. They were not part of the four 
oversight committees. 
INTERVIEWER: They were not?
