TOP SECRET 
Istanbul, Ankara, and to the Forward Operations Base 
in Miami~ Remembering that Dave Phillips himself 
was something of an actor, as well as a newspaperman, 
it is believed worthwhile to repeat.this cable in its 
entirety. The cable read as follows: 
1. FYI: HQS IS CONSIDERING THE FOLLOW­
ING OPERATION: SHORTLY AFTER A RUSSIAN 
BOAT HOMEWARD BOUND FROM CUBA PASSES THROUGH 
BOSPHOROUS A DRIPPING CUBAN CLIMBS ASHORE 
IN TURKEY. HE CLAIMS TO BE.POLITICAL 
PRISONE~ ARRESTED BY CUBANS IN HAVANA BUT 
SENT TO RUSSIA FOR IMPRISONMENT. CUBAN 
SUBJECT WILL CONTACT LdCAL LATIN AMERICAN 
CONSULS AND ISTANBUL PRESS FOR EXPLOITATION, 
THEN RETURN LATIN·AMERICA. AFTER BRIEF 
BUT DRAMA':l'IC EXPOSURE TO PRESS AN "ATTEMPT" 
WILL BE MADE ON SUBJECT'S LIFE. FOR THIS 
REASON HE WILL GO UNDERGROUND SO "THEY" 
WILL NOT LIQUIDATE HIM. 
2. FOR HAVA: REQUEST STATION RECRUIT 
SUBJECT. OBVIOUSLY HE MUST ,.BE SUPERB 
ACTOR WHO CAN CONVINCINGLY MAINTAIN ROLE 
IN SPITE OF SKILLFUL PROBING BY DUBIOUS 
NEWSMEN. HE MUST HAVE MEMORY CAPABLE OF 
~ETAINING THOUSANDS OF "D~TAILS" ABOUT HIS 
ARREST AND FORCED JOURNEY. HE MUST BE 
KNOWN IN HAVANA SO.AS TO BE MISSED WHEN 
HE IS "ARRESTED." AN ARTICULATE STUDENT 
TYPE WOULD BE DESIRABLE. SWIMMING ABILITY 
DESIRABLE BUT NOT ESSENTIAL . 
. 3. SUGGEST THAT IN.RECRUITMENT, STATION 
STATE THERE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE CUBAN 
PRISONERS REALLY ARE BEING SENT RUSSIA, 
BUT THAT THIS CANNOT BE PROVED. THUS SUB­
JECT'S PARTICIPATION IN THI~ PLAY-ACTING 
WILL BE .JUSTIFIABLE DRAMATIZATION OF 
.SOVIET CONTROL IN CUBA. STATION ALSO 
AUTHORIZED PROMISE FINANCIAL BACKING, LATER
