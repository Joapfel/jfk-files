Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
RE: SENSTUDY 7 5 
62-116395 
• 
CIA item described as Project WESTPOINTER apparently 
involved the examination of mail to the U.S. from Mainland 
China during certain specific months of 1969, 1970 and 1971. 
CIA indicated that Project WESTPOINTER was similar to Project 
SRPOINTER. FBIHQ COMMENT: Our fiies contain no information 
concerning Project WESTPOINTER. Memorandum from Acting 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated 4/1/75, 
captioned "Jane Fonda v. L. Patrick Gray, et al.; Civil Action 
No. 73-2442-MML (C.D. Cal.}," describes a CIA covert operation 
known as SRPOINTER which involved examination of mail to and 
from the Soviet Union which was discontinued in 2/73. 
Apparently, CIA had examined certain mail addressed to Jane 
Fonda in connection with its SRPOINTER activity. While we 
were not aware of CIA's Project WESTPOINTER, it is noted that 
this Bureau did periodically examine mail coming from the 
People's Republic of China (PRC} and Hong Kong to the U.S. 
and mail from the U.S. to the PRC and Hong Kong during the 
period 1956-1966. This activity, which was permanently dis­
continued 1/24/66, was carried under the code names CHIPROP 
and CHICLET. Public disclosure of the CIA item referred to 
above as Project WESTPOINTER might lead to a more detailed 
public examination of this Bureau's periodic control of mail 
in the CHIPROP and CHICLET operations. 
ACTION: 
For information in connection with Senstudy 75.
