4. An operational test of an !'!SA-developed HF /DF 
system Kas jointly conducted by XSA, Division D/DDO and 
OC-SPD personnel in the early part of the summer of 1972. 
A location in Miami Beach, Florida was selected for the 
tests because of similarity to the actual target site and 
environnent in S~igon. Receiving antennas were placed on 
the roof of the hotel being used as the receiving/OF site. 
A hotel e~ployec asked why the =ateriel was placed on the 
roof. A team member in effect told him that the group 
was an ~dvancc security segment for the Democratic National 
Convcntio~. ~o further questions were asked; the tests 
were completed and the equipment was returned to the 
Washington area.
