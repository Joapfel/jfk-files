against a coup, but suggested that alternative l~adership should be 
identified and cultivated. The recommendations we~e prom;:,tly

On October 3 Cone in contacted Minh. '.linh explained that a 
coup ;:as being planned, and requested assurances of American

The tctiay Chief of the cr0istation, t~f;iratm,g- cabled on

October 5 that he had recommended to Lodge that ''we do not set 
ourselves irrevocably against the assassination plot, since the 
other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon or a 
protracted struggle'' (Cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63). 
A cable from the Director, CIA to Saigon resroncled that: 
''(w)c certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating, 
arproving, or supporting assassination, but on the other 
hand, we are iri no way responsible for stopping every 
such threat o.E '.-:hich we mis-ht receive even parti2.l l~no1-,­
lcdge. \·.Ye certainly 1·:ould not favor assassination of Diem. 
Ne believe engaging ourselves by taking position on this 
matter opens door too easily for probes of our position 
re others, re support of regime, et cetera. Consequently 
believe best approach is hands off. Ilowever,*we naturally 
interested in intelligence on any such plan.'' 
* The other courses of action were the encirclement of Saigon 
by various military units and direct confrontation between military 
units involved in the coup and loyalis.t units. 
1,* Colby, who was then Chief, Far Eastern Di vision, drafted 
this cable for McCone. Colby testified: 
"Q: So you were on notice as of that date that the Director 
personally opposed any involvement by the CIA in an assas­
sination?· 
"Colby: I certainly was." (Colby, p. 57)
