nobody knew the difference. 
INTERVIEWER: Good point. 
MR. HALPERN: So. You know. And the academics in this country 
have never caught on. Maybe they are catching on slowly now. 
INTERVIEWER: Slow. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, very slow. That there is an impact on this 
stuff. You got humans and humans and humans. And that"s all 
there is. And I think, for example, Roy Godson, started in 
1978, at Georgetown on the National Strategy Information 
Center. And he has a number of academics come, almost every 
year up in Maine. 
INTERVIEWER: And he is running another one this summer. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah. Okay, that's beginning to have an impact. 
I don"t know how many thousands of academics there ar~ in the 
colleges and universities. But he is just barely scratching 
the surface. And it has taken him 10 years. 
INTERVIEWER: He ran the first one up at Bowdoin in '81. I was 
up there. 
MR. HALPERN: Okay. There is one. I was one of the guys -- he 
asked me to come to tell them about the intelligence of '78 
which I did. And unfortunately Angelo Codevilla got a hold of 
him too and so changed Roy Godson's views, but at least we got 
started on this th'i ng. And I attended a lot of those seminars 
that he started in '78 and.'79 and so. 
INTERVIEWER: Were they local? 
MR. HALPERN: They were all here, but he brought in people from 
all over and they had a good foundation.
