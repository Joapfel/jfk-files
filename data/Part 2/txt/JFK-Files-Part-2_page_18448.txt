FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local 
Law Enforcement Agencies 
The Committee seeks ·to determine the nature or 
the relationships betw~en FBI intelligence 
. activities and state ahd local law enforcement 
agencies. This subject involves the delicate 
balance between the.necessary centralization 
of certain law enforcement activities and the 
Constitutionally-mandated decentraiization of 
general law enforcement responsibility. It is 
necessary for the Committee to evaluate the 
centralizing influence of the FBI~ as well as 
the FBI's role .as a check on local law enforce­
ment abuses. •
