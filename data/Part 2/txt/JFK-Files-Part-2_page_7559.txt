Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future c::p2ri:-:1cnts on the 
biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laSoratory ani.nals; 
therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, anc USSR reconu::cndatioris 
to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. These Soviet 
scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of 
inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except 
our own laboratory. The interchange of e~peri~cntal ~etho~s, results, 
and concepts was valuable for planning our future resea~ch and 
evaluating the results of past and present research. Since they 
have reported biological effects of inhaled plU;tonium in e:>:periment2.l 
animals at extremely low expos3,1re levels and recommended to the ICRP 
that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to 
understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation, 
and logic in making their recommendations was very useful. 
Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs. Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well 
acquainted with the field of therapy for pluto::1ium poisoning but 
not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the 
former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the 
latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased 
active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was inter-
~st~d in our plans to test phosphorothioiG ___ ci.cl-fts as removal agents·= 1 
and mentioned his own work on the removal of l~ce with DTPA as c:in '

. l . 238 -· Dr. c. L. Sanders discussed our ow-level inhaled Puo 2 stuaies 
(life-span) , metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction ·with 
Pu02 particles. The Russians were particularly informative in • 
describing their low-level life span studies with 239Pu. It was 
learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist ·who worked 
in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated 
ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution proble~s. 
Dr. J.E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium 
compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our 
americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tried 
inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He \·.'as interested 
in our work with age effects on gut absorption and ,-,•anted to know 
why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is 
prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in
