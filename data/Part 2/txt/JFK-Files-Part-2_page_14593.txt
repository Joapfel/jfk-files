Re: INTELLIG1,1vCE COVERAGE OF FRIENDLY 
FOREIGN COUNTRil~ (SEMIANNUAL E'VALUATLON} 
result, in intelligence coverag"'e of friendly foreign countries. The Anagram 
Program is a typical example. Our technical coverage frequently assists in 
on Anagram. operation. The name-check program on holders of official and 
diplomatic visas covers many of the intelligence personnel coming under the 
firsi category of captioned progrcm. Even the Intensification Program, 
which is directed against Soviet bloc officials and establishments, produces 
~ data on activi-cies of friendly foreign officials and their contacts with 
communist officials. M_g,g_nitude: Program handled on Section-wide basis sfnc.e-· 
it has ramifications touching work on any desk handling matters relating to 
noncommunist countries, depending upon world developments""·and intelligence 
requirements ;of Bureau and State Department. Past or Present Vleaknesses: 
During pa'st s-t,x ~months potential weakness developed in thjrd category of this 
program - devel opme,n,t of 1 ive sources. After securi, ng approval of State 
o.fficials in Bureau of Security and Consµ,lar Affairs to undertake program to 
.develop live sources in official establishments of certain defined friendly 
countries we found such officials reluctant to approve interviews with 
persons we desired to approach in thi,s connection, often citing as reason for 
refusal the fact that a friendly country was involved, which of course was 
known at outsets On 6-2-59 we discussed this problem with Robert Murphy who 
said he did not know we had been having this problem and would appreciate our 
contacting him on these matters and, depending on each individual case, he 
would make the determinationo We are now handling these matters directly 
with Murphy under a procedure approved by him which will eliminate some 
paperwork required in past and reduce liaison contact with him to minimum so 
as not to tie up procedure with "red tapeo II This should strengthen this 
phase of program si fi.Ce past experience has .. shown Murphy has real isti,c and 
understanding attitude toward Bureau's intelligence operations as well as 
great appreciation of its results. Administrative_q_ontrols: Controls 
exercised on day-to-day basis through review of outgoing instructions to 
field relating to the various phases of program. Control file maintained to 
which copies of pertinent serials are regularly routedo Semiannual review oJ : __ 
program encompasses complete review of control file. Adequacy and Curren.tnes:3!f~··. • 
of Instruction.§._: SAC letter 59-9 alerted field to necessity for recognizing t·- ,_. 
responsibilities for intelligence coverage and seeing that agents handling 
security matters do so with interest and enthusiasm. Since last evaluation 
this program, memoranda to all Section Supervisors circulart2ed 12-17-58 and 
3-2-59 giving direction to phases of program and current memo prepared 
concerning new procedures for cleari,ng thfrd category matters with Robert 
Murphy. Over-all Value·: For the most part, this program consi,sts of a 
coordination of accepted investigative and intelligence procedures for the 
purpose of proper direction, redirection when indicated, and administrative 
' controls. On a continuing basis it produces information of value to our 
investigative requirements, to our intelligence requirements and for budget 
purposes. Contemplated Action: F~om current evaluation and analysis, no~ ,.. .... 
changes are indicated at this timee We will closely follow all phases 0 J v _, -~
