In view of the personal interest expressed by Mr. McCone 
in the project when it was tabled at the meeting of 15 August,it was 
agreed that no decision should be made until after the DCI's return. 
b. Mr. Cheever briefed the Group on the successful disposal of 
the contaminated sugar which has been in Puerto Rico. 
c. Mr. Cheever discus'sed the "After Action Report" on the two 
sabotage operations conducted the middle of August. Mr. Johnson 
commented on the amount of materiel that had been left behind at the 
site of one of these operations, and asked whether it is possible that 
the Cuban agents did this deliberately, in order to involve the United 
States. Mr. Cheever acknowledged this possibility, but felt that it 
had simply been a question of "green troops" behaving in this manner 
their first time under fire. 
The Chairman asked that an estimate be prepared, assessing 
Castro's probable reaction to this sabotage. He also asked Mr. Cheever 
to see that the Attorney General is briefed on the results of the· 
operations.
