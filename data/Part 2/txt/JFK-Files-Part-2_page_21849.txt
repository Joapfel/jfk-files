Tweedy's cable indicated that a third country national would be 
required as an agent in the PROP operation: 
IF DECIDED SUPPORT FOR PROP OBJECTIVES, 
BELIEVE ESSENTIAL SUCH BE PROVIDED THROUGH 
THIRD NATIOUAL CHANNEL WITH [AMERICAN] 
ROLE COMPLETELY CONCEALED. (CIA Cable, 
9/22/60.) 
Tweedy expressed reservations about two agents that the station 
was using for other operations and said "WE ARE CONSIDERING A 
THIRD NATIONAL CUTOUT CONTACT CANDIDATE AVAILABLE HERE WHO MIGHT 
FILL BILL"* (CIA Cable, 9/22/60). Despite Tweedy's concern about 
the two existing station contacts, he indicated that the~hief of} 
station and his "colleague" -- presumably the man identified as 
('Sid'}who was to arrive in the Congo shortly to explain the PROP 
operation to Hedgman -- were to be afforded considerable latitude 
in exercising their.judgment on the conduct of the operation: 
YOU AND COLLEAGUE UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT READ 
OVER YOUR SHOULDER AS YOU PLAN AND ASSESS 
OPPORTUNITIES. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN MUST BE 
CONCEALMENT [AMERICAN] ROLE, UNLESS OUT­
STANDING OPPORTUNITY EMERGES WHICH MAKES. 
CALCULATED RISK FIRST CLASS BET. READY 
ENTERTAIN ANY SERIOUS PROPOSALS YOU MAKE 
BASED OUR HIGH REGARD BOTH YOUR PROFESSIONAL 
JUDGMENTS. (CIA Cable, 9/22/60.) 
* This is probably a reference to agent Q.JltlIN, who was later 
dispatched to the Congo. His mission is discussed in Sections 
and infra.
