FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE, BAY AREA CHAPTER 
also known as Bay Area Fair Play for Cuba 
Committee (BAFPCC) 
The "New York Times" newspaper on November 20, 1960, 
carried an article captioned "Pro-Castro Body Reports U.S. 
Gain," which reported that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee 
(FPCC) had 5,000 paid-up members in the United States. The 
article declared that the FPCC had headquarters at 799 Broadway, 
New York City, New York, and had chapters in other cities, in­
cluding one in San Francisco. 
------ ------
A source advised in March, 1961, that the Bay Area 
Chapter of the FPCC (BAFPCC) began to be formed in San Francisco 
in November, 1960, under the direct guidance and leadership of 
ASHER HARER, who the source identified as a member of the San 
Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and a 
member of the National Committee of the SWP. 
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney 
General of the United States pursuant to 
Executive Order 10450. 
A source advised in May, 1962, that the BAFPCC is 
currently active in the San Francisco area and includes members 
in San Francisco and surrounding counties. He advised that the 
BAFPCC has no headquarters but receives mail through Post 
Office Box 2615, San Francisco 26, California, which is a box 
maintained by ASHER HARER. He stated that the announced aims and 
purposes of the BAFPCC are to "spread the truth about Cuba and 
to prevent U.S. intervention in Cuba." 
A source advised in March, 1962, that in the recent 
elections of the BAFPCC, the SWP continued its influence by 
having SWP members elected to the Execut:t ve Committee.
