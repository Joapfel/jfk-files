First, profits (defined as net income to a proprietary after 
coverage of operating expenses) are relatively small. Even in 
the days when the most profitable air proprietaries were at full 
swing, the most that any single firm netted was $3.9 million (Air 
America in 1967). Over the entire period 1947-1975, total pro­
fits have been $50 million, an average of about $1.6 million 
annually, for the 16 biggest CIA proprietaries. And in these 
years, a net loss was sustained three -times -- $2.5 million 
in 1971, $0.5 million in 1973, and $0.3 million in 
1975. Looking to the future, after liquidation of the air pro-
prietaries has been completed, there is forecast to be only one 
profitable proprietary: 1'1HMUTUAL a complex of insurance, reinsurance 
and, and escrow-holding companies which derives most of its pro-
fit from investment portfolios. MUTUAL's net income in 1974 was 
$1.8 million and this general magnitude of profit is expected in 
the foreseeable future. 
As for treatment in the budget, there is both a policy and 
procedural aspect. The policy of CIA has changed; in February, 
1975 the General Counsel of CIA ruled that profits of proprietaries 
and proceeds of liquidation must be returned to the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts and cannot be used to augment the Contingency 
Reserve or otherwise be applied to CIA operations. ·This ruling 
overturned the practice of the past which, on the few occasions 
where profits were not applied to augment net worth of proprietaries 
--i.e .. plowed back into the enterprise or investment portfolios--, 
was to apply proprietary net proceeds to the Contingency Reserve· 
for later release to operations.
