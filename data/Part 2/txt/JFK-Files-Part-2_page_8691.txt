Raul ROA said that prior to his assassination, President 
Kennedy "established certain contacts" with iliba.

New York. ROA thought that Kennedy would have gone on 
to negotiate with Cuba, for practical reasons, which 
would have been to Cuba's advantage. He thought that 
President Johnson was unaware of Kennedy's actions.
