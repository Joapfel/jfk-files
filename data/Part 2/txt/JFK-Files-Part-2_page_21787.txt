anybody. It was to provide information to them because their 
name would come up ·somewhere in a case. 
Mr. Wides. What kind of assistance? You mean more than 
just a chance to interview tha~? 
Mr. Sarno. No, just interview. They never used them to 
run a man on the street or anything like that, no, sir. 
They tried to get one individual one time and they didn't know 
that he worked for us and they tried to hire him and he came 
back and reported it. We had to advise them that he was 
already working for us. 
Mr. Wides. And you had 115 men a.nd,:all··--
Mr. Sarno. There were women also, sir. 
Mr.' Nides. And women, and all they were doing was 
interviewing refugees and writing reports on exile potential 
activities against Cuba? 
Mr. Sarno. I would say that was the biggest majority of 
their job. 
Mr. Wides. What was the rest of it? 
Mrv Sarno. They also went out, if our station was going 
to run a!:. operation and they needed X amount of bodies, certain 
specialized personnel, the~~ would go and locate the 
personnel, talk to them, spot them, get their personal history 
from them, send it in, and the:·pepple would be traced out and 
checked and cleared and eventually introduced to the station 
case officer who would use them in our operations.
