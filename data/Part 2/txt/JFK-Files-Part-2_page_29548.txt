tha·t the tape of the 28 Sept,•mber conversation, which

30th or the 1st of October, 11as·destroyed before the 
tap~ of the convtrsation on :he 1st of October was re­
ceived in the station on tha: same day. In ·light of 
the standard operating proceiu~es in effect in the sta-

In view of what is now k1own about the standard 
operatin.g procedures and aboJt the Station's.actions 
prior to the assassination, the Station's cohfusing and, 
somewhat contr~dictory reporting after th~ assassination 
is strange. 684/ It .is possible that these confusions 
and contradictions· arose out of the crisis atmosphere 
at the station and the rush to report information. This 
Committee has not fourid any·s~lid evidente that. there 
\. 
were sinister qualities tn the reporting after the 
assassination.
