government privy to all the studies of the Bay of Pigs operation, 
including the Taylor report, Robert Kennedy's personal report, the 
Kirkpatrick report, and the views of the President's Foreign 
Intelligence Advisory Board. 
McCone did not dwell on the Bay of Pigs after he took office, but 
he did draw several conclusions. Firmly believing the decision to go 
ahead was a mistake, he nevertheless thought it an even worse mistake 
to dismember the operation once underway, cQntending that the CIA 
should have appealed directly to the President to reverse the 
decision to stand down the air strikes. Concluding as well that the 
members of the Taylor commission had been too closely involved with 
the events to have sufficient perspective, he believed the CIA and 
JCS had to bear special responsibility for advising the new President 
to go ahead, since at that time these were the only two Washington 
organizatjons dealing with international affairs which possessed 
complete continuity. 
Taking a detached view of the operation, McCone was able to 
concentrate on what the Agency could do to avoid similar mistakes in 
the future. Leery of large-scale operations involving the Agency's 
paramilitary capability, McCone strove, with mixed results, to remove 
the CIA from such enterprises. He also stressed the importance of 
planning an operation from beginning to end (an attitude which 
dominated his approach during the Cuban missile crisis). Finally, he 
insisted that the Agency's estimative function be privy to planned 
operations, providing early and frequent judgments.
