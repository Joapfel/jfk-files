After the assassination the CIA's Mexico.City Station 
passed copies.of seven of the above listed conversations to 
the U. S. ·E°mbas_sy Legal Attach~. 471 1 The 9/27/ 10:30 and the 
9/27 1:25 calls listed above are not included in this 
dissemination. 4721 The· cover memorandum itates: 
Attached are ph-0tost3tic copies of transcripts 
of all conversations from technical operations 
of_this.off ➔r.~ which are possibly pertinent in 
th1s case.-- 3/ • 
The HSCA has not bee.1 able to determine why the 9/27 
10:30 and 9/27 1:25 calls 11ere not included in this memorandum; 
While the 1:25 call could bt! considered unrelated, it is 
unlikely that the same would apply to the 10:30 call since 
. the 9/27 10:37 call is included in ·the memorandum. 
At the bottom of eact attachment pag~ to the Scott 
memorandum, a summary of the conversation is provided.474/ 
The Station questioned the relevancy of only one·of the se~en 
calls presented in the mrmorandum. The summari of the lb/3 
call says: 
By the context of oth~r conversations by Oswald 
and the fact that this called· (sic) spoke in 
broken Spanish ~nd En~lish rather than Russian­
which he· used previou;ly, it is probable that this caller is not Osiald._4_7_5/ 
(Ibid., p.9~) 
A judgem~nt that this call did not p~rtain .to Lee Harjey 
Oswald could be based ·on ·the JolJ:ow.ing _f~t.s.:-:... -~---.
