c) Item 48 (p. 71a) is classified secret, and 
is exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2) 
of EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and 
methods of operation. This item names African Forum, 
Africa Report, Preuves, Encounter, and Forum as 
magazines that received CIA subsidies; In the case 
of Preuves, Encounter, and Forum, these magazines were 
published by the former Congress for Cultural Freedom. 
The Government has not acknowledged covertiy subsidizing 
CCF or its magazines, although Encounter magazine's 
ties to CIA have been the subject of press speculation. 
Preuves magazine has been the subject of little or no 
press speculation, as far as we know, and it is our 
understanding that French laws prohibit covert foreign 
subsidies to French publications, which makes it 
especially important to protect the former CIA tie to 
that magazine. Exposure of the two Africa magazines 
would be damaging to a number of prominent people and 
organizations in this country and in Africa that have 
worked for _improved social conditions in Africa and for 
good relations between this country and Africa, which 
would be harmful to this country's relations with Africa.
