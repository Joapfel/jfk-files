c~tions and historically h~s been,.hnd undoubtedly 
will be, one of the most importan~ and involved case~ 
of Soviet oper~tions in this country and abroad. We 
did not dissc;:1in::1te any information of sit:;nificancc 
in this c~se until 1954. bn various occnGions when 
the Liuison A~~nt has beco~e involved in heated argu~ 
ments TTith CIA officials, they have ocen fit to raise 
this case ns ~n out~t3ndini ax~mplc of FBI failu~o to 
coopor~tc ~ith the A~o~cy. The position taken by CIA 
w~s that it sboul<l h~vo ~con advised regnrdin~ the 
Soviet opcr~~ional ~ctivity in foreicrn countrie3, , 
clnininr; that the Agency ..-:ould have had the opportuni t::' 
to clevelori :-;.ore infor~~tion of sir;nificancc, identify 
Soviet":; 1ts, and possibly prepare conditio~s for 
, recru_ .. tncu: or chublin;:;. of Soviet operatives. We did 
1 not disscrnin~te our reports to CIA because of the 
• extrchl'3 sen3i ti' . .i ty of the c~se. We ac 1tun.lly did not 
• p·err.ii t CI.I\ to 11.:';.ndle :iny investic:a tions relating to 
lthe MOCASE until 1957. • 
In 1G57, CI~ complained that it certainly had 
every ri~ht to l1ave roccivc<l the informntion c3rlier 
because D;lllY aGpcct:1 of the !:CCASE pertained to CIA 
e~ploycos and oporatinns. CIA further argued that it 
had been ~rcatly h~ndicnppcd in effectively carryinrr out 
the' loads in 1957 bccau3e the lends were given to the 
Agency at the sa~e tine that the cnse was publicized. 
'The A~ency 3r~ucd·th~t the failure of the Bureau to 
coordin~te with CIA those French aspects of the case 
'
permitted th~ French, r~thcr th~n the u. S., to play a 
dominatinc role in Europe. .
