Dear John: 
Through an-oversight, the Research Unit failed 
to notify the Budget Office t'hat you had.terminated 
your services with the Select Committee~ As a 
consequence, y9u were overpaid for the mon~h of 
August. 
As I understand the facts, you ~orked through 
Friday,_ August 12 and that Mr. Gay gave you vacation 
throtigh Friday, August 19. Therefore, you were 
overpaid for the period August 20-31, ·1977 which 
amounts to a gross salary 0£ $220.00~ 
I£ you ~gree with the £acts, I must request. 
from you in the name of the House of Representatives, 
the return of Hous~ funds in the amount of $220.00. 
The check should be made payable to the U. S. , 
Treasury and sent to me in. care of ·the Committee. 
If you dispute the facts,· kindly get in touch· 
with me as soon as possible so that we can settle 
the matter. 
Kind regards and good luck in your classes at 
school.
