CIA item captioned nAntlers," relates thElfCIA 
arranged to move a sensitive defector out of a -.European 12 
country by commercial transportation and gained entry into ~ 
the U.S. without leaving any trace of the defector's true 
identity. FBIHQ COMMENT: Our files contain no information 
concerning the word "Antlers," in the context described by 
CIA. More than likely, "Antlers" is a CIA in-house code word 
used for the handling of a valuable and sensitive def,ector • 
source. i'fuile we have no information relative to "Antlers," 
it is noted that we do have access currently to two CIA 
defector sources respectively code named TORTIS and TUMBLE, 
both of whom were Romanian Intelligence Service (RIS) officer~ 
whose whereabouts have been carefully concealed as both of 
these defectors are targets of the RIS. Specifically, the RIS .. 
has indicated a desire to kidnap·and/or kill the two defectors 
mentioned herein. It is possible the CIA item referred to as 
"Antlers" may relate to either TORTIS or TUMBLE. It is firmly rl,? L 
believed that public disclosure of the CIA iteJJt' .. nff}nt.i~1~j'1J~ fD<,)
