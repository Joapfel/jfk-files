MOSKALEV participated in Second Int'l 
Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone 
Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley, 
~Jlo.., arriving two days early. He 
had travelled alone to Sun Valley and 
apparently was able to use his knowledge 
of English language to get along on his 
own. However, he complained to Chairman 
of conference that he did not know enough 
English to read his paper which also 
required condensation because it was too 
long for the time allowed. A colleague 
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet­
ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English 
improved greatly after a few drinks. 
However, he did not drink at all during 
this conference. He did mention that he 
had written the English version of the 
paper he presented himself. A respected 
U.S. scienti~ with nore experience 
than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not 
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this 
in private.) MOSKALEV attempted to 
make propaganda of a report by a west 
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a 
little upset. He took copious notes on 
all papers, whicnTnaica~he understood 
what was going on. He also took many 
pictures with a 35 mm camera. From questions 
he asked in private, it was obvious he 
understood English quite well. Considerable 
time was spent in arvanging visit to a U.S. 
lab. in route to his home. He took a 
C e -•eel 
different route, without telling anyone
