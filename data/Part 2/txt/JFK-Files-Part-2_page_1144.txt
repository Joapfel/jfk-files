Covert Action training· presented by. this D ranch in the i.6&1rn 06U:Q~1Jiitd[Jb'is·e of a wide 
range o! Agency CA activities. Ouite apart from all the operational consequences of 
these public disdos·ures, there were also, ·of course, conc;p.mita,nt ramifications in 
the tra,ining field. Following careful study and examinatie>n.of i.he'ne:,.v situation, Mr. 
Smith de-vised, in closest coordination with the CA Sta££, a radically new and different 
Covert.Action curriculum. The existing l:omp·reh~n'sive courses on youth and labor 
operatwns were discontinued £or obvious reasons. ·In place of-these and the part.;.time 
Covert Action Operations Course, Mr. Smith developed a new, £uli-ti~e, thrce~day 
Covert.Action Operations Seminar £or middle and senior grade officers. This inten• 
sive seminar, stress_ing the _integrated nature of CS,operaUons, was designed as_a: 
• basic core around which skills-oriented seminars or workshops could be. built to deal.
