E. Indonesia-Philippines A Philippine foreign office 
man states that everything was set, as we noted yes­
terday, for Sukarno to visit Manila today. This 
official says, however, that the visit was postponed 
as a result of Macapagal's decision to attend Presi­
dent Kennedy's funeral. 
F. Indonesia Djakarta is giving every indication that 
it will hold up final action on the long-pending oil 
contracts with US companies in an attempt to smoke 
us out on the question of US aid policy toward Indo­
nesia. 
G. Rwanda-Burundi Tribal refugees from Rwanda, now in 
Burun~1, seem bent on making trouble between the two 
countries. Some 3,000 of their number were reported 
yesterday to be moving toward the frontier. They 
have little military capability, but blood could 
flow and require UN intervention. 
H. USSR-CQngo · As a further token of the withdrawal 
of Soviet diplomats we have noted that the Soviet 
diplomatic communications link between Moscow and 
Leopoldville was shut down last Saturday. (INTER­
