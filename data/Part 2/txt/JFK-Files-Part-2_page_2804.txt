I concur with this evaluation, Subject's ability in the propaganda 
field particularly is exceptional. Blessed with a fertile imagination, 
he has an uncanny talent for coming up with an appropriate CA remedy 
to almost any problem. His knowledge and experience in the CA field 
is wide and deep, making him undoubtedly one of thF. best officers in 
this speciality in the Agency. The Branch is indeed fortunate to 
have his services.
