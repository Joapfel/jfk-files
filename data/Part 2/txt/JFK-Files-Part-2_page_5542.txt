Eileen: Let me introduce myself. I am CIC/Legal. C/CIC asked me to touch base with you 
concerning any possible ARRB release of privacy information concerning Nosenko. While we are 
aware that such a decision to release is within the Board's discretion, we do believe that the 
Agency, when giving this information over to them, should request that the Board protect such 
information to the maximum extent possible. If I can be of help in that regard just let me know.

The Nosenko Papers

DRV FROM: HUM 4-82 
At about 1020 hrs on Tuesday, 31 July, I received a call from(ff[/een Wukitqffjof the Agency's 
External Support Group/Historical Collection Staff regarding Michelle Combs's interest in reviewing 
the Nosenko papers for the upcoming meeting of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) 
on 5 August. • ukitch said Combs, an ARRB staffer, is planning on taking 20 pages of the Nosenko 
material with her. • ukftcii"y;:ants to know whether we would like copies of the material Combs is 
taking. I said yes. ~aid Combs appears understanding of our concerns in this case and to 
this end wanted the following questions answered so she could put a human touch on our concerns 
in explaining our position to the ARRB. 
1. Is Nosenko married? (No one in CIC/AG knows.) 
2. What part of the country is he living in? (This is known, but I can't see why she or the 
ARRB needs to know.) \ .' 
3. Did the Soviets actually sentence Nosenko to death? Or was this just his claim. (No one 
in CIC/AG know, but it appears reasonable to assume that the Soviets did sentence him to death.) 
4. Nosenko's current age? (No one in CIC/AG knows off hand. Henry's observation was 
that Combs can find this out from open literature.)
