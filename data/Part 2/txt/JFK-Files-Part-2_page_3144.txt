one could have found a better man. People 
have said ... "Well, the son of a bitch 
just worked out in the Philippines as a 
stay behind what did he know?" He 
knew a lot. He had written a book oh 
guerrillas. He was sharp, he. was smart, 
and horiest, and not overly ambitious. I 
ani. sure that he saw this as a way to further 
his career, of course. Military men, I 
·think, tend to maximize that more than 
Agency people. But that was not his 
motivation -- or his primary motivation. 
He had around him some really first rate 
help . . . not very high ranking ... but 
. we didn't need an awful lot·of high ranking 
• ... ·we needed some hard workers. Frank 
Egan, who went down to do the training, 
was the man that L would have picked. He 
was probably the most disputable of the 
bunch because he was pretty volatile. He 
has been condemned for leading the Cuban 
manpower to believe that they were going 
to get more supper~ than he had any right 
to iet them know about. Well, I wasn't 
there, but I know damned well that if I 
had been, I would have been priming up 
the Brigade to do this tough job, not by 
counseling them as to the difficulty of 
it ... at least, exclusively ... or, giving 
them lectures about now you will really 
have to do this on your own, because you 
are not goirig to ~et one iota of assistance 
from the armed forces. You don't normally 
train a group to conduct an operation of 
this sort by playing on ·Eheir fears. If, 
down there at the end of the line -- first 
in Guatemala and then 1n Nicaragua -- Egan 
led them to believe that they were going 
to get them more help than he had any right 
to let them know, well, I can understand 
why that·would have happerted.* 122/
