National Crime lnf ormation Center (NCIC) 
NCIC is a nationwide index of documented law 
enforcement information on crime and criminals .. Its objective 
is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement through the 
more efficient handling and exchange of information. In January, 
• 1967, a pilot operation was begun with terminals in 15 local and 
. state law enforcement agencies. NCIC now has 78 control termi­
nals in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. North 
Carolina and Wyoming will be added in· the near future; however, 
Alaska will be delayed due to very high communication circuit • 
• costs. The files consist of stolen· motor vehicles, license plates, 
firearms, other identifiable stolen property including securities, 
and wanted persons. Over 780,000 rec.ords are in the system and 
more than 33, 000 messages are handled each day. Positive . 
responses to inquiries wherein a record is furnished now exceed 
220 each 24 hours. NCIC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week.
