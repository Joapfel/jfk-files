of support,· indicating U.S. support of the dissidents' efforts 
to overthrow Trujillo. (Dearborn 7/29, pp. 46-48; Owen p. 39) 
c. Failure to Disclose to State Department 
Officials in Washi11gton 
•• There is no iridication that the request or the passilge 
of th~ carbines was disclosed to State Department officials in 
Washington until several weeks after the passage. In fact, on 
April 5, Ileadquarters requested its Station to ask Dearborn 
not to comment in correspondence with State that the carbines 
and ammtini tion were· being passed to t.lae dissidents. This cable 
was sent while Owen was in Washington, and it indicated that 
upon his return to the Dominican R~public, he would explain 
the request. The Station replied that Dearborn had not com­
mented on the carbines and ammunition in his correspondence 
with State and he realized the necessity not to do so.· (Station 
to HQS cable, 4/6/61) 
Dearborn testified, however, that he believed, at the 
time of his April-6 cable, that someone in the State De­
partmeht had been consulted in advance and had approved the 
passage of the carbines (Dearborn 7/29, p. 44)
