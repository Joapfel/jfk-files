to assassinate Castro: 
"The Chairman. 'Since he was on the phone to you 
repeatedly did he ever tell you to kill Castro?' 
"Mr. Helms. 'No.' 
"The Chairman: 'He did not? 1 
"Mr. Helms: 'Not in those words , no. '" (Helms, 
7/11, p.13):_; 
* Helms immediately reiterated after this exchange that his perception of 
authority for a Castro assassination rested on the pressure exerted by the 
Administration against Castro. The·exchange between the Chairman and Helms 
6ontinued as follows: 
"'l'he Chairman: 1 Well, did he ever tell you in other words 
that clearly conveyed to you the message that he wanted 
to kill Castro?' 
"Helms: 'Sir, the last time Twas (before the Committee), I 
did the best I could about what I believed to be the parameters 
under which we were working, and that was to get rid of Castro. 
And I don't, I am sorry to say ... see how one would have 
expected that a thing like killing or murderinr:; or assassinatin_£ 
would become part of a large group of people sitting around a • 
table in the United States Government. I can't imagine any 
Cabinet officer wanting to sign off on somethine; like that. I 
can't imagine anybody wanting something in writing saying I 
have just charged Mr. Jones to go out and shoot Mr. Smith."
