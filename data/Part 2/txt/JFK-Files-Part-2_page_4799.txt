Or whatever you want to call it. Ask the poor guys who were on

know·, you• ve got the power of the purse, use it. If you want 
to get into the act of being an executive, goddammit, stop 
paying the President of the United States. Don't send him any 
I . checks. 
INTERVIEWER: I bring this ·up in class. 
MR. HALPERN: Sure. Close his bank account. Take away his 
credit card. Don't give him any money. Close down the White 
House. Paint it black. You know, make up your mind what you 
want to do. If you want to fol low this system, there-' s going 
to be tension between the two branches of government forever. 
And the judiciary sits on the side, and look at the tension 
that was there initially before you had the great decisions 
about whether or not the Supreme Court is going to declare 
something unconstitutional or not. Nobody was sure how that 
was going to work. And that always hasn't worked smoothly 
either. Now we've come to accept it more and more and more and

role of the Supreme C6urt, it wasn't written into the 
Constitution. It developed~ Now as far as executive and 
legislative, nobody has come up with a simple way of handling 
that one.
