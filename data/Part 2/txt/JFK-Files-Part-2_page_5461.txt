from such release. The CIA will conduct the appropriate 
searches to determine whether release would pose national 
security concerns for the us Government or personal safety 
concerns for the individual. In this way, CIA and the Review 
Board can,concentrate their. efforts on individuals who are 
significant figures in the JFK story, expediting the review 
of the sequestered collection~ 
23. CU) It is our hope that the CIA and the Review 
Board can agree on.and work out a mutually acceptable policy 
regarding the identity of CIA employees that will not 
undermine the important principle of protecting those who 
work covertly for the us Government. My staff and I are 
ready to discuss this matter with you at your convenience.
