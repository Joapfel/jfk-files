next week if I have your permission, sir. He wouldn't have 
done that. Because where I particularly remember this, or 
get the feeling particularly strong, is dating back to 
something that Senator Hart mentioned, the U-2 incident. 
Allen Dulles' strong desire was to take the whole responsi-
bility for that, and resign, and be fired in disgrace, 
publically, in aider to protect the President. But the 
President totally refused to accept any such way of handling 
it. 
Mr. Baron. So that says something not only about the 
character of Allen Dulles, but the character of the President? 
Mr. Dillon. Of both, yes. 
Mr. Baron. That the President would be inerested in 
taking responsibility for the orders that he had given? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes. He was very strong that way. And Mr. 
Dulles was so strong in wanting to protect the President that 
he was willing to go out in disgrace, public disgrace after 
ten years or more of service to the Government, just to pro-
tect the President, although there was nothing that he had 
responsibility for, primar~:~esponsibility. 
Mr. Baron. From your knowledge of Special Group meetings 
and minutes, it is your reading of this sentence that "it 
was finally agreed that planning for the Congo would not 
necessarily rule out consideration of any particular kind 
of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lurnurnbaw
