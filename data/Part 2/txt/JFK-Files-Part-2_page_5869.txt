disposition of JFK Assassination-related records held by CIA 
which are not already at the National Archives, and the 
terms under which those records to be declassified will be 
dealt with.

collection, the Russ Holmes files and the LA Division 
working files;

1978 201 file; Oswald's 201 file and security file and

JFK Act; any new documents on Oswald will be added to the 
post-1978 part of his 201 file.

the Future Treatment of Assassination Records".
