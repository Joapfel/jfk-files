~'bums" in the photograph with the police officer. No photograph of Vallee was 
available for comparison in this regard. The. Laboratory made copies of all 
the information furnished by Donahue, and the originals of the photographs and notes 
were rehirned to him on 9-13-74 by Bowers. Donahue had told Canfield he was 
going to have a contact examine the pichtres but did not identify h.is contact. 
Donahue intends to tell Canfield that his contact does not believe the "bums" are 
identical with Hunt and Sturg~s and that he does not want to become involved in this 
matter since he feels it is a situation which should be handled by the FBI. , i
