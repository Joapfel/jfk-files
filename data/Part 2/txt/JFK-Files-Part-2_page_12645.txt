[ light of existing circumstances and available manpower. 
[ a. When information is received that meetings of subversive organiza-
[ tions are to take place, physical surveillances should be considered 
[ to corroborate such information and identify participants. 
[ b. Surveillances of individuals in leadership or underground capacities 
[ serve to identify others within movement.

[ must at all times exercise sound judgment and discretion. Be alert 
[ to observe activity of subject and countersurveillances which may 
[ be used to identify Agents and embarrass Bureau.

[ jects entering or leaving meeting places of subversive organizations af-
[ fords convincing and admissible evidence to establish subversive activ-
( ities. Prior Bureau authority is needed for photographic surveillances.

( gative techniques.to obtain maximum evidence. Conceal equipment to avoid 
[ detection by subjects or other individuals in proximity of ~urveillance.

[ to main case files of individuals involved. Mimeographed form FD-306 
[ may be used provided it is limited to reporting attendance at meetings. 
[ When information from informants or surveillances is channelized to indi-
[ vidual case files, it must be documented. Coordinate information received 
[ from informants and confidential sources with active investigation.

[ serialized, or mutilated in any way which would render them unsat-
[ isfactory for use in Federal proceedings.
