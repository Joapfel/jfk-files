ljom~"time later, Bbb su~gested to an officer 1n the· CIA' s executive suit~ ··ttjj? 
that the Agency should help.the South American country obtain a channel in the 2,. 
international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive· •. J 
operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency shou1d do this, and the other I-{ 
CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, w~s not the American foreign aid program; and 5" 
kether or not this particular country received a Comsat channel did not seem to (. 
be a matter cancer-;= jng CIA. Onl'y later did the execu.tive suite officer learn 7 
from other sources that FI/D had worked out a ~eal with the South American jJ 
\ ' 
countr.y in which 1 iaison would be restored in return ·for a·· comsat channel (which 7 
• CIA ·would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme sten /0 
w.ith a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office. II 
~ventually, the ·south American country received the Comsat channel; the 12 
country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that 
country's s~cret messages;:} 
Bob's job with FI/Dis by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the 
Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who 
probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in 
a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even lies 
within the U.S. government -- not to mention the deceit he and his c.olleagues 
perpetrate on friendly foreign governinents which in good faith enter into 
liaison agreements with FI/D. 
Bob Xis one of these oodinary looking people who mow their lawn. love 
their wives, and do some ve_ry nasty things for the CIA. 
,~ 
few other devoted family men who 1 ived in suburban Washington homes 
similar to Bob X's are named James McCord and EE, Howard Hunt. Both had long, 
relatively successful careers with the CIA and rose to roughly the same upper­
middle level of the bureaucracy as Bob X has. McCord wa_s a CIA security
