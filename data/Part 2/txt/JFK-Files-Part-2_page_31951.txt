girlfriend. HE is completely honest, trustworthy, and dependable, and HE 
has never had a moment of difficulty with law enforcement agencies. When 
SUBJECT'S brother was drafted into the military service SUBJECT was granted 
a deferment in order that HE could assist in supporting the ·f~ily since 
HIS mother was ill. When HIS turn came to be drafted HE did not utter a 
single complaint about going into the Army because HE felt that HE had an 
obligation to go. Source stated that HE would stake his life on SUBJECT'S 
loyalty to the United States. Although he had no knowledge of SUBJECT'S 
father's political or organizational affiliations, Source recalled that he 
occasionally brought home the socialist newspaper, name not recalled, 
and would side with the comments made in the paper that were critical of 
the United States and its policies. On these occasions SUBJECT and HIS 
brother would always argue in defense of the United States, and SUBJECT'S 
father has never been able to influence HIS political thoughts and belief 
in any way. SUBJECT never travelled abroad, aiia is not known to have any 
relatives residing abroad. ·HE uses alcoholic beverages moderately, and 
does not gamble or use habit forming drugs. Source knew of nothing that 
would reflect adversely on MARTI'S character, discretion, maturity, or 
emotional stability, and HE has no organizational affiliations, except 
perhaps some club connected with stamp and coin collection. Source was 
unable to furnish any information concerning SUBJECT's listed character 
references Juanita Reyes and Aleanso Ortiz. Carlos Delgado, SW 33rd Street 
between First and Second Streets, Miami, Florida, is a friend of SUBJECT. 
Rivera highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered 
for a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
