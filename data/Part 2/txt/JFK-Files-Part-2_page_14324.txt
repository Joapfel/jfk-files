tfuen an allegation is received that a group 
may fq.11 within e~isting jurisdicH:.iona1 criteria, FBI 
Headqua~ters is immediat~ly notified and a "preliminary 
investigation
11 
along th0 lines alroa:dy ind!cated. is 
undertaken. Again, approval from FBI IIoadqual'..'ters must 
be obtained to oonti11ue this npreliminnry investigation n 
beyond 90 days to resolve whether juriodiotionnl standards 
ar_§?_met. If mat, a full investigation is conducted 
upon approval by FBI Headquarters. 
Inte~nal security inveotigations are also 
conduoted on the basis of speaifie instructions from 
the. AttQ~noy General (pursuant to Presidential Direotivoo) 
to the Director of the FB:t. until the instruc;r-tion is 
complied. ·with, these matters remain pending. 
Every offort is ma.de to maintain proper 
administrative contxol over domestic S¢ourity invcstigationn 
an<l to ins~re full complio.ntie with th~ law. In this 
tegard, Bure~u rules require Agents to limit investigations 
to ~elevant matters. Supervisory personnel in the Field 
and at n•ax Hoaclquarters :i:evie~t the progress an.d relevancy 
of these investigations, and reports arc fon,arded to 
the Pepart:ment of Justice. Agants also receive l~gal 
instruction on a continuing basis in o~der that they 
may bo fully able to ~eoognize relevanoo and safeguard 
individual rights. 
Those Bureau procedure$ ha.vo been devised 
in an honest effort to car~y out with ma::imUt.\ e:ilfe.ctiveness 
and propriety our vital domaatiq~seourity tesponsibilities. 
Over the yearat the FBI hua handled the$e responsibilities 
and protected the domestic security of our t:tation with 
g:roo.t dedication and, I believe, l'1ith great di,stino.t;i.on,. 
We wiJ.l continue to vigorously oa:,:-ry out. these duties 
with all due ~egard for individual ~ights and liberties, 
I believe the prooedures I have outlined n~e in full 
accord with this purpose.
