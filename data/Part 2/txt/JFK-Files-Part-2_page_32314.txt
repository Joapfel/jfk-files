SUBJECT: Anti-Sabotage Opel":ation» in Latin America 
The Ir.1.te:rdepartt:nental Coordi:t1ating Committee of Cuban 
Affairs (ICCOCA) baa .recently conaide,:ed a ClA ·propoe~l to provide 
guidance to US fix'ms h1 Lactin .Amed<:a con!l'cmted with Castro­
comm~nist il'l:$pired sabotage of their facilities and assets. CIA has 
cont1~a<::ted .fo,: the p-reparaiti.on of a report which will consolidate the 
eJq>erie-.nce!:3 of several US firms in Latin Am,erica .in com.batting 
sab0tageo .After consideration by the lCCOCA this report will be 
furnished through our eount~y teams in Latin America to local US 
firms to assist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage progra..T"O.s. 
l ·would be most grateful if you would prepare a brief repor.t 
designed to supplement tbe CIA project which would include enumel"a. .. 
' tion of general guidelines which might be adopted by US .firms .in the 
Latin Amedeau area in combatting sabotage. In particular, an 
ei:n.imeTation of known approp:riate anti-sabo.tage devic~s available on 
the comme~cia.l market tegether wi:th the manufactuHr's name$ would 
be most helpful .. 
A.·member of my staff hat.l discussed this project with Mr. 
Phelp'S of your stat£. who hae indicated that ll)ll)R&E n:ught be of assist­
ance .in this .matter based O.ll a. recent :field tdp to Vene&Uela where 
·p:robl~m"l!I peculiar to th.at area were l!)tudied at the reqU:est of the US 
Ambassador. It is also possi.ble tllat cemmercial devices develot)ed 
.for South Vietnam would have .applicabillty in L<!!,tin Ameri<:a.. Because 
this pr:ojecct is designed fo.l!'. distribution to- several Latin American 
·eountri,es, it is requeeted ~t where po8sibl.e guidel;i,ne.s be developed 
which might have general all)plie.atlon throughout L~tin .AmC;:rlca,. but 
v,i.th emphasis on key subversi~ target areas. PrErsent plans antici­
:pate fmalization of this projec:t' by December 23, 1963.
