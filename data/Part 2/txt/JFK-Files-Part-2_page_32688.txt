VII. CONCLUDING STATEMENT 
SECRET 
- 34 -
Barring some development which ia unforeseen at this time, the public 
debate will probably continue as to whether missiles and other strategic 
weapons are now based in Cuba and as to the number of Soviet troops being 
maintained there. These things are certainly of undeniable importance. The 
matter of basic and fundamental importance, however, and the source of the 
real threat, is that international communism now has a firm foothold in this 
hemisphere and that, if we permit it to do so, it is here to stay. 
The Soviets are in Cuba primarily for the purpose of increasing and 
spreading communism's influence and power in Latin America and we can be 
sure that they will exploit their foothold to the greatest extent possible. 
The paramount danger at this time is that the nations of this hemisphere may 
be subverted one by one and be exploited, in turn, for subversive and revolu­
tionary activities. By this process of erosion our neighbors to the South may 
fall nation by nation until the entire hemisphere is lost and the Communist 
goal of isolating the United States has been attained. 
Communism, of course, operates on a world-wide scale and its methods . 
and techniques are always adapted to the environment in which it operates. 
With this in mind, the value to the USSR of the occupation of Cuba is apparent, 
The techniques of communist subversion may vary from simple infiltration to 
violent intervention. Whatever its form, however, in Cuba as elsewhere it is 
conceived, developed and perfected by the leaders of world communism for the 
purpose of furthering their concept of world domination. Its aim and goal is 
to destroy existing political, economic and social orders and to replace them 
with new and dictatorial regimes which ;presuppose the complete physical and 
moral control of subjugated peoples.
