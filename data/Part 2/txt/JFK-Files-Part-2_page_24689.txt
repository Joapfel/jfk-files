Ainold Silver had not previously tise4 
QJWIN as an assassination capability or 
even viewed him as such. (Harvey affi­

. Although Harvey also had discussions with Sidney Gottlieb in connec­

.to him either QJ'WIN is· activities in the Congo or Gottlieb' s own 
trip to Leopoldville (Harvey affidavit, p. ) . Harvey had con-
suited with Arnold Silver about the initiation of.Project ZRRIFLE 
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 52). 
The Chief of Station in Leopoldville testified that he had 
never heard of Project ZR.RIFLE, nor was he aware of any. CIA project 
to develop the capability of assassinating foreign leaders. 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 93.) Furthermore, Hedgman said that he ·was 
"quite certain" that he never discussed assassination capabilities 
or assets with Harv~y at any time. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) 
Hedgman testified that Arnold Silver came to the Congo on a counter­
intelligence mission during his tenure, but they did not •discuss 
the plan to assassinate Lumumba. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 92.)

and the. inhe.rent predicament for an intelligence agency that employs. 
hoodlums is found in a cable from CIA headquarters to Arnold Silver 
in 1962. The CIA had learned that QJWIN wtis about to go on trial 
in Europe on smuggling charges. The cab le· sugr;es ted:
