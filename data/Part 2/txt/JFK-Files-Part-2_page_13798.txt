F. Clandestine Informant Activities 
"The Coremittee is examining-all aspects of the 
FBI'p use of informants, sources, and undercover 
.personnel and the techniques employed by such per­
sons. Although informants are the s~ngle most 
productive source of intelligence information, the 
difficulties of controlling their activities may

·accomplishment of legitimate objectives.
