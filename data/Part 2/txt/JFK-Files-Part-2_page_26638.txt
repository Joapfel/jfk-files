Fleet Modernization 
The new Polaris-type sub­
marine--designated the Y-class-­
carries 16 SS-N-6 ballistic mis­
siles with ranges of some 1,500 
miles. These 425-foot-lon~ sub­
marines_ are currently being built 
at severodvinsk in the Soviet 
Northern Fleet area. The first 
units should be operational soon 
and 40 or more could be in serv­
ice by the mid-1970s. 
,Two new classes of nuclear­
powered attack submarines are 
also being built--one at Lenin­
grad shipyard and the other at 
Gorkiy. At least one of these 
classes probably was specifically 
designed to engage enemy subma­
rines. A third class of attack 
submarine is under construction 
in the Soviet Far East; its means 
of propulsion is not yet known. 
In addition to these new con­
struction programs, the Soviets 
are reconditioning many of their 
older classes of submarines. 
There are no indications that 
the Soviets intend to introduce 
a new class of cruise-missile 
submarine, however, and con-
struction of these submarines 
is apparentiy ending as the 
Soviets approach their desired 
force level for these anticar­
rier units. 
Operational Implications 
Strategic targets in the 
middle of the US are beyond 
reach of the 650-mile SS-N-5 
carried on the older ballistic­
missile submarines, but are 
within range of the SS-N-6 
carried on the Y-class. By 
the mid-1970s, Soviet ballis­
tic-missile submarines may 
present a strategic threat com­
parable to that of the US Polaris 
fleet and be able to operate with 
less risk of detection than 
earlier classes of Soviet mis­
sile submarines. 
The introduction of the new 
classes of attack submarines 
suggests that the Soviets are 
attempting to come to grips 
with the Polaris threat. The 
Soviets apparently are counting 
on their submarines to help 
blunt that threat by attempting 
to destroy Polaris submarines 
before they can launch their 
missiles. 
Soviet ballistic-missile 
submarines frequently patrol 
within range of US Polaris 
bases and could destroy a num­
ber of Polaris submarines by 
attacking these bases. The 
new Soviet attack submarines 
may be able to locate and de­
stroy a few Polaris submarines 
in confined waters through which 
those submarines frequently 
must pass, such as the Irish 
Sea or the Sicilian Straits. 
Combined operations with new 
Soviet surface ships, such as 
the Moskva-class helicopter car­
riers and Kresta- and Kashin­
class guided-missile ships, 
will provide some antisubmarine 
capability in the ocean approaches
