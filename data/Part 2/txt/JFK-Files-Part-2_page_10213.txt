MEMORANDUM.FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Generah Office of Security Survey 
1. At the Dir.ector's instruction, and with the concurrence 
o! the then DD/P, the Office oi Secur 1ity developed infor1:lants in 
RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security 
questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a 
dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of 
three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current 
interest. 
z. The principal_ object of Security's ,interest through this 
informant is· a female who was employed in RID ~or a number of years 
until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation· 
of a security review on her by the Office 0£ Security, but Security does 
not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at 
the time of her resignation. 
3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by 
reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance 
with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also 
being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have 
an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub­
sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among 
clerical and secretarial cmployee.s (?f the Agency. Among these 
employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division. 
4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID 
employee entered into a common-law marital re.lationship with the . lf./'· 
Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this \"' 
capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially • / • • 
those requiring passpol:"t photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought 
to·employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.
