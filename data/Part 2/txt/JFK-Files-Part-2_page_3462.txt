This would suggest that Angleton may h~ve lacked the 
opportunity that others had had to observe the kinds of 
behavior soviet defectors have displayed in soning out who 
the i~portant players are in matters affecting their future, 
and figuring out'how to deal with them.* 
--In the eyes of some who knew hi~, Angleton viewed 
himself more as chief of an operational entity than of a 
staff. Few gave him high marks as an effective staff, as 
opposed to operations, officer. His secret travels in 
western Europe, not to ~ention to Israel, to meet with 
senior liaison officials with whom he had developed 
confidential relationships constituted a form of independent 
operational activity. The proposal, ultimately stillborn, 
in 1965 for Angleton to develop special counterintelligence 
units in Vietnam•• displayed certain parallels with his 
conduct of counterintelligence abroad as Chief of the CI 
staff in the way in which the local station would be 
effectively eut out and command channel and co111munications 
would run direct to counterintellige.noA headqUarters in 
WaGhington. The proposed special counterintelligence (SCI) 
units for Vietnam were modeled af~ar SCI units employed by 
x-2, the counterintelligence arm of the wartime oss--where 
Angleton began his intelligence career. Perhaps those early 
experiences shaped in some way Angleton'& later preference 
I 
for conducting counterintelligence--by himself, without 
involve~ent of the area divisions and stations .
