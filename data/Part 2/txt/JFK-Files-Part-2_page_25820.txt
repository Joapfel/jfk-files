Thank you for ·writing to me regarding your knowledge of 
the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. I understand 
that you have discussed these questions at length with members 
of the Committee staff. 
On March 1 the Committee reported S._ Res. 400 creating 
a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities. The legislation 
which was before us concerned only the establishment of a new 
cong:r:."essi.onA.l committee; it did not involve· revisions that. ·would 
significantly modify the structure or the powers of the CIA it­
self. The Committee has not been authorized to hire additional 
staff personnel for the pur-pose of this legislation. Further­
more, we were under instructions from the Senate. to report out a. 
formal recommendation in the.form of legislation by March 1. 
I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you 
have made because, if true,. they represent grave examples of 
corruption and criminality. It is my hope and intent that the 
new committee created by the legislation we are co·nsidering, 
once it is established, will have the juri-sdiction and the re­
sources to explore the kind of issues which you raise. 
I assure.you that the entirety of the information you 
have submitted to my committee will b~ made available to the 
new Congressional oversight connnittee. 
I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern­
ment Operations. Committee which prevent us- from undertaking the 
investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material 
you submitted to the new corrrrnittee as soon as it is established.: 
For your information, I am enclosing a copy of S. Res. 
400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure. 
Sincerely, 
Abe.Ribicoff
