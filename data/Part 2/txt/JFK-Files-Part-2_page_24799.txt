Late in the evening of May 30, 1961, Trujillo was ambushed 
-
and assassinated near San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. The 
assassination closely paralleled the plan disclosed by the 
action group to American representatives in the Dominican Republic 
and passed on to officials in Washington at both the CIA and 
the State Department. (Dearborn cable to State, 5/30/61) The 
assassination was conducted by members of the action group, to 
whom the American carbines had been passed, and such sketchy 
information as is available indicates that one or more of the 
carbines were in the possession of the assassination group when 
Trujillo was killed. (I. G. Report, pp. 60-61). This evidence indicate 
however, that the actual assassination was accomplished by 
handguns and shoto:lms. (I.G. Report, p.61)
