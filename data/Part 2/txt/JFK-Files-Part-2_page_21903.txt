(d) i::p;ent QJ\H~·l Has Asked Ev Hedgman' s Operative WIROGUE 
to Join an "Execution Squad": December 1960 
The one incident where there is an explicit reference to 
assassination in connection with QJWHl involved his contact with 
HIROGUE, another asset of the Congo station. 
HIROGUE was an "essentially stateless" (Europea~)who was 
" a forger and former bank robber" t~d had' fought. with the French 
Foreign Legion) (Inspector General Memorandum, 3/14/75.) He was 
' / 
sent to ~he Congo after being given plastic surgery and a toupee 
by the CIA so that he would not be recognized by Europeans traveling 
through the Congo. (I.G. Memorandum, 3/14/75.) WIROGUE was 
assessed by the CIA as a man who "LEARNS QUICKLY Ai'ID CARRIES OUT 
.ANY ASSIGUNENT WITIIOUT REGARD FOR DANGER" (CIA Cable (oUT 36554.i 
\. / 
Africa Division to Leopoldville, 10/27/60). 
The ~hie£ of/ Station described WIROGE as "a man with a 
rather unsavory reputation, who would try anything once, at least." 
(Hedgman, 3/21/75, p. 96.) Hedgman used him as "a general utility 
agent" because "I felt we needed surveillance capability, develop­
ing new contacts, various things." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96.) 
Hedgman supervised WIROGUE directly.and did not put WIROGUE in 
touch_with0ustin O'Donnel3/, (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.) 
A report on agent WIROGUE, prepared for the CIA Inspector 
General's office in 1975, .described the training and tasking he 
received:
