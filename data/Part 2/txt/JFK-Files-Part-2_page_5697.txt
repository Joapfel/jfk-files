(S) Required Protection of Warrenton Training Center 
as CIA Facility 
our covert foreign stations and bases, and, also 
processes a significant volume of highly sensitive 
message traffic for the White House and the Secretary of 
State. 
5. (S) As detailed on the attached annotated photographs, 
WTC and its four constituent stations are a critical ·support 
element for the clandestine intelligence collection mission of 
the CIA and the.United States. Whether sending a message to a 
covert foreign national asset in Havana, or receiving a message 
from the CIA Chief of Station in Moscow,.or supporting military 
and diplomatic representatives in Bosnia,· WTC is a key element in 
that effort. Moreover, it is extremely vulnerable to physical 
attack because of the proximity of uncontrolled public roads and 
spaces. Accordingly, and as considered in more detail in 
paragraph 6 below, any affiliation of WTC with the CIA, no matter_ 
how insignificant the individual occurrence or document release· 
may seem, has the very real potential to jeopardize lives, 
negatively affect the Agency mission, and thereby do irreparable 
harm to the national security of the United States. 
6. (S) But in addition to this established mission and 
extant risks, there are new activities at WTC :i.,n direct support 
of the nation's leadership which must be considered -­
specifically, the establishment of the Director of Central 
Intelligence (DCI) Emergency Relocation Site (ERS), and an 
alternative ERS site for the Secretary of State. WTC has been 
chosen to be the primary DCI ERS given its location, 
communications, information services, and life support 
capabilities. Needless to say, the fact that.WTC is not an 
officially recogniz~d CIA facility adds a dimension of secrecy 
which will be needed to enable the DCI to continue his .work 
during any emergency situation. Additionally, active 
consideration is being given to.also designating.WTC'as the
