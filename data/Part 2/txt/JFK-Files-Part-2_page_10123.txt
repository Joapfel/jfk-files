a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL 
BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadmoor Hotel, and whom he 
eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM. He stated that TANNENBAUM 
immediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and 
: Immigration connections,·and advised her that she cculd arrange 
to get her a passport-to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia. He 
stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that ·TANNENBAUM 
~ had recently approached her with a letter written in English 
purportedly from THOMAS RIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was 
asked by TAHNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakian, and 
that he eventually received this letter postmarked from somewhere 
: in Canada. He felt at the time he received the letter that it had 
not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BDL~KOVA 
that the letter was a hoax, he began to feel thaL TANNENBAUM was 
a fraud and that his uncle's disappearance could have been for 
reasons other than marital discord. He stated that imJneidately 
after being told o~ the letter by BDLIKOVA in October, 1969, he 
filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, ColoradG Police 
Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw 
TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the 
Boulder Police Department. 
With regard to CERVENY's association with GALYA 
TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she t~~d him 
that she would like to recruit him into Milita~y Intelligence, as 
his engineering background and language ability would be 11e~tremely 
useful to us." She also told him that if he were in the United 
States "working for the other si~e," she would shoot him. TANNEN­
BAUM also told CERVENY that she had originally met THOMAS RIHA in 
Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he follo,-1ed her for th'.! 
purpose of marrying her; however, the marriage did not take place 
as RIHA was unable to get along with her children. He stated that 
upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that 
TANllENBAUM was connected in some official cape.city witb the Un:.ted 
States Government, and that there was something in their relation-· 
ship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM sorr.e type of influence over the 
actions of his uncle; however, in conversation wi~h bc~h hi~ ~nclc
