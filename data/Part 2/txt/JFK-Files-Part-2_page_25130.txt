OCCUH!U:i✓ CE: Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any 
religious flag--either the Budclh~st or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National 
Vietnamese flag in public places :or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the 
Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6? 1963 made . 
possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been ~ene:"ally viewed as anti­
Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earher m D~ Nang by the 
exce~sive ~se by Ca~holics of th~ flag of the vati~an with the Na~~-~~~ll?ietnamese flag 
on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number. (9,J}·:<:\;C \1,,

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that the catalyst that brought down the DIEM regirre was their 
antagonism of the Buddhists. He explained that 80% of the Vietnarrese people clairred to be 
Buddhists. /.\nd that DIEM led a Catholic regirre and that this drove people, particularly 1n. 
light of MADAME NHU's staterrents to the effect that she'd like to furnish sorre mustard at 
a bonzes barbecue, or sorrething to that effect. 'lhis made people want to identify themselve: 
against the regirre and so they would go back to the pagodas. CONEIN did not know whether or 
not this becarre the principal reason for the United States wanting to get rid of the regiITE.
