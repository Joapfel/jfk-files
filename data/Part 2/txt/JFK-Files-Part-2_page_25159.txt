CCURRENCE: ,, . . 6 During the period between 21 August and the lifting of ITE.rshall law on l 
September, GENERAL DINH actually considered himself the hero of Vietnam and the savior of 
the DIEM regirrl2. DINH, on approximately 31 August had the audacity to inform both President 
DIEM and counsel+or NHlI t~_t he was their' savior and requested a ministerial post for himsell 
NHU' s reaction was to order him to Dalat for a rest." During this period of time, DINH 
realized that he had been played for a dupe by DIEM. 'Ihe generals would recognize this fact 
and GENERAL OON started playing on DINH' s vanity by telling him that he was a real hero and 
that, above all, should have been thanked by DIEM and NHU for saving the government.
