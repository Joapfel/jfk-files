,;c~tcr'' as ind ic,, .:ive of racis c America. The National Congress of A1nerican 
I~dians opposes u~is distortion of history. Bcatinss and murder of Indians 
1.n is•iaine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land 
1·e servat ions to state jnr isd ic tlon. In actuality, this rides established 
i:ribal courts and federal jt!risdiction. It r;ives local bigoted authorities 
uiore orportunii:y to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties 
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land. 
It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier 
in Viet Nam. In ~he three years before 1s~1, more Indian children below the 
aGe· of lC had died in this country than the 6,623 u. s. combat casualties of 
tl '? entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children 
beiow the age of six. 
The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in 
school, over television, in·cartoons; the Indian has become .a jo~<e. to white 
Americans_. We pay because we don't know our own history. 
f The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history 
of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go 
deep into their history in ·finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some 
Ne3ro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as havin3 raised the same is~,e cf 
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for .400 years. 
The Indian people have been send in~ spo!tesmen to brin 0 their grievances 
and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred 
years. They have fou&ht in the courts since at least 1030 when the case of 
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested t.he ability and the willin~:,ness of the 
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination. 
The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have 
wa6ed a~~ainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understandin~ 
the Viet Nam t-•ar. We respond to what is happenin 0 to Vietnamese children, yet 
the Indian people have snffered from the same policy of extermination and 
destruction of their identity. 
We must unite with the strivincEs of those who have had to deal with 
United States' genocide for 200 years!u 
f 
We can help co push the United States to ratify the United Nations 
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct 
the history and policy of genicide a~ainat the Indian people. Today this 
refers to the destruction of their identity as· a people and lln!:a with the 
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
