capability "in being" to create even large proprieta~ies.* More-
over, numerous "shelf" corporations are kept available to provide 
cover. These latter entities are generally only of the notional 
variety and pose no threat either competitively or in terms of 
domestic activity beyond the Agency's charter. Nonetheless, the 
Agency has emphasized the need to retain this general vehicle for 
at least one purpose: to retain assets. The CCS has indicated 
that a method is needed to keep "good men" who are loyal. but who 
need continuing work in both their ordinary and also somewhat 
byzantine fields. Consequently, proprietaries offer a yiable alter­
native to solve this dilerrana of maintaining assets. 
As a result of this, the Committee studied which proprietaries 
had been sold or otherwise-disposed of during the period from 1965 
to 197 5. - It sought to find out which of those proprietaries so dis­
posed of in the last ten years maintained a significant relationship 
with the Agency by contract or informal understanding for any purpose. 
More specifically. the Committee sought answers to the following 
questions: 
(1) How many proprietaries, by type or function. have been 
dissolved or sold as a going enterprise or otherwise 
disposed of by the Agency? 
* Mr. Nelson closed his recent testimony with a caveat: 
I can visualize, however, depending on what happens to 
the Agency in the future, the possibility that we might 
want to use more proprietaries, particularly in the 
field of cover if this gets terribly tight or terribly 
difficult. But the average operational purpose, except 
for some of these media operations. all we need is cover 
and I think that most of the proprietaries that we have 
fall into that category.
