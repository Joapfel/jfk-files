an individual is a militarr·intelligence agent.would the fact 
of that agency status be -n,)ted and a 201 file opened on that 
individual?· 
Mr. Tovar. I am not ,ure. I would think it would be. 
Again, I .am speculating. [ think almost certainly if I were 
doing a file check on a p-:!rson whose name came from one of 
field stations and it turn,:!d up the fact he was already • .

I think a notation would b,? made in the 201 file. 
Mr. Goldsmith. As a practical matter ·that would be a good!

Mr. Goldsmith. So if someone is an agent of. the CIA, 
would that fact be noted i:1 the ISR? 
i 
Mr. Tovar. No, I don't believe it would. Again, you I i 
can check on that to make -::ertain. Donelly I think can help I 
much better on it. I cann,,t visualize all our sensitive 
being registered there.
