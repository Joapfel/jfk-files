Excerpt from President's Press Conference .:: - A}bril 3 
THE PRESIDENT: As yoi1: know, our best information is 
that they did not come from the United States. We have already 
indicated that we do not feel that these kind of raids serve a 
useful purpose. It seems to me in some ways they s_trengthen 
the Russia·n position 1.n Cuba and the Communist control of Cuba 
arid justify repressive measures within Cuba which might other­
wise rio_t b~ regarded as essential. So that we have not supported 
this and.these men do not have a connection with the United States 
Government. I think a raid which goes in and out does indicate 
the frustrations of Cuban exiles who want to ge~ back home and 
who want to· strike some blow I but I don't thirik that it increases 
t;he· chances· of freeing Cuba.
