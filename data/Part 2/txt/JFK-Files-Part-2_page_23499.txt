EX.ECln'IVE ACTION

me." 
ASSASSINATIONS GENERALLY 
. Gray said that he remembered two mentions of assassination: (1) M1en 
NASSAR was riding high, someone at the planning board said "we ought to bump 
him off". But Gray said this was not a serious discussion .. Assassination was 
not an option that went to the President. (2) At the PFIAB meetings, one 
member consistently would ask the CIA "about bumping off the leadership in 
Hanoi". Gray did not think this was a serious suggestion. Gray said the 
member who suggested this is "well-known" and he ,✓as reluctant to provide the 
name to us. 
"I followed closely any covert operations I was interested in." Gray said 
that "if I had known of any assassination attempt, I probably would have called" 
the responsible official to stay abreast. He said he didn't know of any such 
attempts.
