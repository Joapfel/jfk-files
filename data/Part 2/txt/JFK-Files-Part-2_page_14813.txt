· Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe 
•• streets and Crime Control Act'')- -but with considerable changes_.. One amend­
. ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police 
training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter 
• has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee. . 
Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine 
their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and 
add this to H. R. 5037. • •

(5) Latest two issues of "Lite" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith, 
former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well 
as their political affiliations, and the n-ead {or electronic surveillances to cope 
with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qual~ying

Section of Department.. ) .

Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs 
~rvice that the' Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart' s 
activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys 
•. and others on the "task force" ·appeared at the police department and "took over" 
entire investigation. "Task force" was _so inept that it "blew" the case against 
Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and 
associates. Although Reinhart' s gambling activities were across state lines fr.om. 
New. York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were 
,brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force" 
be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.
