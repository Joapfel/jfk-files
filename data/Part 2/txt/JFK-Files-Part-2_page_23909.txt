actual assassination plots against Castro already undertake~ by the 
CIA (Ilissell, 6/11/75, p. L,7; _7/2.2/75, p. 31). llissell was "quite 
certain" that he.would not have exrected llundy lo mention the 
executive action carability to the President. (llissell, 7/22/75, 
p. 35)·. ·Bissell testified:
