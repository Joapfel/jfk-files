4. REPORT OF FINDINGS 
(NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK) On 24 October 1968, Hortense Mosko, 
Housewife, who resides at 1201 University Avenue, Bronx, New York 10452, 
was interviewed in her residence concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has 
known SUBJECT for approximately three years stated substantially as follows: 
Source has been casually acquainted with SUBJECT and HIS family 
as neighbor~t'f;,0since 1965 when MARTI and HIS parents moved into apartment 1 E 
adjacent to Source; however, her contact with SUBJECT and HIS family had 
been limited to a neighborly greeting whenever they met in the hallways of 
the building. Source saw SUBJECT frequently prior to HIS induction in the 
United States Army. 
_.,-,,·· SUBJECT and HIS family were described as very quiet, friendly 
neighbors whose conduct in the neighborhood was~ above reproach. Source had\ 
no knowledge concerning SUBJECT'S educational background, employment or 
pr~vious residence. 
MARTI appears to be of excellent character, and Source knew of 
nothing whichwould reflect adversely on SUBJECT'S character, integrity, 
discretion, honesty, or financial responsibility. HE was not kno_wn to ha,ve 
any difficulty with law enforcement agencies .. SUBJECT'S mother,,given 
name unknown, died almost two years ago. The members of SUBJECT'S family 
keep very much to themselves and do not associate with any of the other 
neighbors in the building. Neither SUBJECT or the other members of HIS 
family were known to engage in any questionable political or 0ther activity 
in the neighborhood, and Source had no reason to doubt or question SUBJECT'S 
loyalty to the United States. Source had no knowledge of SUBJECT'S organi­
zational affiliationsri)0!' foreign travels. Source was unable to suggest any­
one who may have knowledge of SUBJECT. 
Mosko recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for a position 
of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
