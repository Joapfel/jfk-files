The cable traffic after the assassination confuses 
this point rather than clarifies it. This will be de~lt 
with in more detail in a _subsequent section. An examina­
tion of documents in Lee Harvey Os~ald's Mexico City Sta­
tion P file and.the cable traffic fr6m Mexico City to 
Headquarters after the assassination, raised a possibility 
that it least one tape ·of Cswald's voic~ existed as late 
as 16 October 1963. 614/ 
Assuming that the 10/1/63 call in which an individual 
identifies himself as "Lee Oswald" WJS handled in an ex­
pedited manner~ the tape ard the_transcripl would have 
been in the Station by th-e following day·at the latest. 615/ 
If the tape had been held 1·or the norm~l two-week reten-
tion period, it would have been erased on or-about 16. 
October. The tape from the 9/28/63 conversation would 
hav.e probably been in the ~-tation by the first or second_
