TOP SECRET 'SENSITIVE Attachments -3-
Mrs. Davis also said that Justice made reference to Walt Ro stow' s recollection 
of a general survey of all "intelligence programs country by country" made by 
the 303 Committee. I assume he means the general beginning-of-a-new­
President' s-term roundup (similar to the ones given Mr. Nixon and Mr. Ford). 
We find references to covert action reviews, but these appear to have been oral 
and we find nothing i.n writing, and no references to mail operations. 
In summary, we have made a review of our files, with special reference to the 
general index of minutes and the country files deemed most likely to include 
references to "any use ·of mail techniques." Representative findings are cited 
above. We firid no record of "illegal" mail operations being a subject of dis­
cussion or consideration within the 40 Committee and predecessor organizations 
(December 1958 to the pr.esent). However, 'there is evidence that the Committee 
was informed that mail intercept operations were conducted (TAB C-6 ). 
Please advise if any additional material or presentation is desired.
