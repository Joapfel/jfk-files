Senator Schweiker. Let me ask counsel this. 
Can we establish that Philpott did communicate 
Mr. ·Schwarz. Philpott is going to testify on Tuesday. 
We have talked to him~He accepts at least one message. There 
are two which purport to be signed by him, and he is not 
sure if he accepted two. 
Senator Schweiker. So, he has accepted one message? 
Mr. Schwarz. He accepted one message, yes. 
Mr. Phillips. You wanted to ask about a meeting. 
Mr. Schwarz. It was a final meeting you had with Helms? 
Mr. Phillips. Yes. 
The death of General Schneider had occurred. And while, 
as we said previously, things had fallen into place according 
to "plan", an egregious plan, it was absolutely my conviction 
that those orders that I had been predicting, which were very, 
very slim, were now~ompletely unacceptable, one reason being 
that the inauguration was going to be in 48 hours -- not the 
18 --inauguration, but the confirmation, and so forth.

And so as I recall, there was a meeting of quite a few 
Broe and Mr. 
Karamessines, and maybe Mr. Flannery, -- no, I guess not, but 
.I do remember thatmeeting going up there and saying, if there 
ever was a chance, it is now finished, ang somebody has got to 
say that it is finished. And so that is what I meant by that 
25 meeting.
