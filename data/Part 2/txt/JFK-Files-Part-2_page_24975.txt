I asked if he would be willing to Eay this under swoni testisony. 
He said that having gone this far he would, but he cautfoned that 15 
years had pass€d end he could not vouch for the exact wording, although 
his memory of the in1pact of the meeting is firm. 
Hr. Johnson colkd one hctlr ofter the meeting saying th-:it upon 
reflection, be would prefer not to testify if at all possible u..11less it 
,,-as absolutely esoEntial. He. fears retribution, saying that such 
testmonies in the post have blackballed people who were interested in 
working for the government. Af!Jlin, he cited people -who hod teotified 
for the right cause such as the Dodd case. He said he ,,ould testify 
if it were aeer:.1ed to be absolutely necessary but be uiltl.tlant to raise 
this question.
