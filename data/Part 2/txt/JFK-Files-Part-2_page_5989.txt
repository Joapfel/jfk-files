In conducting a· search for the above information, the 
DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title, 
"Mexico City, Mexico." We forwarded the entire contents of 
that folder for the period 24 May 1961 to 10 June 1965, with 
one exception. Three Operational Monthly Reports were 
forwarded to the Board. The dates covered were 1-30 September 
1963; 1-31 October 1963; and 1-30 November 1963. The 
attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was 
not included. It was a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish, 
between two individuals talking about office procedures. No 
substantive information was exchanged during this 
conversation. 
The DS&T also conducted a search of OTC records. This 
office would have inherited the Division D records of the 
Directorate of Operations (DO) . We reviewed old DO Records 
Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder­
inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests 
since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO 
system. We forwarded for the Board's review the six Records 
Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959 
to 1962. We advised the Board that Records Center records 
indicated the records' disposition as follows: 
1. 59-S-477: Destroyed September 1977. 
2. 60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980. • 
3. 60-S-402: Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977. 
4. 61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March 
1972; three boxes destroyed, May 1980. 
5. 62-S-885: Destroyed (no date given). 
6. 62S000986R: Transferred to the Office of SIGINT Operations 
(DS&T). 
These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the· 
possession of OTC that are in the time frame relevant to the 
JFK assassination. As their descriptions indicate, they do 
not appear relevant to the request.
