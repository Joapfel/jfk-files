serve very little purpose and expose the United 
States to great danger of association with 
assassination attempt."

VII .. May 30, 1961 and Immediately Thereafter: 
A. Trujillo Assassinated 
(State Dept. 
Late in the evening of May 30, l96l, Trujillo was ambushed 
and assassinated near San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. The 
assassination closely paralleled the plan disclosed by tne 
action group to American representatives in the Dominican Republic 
and passed on to officials in Washington at both the CIA and 
the State Department. (Dearborn cable to State, 5/30/61) The 
assassination was conducted by members of the action group, to 
whom the American carbines had been passed, and such sketchy 
information as is available indicates tha_t one or more of the 
carbines were in _the possession of __ t:_he assa_ssination group when 
Trujillo was killed. (I. G. Report, pp. 60-61). This evidence indicate 
however, thit the actual assassination was accomplished by 
handguns and shot.o;uns. (I.G. Report, p.Gl)
