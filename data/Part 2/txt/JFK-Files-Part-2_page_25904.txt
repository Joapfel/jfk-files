In either the s·ecoJJlt.or possibly a. third ·conversation f"J', . 
with Bennett, he told ml\ha t Giancana had now. checked out 
i of the hotel and was either on his way back· to his home in 
Oak Park;- Illinois, or with his daughter in California. He 
provided me with the telephone number of the daughter in 
California and suggested I obtain Giancana's home number from 
the information directoty,in Illinois. 
The telephone convei~ations with Bennett occurred, to 
: I 
the best of my recollecii~n, during the w~ek of June 16, 1975. : • 
It is possible, h_owever, that the first conversation occurred 
later in the week of June: 9. It is my recollectioo that my 
second telephone conversation with Bennett occurred on Thurs­
day June 19. In any even~, I am certain that I attempted to· 
contact Giancana by telephone on Thursday~ Jurie 19. I was 
unable to. get anyone to ~J1swer the telephone in California 
I,' 
I 
and did not have an opporituni ty to attempt to obtain the 
;·•1·: 
Illinois number. I learn~d Friday, June 20 that Giancana had 
been shot and killed in his home in Oak Park, Illinois on 
the evening of June 19.
