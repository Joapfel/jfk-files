We received ·this afternoon, 5/9/75 r frmn1 Mrs. S'tfsan-M-_--'-
Hauser of the Deputy Attorney General's Office, the following 
data: 1) informal note from Doug Marvin to the Deputy. Attorney 
1 General re: Senator Hart's meeting with the Attorney General 
5/6/75; 2) letter to Senator Hart by the Attorney General dal:ed 
5/7/75 advising that Hart's oral request for access to his FBI 
file will be treated as coming under the FOIA; and 3) a memoran-­
dum from for files dated 5/6/75 that appears to have been 
dictated by the Attorney General in which he sets forth pertinent 
information concerning his meeting with Senator Hart. The Attorney 
General points out that he will treat Hart 1 s oral request as • 
coming under the FOIA although he did not know whether the 
Senator should in fact make this request in writing (actually, 
the Code of Federal Regulations, of course, points out that FOIA 
requests must be in ·writing). 
According to the Attorney General's memorandum, Senator.~ 
Hart· • indicated that he was not trying to make a particular "-._ 
point 3,nd did not ·want to go to court, but rather felt it would 
be helpful to members of the Senate Select Committee, who wanted 
' to do it, to see what an FBI file was like, and he felt that by ~· 
seeing- his own file it would raise less problems than trying to -
see someone else's file. ·.,..,,,,,-~ 
/ f} '--s--··; ~...., In view of the .Attorney General's letter to Senator .. v t 
Hart of 5/7/75 advising him that his oral request will be processed!'­
under the }"'OIA, the FOIA Section will immediately institute the f'-... 
processing of this request. However, unless advised to the 
contrary, it is intended that Senator Hart rs request will be put • ,.' 
1 in chronological order and will receive no special treatment. It •, • :f~-
1 should also be noted that Senator Hart is under th0 mistaken . }~ 
, belief that as a S<;nator, and particul~rly as a me~1ber of the. , -~,..,.fil 
I Senate Select Cofllmittee, he could receive an FBI fJ_le ,Qfl- .2. ,th·irtlr::,,•· ~
