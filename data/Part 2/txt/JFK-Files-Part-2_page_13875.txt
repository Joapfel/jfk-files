Dear Mr. Attorney General°: 
Thank you for your letters ·of May 17 and May 23, 
1975, informing the Select Committee of five additional 
COINTELPRO-type operations disclosed by the continuing FBI 
review of its counte:rintelligence files. The Committee ap­
preciates your candor in disclosing the sensitive aspects of 
these programs. Pursuant to its rules, the ·committe~ wi11· 
handle this information with the necessary security. 
I have been informed that a member of the Commit­
tee staff has inspected and taken notes on the 39-page 
report of the Petersen committee on COINTELPRO. I believe 
that our security arrangements are more than sufficient to 
safeguard the confidentiality of its contents. The Commit­
tee members themselves as well as the staff would be con­
veriienced by its availability in our secure facilities. 
I believe that it is· vitally important for the Com­
mittee to be provided with Appendices A through E of that 
report. These documents will also be :tiandled according to 
our stringent security arrangements. In addition, Appendices 
Kand L should be made available for inspection by designated 
Committee staff at the Department of Justice. I understand 
that these appendices are not "raw files" of the FBI.
