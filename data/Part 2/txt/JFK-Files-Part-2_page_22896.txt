.'the· Constitution· that we ware .p.icturing 
Dr. King as a moral leader and.something of a hero and.then this 
agent went on to talk in great detail about Dr. King's personal 
life which he claimed he had learned from a confidential source, 
and our interest in interviewing.this agent obviously relates 
to the circumstances surrounding that visit to a newspaperman, 
who dir~cted him to do that, what the purpose of that visit 
was, whether there was any· documentation --
Senator Daker. Who was the newspaper man? 
Mr. Epstein. His name was Eugene·Patterson and he was 
with the Atlanta Constitution at that tim~. He's now with a 
newspapdr in Flor~da. 
Th~ Chairman. Do you believe the subpoena now to be 
necessary because.of what you have bee~told by the Justice I 
Department? j. 
Mr. Elliff. Ne have other aqents which we would like to 
proceed with at the interview level, so we would like to procee. 
at both levels to get their reaction to both types of requests. 
What is their reaction to a subpoena goinq to be, what is 
their rdaction to a renewed request to interview goinq to be? 
So we crystallize each issue. 
Senator Tower. I still think it might be good for us to 
hold that up until we.talk about it, since they are coming in 
Tuesday .morning or Tuesday sor.ietime, it's not going to push 
'things too far.
