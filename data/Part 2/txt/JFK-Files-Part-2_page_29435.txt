(g) Format of Transcripts 
c.. 
The format of the t~anscripts that Mi. Tarasoff 
produced was much the same as those of the Spanish 
language transcripts des~ribed a~oye.2i4/ Mr. 
Tarasoff's tr~nscripts wer~ from Russian into English.295/ 
Many of Mr. Tarasoff'~ tra1scriptions bear the notation 
• : '~,, -
"(previously transcribed)" after the meter number 
re f e r r i n g to t he re e l f o o t :1 g e 1 o c a t i o:n o f a 
conversation.297/ Mr. Tar:1soff indicated that this 
notation meant th~t- the conversation had already been 
transcribjd from a tap on :1nother embassy phone: 
"Previously transcrioed"· means, for instance, 
1 went· to_ the embassy first ·and the embassj 
·number.was 605055. Now this number 501264 
bel·onged to the filrr's office. So cons~quently 
if that particular :all went out of the main 
building to the fil~s office and it had been 
transcribed before, that is exactly what I 
would_do, put down "previously transcribed". 
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/
