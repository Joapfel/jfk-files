C. The need for a statute. Commendable and welcome as they are, .these 
CIA directives are not sufficient. Administrations change, CIA directors ch~nge, 
and someday in the future what was. tried in the past may once again beco~ea tempt­
ation. Assassination plots did happen. It would be irresponsible for us not to do 
all that we can do to prevent their happening agaih. Laws express our s6ciety'~ 
values; they deter those who might be tempted and stiffen the will of those who 
want to resist. 
The statute we recommend, which is printed as an appendix to this report,; 
makes it a criminal offense for persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States 1) to conspire, within or outside the United States, to assassinate a 
foreign official; Z) to attempt to assassinate a foreign official, or 3) to assas­
sinate a foreign official. 
Present law makes it a crime to kill, or to conspire to kill, a foreign 
official or foreign official guest while such a person is in the United States. 
18 U.S. C. 1116; 18 U.S. C. 1117. However, there is no law which- makes i.t a crime 
to assassinate, or to conspire or attempt tb assassinate, a foreign official 
while such official is outside the United States. Our proposed statute is thus 
designed to close this gap in the law. 
Subsection (a) of the proposed statute would punish conspiracies formed 
within the United S~ates; sJbsection (b) punishes conspiracies outside of the 
United States. Subsection (b) is:i necessary to eliminate the loophoie which would 
otherwise permit persons to simply leave the United States and conspire abroad. 
Subsections (c) and (d), respectively, make it an offense to attempt to kill or 
to kill a foreign official outside the,United States. 
Subsections (a) through (d) specifically apply to any "officer or employee 
of the United States" to make clear that t.he statute punishes conduct by U.S.
