following recommendations are submitted with.reference to the points r---
raised by Mr. Katzenbach: · 
1. fusofar as making a formal approach to the Soviet Government, 
we believe this undesirable. Such a formal request from the United States 
will enable the Russians to put out an official statement entirely favorable 
to them. The United States will have to ace(j,let this, since it is in response 
to our formal request, and we wo.'1 't be in a position to disprove it. The 
state Department has responsibility here and we should not dictate the 
position they are to take, but our views should be stated. 
·[ 
2. fu connection with the investigation in Mexico, it is · !,,,... 
recommended Katzenbach be ·informed that the State Department and i,· 
Central futelligence Agency (CIA) have jurisdiction in dealing with foreign W 
governments and in getting investigative results and intelligence coverage ,_ 
abroad; that wh_He .we a.re cooperating fully wuh State and CIA in Mexico, •,·F--
the responsib1hty m this matter should rest with State and CIA. · ~ ·
