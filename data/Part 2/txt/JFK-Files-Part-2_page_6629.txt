AR.RB Request No. CIA-9 
"Compliance Letter" to DCI, fr. AR.RB 
ExDir, dtd. 27 Nov 1996, (attached) 
1. The attached request was received from the 
Assassination Records Review Board (AR.RB) in March 1996. It 
appears from our records that a copy was not sent to you. 
(Our normal procedure is to provide the appropriate -
Directorate Focal Point a copy of the request as soon as 
received.) This is one of several requests placed on hold 
while we worked on other AR.RB priorities. 
2. In the Agency's response to the 27 November 
"Compliance" letter (see reference), we asked the AR.RB to 
prioritize their requests. The ARRB staff has identified 
CIA-9 as a "priority" request. 
3. The initial request is for access not release. We 
usually limit access to sensitive material to Jeremy Gunn, 
AR.RB General Counsel, and one or two of his staff. If the 
material is particularly sensitive, access is restricted to 
Mr. Gunn and/or the Executive Director of the Board, Mr. 
David Marwell. Gunn, Marwell and all members of the AR.RB 
Staff's CIA team are fully cleared (TS/SCI). 
4. HRG reviewer Jim Hanrahan (~) is the fo~al point 
for this request. Many of the documents described in CIA-9 
were part of eight Executive Order Mandatory Review requests 
(see attachments) from 1994 and 1995. Jim has obtained from 
IP&CRD full-text copies of the documents. He will be in 
touch with you concerning access to these specific 
documents. 
5. Mr. Gunn will be at IP the week of February 24 to 
review documents. Please advise HRG as soon as possible of
