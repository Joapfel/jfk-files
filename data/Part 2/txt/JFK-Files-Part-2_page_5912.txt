during the 
1960-1964 time period? 
Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD 
(Development Products Division) at 1717 H Street or to the 
Communications Center at "L" Street. In addition there 
also was a Q building that received special traffic. 
After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and 
were processed in different areas depending on the 
types of traffic. 
Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor 
for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs 
would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the 
Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat.

Messages came in from the field via the Brandy Station S~ate 
Channels or military channels.

M~ssages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape) 
or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.
