(12) Miss Gandy refers to the fact that questions were 
raised concerning Mr. Hoover's back door entrance. The questions 
concerning this back door were to determine just who used this 
back door entrance and its purpose. In addition to explaining it was 
immediately adjacent to the elevators at 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue 
which Mr. Hoover used to enter and exit the building, they were also 
advised that this was Mr. Hoover's private and personal entrance and 
that persons wishing to see Mr. Hoover were not brought through this 
back door. 
The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and 
as an auxiliary record of Miss Gandy' s appearance before the Staff of the 
Senate Select Committee on May 15, 1975, accompanied by me, 
John P. Mohr.
