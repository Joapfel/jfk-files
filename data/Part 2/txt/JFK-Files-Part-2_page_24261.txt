They were used, usually when they had spare time. 
To my recollection, they were only called off once, 
off the actual contract time, and this was for a 
possible use which didn't go through. But the White 
House asked if we had the capability to move some­
thing from here to there, I think from the Philippines 
to somewhere in Southeast A~ia, I don't recall, and so 
they sent word to management that they wanted a plane 
available at the earliest opportunity at Clark Field. 
They pulled one of them off the MAC contract and had 
it available, I think ready to go, in twelve hours, 
all set for the operation. And the operation was 
never called. But it showed what the capability was. 
And what they had to do was get substitute service 
for the MAC contract. 
During the late 1960's ·several Chinese airline enterprises started, 
both of them on quite a small basis, but one of them which became

national common carriage. This Agency proprietary, Civil Air Trans­
port Company, Ltd., which had been organized in 1954, had the right

Air America did the American contractin& followed on then by 
.Southern Air Transport, due to its certification. Southern was
