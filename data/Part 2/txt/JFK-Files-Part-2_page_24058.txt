c. There is the danger that the United States Govern­
ment will.become an unwitting accomplice to criminal acts and 
that criminal figures will take advantage of their associa­
tion with the government to advance their own projects and 
interests. 
d. There is a fundamental impropriety in selecting 
persons because they are skilled at performing deeds which the 
laws of our society forbid. 
The use of underworld figures by the United States Govern­
ment for their .criminal skills raises moral problems comparable· 
to those recognized by Justice Brandeis in a different context 
five decades ago: 
Our government is the potent, the omnipresent 
teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the 
whole people by its example. Crime is con­
tagious. If the Government becomes a law­
breaker, it breeds contempt for law; it in- . 
vites every man to become a law unto himself. 
To declare that in the administration of the 
criminal law the end justifies the means --
• to declare that the Government may commit 
crimes in order to s.ecure the conviction of· 
the private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution. Against this pernicious doctrine 
this Court should resolutely set its face.
