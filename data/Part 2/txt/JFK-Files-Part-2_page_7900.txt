inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request 
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established . ·• 
for determining.whether or not a request for waiver should be 
granted. 
You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's 
request "unless and·until we are in receipt of notarized state­
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray, 
respectively." Because Mr. We.isberg's request undoubtedly com­
prises records which do not invb'I.ve any proper claim.of privacy, 
this cannot be true~ I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized 
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King 
about.a waiver by her. ·1n the meantime, ·r request that you proceed 
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re­
quest which do not involve any proper.claim of .invasion of privacy. 
Sincerely yours, 
~~!~~
