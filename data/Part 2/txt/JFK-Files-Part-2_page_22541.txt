the Foreign Ministry of that country. The Vietnamese 
Government will pay all his transportation and living 
~osts while on the trip and the invitation resulted from 
urgings by Nguyen Quoc Ten, press officer of the 
Vietnamese mission to the_U.N. in New York City. Wiley 
was certain that his repL1tation as a friend of the Vietna­
mese triggered the invitation. 
Approval was given him to make the trip; however, 
his request to extend the trip through other places 
in the Far East and Europe was turrted down. 
On 18 December 1967, Cecil Tighe(SRS) reported in 
the memo to the Chief, SRS, that Wiley briefed him on the 
forthcoming trip on 15 December 1967. Wiley was told 
to stay out of the front lines and take precautions not 
to involve himself in any situation that might jeopardize 
his safety. Ralph True (Chief/SAD, OS) accompanied Tighe 
to the meeting and True presented a requirement to Wiley 
to which he acceded. Apparently True's presence at the 
meeting had the approval of the Chief, SRS. Wiley 
agreed to cooperate whole-heartedly with True. For the

no explanation in the file concerning the requirement 
levied by True. 
Wiley submitted a report concerning a debriefing 
concerning his Vietnam trip. 
"During a debriefing session in Washington, D.C. 
30 April 1968 (by Bob Long?), I was rather surprised 
by the lack of interest in my findings. The interviewer 
asked almost no questions and didn't take notes. In 
talking to someone who has a great many sources of 
information available, I had little way of knowing what 
might be of interest to him. On several occasions during 
the interview I specifically asked if there were any 
particular information that he wanted. There was no 
response.

Tet "truce" offensive - as a guest of that country's
