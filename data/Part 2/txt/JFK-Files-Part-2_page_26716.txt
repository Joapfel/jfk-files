wanted the infor!'lation on anybodv. 
Q. Well, I guess with several million fiels or several 
l'lillion cards and tens of thousands of files it is difficult to 
make generalizations about the kind of information that is in 
those files?

study that particular situation? 
A. WEll, we did make an effort to do it at one time.
