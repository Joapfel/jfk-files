The Bureau is requested to ob~ain Department 
of State author~ization :Cor the development of sources and 
info:crnants at the captioned establishment. 
This request is being made in view of' existence 
of strong Communist Party in Brazil and absence of dLplomatic 
relations between Brazil and the USSRo It seems likely that 
New York City is a logical place for contacts between 
pro-Communist Brazilians and Russian officialD. Also., news 
reports in recent months have indicated that there is strong 
sentiment for increasing commerical activity between Brazil L 
and• Russia especially in vie·w of BPazil' s increasingly precari.ous t., 
~· economic situation. It is felt that information concerning -
the background and activities of Brazilian officials in the g 
New York area is of vital importance to the internal security G 
of the United Statese ~
