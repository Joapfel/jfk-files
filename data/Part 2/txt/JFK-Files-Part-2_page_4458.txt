(b) ?Uckle Industry: The seat of this 
important industry unfortunately is In two small towns in Oriente 
province. Lightly populated arena which are of strategic importance 
always pose rugged operational obstacles. The nickl.e towns are 
no exception. Numerous well-meaning persons in the U.S. have 
attempted to help us obtain access to this critical target. Yet 
no~ until late September was the Agency able to turn up (by 
virtue of a Now Orleans recruitment) a source of viable leads 
to key· personnei. By cut-off date, however, we had-not been able 
to bring any lead to function. Most promising is a lead to the 
~echnical superviso1'.of the Nickle complex. .

of the Sugar Industry-defected to the U.S. soon after the inception

a suitable candidate to replace them. A New York source in e~ly 
Octob~r succeeded in placing us in touch with the fchi,f sugaro~
