In the 35 years since·Nosenko first approached the CIA in Geneva, no prima facie 
evidence has ever emerged to prove that he was a KGB provocation and subsequent 
defectors have affi:i;med him as a bona fide defector. He has identified many hundreds· • 
of Soviet intelligence officers, provided a considerable quantity of useful information on 
the organization, doctrine and methods of the KGB, and conducted numerous special 
studies on Soviet subjects .. Today, Nosenko is seventy years old, recently retired as a 
contractor from the CIA, an American citizen, married, and living quietly in the 
Sunbelt.
