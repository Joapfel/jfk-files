• . Dear Ms. Mills, 
Your letter of 4 Maroh was delivered to me on 10 March, and this reply will 
b~ sent vi_~ the same channel. 
. I w~h to go on record as demanding that my name not be reloased in ANY 
j d09Ulllent disclosed coti.ceming the K.ennedy assassination. 
1 fj ,First, I shall dos~rib~ my present circumstances; and thereafter I will address 
the legal points in the legislation. 
I retired in 1974 fu a clandestine sta~s, using a State Department cover, 
which has worked reasonably well since· then. I reside in Caracas, Venezuela. This 
city (and. the entir~ oountiy) is still populated with Communists and ex-Communists 
• who form_ed part of ~e ·Marxist-conspiracy to overthrow the deznooran~~ly elected . 
·Oovemments in the _196.Qa and _70s. Many of these persons are.now members of 
Congress and -aJew -ai-~ in the ·President's Cabinet. During my service in Venezuela, . 
as COS, I maintaine~ liai~on with civilian and military officers, during which time I 
worked. with these. to overco~e····.the guerrilla offensive_, .. and ·to .. 0ot11bat the 
Communist Party after it aooepted 11paoification.

. . . . 
Oiyen my somewhat exposed position as COS,· my true affiliation was known 
to a number of impo~t V_enezuelan Government officials. In any event, soon after 
my retuin, I was infonned by the Venezuelan Government_ that an important 
\ Communist leader had loamed of my rotum, and that ".I was living in Urbanizaoion
