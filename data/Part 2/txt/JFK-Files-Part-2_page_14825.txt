Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph T. Mul,loy, an 
employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state 
sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press 
a report prepared by an OEO investigator which contained state­

appeared ·in the 9 /1/ 67 issue of "The Evening Star." 
·The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous 
protest with OEOconcerning the fact that information appearing 
in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published i:;.i "The Evening

in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.
