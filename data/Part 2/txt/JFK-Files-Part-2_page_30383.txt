Mr. Tovar. Yes. 
Mr. Goldsmith. I wou:.d like you to review the statement 
under the name Thomas Morr:.dian. M-0-R-R-I-D-I-A-N. While you

people whose files were reuiewed only ten were debriefed. I·

Then it proceeds to list the ten individuals who in fact were 
debriefed. 
I have now requested llr. Tovar to read the first summary 
which is right next to the name of ·the first per-son who was 
debriefed. 
Mr. Tovar. Yes sir. 
Mr. Goldsmith. When· did that iri:q.ividual defect? 
Mr. Tovar. 19.47 is. the ::year.-·'he~.w.ent to. -the· . .-ussR. I 
assume· that .·is. the year he defected,_ if that is the term. 
Mr. Goldsmith. So th,Lt in fact that individual was not 
someone who defected betweE!n 1958 and 1963? 
Mr. Tovar. That is correct.
