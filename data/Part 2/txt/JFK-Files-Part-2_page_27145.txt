IV. RECOMMENDATIONS 
The following recommendations are presented for the 
consideration of the Commission with the sole intent of 
revitalizing national counterintelligence and enabling it 
to discharge its assigned responsibilities in furtherance 
of national secur.ity. To this end we propose the following 
changes: 
1. That the Operational Directorate of 
CIA assign not less than one-tenth of its 
component to counterintelligence. 
2. That of this total about half be 
assigned to a central counterintelligence unit 
.in Headquarters and that the remaining half be 
divided among the various Area Divisions and 
branches in Headquarters and selected Agency 
stations abroad. 
3. That CIA provide this cadre with 
counterintelligence training in depth. 
4. That selected counterintelligence 
personnel be rotated through Headquarters 
and field assisgnments of growing responsi­
bility in accordance with career plans that 
afford them opportunities for advancement 
which equal those of their Agency colleagues.
