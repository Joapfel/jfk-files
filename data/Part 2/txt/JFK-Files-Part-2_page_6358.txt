5. With specific reference to the requirement of· 
1400.2 (a), the Agency should be concerned about its records 
within the DO which tie crypts to true names of projects and 
alias' and pseudos to the true names of individuals. 
Because we regularly called the DO office responsible for 
these matters for assistance in identifying the projects and 
names behind the crypts and al,ias, ' this subsection would 
seem to place those document holdings within the reach of 
the Board. This needs to be addressed. 
5. Turning to 1400.7 (d), the Agency· should be very 
careful here. In HRG's review and release of documents, we 
have often given out an alias but protected the true name. 
In others, we have given out the true name but protected the 
alias or pseudo. This section seems to vitiate that effort 
and needs to be addressed. 
6. I have several thoughts on the non-relevant issue 
which would take several more paragraphs. Suffice it to 
say, carried to its extreme, if the Board can in any way 
make the case a document is an assassination record, then 
they are entitled to access to it and may direct its 
release. 
7. I would be pleased to discuss any of these items 
with you if you wish.
