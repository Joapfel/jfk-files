Recently, CIA reported that SUGAR had encountered 
some difficulty in Sweaen as a result of his efforts to , / • 
establish cont~ct with Amer-ican deserte;r.-s in that country • .): __ r 
On April 17, ~968, Richard Ober confidentially \<J -
advised that the Dutch internal security service had con- • 
tacted CIA and was making an inquiry concerning SUGAR. At 
this point, CIA does -not know-why the Dutch are making the 
check, but the Agency is speculating that SUGAR's activltie "'~-..... _ 
in Europe have come to the. attention of the Dutch. It is • i<­
Ober's opinion that CIA at some point will contact a top 
official in the Dutch internal security service concerning S' 
the Agency's inte_rest in SUGAR. , • ~e+h b .(~.

Ober stated that i-n the event the Bureau receives 
any inquiry from the Dutch concerning SUGAR, the Agency would 
like to be contacted before we respond/\~ ~-he Dutch. In this
