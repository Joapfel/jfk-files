Robert Kennedy often talked directly with Helms and other CIA officials 
working on the Mongoose program, ouiside of the Special Group Augmented 
channels. (Helms, 7/17, p.13; 7/18, pp.60-61). As Helms stated: 
"I can say absolutely fairly we are constantly in 
touch with each other in these matters. The Attorney 
General was on the phone to me, he ~as on the phone 
to Mr. Harvey, to Mr. Fit~gerald, his successor. He 
was on the ohone even to people on ~arvey's staff, as 
I recall it." (Helms, 7/17, p.13). 
Helms said that although he did not know whether a Castro 
assassination would have been morally acceptable to Robert Kennedy, 
Helms believed that Robert Kennedy ''would not (have been) unhappy if 
(Castro) had disappeared off the scene by whatever means." (Helms, 
7/17. p.17-18). And Helms stated that Robert Kennedy never told him - • 
that a Castro assassination was ruled out. (Hel~s, 7/17, p.21). 
llowcvcr, Helms further testified th.1t Dlthour,h Robert. Kennedy v.J,; 
"constantly in touch" with Helms and their exchanges were marked by de­
tailed, factual, and highly specific discussions on anti-Castro operations. 
Robert Kennedy never raised the subject of a Castro assassination and never 
instructed Helms to assassinate Castro.** Helms furthet testified that he had 
no knowledge that Robert Kennedy "was ever asked to specifically approve 
an assassination plot." (Helms, 6/13; p. 57.),

to the level of.detail in his talks with Robert Kennedy: 
"For example, we had projects to land sabotage teams.*/ 
Well, (the Attorney General would ask) have you got the 
team organized, did the team go? Well, no, ~e've been 
delayed a week because the weather is bad or the boats 
don't run, or something of this kind. It even got down 
to that degree of specificity." (Helms, 7/17, p.40)
