DISSEMINATION OF DATA DEVELOPED IN SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS 
l. Policy 
Proper utilization of information received is foremost among Bureau's 
responsibilities. Information obtained during investigations should 
be forwarded to other interested agencies in executive branch unless 
there are compelling reasons not to do go. Delimitations Agreement 
and Presidential directives provide for-dissemination to other agencies 
which have present or potential interest information relating to espionage, 
sabotage, subversive activities, and related matters. 
2. Bureau requirements 
Because all conceivable situations cannot be anticipated, data below 
pertains to representative situations which occur frequently. Basic 
rule is that security information must be furnished promptly to inter­
ested agencies in executive branch. Term "interested agency 11 must be 
interpreted in light of reason and common s·ense. Bring any unusual 
situations to Bureau's attention promptly for consideration. 
Considerations affecting national defense in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto 
Rico necessitate broadest possible construction to requirements for 
dissemination to intelligence services in those areas. See Manual of 
Rules and Regulations, part II, section 5, pertaining to Bureau 1·s 
overall responsibilities, policies, and exceptions in dis~emination. 
a. Members of armed forces 
Delimitations Agreement between FBI and armed forces intelligence 
agencies (see section 102B, volume IV, of this manual) requires 
each agency to exchange freely and directly with other subscribing 
agencies all information of mutual interest. Any information 
developed concerning members of military services must be referred 
immediately to appropriate military branch having primary respon­
sibility, even though allegations have not been fully resolved or 
verified. Specifically point out in such instances that infor­
mation has not been verified. When it is determined security 
subject is member of armed services, discontinue investigation 
im:nediately, advise Bureau, and disseminate pertinent reports_ 
locally to appropriate intelligence agenc~. ~issemination regarding 
military personnel is not confined to subjects of security invesii-­
gations but extends to any. subversive data developed against member 
of armed services during FBI inves-tigations. If member of armed 
forces has been in contact with security subject or any individual 
or group with security implications, immediately advi"se appropria·te 
local intelligence service, even though security aspects of contact 
have not been resolved. Point out in such instances that infor­
mation is unverified and transmit any additional developments im-
mediately. •
