2 Mr. Aaron. Well, let me see if I can read out what I would 
3 propose along the lines I think we discussed. 
4 The oversight committee should. require that the .fiscal 
5 impact of proprietaries be made clear in.the DCI's budget

presentation to the oversight committee. If you want to add 
the appropriations committee, you can, but I think the point is 
that that happens. 
Mr. Kirbow. If you'll listen just one minute, Mr. Miller 
knows and I believe the.Senator knows that "in the Senate there 
is a formal budget presentation • ,• '• made to the Appropriations 
Committees." They are not made elsewyere. Reports are made 
to oversight committees on the status and all of these other 
14 things, and if they request any money for those proprietaries, 
15 they would request that before the authorizing committee. If 
16 you are just trying: to accomplish getting it made known to.the 
17 oversight commiteee, drop the word "budget presentation" and 
18 adopt the common usage of the annual report of the Agency or 
19 of the DCI . 
20 . But that is kind of a word of art. Those are words of 
21 art in the Senate, and they will seize on it because today 
22 they don't do it for anybody else but the Appropriations 
23 Committee . 
24 Senator Huddleston. I think that's reasonabl~_enough. 
25 It ought to be clear.
