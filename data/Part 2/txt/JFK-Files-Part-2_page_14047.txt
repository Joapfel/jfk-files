Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams Memo 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
It is realized that the White House has requested that a 
paper be prepared which would include the Atlantic City incident; however, 
K. William O'Connf)r indicated that he ~ad conversed with 
Mr. James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and 
that Wilderotter had advised that document requests pertaining to 
Atlantic City or any other topic which will be addressed in a paper should 
be responded to and response should not be delayed. 
It would appear to be advantageous to the Bureau to attempt 
to comply with the summary request along with furnishing certain documents 
concerning Atlantic City on an expeditious basis as opposed to the Committee 
continuing to conduct interviews of current and former Bureau personnel. • 
If this type of arrangement can be worked out in this particular incident 
which the Committee characterizes as an abuse, it might lend itself to a 
similar arrangement in other areas. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare a 
summary in line with the above concerning the Atlantic City incident along 
with furnishing the important documents concerning this incident.
