The next day, Allen Dulles personally signed a cable* to 
the Leopold_ville thief o.~ Station which stressed the· urgency of 
"removing" Lurnumba: 
IN HIGH QUARTERS** HERE IT IS THE CLEAR­
CUT CONCLUSION THAT IF LLL [LUMUMBA] CON­
TINUES TO HOLD HIGH OFFICE, THE INEVITABLE 
RESULT WILL AT BEST BE CHAOS AND AT WORST 
PAVE THE WAY TO COMMUNIST TAKEOVER OF THE 
CONGO WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 
PRESTIGE OF THE UN AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF 
THE FREE WORLD GENERALLY. CONSEQUENTLY 
WE CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL MUST BE AN 
URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE THAT UNDER EXISTING 
CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD BE A HIG!i PRIORITY OF 
OUR COVERT ACTION. (CIA Cable,I.S)UT 6296~, 
Director to Leopoldville, 8/26/60.) 
Dulles cabled that the (chief o~ Station was to be given "WIDER 
~ -
AUTHORITY" -- along the lines of the previously authorized opera-
\...... tion to replace Lumumba with a pro-Western group -- "INCLUDING 
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT" (CIA Cable, 
8/26/60). "WE REALIZE THAT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY MAY PRESENT 
THEMSELVES TO YOU," the cable continued (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). 
* Cables issued under the personal signature of the DCI are 
a relative rarity in CIA communitations and call attention to the 
importance and sensitivity of the matter discussed. 
** As discussed in Section S(c), infra, Richard Bisell testified 
that Allen Dulles would have used the phrase "higher quarters" to 
refer to the President (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 48) ..
