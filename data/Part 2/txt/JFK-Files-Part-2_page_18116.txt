The Attorney General 
NOTE: 
Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have 
detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue 
Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax 
return information. Included in this material were a 
number of cases in which the FBI locally requeoted and, 
according to the documents 1 received tax returns or tax 
return information from Internal Revenue Service employees. 
Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who 
assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations. We 
successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities 
of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the 
SSC. We were sustained in our position by the Attorney 
.. 
General. Our position was based on the fact that we considered 
that we had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi­
dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf. 
The SSC now raises a question as to whether our 
position concerning contacts with and identities of employees 
of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the 
"confidential sources." For the reasons cited in our letter 
we do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an 
argument.
