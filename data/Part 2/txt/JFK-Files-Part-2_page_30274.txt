Mr. Klein. They 0ould rather keep him in the Soviet 
Union? 
< I 
Mr. Nosenko. No, they wou~d rather prefer they washed 
their hands, Mr. Klein; they ar~ n6t making decision, KGB. 
In 1 Soviet Union decisions are.made by the Central Committee 
of the Cocirriunist Party:, and General Secretary and Politburo, j

to this Committee 
Goin~ by the facts as you have told them 
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Klein. why wasn't he put on a plane and sent 
back to America? 
I 
l 
Mr. Nosenko. KGB washed their hands: Then from Intouri1t 
i 
it was given information Ministry of Foreign Trade; Ministry i 
I of Foreign Trade reported to the Soviet Government. As I sai1•, 
I assumed the .Chairman was .surely asked; he told his opinion 
of the KGB, and up to the Soviet Government how they would I 
decide. 
Mr. Klein. Could he have been brought to the U .'S. 
Embassy and told them ,he is an American, "You take care of 
him; we don't want hirri"? 
Mr. Nosenko. It can be done, sure. It can be done, but 
it wasn't done.
