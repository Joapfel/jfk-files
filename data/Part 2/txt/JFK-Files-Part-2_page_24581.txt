McCone also testified that McNamara agreed that the Lansdale Memorandum 
should be withdrawn for the same reason expressed by McCone, i.e. because the 
topic of a Castro assassination had not been given consideration by the Special 
Group Augmented. (McCone, p. 39). 
(2) Testimony of Harvey 
As discussed above (seep. __ ) Harvey's Memorandum of August 14, 1962 
states that upon receiving Lansdale's August 13 Memorandum, Harvey demanded 
that Lansdale excise the words referring to "liquidation of leaders." Har­
vey's Memorandum further sJ:atecLthat "the Special Group (Augmented) is not 
expecting any written comments or study on this point." This latter passage 
raises the issue whether. Harvey meant to state that the Special Group Aug-
mented authorized a Castro assassination plan or activity but that no written 
record should be made. In his testimony, Harvey clarified this point by 
stating that the Special Group did not express a desire to proceed with the 
suggestion of a Castro assassination: 
cee • ~· 
"Mr. Harvey: t to my knowledge, no .... 
If there was an;2: nwritten understanding on 
the part of the members of the Special Group 
concerning this, other than what was said at the 
meeting, I do not know of it ... " 
(Harvey, pp. 30-31). 
Harvey further testified that shortly after the August 10 meeting, 
McCone told Harvey tha.t he had called McNamara to sta.te that assassiantion 
should not be discussed and that he had told McNamara that if he was involved 
in such matters, he might be excommunicated from his church. (Harvey, p. 25).
