Rodriguez also agreed with the British ambassador that the 
second_problem facing Cuban agriculture was the lack of consumer 
goods which were necessary to stimulate production. However, 
Rodriguez said that Cuba was in a vicious circle: farmers did 
not have incentive to produce because there were few consumer 
goods available, yet such goods could no~ be obtained until 
farm production had been raised. Rodriguez' main concern 
seemed to be the scarcity of many consumer goods; in fact, he 
admitted that he was willing to undertake t'emporary expediencies 
which might help raise production, even though they might be 
"doctrinally unwelcome .. " . Rodriguez referred the ambassador to 
Lenin's New Economic Policy, and made noiattempt to disguise his 
disagreement with Castro 9 s insistence on "ultimate aims" instead 
of current "tactics." (British Embassy Havana, 13 November, 
CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM)
