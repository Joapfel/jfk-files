In the past, the actual costs of major weapon systems have com-
monly increased from 300 to 500 percent over the costs estimated when 
the program started, and in some instances more. Some of the reasons 
for such overruns have been: 
1. We have insisted that weapon systems meet pe#form­
ance standards that go far beyond essential military requirements. 
2. We have accepted unrealistically optimistic cost 
estimates at the beginning of a program, only to find costs multiplied 
many times during the program. 
3. We have not sufficiently defined at the outset what 
it is we are asking our contractors to develop. Here we have discovered 
that it is frequently helpful to work with more than one contractor in 
what we call a "program definition phase" before a development contract 
is awarded. 
4. We have too often employed inadequate and 
unsatisfactory procedures to select major contractors, putting in-
,l:lu!:ficient weight on ,sea·soned experience in the aesign 'and :prod{i'ction 
5. We have relied too much on cost-plus-contracts and 
other contracting procedures which do not provide incentives to reduce 
cost.
