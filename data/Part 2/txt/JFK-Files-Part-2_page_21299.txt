YIS. CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject 
is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to 
remain in the U. s. ~IA desires verification of this information

April, 963,~ Approach to subject by FBI is not recommended because

intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance 
for approe.ch in similar case.
