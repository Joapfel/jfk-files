and it will give him the necessary oppor­
tunity to conduct the following busines~: 
As Source makes his lecture tour he will 
attempt, by direct contact and through al­
teady established channels, to determine 
whether or not he can set up for the basic 
plan (a) a daily column, (b) a newsletter, 
(c) a radio spot news broadcast. The lecture 
tour, of course, will place Source in given 
areas and it would be completely logical for

newsletter or radio broadcast bureau, shuttle back
