int~re.sted in so that there would not be a cro·ss ;·cff ·pr66lems 
with these jurisdictions and therefore a 1-iaison was opened on 
that basis, a multiplicity of approaches·. 
Mr. Daron. The articld discusses the fact that regular 
commnndo raids were run out of JMWAVE Station to the shore of 
Cuba, and that those commando~-were equipped with all kinds of 
explosives and armaments. 
Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on 
a regular basis commando raids to Cuba? 
Mr. Halley. Yes. There were a series of commando raids 
run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuha. 
Mr. Daron. _Wdre assassination weapons, that is, high-power d 
rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied 
to those commando teams as a matter of coursd? 
Mr. Halley ... No, they were not. For most of those 
commando teams, you were looking for a different kind of a 
weapon~ You are looking for a weapon with a high range of fire 
power over a short distance to deal with an emergency situation 
rather than the kind of, you know, weapon that we are talking 
about. 
In other words, you wouln find that type of a group armed 
with a submachine gun, as for example. 
Mr. naron. If an assas~ination weapon as we have 
described it was supplied to a commando team, they would hav~ 
to have a spe~ific purpo~e in mind for its use?
