"Maybe ~-~~ ~-information 
was the vital.nerve of the K_ennedy • 
assassination," a Senate source..told 
The Herald. • , : 
High officials in the Cuban gov- ' 
ernment also reportedly feel there 
· was a "Cuban factor". in the JFK 
, death, but they see it as a result of . 
' exile politics, acc~rding to a_ recent 
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel~, 
low of the Council Foreign Rela- • 
tions in Washington. 
Frye wrote that he visited H~~­
vana recently and met with Cuban_. 
officials including Deputy Prime 
Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez. 
" ... they volunteer the suspicion 
that the recent murders of Sam Gi• 
ancana and Johnny Rosselli ... 
surely have some connection with 
I Cuban exile politics and the 'Kenne-
dy murder," Frye wrote. _ . 
THERE HA VE been theories re­
cently propounded to show why 
both pro and anti-Castro forces 
could have wanted to get JFK out 
of power in 1963. • 
·, On the one hand, there is the re• 
' port of French journalist Jean Dan- . 
• iel, who was the bearer to Castro 
• ,_ of an offer from·_JFK for calmer re­
,. lations. Castro was reportedly 
;· agreeable, The repprt stated thal 
rnanie! later was .lunching with. 
• Castro when word came that Ken­
t nedy had been' shot. Daniel de-
scribed the Cuban leader as genu­
inely shocked by the news. 
It has since been learned that 
probably in the very hour iJFK was 
shot, a one-time Castro supporter 
was receiving a poison pen device 
from a CIA agent in what was a 
long-running anti-Castro ·effort. 
That Cuban agent was code-named · 
AM/LASH, and he has since been 
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now 
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi- '. 
nation plotting. • 
WHETHER JFK had knowledge 
of, or perhaps even approved, any: 
of the assassination plots will prob-: 
ably never be known. • • . • 
His closest advisers, who test1-. 
' fied before the Senat~ Committee, -
' all said he had no knowledge of 
such plots and would never have 
, approved of them. _ . 
• The same month Rossell! was_ 
passing poison pills to_ his C_u_ban 
· contact at a meeting at the ton­
e: tainebleau, March of 1961, former 
Florida Sen. George Smathers, a 
friend of Kennedy, said he and

Kennedy discussed the ramifica-. 
tions of a Castro assassination. 
Smathers has since said Kennedy 
rejected the idea and that the dis­
cussion was more of a "brain-pick­
ing" session. 
AT LEAST one high-level .CIA 
official did testify he believed the 
White House was being briefed on · 
the plots but according to Richard 
Bissell, one of the officials who 
originally decid.ed to use Rosselli, it 
was through the method of "plau­
sible deniability." 
T)lat, according to the recent 
Senate r!!port, "can also lead to the 
use of euphemism and circumlocu-· 
tion, which are designed to allow 
the President and other senior offi­
cials to deny knowledge of an op­
eration should it be disclosed." • 
Another alleged link between' 
the White House and the under-
• world plotters, first made public by 
the Senate Committee, has also 
been denied by virtually everyone 
involved. Judith Campbell Exner, 
the woman who claims to have 
been friend and lover to both Gian-
• cana and JFK, introduced to both 
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in __ 
the Castro plotting, those close· to·~ 
both Giancana and Kennedy have ' 
said. , 
A MAN with access to Kenne­
dy's closest advisers told The Her~ 
aid recently, "The Giancana-Ros­
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner 
thing. I was there. Sure JFK knew 
her, but he was naive about those 
kinds of things." 
There is documentation to show 
that on March 22, · 1962, Hoover. 
lunched privately with Kennedy 
and presumably gave him his first 
information linking Exner with the 
gangsters. • The final • recorded 
. phone .call between the . White· 
• House and Exner was made only a 
few hours later. ; . 
Another possible link discussed 
in the Senate report shows that the 
• / same unidentified Cuban· to whom 
Rosselli passed the poison pills 
prior to the Bay or Pigs operation 
in April of 1961, was among a 
group of Cuban exile leaders who 
. met with JFK following the inva­
• • sion fiasco. • 
. IT IS known that several of the 
Cubans • with whom Rosselli 
worked have been identified, but 
investigators say that not all ar.e 
known. 
As a condition to his appear­
ances before the Senate Committee 
in the past year, it was agreed that 
Rosselli "would not state the 
names or confirm the existence of} 
those agents whom he knew '.i 
about," Rosselli's attorney , Lesli~J 
Scheer said. • ' . • 
The friends and acquaintances of­
Rosselli who could be contacted by. 
The Herald all said they never ' 
--._heard the names of the Cuban • 
agents. . _____ __ _____ _______ -~ 
But a ·committee source· ·cau-.-­
•. tioned; "they (Cuban agents) read : 
the committee's report, they know • 
who's being referred ·to." 
ANOTHER Rosselli attorney, . 
Tom Wadden, a partner of Edward ~ 
Bennett Williams, said, "Yes,· l'' 
think he had more knowledge•~.;_ 
than he testified to. 
Searching I;<osselli's more rece_nt_.;

tra had made him a member ac•,': 
cording to investigators. • 
Deportation pressures were also 
mounting at this time. 
• ROSSELLI entered prison on the 
conviction in 1970 where he would· 
serve three years of a five-year. 
sentence. 
In 197,1, he was brought to a. 
federal grand jury in Los Angeles

Rosselli, too, had, an interest in 
the Frontier, which opened in 1967.

concession is unclear, but·' l:3reen 
said it gave Rosselli an· income of
