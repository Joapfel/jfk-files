forts or personal goals. 
Mr. Taylor reflected that he could not understand the 
interest that George De Mohrenschildt showed towards LHO dur-

giving Oswald money, helping him by giving him clothing and 
then by virtually forcing Oswald on his friends, that is, the 
friends of De Mohrenschildt. He also stated that De Mohren­
schildt spent a great deal of time with LHO. Mr. Taylor said 
that was difficult to understand because George De Mohrenschildt 
had children and a family of his own and he had never done any

stated further that this interest was out of character for 
George De Mohrenschildt, considering that lHO was a "nobody."
