Serving the Greater Philadelphia and South Jersey Area 
I understand that you are extremely busy at this point, 
preparing a budget and interviewing prospective staff members. 
But I would appreciate a call at your convenience. 
I am somewhat anxious since several of the AP stories 
mention "a spokesman for Sprague." I recall that you mentioned 
a temporary press secretary, aide to Rep. Thomas N. Downing. 
My concern is that he may become permanent.
