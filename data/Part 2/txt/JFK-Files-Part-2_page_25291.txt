Out from Miami spreads a wave of vio­
lence. Terrorists' aim is to topple Castro, free 
Cuba. Nearly all Cuban refugees share this 
dream. But the acts of a few zealots create 
trouble for fellow exiles and for the U.S. 
Reported from 
MIAMI and WASHINGTON 
TL'rrorism by radic,t! Cuban refugees has become a thorny 
problem in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and, in the 
\·iew of some authorities, a potential threat to the lives of 
:\merican leaders. 
The terrorists' goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from 
its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro. 
In pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence 
from \li,trni across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba but 
,dso to \le:1:ico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama-even across 
the South .-\tlantic to :\rgcntin:t. 
They have engaged in~ a series of bombings in the U.S. and 
abroad. Thev ha\·e c,irried out military-style attacks on 
Communist ships. The:· arc strongly suspected of SC\ n: . .t 
killings. . 
:\ federal grand jury in \founi is investigating their acti,i­
ties and their leaders . 
. '.\:ow, as a new :\clrninistration prepares to take O\'L'r in 
\\'ashi"1igton, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists \\'ill step up 
their att,icks_ in an effort to th\\'art any turn toward recrnwili­
ation with Castro. 
Offj_~ials familiar ·with their operations warn that SOillt' ol 
the Cuban extri:-mists \\:"ill stop at nothing, not L'\'t•11 .,t 
assassinating members of the Cartl'r Administration. 
"The Cuban terrorists are the most highly trained assas,im 
in,the \\'orld todny," says one U.S. official. 
\!an~· of the terrorists were trainl'd by the Central liitc-lli­
gence .-\geney in tliL' days \\'hen this country \\'as trying lo
