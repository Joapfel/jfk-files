A source advised duri1g August, 1969, that at 
the National Convention ·(NC} of Students for a Democratic 
Society (SDS) held in Chicago, Cllinois, during June, 19.6.9, 
a split arose between the Progr~ssive Labor Party (PLP) and 
the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the 
Weatherman faction. The PLP fa~tion drew the largest 
support amonq those in attendan~e at the NC. 
Source further advisei that during late Summer, 
1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National 
Headquarters (NH} on the second floor of a loft-type 
building at 173A Massachusetts \venue, Boston, Massachusetts. 
The campaign on which the PLP fiction centered was to build 
a worker student alliance or a ~ampus worker student 
alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student 
Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance. 
Source stated that th~ "New Left Notes," printed 
in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA 
faction. 
A second source advis~d during January, 1970, 
that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP 
constitutes the leadership. 
A third source advisei during July, 1970, that 
during demonstrations staqed ir the Boston area during the 
Spring and Summer of 1970 by tr= NH, the main theme of 
previous demonstrations staged Jy the NH shifted from 
protestations of the Vietnam Wac and other United States 
foreign policy matters to attac<ing domestic issues such 
as racism and unemployment and iemonstrating support of 
the "workers' struggle." .
