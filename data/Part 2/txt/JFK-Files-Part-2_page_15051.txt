The essence of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans 
lies in the connection New Orleans District Attorney James c. 
Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee Harvey Oswald, 
David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw. The principal 
witness has been Perry Russo who has said Oswald, Ferrie, 
and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at·a 
meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September, 
1963. 
Immediately followi.ng the assassination of President 
Kennedy, the.FBI received all'egations of a connection between 
Ferrie and Oswald. These allegations were thoroughly and 
exhaustively investigated. No eviden·ce was ever developed 
that Oswald and Ferrie were acquainted~ Clay Shaw's name 
never came up in the investigation and the FBI never 
investigated him. 
The FBI has held to a "hands-off" policy regarding 
Garrison's investigation. Although we are closely following 
Shaw's trial, we have no observers in the courtroom. It is 
noted that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice 
has an unofficial observer in the courtroom. 
Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He 
received a medical discharge in October, 1951, from the u. s. 
Army for an emotional problem. He admitted to Army authoritt~s 
that he had received psychiatric treatment. Garrison was a 
Special Agent of the FBI for four months, resigning to 
re-enter military service in July, 1951.
