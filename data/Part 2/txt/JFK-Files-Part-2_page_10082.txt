MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RE: FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM 
• NOVE1'1BER 12-16, 1969 
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS 
The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in 
Vietnam (NMC) is sponsoring a massive antiwar mani_:festation 
to take place in Washingtc;m, D. c • ., on November 12--16, 1969. 
The Student Mobilization Committee to End t~e War in Vietnam 
(SMC) and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC) are closely 
coordinating their efforts with NMC in organizing the 
demonst1·ation. NMC, SMC and VMC occupy adjoining of:fice 
space at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, Washington, Do. c. 
SMC is completely dominated and controlled by the 
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party· (SWP) and its youth affiliat·e, 
the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The VMC has recently 
endorsed fully the activities of NMC concerning the upcoming 
antiwar demonstration. 
This demonstration could possibly attract the 
largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in 
Washington, Doc., which is cause for major concern should 
violence of any type break out. It is necessary for this 
Bureau to keep abreast of events as they occur, and we feel 
advance knowledge of plans an<l possible areas of confrontation 
during the demoi1Stration would be most advantageous to our 
coverage and to the safety of individuals and property. 
We have separately requested authorization to install 
a telephone surveillance on the office of NMC. To further 
·implement our coverage, we are requesting authorizatio_n to 
install telephone surveillances on the offices of SMC and VMC.
