Mr. Schwarz. And this is a cable releasing officer Wi11·a: 
Broe, authenticating officer David A Phillips, dated Octo­
ber 14, 1970, from CIA headquarters to Santiago, CIA. 
And it says: 
"Please deliver the following message ('destroy immedi-
Bennett. " 
Now, on what basis did you authenticate that message 
which purports 
Bennett? 
Mr. Phillips. Obviously 
from Lieutenant General 
not obviously, but because 
I presume in this case -- I am sure in this case once again 
there was a document that was handed to me and I was told, 
send this down. ~ In order to make this point, I was in there, 
and it was sort of a direct operational thing, and when I 
authenticated them I did it because I knew what was going on. 
If Bill Broe, my boss, came in and said, here is a document 
that we want to send, or if Tom Karamessines said, I worked on 
the assumption that they were passing on to me the authority 
to authenticate, and I didn't necesarily turn to them and say, 
hey 
Mr Schwarz. Prove that --
Mr. Phillips. Prove that you have been talking with 
General Bennett -- I obviously didn't do that. 
Mr. Schwarz. Then mark as Exhibit 6 an undated docu-
