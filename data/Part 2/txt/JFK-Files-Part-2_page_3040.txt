As 1959 drew to a close, a final Special National 
Intelligence Estimate, "The Situation in the Caribbean 
through 1960!," indicated that Castro was in to stay, 
despite internal difficulties. The SNIE saw no serious 
threat to Castro's continued rule, and it pointed out 
that if there was direct US intervention, "Most Cubans 
including the military, would react violently." 46/ 
As 1960 began, General Cabell, the Deputy Direc­
tor of Central Intelligence, held a joint ~riefing 
plots aimed at Fidel Castro and others, pages 2 and 3 
of Appendix A show two significant corrections in Allen 
Dulles's own, handwriting to the text submitted. by Col. 
King. In paragraph 3d, the phrase "thorough consider­
ation be given to the elimination of Fidel Castro" 
carries Dulles's pencilled correction making the text 
read "removal from Cuba" rather than "elimination." 
At a later point in the same paragraph the 
original text said "many informed people believe that 
, the disappearance of Fidel would-greatly accelerate 
the fall of t~e present government". Mr. Dulles has 
substituted the word "removal" for the word "disappear­
ance~" These significant changes in the text on the 
·original copy of king's memorandum -- which the author 
has recovered -- support the contention that the author. 
has made in the Foreword to this Volume that the com-
.ponent (WH/4) officially charged.wi~h the conduct of 
the Agency's anti-Castro program was.neither charged 
with nor responsible for programs designed to assas­
sinate Castro in the course of the Bay of Pigs Opera­
tion. Colonel King's memorandum of 11 December 1959, 
with the pencilled corrections noted above,·· was con­
curred in by Richard M.· Bissell and approved by Allen 
W. Dulles on 12 December 1959.
