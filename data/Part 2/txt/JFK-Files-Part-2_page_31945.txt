(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 24 October 1968, Ramona Rodriguez, 
Housewife, Apartment 4E, 905 East 167th Street, Bronx, New York, was 
interviewed in her residence concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has known 
SUBJECT since 1951 stated substantially as follows: 
Source met SUBJECT and HIS parents as neighbors in 1951 when 
Source moved into the apartment across from SUBJECT at 905 East 167th Street, 
Bronx, New York. Source became a close friend of SUBJECT'S mother and saw 
SUBJECT daily until HIS family moved from the building in 1965. Source 
continued to visit SUBJECT'S mother after 1965 and until her death in early 
1967. Source had not seen SUBJECT since the funeral of HIS mother in 1967. 
Source had no knowledge of SUBJEDT's birthplace since HE was 
approximately six years of age when they first-.met. Source knew SUBJECT'S 
parents as Manuel and Reyes Marti. HE has an older brother, Ivan, and a 
younger sister, Blanca. SUBJECT was brought up in a very respectable home, 
and HIS parents exercised very strict control over the children. SUBJECT 
graduated from high school in Bronx, New York, shortly before HE and HIS 
parents moved from the neighborhood, further details unknown. Source had 
no knowledge of SUBJECT'S employment. 
SUBJECT is a quiet, friendly, serious-minded young man of excellent 
character and personal behavior. HE was never known to be adversely 
involved with law enforcement agencies. HIS parents were very strict and 
watchful over the. upbringing of SUBJECT and HIS brother and they were not 
allowed to roam the streets or participate in any neighborhood gang activi­
ties. Most of SUBJECT'S free time from school was spent at home with HIS 
studies, and with HIS hobbies of stamp collection, and HIS pet birds and 
fishes. Source believed that SUBJECT'S father worked in a-factory, further 
details unknown, and was never known to operate HIS own business. HIS 
parents were never heard to speak badly about the United States and its 
democratic institutions, and Source was of the opinion that SUBJECT was 
brought up as a loyal United States citizen. SUBJECT is a mature, emotionally 
stabia young man, and because of HIS home training Source was of the opinion 
that HE would be financially responsible. SUBJEDT was not known to have any1 
organizational affiliations, nor to have traveled outside of the United 
States. HE is honest, trustworthy and dependable, and has manifested no 
undesirable social habits. Source suggested Luisa Perez, 905 East 167th 
Street, Bronx, New York, as a friend of SUBJECT's family. She was unable 
to suggest other persons in the neighborhood who would have knowledge of 
SUBJECT since most of the people presently residing in the apartment building 
moved there since SUBJECT moved away in 1965. 4 3 '
