Mr. Johnson. So both of you •left the CIA in December, 1974 
Since that time we understand there have been so~e changes 
in how counterintelligence is conducted at the CIA. 
Could you give us some understanding of those changes? 
Mr, Angleton, I would like to defer to Mr, Miler on this, 
if I may? 
Mr. Miler, Yes, 
My understanding is there have been some rather fundamenta 
and substantive changes which are a continuation, actually, 
of changes that were made first in 1973, in July of 1973 
when many of the centralized counterintelligence functions were 
decentralized and reallocated to different components of the 
Directorate of Operations, Suell things as agent approvals and 
security, operational security reviews for intelligence 
collection and covert action operations; the oversight on 
intelligence operations, and oversight on counterintelliqence 
operations in the field were deceritralized. Research and 
Analysis has been curtailed, and the emphasis on it has chang0.clj 
·i There have been changes in the record procedures, 1 
Mr. ,Johnson. Could you be more specific on these chanqes,, 
for example, in rcseirch? 
Mr. Miler, In research, the research is now, as I under-
stand it, pretty much on a case by case basis, not in an 
overall perception of worldwide or national counterintcllic,c:1(''.) 
problems, There is no -- the applic,1tion of historical casei;,
