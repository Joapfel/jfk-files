Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Is there presently a Miami Station? 
Oh, yes. 
And how large is it at the present time? 
Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the 
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present 
time because we are in one of these periods where,we-are

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions 
were being performed by the Miami Station? 
A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I

positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this 
type of tiring. Covert action. 
This is the list of things you gave me earlier in 
the deposition? 
A Yes.
