Cuba, however, remained a subject of considerable concern. In 
April 1961, shortly after President Kennedy established the Taylor 
commis~ion, Presidential adviser Walt Rostow speculated that Cuba 
might join with the Soviet Union in setting up an offensive air or 
missile base. He additionally posed that Cuba might build its 
conventional military strength and develop its subversive network to 
threaten other Latin American nations from without and within. "Its 
ideological contours are a moral and politic~! offense to us," he 
concluded, "and we are committed, by one means or another, to remove 
that offense .... " 
The ~enned~ administration proceeded tb address the situation 
directly. At a White House meeting which McCone attended in late 
November 1961, the President announced that General ~dward Lansdale, 
acting under the direction of the Attorney General, had already begun 
to study possible actions to overthrow the Castro regime. These 
covert activities, explained Robert Kennedy, included anything 
possible to create internal dissension and discredit Castro. He then 
proposed that, to accomplish this goal, Lansdale head up a committee 
made up of representatives of Defense, State, USIA, and CIA, which 
would cut across organizational lines. 
McCone d~cided that the administration and the Agency both seemed 
in a state of shock so far as Cuba was .concerned. Although skeptical 
from the beginning about the Lansdale program's prospects for 
success, he nevertheless recognized that the CIA h~d a special role 
and responsibility so far as Cuba was concerned.
