Mr. Baron. :--or the ettect ot the language in the cable7 
Mr. Tweedy, The effect ot the language in the cable 
would be to get Hodgman to be thinking along these lines, 
Mr. Dawson. Would you describe the purpoea? 
Hr. Tweedy. It would have been the eventuality that we 
might wish to get rid of Mr, Lwnwnba personally, 
Mr. Dawaon. Ia that language you think might have 
been used or that is how you think it might have been done? 
Mr. Tweedy. I couldn't even start to reproduce the 
cable. 
Mr. Daron. Did you send a number of ouch cables to 
the Chief of Station? 
I imagine there were .a few over a ,period 
of time. It was not an intensive correepondence as I 
remember it. 
Mr. Baron. It wouldn't be thenormal practice to 
have an intensive correspondence on such a sensitive subject, 
would it? 
Mr. Tweedy. I don't know. It ig the only time I ever 
had one hut I hdve had v~ry sensitive suhjects,operationa~l~· 
sensitive ~ubjccta that I have dealt with in extensive 
cable" over a very long period of time, but nothing of this 
nature whdteouvcr . 
Hr. Uaron. Were these cables from headquarters to 
tho Chief of Station in Leopoldville sent in a specially 
TOP SECRET
