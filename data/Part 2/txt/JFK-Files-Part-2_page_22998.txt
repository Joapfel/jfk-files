civic officials and law enforcernant agencies in being allowed 
to operate free or the law? For instance, were you allowed to 
put vessels onto the water which were not properly registered, 
or which could be held immune for inspection by the Coast Guard 
or other maritime authorities, and were you allowed to send 
people through the streets of Southern Florida who may have 
been armed or violating local law in some other way, who were 
held immune oy arrangements that you had with law enforcement 
agencies? 
Mr. l!alley. You hava asked me, in essence, three 
questions. 
Mr. Daron. Right: 
Mr. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each 
question separately. 
Let me first deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we 
had was appropriately registered. There were no short-cuts' 
insofar as tht! U.S. Coast Guard was concerned. That is, any 
v~ssel that was registered in the United States met appropriate 
safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any 
·vessels into tht! water that any citi~en could not have put into 
the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty 
foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things 
like that. These boats were owned in'either a corporato name 
or by a private individual who had to register them with the 
Coast Guard and pass normal Coast Guard requlations.
