nl08. Madison wrote, "A popular Government, without popular information, or 
the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy, or, 
perhaps both. Knowledge will forever ·govern ignorance: And a people who mean to 
be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which :knowledge 
gives.u Id. at 103. Jefferson stated: "No ground of support of the Executive 
will ever be sosure as a complete knowledge of their proceedings by the people; 
and it is oniy in cases where the public good would be injured, and beca~se it 
would be injured, that proceedings· should be secret." Thomas Jefferson: word for , 
Word 409 (Maureen Harrison & Steve Gilbert eds., 1993)_.

On the question of original intention, _the evidence is mixed. Secrets were 
a~ once bad and useful, openness was an object to be pursued, but not at a1_1 • 
costs. Since 1787, the government has become more rather than less accountable,
