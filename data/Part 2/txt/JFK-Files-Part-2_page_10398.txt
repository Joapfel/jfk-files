.protect foreign vitiors. Recently, John Ha ___ was detailed • 
to the Secretary o he Treasury along with - ar other Agency 
employees. We have even; in rare. instances, detailed our 
people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time. 
-3. Details to the ~hite ·House and Governnent A~encies -
Discussion: Details to ~SC, the White House, ~SA ana the 
Natio~al ~ar College are pr~bably ~~ite tc5~~sible. On the other 
hand, t~ere may be those ~ho ~ould question Agenty e □ployees 
currently worki~g at the Bureau of Karcotics and Dangerous Drugs 
and Mr. Peter Petdrson having an Agency employee as his 
secretary when he was the Secreta:-y of·· CorrJ-ncrce {she also made 
a ·trip with him to ~roscow). She is still Ki th him in his 
present assignment but we expect that she will renort to NSC for 
.a new detail soraetime this month. Iden 112 se-tved .. for • 
over ten years as Director of the Office of. Public Safety for 
AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during 
that erttire period of time. H~ has been approved· for disability 
retirement and is presently on sick leave and will re~ire 
automatically at the expiration of this leave. 
Each ~et ail of _an Agency employee to the White House or 
other Government agency has been carefully considered and 
approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were 
involved. 
4. Project Ti•:OFOLD: I believe the support ,-ie are 
providing to Project r~;o~OLD is an activity that should be -
reported under your guidelines. Since this is an extremely 
sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on 
it, I will not repeat the details in ray memorandum. 
5. Individuals EngaQed in Domestic Activities:. In a more 
general sense, Contract Personnel ilivision prepares and executes 
• contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out 
domestic activities. We also ~roccss Staff Agents who are 
doraestically assigned. None of these a~signments are decided 
in OP. I really have no way of kno~\ing with any degree of 
certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be. 
6. Arrangemer..ts with Ar.1erican Firms: In the interest of 
reporting "too f.luch, 
11 
I Kould re!:iinci you that Cont.ract Personnel 
Division writes "agreements" with domestically based .American 
firms to provide cover for Agency· assets. The actual assign­
ments are overseas. The arrangements, however, are backstopped, 
in the main, in the United States.
