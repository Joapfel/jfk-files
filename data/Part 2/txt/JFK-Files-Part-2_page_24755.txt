I. Background 
Rafael Trujillo came to power in the Dominican Republic 
in 1930. For most of his tenure, the United States government 
supported him and he was regarded throughout much of the 
Caribbean and Latin li.merica as a protege of the United States. 
~rujillo's rule, always harsh and dict~torial, became more 
arbitrary during the 1950' s, As a result, the United States 
States' image ~as increasingly tarnished·in the eyes of many 
Latin Americans. 
Increasing American awareness ~f Trujillo's brutality 
and fear that it would lead to a Castro-type revolution caused 
U.S. officials to consider various plans to hasten his abdi­
cation or downfall. 
As early as- February 1960 the Eisenhower administration 
gave high level consideration to a program of covert aid to 
Dominican dissidents. (Special Group minutes, 2/10/60). 
In_April 1960 President Eisenhower approved a contingency plan 
for the Dominican Republic which provided, in part, that. if the 
situation deteriorated still further: 
" ... the United States would immediately take political action to 
rerrove Trujillo from the Dominican Republic as soon 
is a suitable successor-regime can be induced to take over 
with the assurance of U.S. political, economic, and 
-- if necessary -- military support." (.Memo from 
Secretary of State Herter to the President, 4/14/60; 
Presidential approval indicated in Herter letter to 
Secretary of Defense Gates, 4/21/60.) 
Simultaneously, the United States was trying to organize 
hemispheric opposition to the Castro regime in Cuba. Latin
