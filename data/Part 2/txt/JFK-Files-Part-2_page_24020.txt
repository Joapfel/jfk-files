It seems to me, although the records don't re­
flect it, that there was a meeting in September, 
a very brief one, in which I must ·have been 
told that there was a specific program going 
underway. That probably would have been by 
Henry (Kissinger) and perhaps with Karamessines 
there'. I am· not sure. (Haig testimony, p. 12) 
Karamessines discussed the Chilean situation by teleph~ne with General 
Haig. He indicated th.it the Station had "made direct contact_with a number 
of the senior military officers, especially those who had been reportedly 
very activist-min_ded and had received pessimistic reactions from all.

Haig recalled the· telephone conversation with Karamessines on the 1·oth. 
His recollection accords with the CIA memorandum of converstition. 
I do know, and I know that from looking at the 
record this morning, that Karamessines made a 
telephone call to me in which he gave a progress 
report. I recall that. It was in effect a nega­
tive progress report, that they were·Just not com­
ing up with it. (Haig testimony, p. 12)
