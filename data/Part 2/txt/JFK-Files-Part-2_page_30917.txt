Cuba. Ray also says he has been offered a 210 ft. Corvette, flying a 
Venezuelan nag and owned by Spaniards friendly to JURE. Said he could extend 
operations along the south coast of Cuba for as much as 2 - 3 weeks with 
this vessel. Ray was interested in whether or not KIM flights were to be 
resumed into Cuba as he is hopeful of returning by legal means which would 
not pose as many difficulties as present Mexican a.nd Spanish air travel 
conditions.
