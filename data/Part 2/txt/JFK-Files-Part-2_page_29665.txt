detailed calls were not made by Oswald or Os~ald could 
speak Spanish.

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in 
Mexico City? 
When the Warren c·ommission wrote about Lee Harvey 
Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded: 
The Commissi~n undertook an· intensive investi­
gation to determine Oswald's purpose and acti­
vities on this journey, with specific reference 
to reports thai Oswald was an. agent of tbe Cuban. 
or Soviet Governments~ As a result of its investi­gation, the Commissio~ believes that it has been 
able to reconstruct ~nd explain most of Oswald's 
actions during this ti~e.
