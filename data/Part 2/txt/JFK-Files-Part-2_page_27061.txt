3. The Intelligence Community view of the Cuban problem 
in this period was crystallized in NIE 85-2-62~ The Situation 
and Prospects in Cub::i., passed by USIB on- 1 August 1962, as 
.the intelligence foundation.for MONGOOSE. This estimate 
stated that: 
a. "By force of circumstances, the USSR is 
becoming ever more deeply committed to preserve 
and_ strengthen- the Castro regime. ·The USSR, 
however, has avoided any formal commitment to 
. protect and defend the regime in all contingencies." 
b. "We believe it unlikely that the Bloc will 
prov~de Cupa with the capability to undertake major 
independent military operations overseas. • We also 
believe it unlikely that the Blee will station in 
Cuba Bloc combat units of a~y description, at least 
for the pe;riod of this estimate." 
c. "The Soviets ... would almost. certainly 
never intend to hazard their own safety for Cuba's 
sake," but "have sought to create the impression 
that Cuba was under the protection cf their 
power ... " 
d. "We believe that the Blee will continue to 
limit its military assistance to Cuba /to defensive 
weapons?. Such a policy would not preclude the 
provision of. more advanced jet fighters, surface-to­
air missiles, and mod_ern radars, or even the pro­
vision of a token number of IL-28 jet light bombers ... "
