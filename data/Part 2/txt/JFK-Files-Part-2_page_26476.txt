Student and youth leaders Andres Soliz Rada, 
Dulfredo Rua, Walter Quisbert Barrios, and Alberto 
de la Barra. 
PCB leading members Mario Manje and Hilario

Alcides Monasterios, national deputy of the

6. In January 1963, there were 60 Bolivian 
scholarship students in Cuba who had attended com­
pulsory 20-day courses of.military instruction. 
The Cuban charge in.Bolivia reportedly said last 
month that Cuba expected to give more than 80 schol­
arships to Bolivians in 1963. 
7. The Bolivian government in June 1961, pub­
lished documents purporting to prove that left ex­
tremists had been corresponding with the Cuban Em­
bassy in an effort to obtain arms and instruction 
for pro-Castro "combat groups." While Bolivia has· 
had extensive paramilitary formations ever since 
the MNR defeated the armed forces and seized con­
trol, and while the extreme left of the MNR in 
particular has strong militia units, we know of no 
paramilitary formations linked directly with Cuban 
subversion. 
8. We assume, however, that some proportion 
of the 500 legal travelers received indoctrination 
while .in Cuba.
