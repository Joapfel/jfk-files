and ait of the tail surfaces. The Boeing design uses two engines nestled 
in the fuselage with their nozzles exhausting hot gases directly alongside 
the horizontal and vertical control surfaces. The full effect of this hot 
gas efflux is unknown. Assurance that longitudinal and directional stability 
was not impaired could not be obtained without extensive flight tests, in 
addition to considerable developmental wind tunnel testing~ Since flight 
testing cannot '.occur until late in the development phase, the Boeing design 
• .. .,. 
would impose an added degree of risk in terms of meeting an early opera-
tional date for the TFX. 
In addition, the Boeing thrust reverser feature, as the Fourth Evalua-
tion Report observed, adds considerably to the complexity and to the 
development task associated with the engine. The full impact of this 
problem could not be completely assessed because Boeing did not collaborate 
in detail with the engine contractor, Pratt and Whitney, on its proposed thrust 
reverser design and development. 
Speed brakes, as proposed by General Dynamics, are historically 
proven and offer a more straight forward approach to meeting the stated 
military requirement. Since speed brakes will, in themselves, exceed the 
' 
military requirement, the greater development risl< of thrust reversers must 
be weighed against their possible advantages. I want to point out that in 
selecting the General Dynamics proposal we retain the option to apply
