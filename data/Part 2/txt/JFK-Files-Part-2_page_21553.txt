wasn't. But he was at a meeting when the bills were delivered, 
and came over to Colonel Edwards'office. 
Mr. Wides. But you don't recall whether you ever knew 
from merely knowing it was a lethal pill, is that right? 
I._ 
Mr. O'Connell. I can't say -- to my personal knowledge, 
the discussion never came up when I was there. I don't think 
he is a dummy, and I don't is any dummy, and 
I think they had a general idea. 
But as far as I know they were never officially told. 
Mr. Wides. To your knowledge, before you went overseas 
no one else in the office of Security, Mr. Bannerman, Mr. 
White or Mr. Hall, none of those men or anyone else knew about 
the project, only yourself and Mr. Edwards? 
Mr. O'Connell. Well, I would say this, to my knowledge 
they were never briefed. However, I think I brought up an 
incident this morning where Colonel Edwards was on leave and 
colonel King called Mr. Bannerman, who was his 
deputy, and assumed that Bannerman knew all about it and starte 
talking about it, what are we going to do about 
this -- I don't know what the conversation was about. 
Bannerman called in and said, what was this all about? 
Mr. Wides. This was in 1962 before you left? 
And 
Mr. O'Connell. Yes. It was while I was up in the office. 
And I said, I don't have the authority to brief you on it.
