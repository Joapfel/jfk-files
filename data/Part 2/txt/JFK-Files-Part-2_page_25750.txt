o.f caatro which would trigger action on th_e part of the 
·u.s. A rule of thumb could be: such action aa would 
represent serious, realized or potential, danger to the 
stability of a Latin American state. By this criterion 
20 Castro-tr&ined men and four ton.a of arms introduced 
into northeast Brazil ·might not eonatitute a trigger, 
whereas the same effort by Castro in a Central American 
country might. The judgment can be unilateral and

revolution into eonatructive lines. 
The above scenario should not be commenced unless 
it is recogniZed that, although these actions are 
primarily designed to deter Castro from.his present course, 
he may very well persevere in his policy. Under such 
ci.rcumstances the U.S., having publicly em.barked on the 
doctrine, cannot then withdraw from the consequences .
