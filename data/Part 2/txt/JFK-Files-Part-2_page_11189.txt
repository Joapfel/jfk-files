Perfect arrangements to be advised on a current basis of 
any indication that the subject is engaged in subversive

Use form FD-154 in verifying addr~uses of security index 
-subjects when its use will facilitate the checking of the 
addresses. When FD-154 is not used in verifying addresses, 
a notation must be made on the J.ast FD-154, .l!'D-122, or E'D-128 
in the subject's case file showing the subject's current 
residence and brrsiness addresses and the date such addresses 
were verified. This must be done to assure that the file 
will contain all information concerning the status of the 
case and that the file will come to the attention of the 
Agent or field supervisor to determine if additional action 
is warranted at the ti~c of the verification of addresses. 
Each time that a senurity index subject's residence ard 
employment· are verified, the case must be reevalu:1.torl to 
assure that the subject is qualified for inclusion in the 
security index under the criteria for such inclusion. A 
notation to tl,e effect t}.~t t11e case has been revi,H:ed for­
this purpose shall be·maJe in thci fiie. 
If it is determined that the re·si<lcnce or busines:i a,lclress

changes to be m&de on the security index card. FD-122 
s·hculd be acco1:1:p1.n.i.ed by form FD-366 fen· dissemin~ticn to 
Secret ScrYice. Secret Service should be advised loc~illy 
by dissemination of FD-366.
