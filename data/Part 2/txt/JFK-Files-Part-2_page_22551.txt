The 1965 Federal inc6me tax return shows a 49 day 
trip to South America from 31 July to 17 September 1965. 
Originally ari extended trip had been approved to include 
the 9th World Youth Festival as planned for Algiers. 
The World Youth Festival was cancelled, ~ut a trip to 
cover Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, 
Paraguay, Brazil and Venezuela remained. Expenses 
were to be covered by the cover fund. In a memo con­
cerning his proposed South American trip for July 1965, 
Wiley advised that "The cover fund is sufficient to pay 
all expenses, and the income from the trip should be 
enough to return the money and show a profit (perhaps 
a very good one)." A travel voucher shows expenses 
for the trip 31 July 1965 to 17 September 1965 of 
$2234.72. The itinerary: New York City, Miami, Pan~ma, 
Bogota, Quito, Lima, Cusco, La Paz, Santiago, Cordoba, 
Buenos Aires, Asuncion, Iguape, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro,· Reclife, Belem, Manaus, Caracas, 
New York City. The cover accounting for 1965 shows the

No foreign travel is reflected in the Federal Income 
Tax Returns or files for 1966 or 1967. 
The 1968 Federal income tax return reflects a 55 day 
trip to Athens, Cairo, Inda-China, Manila, Taipei and 
Seoul. An 18 December 1967 memo to Chief, SRS, from C~~il 
C. Tighe related to his briefing Wiley regarding the 
up-coming trip by Wiley to Vietnam and Laos, warning him 
to exercise care and not expose himself unnecessarily to 
danger. 
An accounting of the expenses for the trip 16 January 
to 9 March reflects that air transportation was supplied 
by the Government of Vietnam. The itinerary shows: Athens, 
Bangkok, Vientiane, Saigon, Hong Kong, Macao, Manila, 
Taipei and Seoul. Total other expenses of $828.11 were 
incurred and are reflected as an expense in the 1968 cover 
accounting and offset against income.
