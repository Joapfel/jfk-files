OCCURRENCE: I 
"Immediately after },1ay 8, President Diem ordered a formal investigation 
of the Hue affairs. For this purpose he appointed a 3-man technical commission led by 
Major General Tran Van Don, the acting head of the army (General Don was considered a 
man of integrity by the Americans.)" The commission also included the Surgeon General 
of the Vietnamese Anny and its Chief of Ordinance. After extensive interrogation of 
witnesses General Don's mission cited plastic charges as the cause of the deaths on 
May 8. , ~~ 
"~t the ~i1~e, nonetheless, Diem'; regime claimed that plastic itn131]\~~;~d the deaths was

Nguyen Van Bang later at the trial of Majot:0-Dahg Sy said that "While we 
were inside, two loud explosions :suddenly reverberated on the veranda. Then came the 
sounds of broken glass-, gunshots,' and· exploding hand grenades." In the confusion Maj or 
Dang Sy heard the explosions also and in attempting to signal what he feared may be a 
Viet Cong attack fired three shots in the air. Unfortunately this was the prearranged 
signal authorizing his troops to·use grenades to disperse the crowds. At least 15 of 
thes& grenades were throw and the explosions caused at least 8 dead at the radio station. 
(95) This statement though, appears to be in conflict with later medical evidence corning 
from the Interior Minister which found that none of the bodies of the dead had metal 
splinters in their organs, but rather the weapons eA'J)ert said that the bombs were probably 
made of plastic and that "plastic is the arm of the Viet Cong guerilla." (95-96)
