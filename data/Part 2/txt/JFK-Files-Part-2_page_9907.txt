He recalled his third meeting with TANNENBAUM occu;ed 
about five days later at the same location, although this time 
TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three 
years of age. He advised her of the amount the University had 
deposited to RIHA's accC'un.t. At this time TANNENBAUM told him 
her real name was not GALY ·1 TANNENBAUM, but something else which 
she did not disclo.se~ and c:3.dded that she was about ready to leave 
town. _He advised of no contact with TANNENBAUM since their last 
meeting.

STEPHEN fISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the 
document mentioned above of January 5, 1968, and its historical 
sign:i.ficance disturbs him. He ~stated if RIHA was "not nbumped 
off 11 by TANNENBAUM~ then he assumes that RIHA1 s disappearance 
may have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter, 
which is pure conjec-'cure on his part. FISCHER-GALATI dlso recall:.::d 
that in September, 1968, Professor RIHA requested that,an advertise­
ment for a travel bureau be run in the "Eastern European Qu.::-.1.rterly, t~ 
which GALATI described as an international journal to promote cul­
tural contact with Eastern European Countries. He advised RIHA 
did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if 
RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Treasure 
Tours, 1010 St. Catherine Way, Montrea.l, Quebec, Canada. FISCHE~­
G~LATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometimes 
believes that RIHA could be in Canada. 
Professor FISCHER-GALATI advised that in April~ 1969 ~-
he contacted a Mr. FRITZ of the Central Intelligence Agen~y (CIA), 
Denver) Colorado, regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS 
RIHA of the University of Colorado. Hr. FRI'I'Z advised him that he 
had no knowledge of the matter but would check into same. Professo::-­
FISc;:;:r.:R-GA::'..:l'-:.TI stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who state:= 
the disappearance had nothing to do with the CIA and that RIHA1 s 
leav::.ng was a pe:t1 3onal matter connected with personal problems.
