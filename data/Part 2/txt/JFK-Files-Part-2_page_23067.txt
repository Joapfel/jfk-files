Aquiar; that name rings a bell with me, for what reason, I do 
not know. You know, we would have to run a name trac9.to get 
a rundown of what is in the files and what is in the central 
index for me to be able to comment on it. As I told you earlier 
I know that the J\gency is doing all these traces after they are 
completed and you get them and you w~nt me to take a look at 
it, I will b~ glad to do so. It may trigger some response. 
This name, Ramon Grau Scerio, it rings a bell with me. It 
is quite possible that he may have been a collection agent, just 
10 as is written here. I am making a deduction, but again, I would 
11 have to look at the name traces, but it is a name t.hat rings a 
12 bell with me. 
13 Mr. Daron. You do not remember him in connection with an 
14 attempt to poison the Prime Minister in June of 1965 as it says 
15 there? 
16 
l? 
Mr. Halley. No, I do not. 
Then the next name that is on here, that is familiar. 
18 Here is one that we discussed, that is J\MLASH-1. We already 
19 went over that one . 
20 The other name. was Manuel Ar,time, whom we. have talked 
21 about. 
22 Mr. Daron. Right. 
23 
24 
Mr. Baron. The last name on here -- I cannot find it -­
the! other name is Antonio Cuesta·valle. ·I cannot find it now, 
25 but that is the last name that rang a bell.
