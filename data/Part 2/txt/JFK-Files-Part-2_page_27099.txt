developing special applications for BW agents and toxins. The principal customer 
of its activities appears to have been the U.S. Army Special Forces. Its concern 
was both v1ith the development of suitable agents and deli very mechanisms for 
special use in paramilitary situations. These applications clearly included 
one-on-one situations in which clandestine delivery was a concern. Both standard 
BH agents and biologically derived toxins were investigated by the Division. 
Discussions with former Fort Detrick employees indicates that SOD was first

The CIA relationship with SOD was formally established in May 1952 through 
a memorandum of agreement with the Army Chief Chemical Officer for the performance

special capabilities of the Fort Detrick group and its access to biological 
materials of all sorts provided the Agency with eipertise and capabilities which 
were appropriate to its function and not otherwise available .. Discussions

grew to a high point in FY 1958 of $390,000 and then dwindled to $75,000 a year 
in the late l960's. Though there appear to be some gaps in available funding 
records, total Agency funding in the period from FY 1953 through FY 1970 is
