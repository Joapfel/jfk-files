To say that the two agencies work in complete harmony is 
not true. Conflicts of past years have had their influences. Fortu­
nately we have been successful in establishing very effective wor -
ing relatj.QM with several key" figures in the agency w o, ave been 
"ifery'cooperative and who are sincerely interested in getting the 
job done. Without this existing framework our relations with CIA. 
could degenerate into a chaotic state. 
Wi~h regard to differences with CIA, there were two 
situations during the past year which had a significant -bearing 
on the relations between the two agencies. Approximately a year 
ago we le.arned that CIA had established contact with a Cuban exile 
who had come into the U.S. and who had confessed to the agency 
that he had been trained as-a Cuban Intelligence Agent. CIA had 
this information for nearly a month g.efore notifying the Bureau. 
We lodged very vigorous protest tre: A win io Tama o The C5J 
other event which led to a heated con lict arose from information 
which we disseminated to the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board concerning Bureau's technical coverage of diplomatic 
establishments in this country. On May 15, 1963, McCone informed 
Mr. Belmont that a letter which the Bureau had sent to the afore­
mentioned Board should be retracted because the communi6ation 
included statements which incorrectly were attributed to him, the 
CIA Director. Mr. Belmont adamantly refused to retract the letter 
and after McCone asked for an apology; Mr. Belmont again made it 
clea.r that no apology was coming from him. Tlie Bureau never 
reiracted the letter because statements disseminated by us were 
predicated on information which had been given to us by two top 
II
CIA officials. The conflict ·was eventually resolved by McCone; 
. writing a letter to the Board and admitting that two of his 
subordinates had erroneously briefed the Bureau on a particular 
matter. 
STATURE OF MC CONE IN THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION_ 
McCone obviously enjoys acquiring and using power. He 
considers himself not only the head of a particular government 
agency but also "the· Direc't}or of Central Intelligence" and in
