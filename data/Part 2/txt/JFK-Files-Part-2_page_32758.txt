Subsystem and Aerospace Ground Equipment areas. The General Dynamics 
design had an edge in superso::r;iic q.ash capability and supersonic maneuvera­
bility at altitude. It h,as a low radar cross section and an integrated 
penetration aids system. For deceleration,_ it uses dive brakes in the 
air and brakes on the ground, providing a conventional but limited 
deceleration capability. The Boeing design has the edge in ferry capability, 
conventibnat:.w,eapori _carriage':,. loiter capability, and in landing perform­
ance. It has the advantage in low-altitude maneuvering capability. For 
deceleration it uses a thrust reverser which offers an excellent 
deceleration capability, but will require additional development effort. 11 
In the operational area, the Boeing proposal received the higher 
score, but the Report stressed that either de.sign was consid,ered acceptable 
from the users I viewpoint. 
In the "Production, Management and Cost" area, General Dy::r;iarni~s 
was rated higher than Boeing. In 11ScheduFng, ,i Generp.l Dynamics presented 
the better program. It was somewhat more detailed and better time phased. 
In the II Logistics" area, which includes the funct~onal elements of 
maintenance,. supply,. transportation and procurement, the Boeing proposal 
received a slightly higher rating over-all. 
It was clear that both designs met the first cond,ition prescribed in 
Mr. Gilpatric's letter of July 131 i.e., satisfaction of both Navy and Air 
Force that the designs represented signiffoant :i.mprovement to their 
tactical air capabilities. With this state of the record, the degree to which 
the two designs met the other tw9 cardinal conditions became crucial. You 
will recall that those two conditions were; ( 1) minimum divergence from a
