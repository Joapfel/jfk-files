"direct positive action" against the Castro brothers 
and Che Guevara, WH/4 .. records reveal interest, and 
possibly limited, direct participation, in a number 
of such activities~* 
,. rFor the Jnost part, ~owever, the various pieces 
of evidence that seemed'to implicate WH/4 in assas­
sination plots against Castro or other of the Cuban 
leaders proved to be cold trails. The peripatetic 
Howard Hunt clai~ed, even prior to the Senate inves-. ·-.,:. 
tigations, that after a visit to Havana in the spring 
of 1960,.he prepared .a report recommending among other 
things that the Agency should·: 
Assassinate Castro before or coincident 
with the invasion (a task. for Cuban patri­
ots) ... Barnes and Bissell read my report 
.... and said it would weigh in the.final 
planning ... So far as I have been able 
to determine no coherent plan was ever 
developed within CIA to assassi'nate 
' * As the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, 
Cabell pointed out to.Mr. Merchant that such action 
was highly dangerous both in conception and execution, 
and, further, he indicated that it was beyond the 
Agency's capabiiity. 7/ The Senate Select Committee 
chased its tail at some lengtliover the interpretation 
of the ·term "direct positive-action," as used by 
Merchant. Only someone (even a Senator) .who consist­
ently engaged and in omphaloskep-sis would have a 
problem understanding the meaning to be anything other 
than assassination.
