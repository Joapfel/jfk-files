Another of the questions which must be addressed 
in setting the stage of the Bay of Pigs operation is 
the failure ot' Richard Helms -- at that time Chief of 
Operat~ons (COPS) for the DDP -- to become more than 
marginally involved in the Cuban project. Oral inter­
views again provided the best explanations, and, con­
sequently, are entered into this record in rather ·full -
detail. Dick Drain, who became COPS/WH/4, made the 
following comments: 
Helms was COPS [Chief of Operations]. 
Either on his own volition, which I sus­
pect or on order·-- which I doubt -- Dick 
Helms completely divorced himself from this 
thing. I.mean absolutely! The one time 
that I .heard. from Helms during th~s entire 
project was ... I am sitting down there in 
my chair, as COPS of the project, on a 
Monday, having spent the entire goddamned 
weekend working with the guy who is now 
th_e head .. of MI-6 -- Maurice Oldfield, 
who was then the MI-6 resident in Washing­
ton -- trying to get an airplane and some 
Cubans. out of Montego Bay before the 
Brits· in Jamaica came back from their 
longweekend ... I am sitting there con­
gratulating myself that the plane is out, 
and the Cubans are out, and the British 
are back, and it h9-sn't hit the fan, and 
I get a telephone call from Dick Helms's 
long time secretary, "Mr. Helms would 
like to speak to you." Well, fine ... 
well, the whole thing on his part was so-
. . . to me . . . incredibly apologetic .-.. 
\three times he said to·me in different 
parts of the conversation ... "As you know, 
I have nothing to do with this project." 
What he did have to do with, ever since
