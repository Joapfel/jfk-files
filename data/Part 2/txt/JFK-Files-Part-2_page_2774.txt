Mr. Kent is indeed a professional in his fiel~JdL aiJ(i~xpert in 
propaganda operations which require area knowledge, technical 
know-how, and imagination. In a specialty where it is only too 
easy to go off the deep end, llr. Kent has always kept his wits 
about him and avoided parochialism. He is a lucid writer who 
focus,es on the essential. By nature, Mr. Kent is an impatient man 
who has certain biases which eo■etimes get into the way of his 
operational judge■ents. He is keenly aware of this and his efforts 
to remain a,s "uninvolved" as posl!lible are co-endable. In SWllDL.",ry·, 
llr. Kent is a "doern wbo in his field contributes much.

Mr. Kent bas no supervisery duties to perform.
