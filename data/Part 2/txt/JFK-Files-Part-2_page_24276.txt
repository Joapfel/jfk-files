supplemental financing -- i.e., within its regular budget --
and, therefore, these remain completely invisible in the Agency 
budget submission. 
D. Some General Considerations

etaries can sometimes be most effective operationally when they 
are large; indeed, as in Laos, there can be a thrust toward enormity 
imposed by the very nature of the operation. The dilermna is that 
large size conflicts with deniability: In areas of the world or 
types of activity where there is little commercial appeal or few 
operating conmercial firms, where would large-scale enterprises 
get financing but from the U.S. Government? Laotian operations
