SECRET 
COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL (contd) William M. Kent 
Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to 
reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in 
fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my 
own Staff. 
With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent 
is a :responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has 
to do, does it with a minimum of !use, writes clearly and to the point, 
is dedicated and in my judgment fully warrants an overall evaluation 
nf strong. The above comments will be shown to the :rater aa well 
a e the ratee.
