30TH ANO MARKET STREETS PHILADELPHIA. PA. 19101 
Serving the Greater Philadelphia and South Jersey Area 
Oct. 28, 1976 
Dear Dick: 
Here is my resume. 
I'm also happy to tell you that The Bulletin has granted 
me an extended leave of absence. In- fact, management, I am told, 
was "thrilled" with the idea. 
The leave was granted in record time. This was a surprise. 
I thought it would take weeks of negotiation. That's why f 
went ahead and requested it now instead of waiting. 
o·f course, I explained in writing, to The Bulletin that 
if for some reason the House does not provide sufficient funds 
for the dual investigation, the deal is off. 
Now that The Bulletin has been apprised of the situation, 
I feel very little notice is required. This means I could start 
as your press secretary soon after things are worked out with 
the House committee. 
I hope that is soon. I am anxious to get involved as 
early as possible. 
Meanwliile, I'm reading extensively in the Kennedy-King 
literature. I'm also meeting with an old friend, the press 
officer for the Federal Energy Administration here, to get 
some ideas about dealing with the media from the other side 
of the fence. 
I will be in Washington, Monday and Tuesday, Nov. 8 and 9, 
NEARLY EVERYBODY READS THE BULLETIN
