SUBJECT: HPSCI Request for staff brief on JFK assassination 
HPSCI staffer Susan Ouellette liked John Pereira's 27 Mar 96 telecon on the JFK assassination issue (see attached note) so much that 
she'd like to schedule a staff brief for sometime in the next two weeks. She'd like the brief to concentrate on two issues mentioned by 
John in the telecon: 
--Differences with the Board on release of certain info (names of former employees, identification of stations), 
and --Current appeal to the White House of decesion of Board to release certain info we redacted. 
Defer to John and DO addees to work out who'll brief (see separate note from DO/ORMSlljµrie §_oodwfn)re Bill McNair.) 
Ouellette suggests c. 1000 either Apr 2, 3, or 4, or Apr 9, 10, 11 since HPSCI recess schedule is pretty open. 
John, pis advise your timing preference. Thanks.
