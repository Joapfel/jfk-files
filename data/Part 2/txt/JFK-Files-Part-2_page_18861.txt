SUBJECT: 
Re teleohone call from Mr. C. E. HENNRICH of the 
Burea.u toda_y rega.rding this matter. . " 
Attached is a memorandum submitted by Special Agents 
ARTHUR J. ACHENBACH., KEVIN F~ FLANAGAN., DONALD A. GRUENTZEL, 
JOHN H. KENOYER., ROBERT G. JlcGEA.RY and JOSEPH E. SCULLY 
describing the surveillance maintained by them-on FED0SEEVA., 
her husband., SAM·JAFFEE and his wife on the evening of July 9., 
1954., 
I have ta.1.ked to the Agents who handled this sur-
veillance which was being conducted in accordance with in- . 
tcJ •. I 
structions issued under the Soviet Intensification Program., .., \ 
The purpose of these surveillances is to determine whether the\\ \ 
subjects under su,rveillance are engaged in intelligence or \. ., 
espionage activitfes and to identify any contacts which may·be 
observed in the course of the surveillance. ~ , .. :.: :-:· lC) "·· . .,. . 
As explained by the Agents., and as wtll b_~e ,toted from 
the attachment, the surveillance was in·itiated at 8:3'? P.JJ • ., at 
which time this party were observed walking from the Qhas·tle·t;on._ 
Hotel to the Oolony Restaurant. During this period, which oon­
_stituted approximately twenty minutes, no activities·:whatever 
···on the part of the subjects under surveillance indicated any { 
_awareness·· or any consciousness of being surueilled. • As the - - 1 
. party left the restaurant at 11:18 P.lJ., they were noted to be , ./ l 
• • on the lookout for a surveillance, even going to the extent of [ j ·j 
scrutinizing passing persons and traffic. The Agents noticed ~---~ 1 1 th is awareness immediate] y and proceeded with appropriate +·-,zl) 
~ discretion. It would appear tha·t; something may have been said ·; ·d, l 
J"/-~~c, during the time the party we1·e in the restaurant about being ] ! 
..,. followed by the FBI, wh tclJ, may account .for the sudden awa1·eness . : r..: i
