Mr. Bundy. No. 
Mr. Schwarz. What context did it come up in? 
Mr. Dundy. It came up in a context in which it was being 
described to me by someone else. An~ that is really about 
as far as I can.take it with preci~ion. 
Mr. Schwarz. WAs it described to you by someone else 
as a capacity in being? 
Mr. Bundy. As a capacity -- and this is not something 
I w~nt to be too certain about, Mr. Schwarz, but my recollec-
tion would be that it was a capacity coming into being . 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, receiving that information, did you 
take any steps to discourage or dissuade the person, whoever 
it was, who was describing to you the capacity coming 
into being? 
Mr. Bundy. What I recollect is that I was satisfied with 
the description I received on two points. 
First, that this was not an operational activity, and 
would not become such without two conditions: first, that 
there be a desire or a request or a guidance that there 
should be planning against some specific individual; and 
second, that there should be a decision to move against an 
individual. 
Being satisfied that these two things were not happen­
ing -- and I am now giving you a reconstruction rather than 
a precise recollection -- I am confident that what I did was 
TOP SECRET
