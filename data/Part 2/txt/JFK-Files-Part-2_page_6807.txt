NOTE FOR: Director, Center for the Study 
of Intelligence 
Deputy Director 
Office of Congressional Affairs 
FROM: John Pereira 
Chief, Historical Review Group 
SUBJECT: JFK/Possible Letter from 
Congressman Burton to EXDIR 
Jeremy Gunn, Executive Director of the JFK Board, told 
HRG yesterday that Congressman Dan Burton may well write a 
letter to the EXDIR expressing concern about whether CIA 
will be able to meet the deadline for declassification of 
assassination-related records. Burton chairs the Government 
Reform and Oversight Committee which has cognizance over the 
JFK Board. 
Gunn said that he briefed members of Burton's staff 
last week and told them he was concerned that the Agency may 
not have enough resources dedicated to JFK to finish the 
review of documents by 1-September 1998. Gunn showed the 
staffers the recent exchange of letters between the Board 
and the EXDIR on the same issue. According to the staffers, 
Burton has a strong personal interest in the release of the 
assassination records. The staffers gave Gunn the 
impression that Burton's strong interest will prompt him to 
write to the Agency. 
During our discussion with Gunn, we reviewed with him 
the Agency's clear commitment to declassifying all 
assassination records. We also explained that we have 
shifted four additional contractors to the· JFK project, and 
will shift more if necessary, even at the cost of slowing 
down or stopping other declassification efforts.
