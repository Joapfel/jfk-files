paramilitary group in Cuba whose primary mission was the 
collection of intelligence, whose secondary mission might be to 
organize a resistance and, unbeknownst to me, might have had 
their own ideas which were never consulted with us, you know, 
never discussed with us, through the communications channels 
that we had, who may have been thinking, may have planned, and 
.. -
may have attempted, to implement assassination operations. 
I do not feel under the command and control m2chanism that 
existed that I ~ould exercise through the Station over such a 
10 situation that I could be held responsible for that. Therefore, 
11 I cannot accept your question on the secondary or tertiary 
12 situation because I have no knowledge of those. You may have 
13 some knowledge and you can confront me with some statement by 
14 some Cuban who said that this was part of his mission. I have 
15 to look at that at the time.

Mr. Daron. We will go over some statements, but in trying 
to recover this ground one more time, I think it is important 
to distinguish an attempt to pin the responsibility on you, 
19 which I am not trying to do by my questioning 
20 Mr. Halley. That is a complicated question . 
21 Mr. Daron. The attempt to simply -- undoubtedly, the 
22 attempt to simply bring out your knowledge and any awareness 
23 that you may have had of any kind of operation that had assassi 
24 tion as one of its objectives, and also involved the CIA to 
25 any extent. That is what I am asking you for.
