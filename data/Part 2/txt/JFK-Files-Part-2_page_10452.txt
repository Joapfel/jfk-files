participation by National Security Agency. It is 
designed in antic~pation of the Identity 64 
. in Washington. The listening post was 
obtained by using the Agency covert mechanisms 
for procuring the property. New systems are 
being designed and produced by using TSD' s covert 
contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

chased iron~ TSD '\-Vero installed in Identity 65 
by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install­

made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI 
listening post on 8 - 9 November 197 2, proved that 
the target equipment no longer functioned and was 
believed discovered by the occupants.

an on-the-shelf capability to e::1gage in photo and
