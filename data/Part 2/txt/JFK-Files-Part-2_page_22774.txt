Mr. Angleton. Well, I think, no question, it's the 
Soviet bloc services that represent the m4jor threat because 
they aro really a small, they are directly subor.dinated to the

i 
central coll\l':\ittee and to the hasic objectives, as I've seen thc::11 
all my life to tho change and balance of military power. 
Further, that practically all intelligence operations ! more: 
7 and more have political objectives, and I ~1ink it is the fact 
8 t~at nince '59 they have elevated the Cuban intelligence and 
9 all of the other bloc services to a very high degree of 
10 efficiency, that they are coordinated and they work as equals. 
11 l\nd I think that is the major threat, that is the 
12 inability of the FBI by lack of personnel nnd manpower to be 
13 able to cover these people. There isn't th'c minirn.:i.l cover.:ige. 
14 The 2eople they cover are people who have been "identified," 
15 and I defy anyone to have a list of id~ntified agents in this 
16 country. 
17 Now that is the legnl sicle of it. ~low the ·larger part 
le 
11
of it is the ille9al, where there's been little or no success.
