Mr. Baron. Let us pick out some specifics and discuss 
them briefly here. 
Near the beginning of this article, it mentions that JMWAVE 
Station operated within an annual budget of well in excess of 
$50 million. 
Would that be accurat~ to you? 
Mr. Halley. I do not recall whether that is an accurate 
figure. We would have to go back to th<! records.· You know, as 
I explained to you earlier, the start of the operation taking 
10 place in March and escalatid,,up_ to· a hiqh:point;and.then

dropped off. In the budgetary cycle, we ar'! dealinq with a 
mass of figures, and I would not want to give you an inaccurat~ 
answer. That is something that could he researched -- we have 
the files -- rather than speculate for you on the buildi.ip and 
reduction in the operation. I do not feel that is useful~ 
Mr. Daron. As a ballpark figure, would you be able to 
place the annual budget of the Station in the ~eighborhood 
of tens of millions of dollars? 
Mr. Halley. No, I would not, because of this transition, 
you know, period, the costs were very high in the beginning to 
get a start-up op~rat!on, brouqht to a certain peak, and then 
tapered off and starting to be peeled back. I would not want 
23. to draw a figure of 
24 Mr. diGenova. What would th~ start-up cost? 
25 . Mr. llal ley. In terms of what they involved or dollars?
