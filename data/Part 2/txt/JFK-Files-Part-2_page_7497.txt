0ity- is :undergoing a reformation. Tho company Teletonoa de Mexico, S.A., 
, bai,•·sub-oontracted thi8 work ot cleaning up and reorganizing the phone 
',B)'Stem: to the 1ndepenrlent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up ooused nnd 
, old -lines, putting 1n new and spare lines, redefining exchanR() areas, 
\1,ay1ng; undergrOW'ld cables., etc. f.ventuall.y- we should be better off be­

aa.uoe• there should be more surplus lines. The renovntion v.ork has 
:!hsmpered .much of the LIIBAT work. principaJ.].y because J11.any or the lines 
\now ·aw underground and we carmot get access to them before they enter 
, tho.:cent-ral. This is particularly truo with reapect to the Czech Em~ 
i'.'.baan;y, to whose telephona linos we connot obtain accoas fl"Ol11 the vnntago

: , • :3• WIL5TKn said that we try to keep trnck or the activities or 
li' trJntel 11 but since they- seem to attack "Colonias 11 at rnndorn., we have no 
'prior warning or their presence in a certain area. 
4. In the recent past. I1'3:rlco has been using houses for listing 
posts £or security- roa.sons. ~le have inore control ovor the access of 
phone coropany 1nsp;,ctors or repnirman to houses. Jtowevor, m1dar new 
regulations. all now Dpnrtment buildings fllUSt havo telephone linoo in­
stalled in tho building by the phone company during the construction 
phaae. This means that tho lines and thoir destination are concealad. 
HILSTED proposed that this vill mean we can again use apartments since 
we oon siphon off a line des-tined for use by another tenant in such a 
uay- that the phone company cnnnot trace its destination without tearing 
the b'U.lding apart ond we can then install a separate line to the build­
ing and hook up_ the subscriber to this line which, it checlmd, will 
belong to a legitimate aubscribor. 
S. One system which hos been used effectively is to take one-half 
or two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two t~Llf 
pair& than tom one good pair which we can use. 
6. WII.STETl explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a 
regular telephone. This entails the purchase or a telephone company 
bond, wbioh later can be eold.
