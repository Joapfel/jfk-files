OCCURRENCE: On October 5, 1963, MC CONE sent, to sore locations, inclucling SAIGON the 
following ressage: "Believe assassination discussions most careful handling. In general 
best line is no line so that it is clear that we are sticking to position of having no 
responsibility for actions of any of various contending Vietnrurese groups. We certainly can­
not be in the position of stimulating, approving, or supporting assassination, but on the 
other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might 
receive even partial knowledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of DIEM. We be­
lieve in gaging ourselves by tal-dng position on this matter opens door too easily for probes 
of our position re others, re support of regiITE, etc. Consequently, believe best approach 
is hands off. However, we naturally interested in intelligence o~. ~~ ?:µc~}arl!-:":'.'•This res-
