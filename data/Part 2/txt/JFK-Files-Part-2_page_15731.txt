:)Ur uJ1dersbnding of V..arxism-Leninism and ol the . Chinese revolution ·was dur:i.ng • our • •

:,f the truth that would save the country and the people. This moves us to song and· 
,>:.'!ars·. But it was only after World War I and .the October Revolution in Russirl that 
·.;e. found Harxism-~ninism, the best of truths, the. best Gf weapons for libera·~ing. •

-~-he War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party,· basing itself on the universal truth· -­
.j.f Marxism-Leninism, ha·s taken a further step in its study of the concrete practice . • 
.:::f this war and in its study of China and the world today, and has -also made a be­
:;inning in the study of Chinese history. ··These are a11 very good· signso . 
However~ we still have shcrtc0mings, and very big ones too.· Unless we correct
