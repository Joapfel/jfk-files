the etaff, on its own and wi~hout coordination with the 
Z'I divieion, had passed to {!_oreign liaiso.ii} a copy of a ·rtss 
containing division-controlled NOFORN information. 
Paper and Re.cords; Disposal and Reintegration 
The paper-and-records problem was ·high on the agenda of 
issues that needed to be addressed. The quantity that the 
Angleton vaults and safes contained was almost overwhelming, 
and much of this had never been ~ade available outside the

Kalaris had no problem in principle with the concept of 
keeping certain information within the staff, as SE did with

proper activity, particularly vis-a-vis US pGrsons. For 
the CI staff, this heavily involved definitions of subjects 
~nd activities that merited staff attention. Executive 
o~de~s would later provide a framework; albeit often 
maddeningly imprecise, for these questions, but the first of 
those addressing US foreign intelli~ence activitites, E.O.
