1. Problem. To .provide planning cuidance for US response to a coup in 
Cuba in' order to assure that Ul3 intervention, if undertaken, results in 
replacement of the CODDDunist government with one acceptable to the United 
States; 
2. Assumptions . 
a, The le$ders of the coup may or l!l8Y" not be aware, from previous 
contact with CIA, that if they agree to and appear capable of meetine; 
certain specified conditions ·(see 'paragraph 2.d. below), their revolt 
will be supported by the tJS if a tJS "special team" (see paragraph 3,b,(l) 
below) confirms that the criteria for support have been adequately met, 
Thus, the coup cou1d be triggered. in one of two wa;ys: The leaders, in 
secure.radio contact with CIA, implement their plan with US concurrence 
and establish a Provisional Government in full expectation of forthcomins 
tJS support barring a complete and immediate crushing of the uprising; or, 
less acceptably, the lt:aders, in the belief that the--J can meet ·probable 
criteria: for tJS support, initiate the coup vi~hout consulting with or .. 
obtaining t_he con_currence_ of· the tJS but establish a Provisional Govern- _ 
ment, hoping that the ·US will intervene, 
b, If the US had prior knowledge ofthe coup, up to forty-eight 
hours would be-required after initiation of the action to introduce into 
Cuba and receive reports trom ·a "special team" wich would obtain in-
formation to assist in making a decision to support the insurgents; if the 
US did not have prior knowledge, a longer t:llne would be required,
