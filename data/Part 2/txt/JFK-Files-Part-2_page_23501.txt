Biographical Background

1962-67 
National Security Council staff member 
State Department, member of Policy Planning Council 
Chronology of Events 
Summer, 1960 Johnson attended a meeting of the NSC to discuss 
developments in the CONGO. "At some time during that 
discussion, President EISENHOWER said something 
I can no _ longer remember his - words -- that came 
across to me as an order for the assassination 
of LUMUMBA ... There was no discussion; the meeting 
simply moved on." • 
--Johnson said he might have omitted the statement 
from his de-briefing memo due to its sensitivity. 
-- J. said probably Allen DULLES and Gordon GRAY 
were present at the meeting (in the Calinet Ro6.). 
--The formal record of decision by the NSC is 
unlikely to contain infommation on this subject, 
he said. 
--The memos which Johnson did on the meetings would 
be with-President Eisenhower's papers. (10) 
"I was surprised :t ... that I would ever hear a President 
say anything like this in my presence or the presence 
of a group of people. I was startled."
