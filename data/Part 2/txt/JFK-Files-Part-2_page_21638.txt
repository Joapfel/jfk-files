Mr. Schwarz. Now, that purports to be from LTG Bennett 
and has the text in it which you sent on 
Mr. Phillips. Yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. And what is your best recollection as to 
who handed you that document? 
Mr. Phillips. I cannot say definitely who did that. 
There were many occasions when Bill Broe would walk into the 
office and say, here is something to send. There were others 
which would come in a manila env~lope with a yellow 
forwarding slip on it. There are times,! am sure, when I 
would go into Bill Broe's office, and he would say, by the 
way, send this. 
I simply cannot recall the circumstances·· in which some­
one handed me that and said, send it to Chile. And I was paying 
less attention to those things, because I was in effect the 
postman for people doing other .things. 
Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any recollection at all 
about this document? 
Mr. Phillips. No, I am afraid I don't. 
Mr. Schwarz. What is your reading of the signature on 
that document? 
Mr. PHillips. Well, it certainly looks like the sig-
nature which was on the other document .which was said to be 
Philpott's. But I am not an authority on these things.
