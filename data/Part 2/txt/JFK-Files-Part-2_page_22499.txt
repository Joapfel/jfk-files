"Because of the obvious value of 
having access to such an index, the writer 
(McCord) recommends that we encourage the 
continuation of Wiley's index project in 
any way in which we are able to further 
such work." 
(There is no objective evidence in the file other than 
the above to support Wiley's contention that he was given 
encouragement by Mr. DaLoach of the FBI to continue the pro­
ject.) 
The above was brought to the attention of Harlan 
Westrell (Chief, Counterintelligence Branch, SRS), who 
in turn brought the natter to the attention of Colonel 
Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early 
Deceiilber 1955. 
Via a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord 
informed i·iestrell of the receipt of additional correspon­
dence from Wiley, and McCord incluri~d a rehash of the 
m~tter including statements: 
"I hope the 0::fice of Security 
can encourage the continuation of the 
pr~ject, at least until the index is 
completed up through 1940, which would 
take about rinother year of work by Wiley. 
The index has considerable potential CE 
(counter espionage) value to this Office, 
for one thing, by virtue of the fact that 
there will be numerous heretofore unidenti­
fied Communists' names turn up in the 
index, some of whom went underground 
during the World War II years. The 
index may give us the one clue neces-
sary to detect any such penetration 
existing within this Agency. The value 
in protecting the Agency thereby is of 
course inestimable. The continuation 
of the project would have other merits, 
which we have discusse<l previously." 
~!cCord also reco1.-,r:1er'.ded that, should the project f:-ii 1, 
.. ' ~he;:_t:gc~cy consider ei;:ploying Wiley.
