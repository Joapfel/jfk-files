security of the United States. I consider it a patriotic 
dµty to so cooperate and agree to maintain this relation­
ship in strict confidence. I understand that I am not~ 
Federal employee and will not represent myself as such. I 
further agree not to make any disclosure -or exploit in any 
way information which I may obtain or any activity in which 
I may engage on beha~f of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
both while I am actively associated with the Federal Bureau of

Informants, particularly in Communist Party, often must execu·l;e party 
questionnaires and in doing so should be instructed to be extremely 
careful not to jeoparidze their position as informants;_ If ne·cessary, 
each item in questionnaire should be discussed with informant . 
9. Informant's activity in organizations 
a. Inforw~nts in organizations must be impressed with necessity of 
carrying on normal activity, such as canvassing, sale, and dis­
tribution of literature, leaflets, etc. 
b. • When feasible, informants should be instructed to accept direction 
from leaders; request instruction and interpretation of organiza-. 
tion's precepts; request leaders to furnish sources for study 
purposes; and enter discussions, not quietly sit back as observers. 
c. Changes in organization's conduct, policy, or strategy should be 
reported on as they occur. Have informants give their opinions of 
motivation behind such changes, but be certain opinions are lab~led 
as such.

in order to gain higher ·positions, but in such manner as to avoid 
suspicion.
