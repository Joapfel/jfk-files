although they subsequently developed a close friendship. 
(O'Connell, p. 52). 
Harvey, O'Connell and Roselli met for 
a second time in New York on April 8-9, 1962 (I.G., p. 43). A 
notation made during this time in the files of the Technical Ser-
vices Division indicates that four poison pills were given to O'Connell 
on April 18, 1962 (I.G., pp. 46-47). The pills were passed to Harvey, 
who arrived in Mia.mi on April 21, and found Roselli already in touch 
with Varona (I.G., p. 47). He gave the "£_ills to Roselli, explaining 
that "these would work anywhere and at any time with anything" (Roselli, 
p. 31). Roselli testified that he told Harvey that the Cubans intended 
to use the pills to assassinate Che Guevara as well as Fidel and Raul 
Castro. According to Roselli's testimony, Harvey approved of the 
targets, stating "everything is all right, what they want to do" 
(Roselli, p. 34). 
Varona requested arms and equipment as 
a quid pro quo for carrying out the assassination operation (O'Connell, 
pp. 53-54). Harvey, with the help of the CIA's Miami station

an assumed name and delivered the equipment to a parking lot 
(Harvey, 6/25, p. 63). The keys were given to Roselli, who watched 
the delivery from across the street with O'Connell (O'Connell, pp. 92-93).
