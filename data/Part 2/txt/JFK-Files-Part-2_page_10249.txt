harass the Republican National Convention in Miami. Florida, 21-24 August 1

American anthvar acth-ists and representatives of the Dc:r.oc:ratic Republic 
o! North Vietnam (DRV) and the Proyisional Revolutionary Govern"rnent of 
South Vietnam (PRG), c.u~rcntly available information indicates that the 
DRV /PRG officials made no efforts to. ericouragc or give guidance to the 
American participants \vith respect to the upcoming Republican National 
Convention·. Private discussions, sc;nr~te from the meetings with the entire 
American delcgatiou, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;
