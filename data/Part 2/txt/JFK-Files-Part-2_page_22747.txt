Now, I have never seen the post mortem of the whole projec 
on the estimation, but I would assume that any estimator who 
received information by letter or memorandum, hand~carricd, I 
! 
quoting Gromyko, would tend to discount tho fact that the Arabs; 
I 
were about to attack Israel where they would have to depend on 
Soviet arms, and therefore the question of the Yom ·Kippur war • i 
would be out of the question. In other words, that one report,! 
I give it as an example, 
Now, inc.lependently a study group of t,he Joint Chiefs came 
up with the whole question of Soviet diginformation, strategic 
disinformation to put us off balance on our estimating process.: 
~Jow, in our own J\gency we were heavily frowned upon for 
raising these questions, th:J.t there was a strong clement of 
Soviet deception and disinformation that had been injected into. 
the intelligence collecting program. 
Mr. Miler. Prior to the Yom Kippur war, 
Mr. Angleton. Prior to that. But the important thing 
is that that source who provided the Bureau with that infor­
mation has been providing information over a number of years, 
but no one has made a study of information in hi~dsight in 
order to evaluate that source. 
And I could go into many more sensitive cases of where 
again intention has come through a highly questionable source, 
and yet there has been no re-examination. There has been no 
groupin<J or forum in whi9h there can be any disputation. Eac-:,
