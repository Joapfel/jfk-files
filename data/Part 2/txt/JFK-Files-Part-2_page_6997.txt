[ 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 [ 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
25 August 1993 
NOTE FOR: All HRG Members 
SUBJECT: Briefing of HPSCI on Denied JFK Documents 
This is to let everyone know that HRG has been asked to 
brief the HPSCI staff on the 10,000 pages of JFK materials 
that we have denied in full (so far). 
The request came from HPSCI Chairman Dan Glickman, who 
apparently anticipates questions from others in Congress 
about the denied documents. 
Among the questions we are asked to address in the 
briefing are the following: 
- How many documents are involved (as opposed to 
pages)? 
- What specific types of sources and methods are 
we protecting? 
- What is the review process? 
- Who made the judgments to deny the documents? 
- Are there provisions for continuing review of the 
denied documents? 
We've asked that the briefing not take place until the 
week of 30 August, but HPSCI may want it sooner.
