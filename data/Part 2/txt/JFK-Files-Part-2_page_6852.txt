files aften accrue totally unsubstantiated information which can 
be fairly characterized as gossip, but which do get into the 
files when a total investigation is done; and third, where we've 
made a specific promise of confidentiality to a particular 
informant. • 
Before I ask you about"those three, can I just ask, 
are there any other areas of documents that you as di:r_e_~t9r: _ of _________________ _ 
- the CIA· beli·eve- should·-·not --be-·relefased1nl:ermso1-a generic 
category like these? 
GATES: No, I would only include in the protection of 
sources also the protection of intelligence methods. But I 
think you've captured it. 
REP. SCHIFF: Let me just go back on each of these 
briefl,y. 
On protection of personnel records, why would those 
have gotten--I understand what you're talking about. I think we 
all do matters where th~re is internal monitoring of your own 
agents, which I understand is a necessity at times, why would 
those records have gotten into the assassination records on 
President Kennedy? Why are they mixed in there, do you know? 
GATES: I don't really know, Mr. Schiff. I think, as 
I understand it, from the materials that were prepared for me, a 
great deal of documents were sweptup in the material that is 
kept, and as my statement indicates, I don't think I read this 
part of it: These files contain everything from the most· 
mundane newspaper articles, which are obviously not classified, 
or shouldn't be, to the most sensitive intelligence sources. 
. And so I think it's just a hodgepodge. As I also· 
indicated, part of the problem that we have in going through ---- ---·····--­
these documents-i-s··-that they ··,rre -riot indexed; they are not 
catalogued; and they really have no organization to them. 
So when I started asking some months ago what was •in 
the documents, what.did we have, it actually took quite some 
time even to perform a survey to get some kind of idea of-what 
kinds of records were in there. ~ 
But I assume that these kinds of:things were just 
swept up with a lot of other material.
