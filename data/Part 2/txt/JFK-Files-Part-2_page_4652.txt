MW: You sure it's our Carter? 
SH: Yes, Marshall Carter. Take a look at the page. I've 
got a copy of the page at home, I should have brought 
it. 
MW: Send us a fax. 
SH: All right, I'll dig it up. You may have to remind me 
again. I got it through the courtesy of Sy Hersh. It 
is now available as a public document. When I saw 
that, as a matter of fact I hadn't yet gotten it .... Sy 
once called me when he was still doing his research on 
the book, and we had talked about a guy working for 
Bobby, and he kept on asking me, who? who? who? I said 
"Not me, I'm not going to tell you the name." He 
called me on the phone one morning and he said, "How 
does Fiscalini strike you?" I said, "where in the 
goddamned hell did'youever get that name?" He told 
me. He said "It's from Angie Novella's appointment 
logs." I said run that by me again, slowly. Well 
because it's got Ford and Fiscalini but it could be 
Ford. He gave me Fiscalini. There were only two guys 
in the world that I knew of that had that name. We 
never told Harvey, we never told Bruce Cheever. Didn't 
need to. Theoretically we were professionals. 
MW: You just had it because you had to clear it. You 
basically had to sign his vouchers and make sure his 
travel was getting paid for and everything. 
SH: That's all we did. If you've got the finance records 
you can find out where he went and every time he went, 
but if I know Charley he probably fixed it up in such a 
way. I'm trying to remember the vouchers. He fixed it 
up in such a way that that didn't really show. He 
wouldn't ask for stuff, When Sy said "Fiscalini", I 
said "Ydu got me hands down." I said "It's the only 
time I ever lied to you." It ~as true. It was the 
only time I ever held anything back. When I start 
talking I know my limits. 
BL: Did you lie to him or you just didn't tell him?
