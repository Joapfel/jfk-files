HEREIN I BY ~ lo 
DATE 
"" Mr0 Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed, f'Jr/'\ ~/1 that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought - -:· .. ~ '.- l 
up to dateo 
This is an excellent _suggestion and we have alre&ay 
started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to 
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's ''Wash­
ington.Spring Project" sholl.ld serve again to remind top-level 
officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character 
of Kingo 
As you know' King Is ''Washington Spring Project" was 
originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our 
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's 
group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals 
to participate:in the demonstration and the date for the project 
has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968. 
Because of the importance of doing a thorough.job on :1 
this, we will' conduct an exhaustive file review to bring togetheV 
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it y 
in a hard-hitting mannero To make the brief timely, we will • 
have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968. _ _::.. __________ . - -·-·-·----·•-------·--- .... --,- ,., ----·· ...,,..,.,., ____ ......... _______ .... ~ .. '
