There is no tim<:~ 0u.ay -to. talk auout the .q.tian of sterep.: • .. •• • 
typed Party, v.rri tinr I shall discuss it at e .. no·\;ner rneetihgo Stcr­
·e-otypcd Party writing is a vehicle fer filth~ a form 0£' expression 
for subjectivism and sectA..rianismo It rlocs people harm nnd damageE 
the revoluti0n, and we must G8t rid .of t t. C(Jmpletely~ 
To combat subjectivism wi mus~_propagatc matcrialisn and dia­
lectics •. Hov1ever, .• ther.~e A.re many· comrades in our Party who lay 
no stress on the propaganda cithtr of materi~lism or of .dialectics 
Some tolerate subjectivist propaganrla and regard it with equunim~ 
ity. They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to 
propagate materialism and.do not give it a thought or express any 
opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stt1ff .. This is not 
the a ttitnde- of a Communist.. Jt alJ.ows many of· our comrades to: · 
be:poisoned by subjectivist· ide~s, which.nu~b their sensitivity~ 
. We· should therefore· launch a carnpa.i.gn of enlightenment wi-'"hin~ 
the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the .fog·· of, sub--- .· ·. 
jectivism and dogmatism and· should ca11· upon them to b0ycott sub- .• 
jectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing, Such evils 
are .-like Japanese goods, for only our .enemy wishes us: .. to preserve.·.• : 
them and ·continue to befuddle "ourselves with them,.· so we should -.. , 
advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanes& 
·goods, We should boycott all the wares of subjectivism, sectar- ., • 
i~nl8m. and stereotyped Party writine, ·make their s~le ~ifficult,'· •• 
and not allow their.purveyors to ply their trade b~ exploiting the_ 
low theoretical level in the Party. Our ~o~rades must develop 
a good nose for this purpose, they should take a sniff at everthing :· 
and dis~inguish the &ood from the bad before they deci<le whether· ... 
to welcome i_t or· boycott it,. Communists must always go into the 
whys and wherefores of anything, use· their ovm heads·· and carefully 
think over wl1ether or not it ~orrcsponds to reality .and is really·· 
well founded; on no account should ·they follow blindly and. enc our- • : 
age ·slavishness. . • • • 
Finally, in opposing subject1v'ism, sectarianism and stereotyped.·. 
Party writing we must have in m1.nd two p,1rposcs, • first, "learn_•···.· • 
from past mistakes to avoid future ones", ~nd second, "cure the 
·Sickn·ess to save the patient".· ·The· mistakes· of the past mµst ,1:,e .• · • • 
expqsed without sparing anyone's sensililitiesr it is necessary to 
analyse and criticize.what was bad in the past with a.scient~:eic . 
attitud~ so that w6rk in the futur6 will be done more carefully .. •• 
and done better.· This-is what ·is meant by ''learn from pait mis-_ 
takes to avoid future ones'', But o~r aim in exposing.errors and~. 
critizing shortcomings, like that· of a doctor curing a sickness,, 
-is so~cly to save the patient and not t 1J doctor him to death,'· A· _ 
person with a~pendicitis is saved when the surgeon removes 'hi~- ap-. _· 
•. pendix. So long as ·a pel·son who has made mistakes joes not .h1ide _· .. 
his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his _mist:ikes_until.' 
··.he is beyond curet so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to • 
b? c1:1red -an9 to mend his ways, .. He uhould welcome hirn and· cure hi_s .··. 
sickness so: that he can become a good comrade,• W~ can never succeed,; 
·if-we just.let ourselv~s go, one must never be rough a~d rash but.:, 
must adopt the approach of "curing the· sickness to save. th0 pat_iont·~- •• • , 
which is ·the only correct Rnd. e::'fccti vc method, . . ... · , .•· . .
