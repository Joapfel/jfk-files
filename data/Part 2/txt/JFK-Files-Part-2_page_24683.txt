(b) • A~ent QJWIN' s I1ission in the Con~: .November-December 
1 60 
QJWIN was a foreign citizen with a criminal background, 
recruited in Europe (Memorandum to CIA Finance Division, Re: 
Paymen~s to QJWIN, 1/31/61), and supervised by CIA officer Arnold 
Silver. In November 1960, at O'Donnell.'s request (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, 
p. 19), agent QJWIN was.dispatched to the Congo by Silver, to under­
take a. mission that "might involv:e a large clement of. personal risk." 
(CIA Cable IN 36814, 11/2/60.)*· 
A dispatch from the CIA headquarters on hi~ pending t:tip 
to Africa made clear the high degree of sensitivity accorded to 
his mission: 
In view of the extreme sensitivity of the ob­
jective for which we want him to perform his 
task, he was not told precisely what we want 
him to do.... Instead, he was told ... that 
we would like to have him spot, assess, and 
recommend some dependable, quick--i;.jitted 
persons for our use .... It was thought best 
to withhold our true, specific requirements 
pending the final decision to use [him]. 
(CIA Di,spatch, AUDW-147, 11/2/60.) 
* Part of the purpose in dispatching QJWIN to A~rica was to 
send him from the Congo to another African country for a.n unspeci­
fied mission. QJWIN's mission to this country is not explained 
in the cable traffic between CIA headquarters and the various sta­
tions that dealt with him. 
There is no indication in CIA files as to whether QJWIN com­
pleted this mission. O'Donnell said he had no knowledge of any 
mission that wo~ld have taken Q~{IN to this country (O'DonQell, 
9/11/75, pp. 32-33).
