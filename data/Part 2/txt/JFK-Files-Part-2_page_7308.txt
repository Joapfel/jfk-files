In sum, except in the case of very sensitive 
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged 
for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and 
with senior officers within the covering Embassy 
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare 
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his 
Station contacts on a discreet basis. 
Members of the SSC and their staff should not 
uestion Station ersonnel on s ecific o erational 
etail. It 1s more itt1ng that Was ington e the 
place where operational details are conveyed to 
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide­
lines are best understood, where the most complete 
and authentic records are kept (many Stations 
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations, 
have periodically destroyed their files). There 
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should 
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera­
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the 
operational environment, relationships with the 
Embassy, the service attaches, etc. 
Members of the SSC and their staff should not 
interview agent personnel. Foreign agent 
personnel frequently are under hos.tile or 
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed 
in touch with SSC members would be to run an 
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage 
could be don~ to agent morale and motivation 
if they were to think their role had been 
revealed to members of Congress. 
Members of the SSC and their staff should not 
in most cases be in contact with members of 
ho·st country's intelliaence or securi th services. 
Many services will fin contact with t e SSC 
politically difficult and will avoid it. They 
further regard that their relationships with CIA, 
the information they pass us and the sort of 
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.
