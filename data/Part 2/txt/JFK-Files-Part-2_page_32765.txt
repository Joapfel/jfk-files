These three examples point up for me a basic difference between the 
overall philosophies underlying the two proposals. I should emphasize that 
this difference in philosophy was not peculiar to the fourth phase of the 
competition. Boeing had from the very beginning consistently chosen 
more technically risky trade.:.offs in an effort to achieve operational 
features which exceeded the required performance characteristics. This 
approach was first exemplified in Boeing's choice of the undeveloped 
General Electric engine for its initial submission. 
Mr. Chairman, I do not mean to say that the Boeing. approach posed 
insuperable obstacles. On the contrary, I assumed that the problems 
associated with the use of titanium, the use of thrust reverse rs in super-
sonic flight, and the high .inlet ducts in the propulsion system are all 
susceptible of solution. But my judgment, reinforced by the Fourth 
Ev~uation Report, clearly indicated that these proposals would, in fact, 
complicate the development problems, and would require a significantly 
greater development effort to be expanded by Boeing in their solution. 
But, significantly, Boeing proposed a development effort less than 
that proposed by General Dynamics, and this in spite of the greater 
. complexity of the Boeing aircraft design, t4e greater divergenc_e between 
the Navy and the Air Force versions of the Boeing aircraft, and the les.ser 
experience J.,hi~h they possess in building high-density supersonic fighter 
aircraft .. This anomaly caused me to examine othe'r cost aspects of the 
Boeing proposal.
