T P SECRET 29

regarding, not necessarily every one, but many of your 
which would contain many or most of OGC contacts with 
Administrative agencies over ihe years?

is a substantial file on relations with Internal Revenue. 
But those were to a large part either working out our own 
tax equations on our own personnel with cover problems which 
you probably know about, or the CAT situation, or Southern 
Air.Transport, and not interferring with IRS prosecutions, 
although several times we were involved -- here is the type of

$2 million? And very definitely tried to involve 
us in his defense. There was some connection with 
in the Philippines, you couldn't be in the Philippines without 
some connection with them. And yet gave IRS the full in-
formation, and said, don't bother with us, we are not 
concerned. 
Mr. Wides. What about such things as the contacts with
