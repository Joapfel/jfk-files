whether Bissell had consulted with any "higher authority" about 
exploring the possibilities for assassinating Lumumba (Tweedy, 
9/9, p. 28). Generally, Tweedy said, when he received an instruc­
tion from Bissell he would proceed to implement it on the assump­
tion that it was fully authorized above the level of DDP: 
I would proceed with it on the basis that he 
was authorized to give me instructions and it 
was up to him to bloody well know what he was 
empowered to tell me to do. (Tweedy, 9/9, p.13) 
Tweedy characterized his discussions with Bissell about assass-
inating Lumumba as "contingency planning" (Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 28): 
Tweedy. . .I think it came up in the sense that 
Dick would have said we probably better be 
thinking about whether it might ever be necessary 
or desirable to get rid of Lumumba, in which case 
we presumably should be in position to assess 
whether we could do it or not successfully. • 
Q. Do it, meaning carry off an assassination? 
Tweedy. Yes, but it was never discussed with him 
in any other sense but a planning exercise, 
never were we instructed to do anything of this 
kind. We were instructed to ask whether such a 
thing would be feasible and to have the ~hief o~ 
Station be thinking along those lines as.~ell. 
(Tweedy, 9/9, p. 15) 
Tweedy said that the planning that he undertook pursuant to his con­
versation with.Bissell included "a few" cables that he remembers 
sending to the ~hief o~ Station asking him 
to keep in mind what sort of access one might ever 
have had to Lumumba. . . [in] the eventuality that 
we might wish to get rid of Mr. Lumumba personally.
