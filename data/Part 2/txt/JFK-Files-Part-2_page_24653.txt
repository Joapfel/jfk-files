in October" which. terminated their discussio_ns about gaining access ' . . ; . 
to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him (Hedgman, ·s/21/75, 
. . 
p. 61). The Chief of Station continued to communicate with head;.. 
quarters about finding a means to move forward with the assassina­
tion operation and securing th~ necessary manpower to do so. 
Hedgman confirmed Tweedy's view that although the assassination 
operation was still his highest priority, he was overburdened with 
responsibility for other operations so that he could not concentrate 
on the progress of the. assassination mission: 
ALTHOUGH MAINTAINING PRIORITY INTEREST THIS
