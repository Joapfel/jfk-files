Mr. Goldsmith. If it is a.n office chrono file does that _ j 
meant that everything is fLled in ·a chronological order? 
Mr. Tovar. Not neces3arily. Here you ought to consult 
my secretary. There might be a subject breakdown. Ordinarily 
hte front office, we don• t main-ain a lot of files·. There is 
no point in it. Let us sa:r something ·I signed off on, here 
is a case in point, memos that are signed ,,on my behalf or 
that I might have signed, Lf I were there that day, I would 
not maintain that in my fr,Jnt office as a rule. That would 
probably be maintained by :.he office of origination. I think 
if I signed it my secretar:r would certainly maintain a log of 
things that had gone throu-ih me for signature. But I don• t 
think, I could be wrong on t~is, .I don't think as a rule she 
would maintain a routine m~morandum just because I happened to 
sign it because I sign so ,nany things on .. :.that staff. I sign 
off on a host of things whLch are not really my creation. I 
am representing the staff iS a whole.

I I think it was either Dece:nber '74 or January '75. That is the 
' I 
position of Chief, CounterLntelligence? 
\ 
Mr.· Goldsmith. Yes. 
Mr. Tovar. !·believe he may have retmained in the office 
for several. months after t1at before he finally retired.
