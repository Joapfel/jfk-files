. ____ Captioned program involves development by the FBI . of 
confidential sources and informant~ in the diplomatic establishments 
of friendly foreign nations where (1) it appears that country ~s leaning 
toward the Soviet Bloc (2) where the situation in a particular country 
involves a serious _political or military crisis (3) where there is a clear 
~investigative need. At present time·we are developing sources and 
informants in the diplomatic establishments of 44 friendly _foreign 
nations with State Department approval. 
At this time it is felt we should obtain State clearance to 
institute a program to develop sources and informants in South Vietnamese 
diplomatic establishments in the United States. 
South Vietnam is an integral part of Asia whefe United St~tes 
is deeply involved politically, economically and militarily to stem· 
tide of Chinese Communists. South Vietnam within less than six months'\_/ 
has had its president slain and been governed by two military juntas f 
which gained control by coup d'etat. Any information which we c~~ 1· 
obtain regarding current political picture should_prove of value·;~
