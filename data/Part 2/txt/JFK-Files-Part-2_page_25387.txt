At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different 
projects. These would range from using plastic explosives to 
booby trapping Castro's desk. Rosselli would relay these on 
to Maheu, who, in turn, would contact the CIA. Most projects 
were vetoed, but the CIA did supply a short wave radio to the 
Cubans in Florida, to try and make contact with their people 
in Havana. 
Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no 
specific point when it was annotmced. But, at sometime Rosselli 
assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.
