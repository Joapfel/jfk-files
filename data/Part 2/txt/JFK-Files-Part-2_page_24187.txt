Substantial assets of these two IUQUEST air 
proprietary entities were sold in 1975 to a 
bona fide aviation company which was made witting 
for purposes of the sale. No agreement was nego­
tiated or implied at the time of sale for Agency 
use or purchase of goods or services from the 
company which purchased the assets. To date, no 
goods or services have been purchased from the 
buyer. The entities were subsequently liquidated. 
This air proprietary entity was sold in 1971 to 
an unwitting businessman. No agreement for con­
tinued use of the entity by the Agency was negoti­
ated or implied at the time of sale, and, to date, 
no such use has been made of the entity.

and was used as cover for Agency officers world­
wide, was sold in 1968 to the editor of the 
travel guides. The editor was an Agency employee 
and retired at the time of the sale. No agree­
ment was negotiated or implied for the continuing
