3. I3issell's Testimony Concerning Presidential Instruc- ~ 
tions to Act More Vigorously, But That Assassination Was Not Included. 
Sometime in the early fall of 1961, Bissell was apparently called to 
the White House and was .said to have been 
"chewed but in the Cabinet Room in the i-,'hi te House 
by both the President and the Attorney General for, 
as he put it, sittin~ on his ass and not doing any­
thing about getting rid of Castro and the Castro 
regime." 
A/~ t: 
This description comes from the testimony of Samuel Halpern, a middle­
level CIA covert action officer, who said Bissell told him about the 
meeting, and directed him to come up wit~ some plans. (Halpern, pp. 8, 
36-37), Bissell said he did not remember that precise meeting but that 
he had been, in essence, told to "get off your ass about Cuba." 
(Bissell, 7/25/75, pp. 37-38). 
Bissell was asked whether he considered such. an instruction 
to constitute authority for proceeding to assassinate Castro. He said it 
would not, and that 
11
formal and explicit approval" would be required for 
assassination action (Id., 38-39). 
Bissell also testified that there was in fact no assassination 
activity between the pre-Bay of Pigs/Roselli operation and his departure 
from the Agency in February 1962. 
In late 1961 Halpern became Harvey's Executive Assistant 
on Task Force W, the CIA action arm of Operation Mongoose. Ile testified 
that he never heard of the Roselli assassination
