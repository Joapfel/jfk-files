Mr. Chairman, I am here today_at-your .request to-pr.ov.ide 
my views on House Joint Resolution 454, '!The Assassination 
Materials Disclosure Act of 1992," and to describe the nature of 
documents held by the CIA that relate to the assassination of John 
F. Kennedy. I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on 
- " this important matter, just as I did before your Senate 
counterparts last Tuesday. , 
~t me begin by stating that I am in complete agreement 
with the purpose underlying the joint resolution--that efforts 
-: ; should be made .to declassify-and ~~~-available to the p~blic as 
- -. 
quickly as possible government documents relating to the 
assassination of John F. Kennedy. We hope that opening up ~d 
giving journalists, historians and, most importantly, the public 
access to governmental files will help to resolve questions that 
·still linger over 28 years after the assassination. Further, I believe 
···- . • - . . 
that maximum disclosure will discredit the theory that CIA had 
anything to do with the murder of President Kennedy .. 
Evenbefore introduction of this joint resolution, I 
recognized the need for greater public access to CIA documents 
of historical importance. Two months ago, I announced the 
establishment of a new unit within C~A that will be responsible ' • 
for declassifying as many historical documents as possible
