In his testimony before the Comr,1i t tee, Bissell characteri­
zed his reasoning for recommending release of the machine guns 
as:

plans that we might as well make the addi­
tional investment." (Bissell, 7/22, p.127) 
The following day, May 3, 1961, Ray Herbert, Deputy Chief 
of the. Western Hemisphere Division of CIA, who frequently acted 
as liaison with the State Department in matters concerning 
covert operations in the Dominican Republic, met with Adolph 
Berle, Chairman of the State Department's Interagency Task Force 
on Latin America. 
A Berle memorandum of the meeting states that Herbert 
informed Berle that a local group in_the Dominican Republic 
wished to overthrow Trujillo and soug.ht arms for that purpose. 
The memorandum continued: 
"On cross examination it developed that the 
real plan was to assassinate Trujillo and·they 
-~anted guns for that purpose .. llerbert wanted 
to know what the policy should be. 
"I told him I could not care less for Trujillo 
and that this was the general sentiment. But 
we did not wish to have any thing to .. do with any 
assassination plots anywhere, any time. Herbert 
said he felt the same way." (Berle, Mer~o of 
Conversation, 5/3/61)
