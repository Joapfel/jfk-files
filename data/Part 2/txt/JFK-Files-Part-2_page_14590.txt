Memorandwn Donahoe to Belmont 
Re: INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE OF 
FRIENDLY FOREIGN 00Ul{TRIES 
In view of Murphy's willingness to cooperate with us on 
this we have studied our system to see if we can streamline our 
"]-step" procedure to eliminate unnecessary paperwork for him arul 
for Bureau and to reduce liaison contact with him on -such matters to 
minimwn so as not to tie up procedure with "red tape." IYe feel we can 
best·do this, and still give us adequate safeguard of State clearance, 
by following procedure: ( 1) uhen we select country atr logical target 
we will write memo outlining reasons and have liaison orally discuss 
with 11furphy to determine if he agrees arul at same time to secure his 
clearance for very discreet investigations of potential sources which 
we will, thereafter, select (liaison notation on memo will constitute 
Bureau record of clearance of country and irulividual investigations); 
(2) unere we desire to interview a potential source we will prepare 
a letterhead memo which liaison will del-iver to Murphy. This memo 
will indicate we propose to conduct. interview under suitable pretext 
and will concisely swnmarize identity, background, citizenship, 
position occupied, and other pertinent factors disclosed during 
investigationo Liaison in delivering this memo will then note on 
yellow lBureau copy) unetherMurphy clears interviews or-not and 
this will serve as Bureau record. If Murphy declines an individual 
clearano.e liaison will determine uhether declination is strictly 
governed by facts relating to that case or whether Murphy feels 
foreign policy situation has changed to such extent we should stop 
our efforts concerning that particular country. This will eliminate 
needless effort.
