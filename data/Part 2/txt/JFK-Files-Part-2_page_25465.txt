FS: Honey, I don't want to know everything you did in 6 
years. I don't want to know everything you did 
because you can't ... 
ML: They were like a family, they were like a family at 
one time. Now when I need help they don't come 
through and they say it costs too much. It cost me 
a lot of nights in the garbage looking for Albanian 
stuff, cost me a lot of worry, cost me a lot of fear, 
threats. 
FS: Alright so this is why ... 
ML: (Unintelligible) 
FS: I want some stuff on this thing because if you make a 
story up then how are you gonna prove, for instance, 
you gonna go ahead ... 
ML: No I'm not making anything up. I wouldn't lie about 
it. 
FS: No, no, honey, I'm just saying. If you're gonna go 
ahead and say, hey - I broke into 33, in an apartment 
building with 33 Soviet families, who did you work . 
for -- well I worked for the FBI. They· call the FBI, 
the FBI said we know nothing about it. Then you are 
a liar. 
• ML: No way am I going to be a liar. 
FS: I'm just saying, they' re going to say how we gonna 
protect this girl when she's lying to us because the 
FBI says no. But if you name names and say I worked 
with this man here, it's got my file, I worked over 
a six year period. God damn it - that, that Justice 
Department will say, hey baby we want to see you and 
we want to see your files on this girl. And baby 
they got to go and come up with it. And if they don't 
come up with it they're in trouble. They're in 
trouble. Now, how could they hide something when they 
are working for the same people who are their bosses, 
who are their bosses? They can tell you to go jump in 
a lake over here. But Washington, D. C. says - hey, 
I want to see something here. Why haven't you given 
this people protection if all this is true. But if 
they don't know, honey, how the hell are they gonna 
do anything?
