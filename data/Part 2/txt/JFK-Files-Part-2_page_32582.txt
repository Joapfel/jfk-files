of Cuban 11chartered 11 flights to Brazil, names and nationali­
ties of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control 
followed by Brazilian authorities. Transmitted this informa­

non-Brazilians travelling on those flights.

Cuba. See Annex B for table of known travel of Latin

the CIA Station in Buenos Aires and with the Station's urging, 
the Argentine Minister of Interior indicated that he would 
make every effort to prevent Argentine delegates from attend­
ing the International Union of Architects Congress in Havana. 
d. At the urging of the CIA Station and the Embassy, 
the Bolivian Minister of Interior issued in mid-July an 
order prohibiting the granting of travel permits to Cuba or 
other bloc countries to Bolivian nationals. 
e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA 
station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the 
entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban-sponsored Second 
Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to 
take place in Santiago in August. This was one of the 
factors which led to postponement of the Congress. 
f. After considerable prodding by the CIA Station 
and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa 
Rica presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican 
Assembly which will require all persons intending to travel 
to Communist countries to have their travel approved by a
