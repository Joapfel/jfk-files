The effort to assassinate Fidel Castro took place in an 
atmosphere of extreme pressure by Eise~hower and Kennedy 
Administration officials to discredit and overthrow the Castro 
regime. Richard Helms recalled that: 
"I remember vividly [that the pressure] was very 
intense. And therefore, when you go into the record, 
you find a lot of nutty schemes there and those nutty 
schemes were borne of the intensity of the pressure. 
And we were quite frustrated." 
Bissell recalled that: 
"During that entire period, the administration was 
extremely sensitive about the defeat that had,been 
afflicted, as they felt, on the U.S. at the Bay of 
l;'igs, and were pursuing every possible means of < 
getting rid of Castro." • 
Another witness, Samuel Halpern, stated that sometime in 
the Fall of 1961 Bissell was 
"chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House by 
both the President and the Attorney General for, as he 
put it, sitting on his ass and not doing anything about 
getting rid of Castro and the Castro Regime."
