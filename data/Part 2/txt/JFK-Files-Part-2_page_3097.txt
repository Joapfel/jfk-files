Castro to recuperate lost prestige and 
rally local and foreign sympathy and sup­
port.· Generally speaking, current area 
attitudes toward the Castro regime are 
satisfactory from our [CIA] point of view. 
However, this could change radically and 
rapidly, if there are any premature para­
military actions. When the time comes 
for paramilitary activity, we should make 
every effort to conceal any invasion 
actions. To avoid or minimize Castro's 
cqunter propaganda, the paramilitary 
operations must appear to be an internal 
uprising by'dissident elements within 
Cuba. This, of course, would require 
clandestine infiltration of personnel 
and arms before the hostitlities begin. 
In my opinion, Castro will inevitably 
charge the US with responsibility for 
JMARC operations, and many Latin Americans 
and pther foreign observers will be in~ 
clined to accept such charges with or 
without supporting evidence. Therefore, 
what we need is a massive diversionary 
effort that will either obscure the fact 
of our involvement or make our involvement 
palatable. This diversionary tactic might 
be accomp~ished by exploiting unanimous 
Latin American revulsion toward the Trujillo 
regime ... If it became known, or strongly 
suspected, that we were supporting opera­
tions to bring about a transition to demo­
cratic government in the Dominican Republic, 
the waters would be suitably muddied, and 
a climate prepared for the Cuban effort.* 62/ 
* Debatable though Oberst's philosophy regarding the 
Dominican Republic might be, serious attention to his 
initial connnents regarding paramilitary activities 
against Castro might have halted -- or at least seriously 
altered~- the operations which would ultimately con­
clude at the Bahia de Cochinos. As with other of the 
cautionary and restrained proposals which would be·put 
forth prior to launching the invasion, little heed . .
