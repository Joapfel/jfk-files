Mr. Schwarz. Now the only remaining question I have on 
this group of documents is, how was it that the subject of the 
death of Castro -- do you investigate the possibilities of the 
death of foreign leaders as a regular matter? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, the question ,i .·"After.:,S.talin,,--, ,What?" .was 
thd staple of discussions in the 1940's, everywhere, academies 
and I would assume inside the United States government; the 
question after DeGaulle was a question about Nestern European 
policy for a great many years. And one could pick smallet' 
figures, more and less controversial, and have the same kind of 
qubstion coming up, in a situation in which a particular 
individual is as dominant a figure in a set of events which 
it had the two, quite contrasting but heavy consequences of th~ 
Bay of Pigs and the Missile Crisis, it doesn't seem to me to 
be an irrational question to ask, without any relation as to 
wheth~r th~ 1}nited States itself would have any active advisory 
role or any role whatever i:n having that event come to pass. 
Mr. Schwarz. All right. 
Would you mark as Exhibit 7 the September 20 document-­
which is the page -- which stat.es the assassination of Castro
