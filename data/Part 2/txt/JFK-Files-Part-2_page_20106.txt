The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open 
organization of politically motivated \vornen

During the Policy Council ~eeting there were no 
overt attempts· by any organized ~roup to influence the !)Olicy 
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified 
themselves as members of any orgn.nfzation ,-.1hich might be construed 
as subversive and/a::- surporting any cause exceDt lesitirrate
