SP3Cl'lUJ.H o:r COURSES o:r ACTION WITH RESPECT TO CUBA 
Accepting as valid the Attorney General's statement 
that there is no point in discussing courses of action 
with respect to CUba until the fundamental decision is 
made as to whether or not it is possible for the United. 
States to live with Castro, the following possible 
courses of action a.re listed under the headings "C:m 
Live with castro" and "can't Live with Castro." Neither 
of these headings is absolute; the courses of action 
listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta­
bility of the Castro regime or conversely the urgency 
to overthrow it. 
COURSES OJ' ACTION 
A. can Live with Castro 
1. Negotiate a detente-with Fidel looking towards 
full recognition of his regime and unli~ited traae 
between the United ~tatas and Cuba. The negotiator of 
the detente would endeavor to secure from Castro·. com-
mi tments not to engage in subversive activities ,in 
Latin America and not to engage in polemics against 
the United States. He would also endeavor to reduce 
or eliminate, a.a a result of our concessions, Soviet 
presence in Cuba and reduce the Cuban military machine 
to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful 
Latin American island republic. • 
No covert a-.:tivities would be undertaken and 
intelligence operations would be of a nature compat­
ible with our relations with a neutral power. ••
