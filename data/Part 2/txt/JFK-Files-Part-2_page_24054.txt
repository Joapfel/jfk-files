b. The Setting In Which the Assassination Plots 
Occurred Explains, But Does Not Justify Them 
The Cold War setting in which the assassination 
plo.ts took place d_oes not change our view that assassination 
is unacceptable in our society. In addition to the moral and 
practical problems discussed elsewhere, we find two principal 
defects in ~ny contention that the tenor of the period justifi­
ed the 'assassination plots: 
First, the assassination plots were not necessitated by 
imminent danger to the United States. Among the cases studied, 
Castro alone posed a threat to the United States, but then 
only during the period of the Cuban missile crisis. Castro's 
assassination had been planned by the CIA long before that 
crisis, and was not advanced by policymakers as a possible 
course of action during the crisis. 
Second, we reject absolutely any notion that the United 
States should justify its actions by the standards of totali­
tarians. Our standards must be high_er, and this difference is 
what the struggle is all about. Of course, we must defend our 
democracy. But in defending it, we must resist undermining 
the very virtues we are defending.
