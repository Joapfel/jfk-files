really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this 
three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of 
that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back 
from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey 
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two 
channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task 
force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr. 
Helms who was the DDP. 
Mr. Daron. As far as Mr. llarvey was concerned, an assign­
ment or order from Richard Helms .,.was an order to be taken' at 
face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the 
stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Houlrl that have been 
your operating understanding? 
Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes. 
Certainly an instructiori received from Mr. Helms was a valid 
Agency instruction. 
Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was ,lohn McCone. 
Mr. Hallay. That is correct. 
Mr. Baron. Do you havP- any knowledge of the relationship 
·between this three-man group and John McCone at that point? 
Mt·. Halley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to 
Miami, I came back on a r~gular basis to review operational 
plans and programs. On o~e occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone 
·to the White House to qive a present.at.ion or sit. in while the 
presentation was being mad~.
