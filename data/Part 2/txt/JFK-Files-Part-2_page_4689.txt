MR. HALPERN: No. It wa1 up and down throughout. 
INTERVIEWER: Throughout? 
MR.HALPERN: Including some of the old hands who didn't like the system, 
didn't like the program. And even those who understood that this was 
basically geared abroad as a counterintelligence operation, just didn't think 
that we should be involved in it. We preferred to have the Bureau or somebody 
else get involved in it. But again, you talk about turf battles and equity or 
what have you, a lot of the liaison services abroad~- the foreign liaison 
services -- we had a deal with. Many of them didn't want to work with the 
Bureau and only wanted to work with us. And you can't have both agencies 
suddenly hitting the same foreign service and aski~g the same questions. It 
just gets silly. So there ~ere lots of problems on this one and the officers, 
as I say, even some of the old hands, didn't like it. They ~anted to go back 
to doing the normal collection job and not go looking_for what amounts to, you 
know, Bolsheviks with bombs under the bed. And that tension was there and I 
think it continues, and even under Bill Colby who modified the program even 
more in '73, in late or middle '73 with Schlesinger and Colby. But the 
progfam by and large continued in a slightly reduced fashion and a different 
terminology and with much more emphasis on doing that over there than in the 
States. I think it's the kind of thing that, you know, you're damned if you 
do and you are damned if you don't. I don't think we ever convinced everybody 
that ·what we were doing was within bounds and, obviously, we had the 
information, the information wasn't going anywhere. Nobody was going to court 
on it, nobody was going to ~et shot, nobody was going to get put in jail. I 
mean, we were just pulling it all together. 
INTERVIEWER: Would you say dozens of officers knew about this?
