. membe'fa of the ARA Durcau, Dick Bissell, Tracy Barn.ea and myself •. 
:":i. ,,,, 
The following decisions were made: 
l. We would proceed immediately to discuss with other Carribean govern­
ments the poaa1bil1ty of org.:,.nizl.ng a. Garribe;in Security Force. This could 
be organized on th~ basis of informal understandinga within the framework 
of exiat.ina treaty a:n·angement:1, as a s_erie's o! new bilateral trcatiel!J, or a 
£orm.al, multilateral trellty., It wo.1a thought that the baois o! organization 
,., .. , would depend on the judgment of other Garribean countries as to how they 
'.'• <: could a.ccompllah the objective of eeta.bliahfog the force without running· ••.• 
. serious intet"nal political risks. The United States, !or ita part,· v,ould pre• 
fer the formnl multi-lateral arrangement. , Such a C.:i.rribean Securily Force 
would have at least four major 1u1pects: • • 
. . 
( l) Advance c.om1nlttment to come to the aid of other oignatoriea 
. threatened by Caatt'C ravolutiorilJ and, perhaps the designation . 
o! specific units !or participation in necessary multi-lateral 
actions. 
(Z) The establishment of a pool of ,intelligence information con­
cerning subveraive activities w:Hh provision for e~chanae of 
such in!ormatlon. 
(3) The establishment of a C arrib~an air and sea patrol to watch 
!or suspected infiltration of Castro arms or a.gents. 
(J) A training program in combatting subversive tactics, police 
organization and procedure, etc. 
It was conceded that th<ll irubstunt1ve aapecto o! this arrnngcment could, if 
nec:::1uuiary, be achieved informally. However, the decision to seek a more 
• .formal arrangement was pdm.arlly arrived at on the baale of interw political 
c:onsiderationa in the United States. / . •
