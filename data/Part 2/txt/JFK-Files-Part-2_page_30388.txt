Mr. Goldsmith. Does ·:he Agency today have a policy of, 
. as a matter of routine ope::ating procedure, debriefing retu~n-
ing defectors? 
Mr. Tovar. None that I am aware of. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Again. would you say you relied on the 
FBI to conduct those inter- riews? • 
Mr. Tovar. Yes. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Is th1!re any coordination between the 
Agency and the FBI so that the Bureau is informed when someone 1 
in fact is returning?

Mr. Goldsmith. An AmEirican defector who is repatriated. 
Mr. Tovar. I know of no case where they would be· 
interested in the subject. I can't say there is a procedure 
in being. Knowing the way we relate to the FBI, if we knew of 
a case of.returning AmericHns, Say we learned. it from an 
overseas station and it ·seEimed of interest, we would' probably 
refer it directly to the FHI by letter.

I am speculating here because I know of no case in point. I 
Mr. Goldsmith. There is no standard procedure for con ta.ctr-

Mr. Tovar. Not that :: am -aware of.

Mr •. Goldsmith. You would be the person who would be aware!

of such a procedure?
