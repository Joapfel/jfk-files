matters. In other words, I want to make it clear we do not regard patriotic 
citizens as informa,nts. 
Mr. STERN. I take it you also would not have regarded Lee Oswa'ld as an in­
formant from the rontacts with him that you have told us about and the other 
agents have told us about? 
Mr. BELMONT. · Indeed not; in no way could he be considered an informant; In 
no way. 
Mr. STERN. Did you supervise or assist in the preparation of the information 
contained here? 
Mr. BELMONT. Yes, sir . 
Mr. STERN. And you are famd:liar with it? 
Mr. BELMONT. Yes; I am. 
Mr. STERN. And to your knowledge, does it accurately and completely state 
the Bureau's practice in recruiting a prospective inform!lnt? 
Mr. BELMONT. That ts· correct. 
Mr. STERN. Is there anything you would like to add to the information covered 
in there with respect to your practices regarding informants? 
Mr. BELMONT. No; only in my personal knowledge this is a correct statement 
and Lee Harvey Oswald was not an informant of the FBI. 
• Mr. STERN. Did you ever use the term "agent" to apply to anyone other than] 
an employee, a special agent employee of the FBI? 
Mr. BELMONT. No; we do not. 
Mr. DULLES. Could I ask you, Mr. Belmont, whether Mr. Fain's separation 
from. the FBI had anything whatever to do with the Oswald case or itt. his 
handling of the Oswald case? 
Mr. BELMONT. No; indeed not. Mr. Fain came to the retirement age and de­
cided he wanted to retire, which •is his privilege, and he retired and is presently 
working in Texas and very happy, I understand. 
Mr. DULLES. Thank you. 
Mr, BELMONT. He retired in good graces, good standing, so far as the FBI is 
concemed. 
The CHAIRMAN. And a year before the assassination. 
Mr. BELMONT. Frankly, I don't recall. 
The CHAJRMAN. Yes; it was August 1962, he ·testified. 
Mr. STERN. rou have already covered this, Mr." Belmont, but just so that the ]. ·. 
record is completely clear on this point, was Lee Oswald ever am. agent of the 
FBI? 
Mr. BELMONT. Lee Oswald was never an agent of the FBI. 
Mr. STERN. The ietter of February 6, 1964, from Mr. Hoover, alludes to testi­
mony furnished the Commission by District Attorney Wade. Have yo·.i sub.re­
quently been advised that Mr. Wade had 1J1ot testified before the Commission? 
Mr. BELMON'l'. Yes; we received a letter from the Oommission advising us 
tLat the incident referred to was an informal discussion rather than actual testi­
mony before the Commission. 
Mr. STERN. And also to complete the record, have you been advised that Mr. 
Wade was not suggestilng that he believed the rumor about Oswald as an in­
formant, but felt obliged to call Lt to the attention of the Commission? 
Mr. BELMONT. The Comm-ission's letter so advised us. 
Mr. STERN. Mr. Chairman, may this be admitted with No. 835? 
The CHAJRMAN. It may be admitted under that number. 
(The document referred to, previously marked Commismon Exhibit No. 835 
for identificaflion, was received in. evidence.) 
Mr. STERN. Mr. Belmont, I show you a letter dated February 12, 1964, a 
number of affidavits by special agents, attached to it. It was identified yester­
day, parts of it were identified yesterday arid it therefore carries the number for 
ideiltifl.catioo 825. Can you identify this letter for us? 
Mr. BELMONT. In order to be sure----:-1 beg your pardon. This is a letter dated 
February 12, 1964, to.the Commission from the FBI, to which is attached affidavits 
of FBI per~nne1 who had reason to contact Lee Harvey Oswald and who were in 
a supervisory capacity over the agents who contacted Oswald. 
Mr. STERN. Did you supervise the preparation of this material? 
Mr. BF.LMONT. These affidavits were prepared, of course, by the men themselves.
