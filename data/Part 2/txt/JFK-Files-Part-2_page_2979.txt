in almost total isolation, the Swan Island transmitter 
raised a nightmare of cover complications. Operating 
as Radio Americas, it was supposedly under cover of 
the Vanguard Service Corporation, an Agency proprie­
tary which offered no services, and the Gibraltar 
Steamship Corporation, another proprietary which 
operated no steamships. A Boston millionaire who 
claimed to own the island collected rent from the 
Vanguard Corporation, which could not afford to argue, 
but not from·the Weather .Bureau, which disputed his 
claim. Vanguard contracted with Coastal Air of 
Miami for one light-aircraft supply flight a week 
and with the Logistics Service Corporation of Phila­
delphia, a Philco subsidiary, to maintain the island 
facilities and transmitting equipment. All of this 
enabled CIA to play tapes and broadcast the commen­
taries of the -three Cuban announcers station-ed on 
the island, but it did not prevent Radio Habana 
from pinpointing the transmitter and calling it a 
308/ 
CIA propaganda mechanism.-
