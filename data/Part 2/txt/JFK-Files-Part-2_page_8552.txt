ATTACHMENT B ( 7) 
Item No. 339 MSS p. no. 509 
(S) CIA presence in Bolivia and Brazil has not been 
officially acknowledged and is still classified because 
it involves sotirces and methods. 
David Phillips in his book The Night Watch, 
chapter 8, pp. 212'-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-
1972" describes his presence as Chief of Station of CIA 
in Brazil and ori page 209 he dis~usses CIA in Bolivia. 
(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence 
in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509), 
Africa Division states "The existence of a GIA presence 
in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975. 
It may be argued therefcire that to agree to declassification 
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of • 
singling otit the Congo in the Third World as an alleged 
target of CIA operations. This would have an adv~rse 
effect on our relations ~ith the gov~rnment of Zaire. We 
believe the item should remain classified and that 
exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo." 
It is not a question of whether to agree or not 
to declassification of reference to the Congo. The Church 
Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made 
"official-public disclosure 11 ·of the matter, rendering the 
subject moot. In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A 
shows, four other countries of the Third World are also 
mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone. What 
adverse effect could be expected now by another public 
reference to CIA presence in.the Congo as of the original 
1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is 
difficult to comprehend. Since the government of Zaire has 
not changed since the 1975.release of the information by 
the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever adverse 
effects there might be have already occurred.
