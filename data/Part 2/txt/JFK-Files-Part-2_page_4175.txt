The time will probably come when we will have to act again on Cuba. 
Cuba might be our response in some future situation - the same way the 
Russians have used. Berlin. We may decide that Cuba might be a more 
satisfactory response than a nuclear res:i:,onse. We must be ready - al though 
this might not come. We should be prepared to move on Cuba if it should 
be in our national interest. The planning by the US, by the Military, 
in the direction of our effort should be advanced alwys keeping Cuba 
in mind in the coming months and to be ready to move with all possible 
speed. We can use Cuba to limit their actions-just es they have had 
Berlin to limit our actions.

In thematter of Europe,Ehe US has been faced since 1958 with deGaulle's

reviewed the problem and took the position that it should be reviewed by 
the NATO nations - the NATO nations would not act. • • • no agreement 
between the Three. That decision this Administration also supported. 
However, this decision has not produced the present contention with the 
French. Even when I was in Paris last June, de Gaulle said he would 
make some proposal in regard to NATO itself. All through his speeches

France would be a dominant power speaking to the USSR and to the Western 
World as an equal. If we had given him atomic weapons he would be difficult 
to deal with;] --- •• • • "... ·

distrust of us that we will desert Europe but it is that he feels that France 
shou~d assert a position as a strong France and cease its growing reliance 
on the u.s~7
