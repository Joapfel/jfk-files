DARDEN, Detroit BPP Minister of. Information, received a 
telephone call in late April, 1973, from BOBBY SEALE in

BPP Chapte~ has the least number of actively involved 
members of all BPP Chapters throughout the country. 
SEALE also complained that the Detroit Chapter is operating 
only two survival programs (the Free Breakfast Program and 
the Free Busing to Prison Program) and warned DARDEN that 
the Detroit Chapter will have to take steps to initiate a 
substantial number of survival programs to serve the 
Detroit Black community as it deserves to be served.
