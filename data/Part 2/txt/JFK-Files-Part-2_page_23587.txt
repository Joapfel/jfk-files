6. The princip.:il r.iernbers of the Special Group felt, after 
some discussion, that the CIA v~riant should be developed further 
for consideration at next Thursday's meeting of the Special Group. 
Mr. McCone was asked to stress dcono~1ic sabotage, and to emphasize 
I 
measures to foment .:i Castro-oldlinc Communist split. It was 
emphasized tl1::it any .:ictions unddr this· plan must be so designed as 
to avoid major attribution to tlie U.S. 
I 7. General Lemnitzcr told the Group that the Navy docs not 
I 
wish Gu:,nt::in.-:i.1110 used as a base f,or operational activities, as 
sug;:;csted by CIA. He said that !the othet· Chiefs b:.ive not yet given 
an opinion on this but he thou[_;ht tb::it they 1-10uld agree with the 
NdV:,', as he himself docs. The vliew is tl10.t this base is too important 
t:o t!1c U.S. and too vulnerable t
1
o Cubon pressure ·to take the chance 
of provuking Cuban rc.:ictio_n. The State representatives agreed with 
this view. 
8. Mr. Bundy sui;gcstc.d that a hard look be taken at the 
possibility of support to selcctbd Cuban exiles on a strictly 
"disengaged" basis; in other wor~s, should they be given covert 
financial and material suprort, Lich tlie idea of seeing what they 
cou:d generate on their own. I 
9. Mr. Rusk suggested that continued pressure should be 
placed on Castro by keepiri~ intelest in the prisoner issue .:1live. 
10. Action to he taken: 
CIA to prep.:1re a new v9rsion of its variant plan, in 
occordancc with the above-sumr,1.:irized discussion. This should be 
ready by Wesncis<lay, August 15th.
