buss es, are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported th 
women will demonstrate. It is noted that L

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesterc: 
are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another 
demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon. 
General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security 
officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street 
Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday. 
Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-
