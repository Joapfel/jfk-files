2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston, 
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300 
women attended the conference, which once a~A1.n re-established 
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand. It was 
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to 
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings 
• across the country had been disanoointin~ly small. It was 
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers 
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the 
abortion issue, includin~ the majority of women's liberationists 
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the mo"ement 
could not succeed without the support of the working women. 
'At the close of the conferen e, WONAAC strongly endorsed 
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972, 11 whicn is to be introduced in 
the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA ZUG from New York.
