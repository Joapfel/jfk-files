_O_C_C_U_R_J_· --· DON promised DINH that he would personna.Jy speak to the President on DINH' s 
behalf and that he would ask that DINH be granted the Ministry of Interior, while he, OON, 
would ask for the Ministry of National Lefense. DJNH believed that OON had his personal 
interest at heart and DON did in fact make such an appeal to the President to enlarge his 
5overnrrent, but made the proposal in such a way that it would have been impossible for DIEM 
or NHU to accept. Leadlines were given. DINH was informed that the President would give hi1 
the ministerial post. After the deadlines had passed and DINH had not received what he tho­
w..:,ht was his proper recof?}lition, • GENERAL DON and other officers including HUAN continued to 
lend sympathy to DINH. while DINH was still waiting for his ministerial post. p. 13
