Mr. Liebengood. Was this listening post that you referred·· 
to, was that a project. that was related to work for the Central 
Intelligence Agency? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't believe it was. 
Mr. Madigan. Did you have any New York assignments other 
than Onassis that you gave to Frank? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't remember any. 
Mr. Madigan. How about· I may have asked 
you that yesterday. Do you recall W!}ether he had any relation­
ship with your company during the 1950's? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't remember a 
Mr. Madigan. A CIA employee. 
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall his name. 
Mr. Madigan. I got sidetracked off of my question• .. cif 
whether you recall a prosecution or an investigation of the 
Onassis wiretap. You may have already have answered that. 
Mr. Maheu. I think I did, yes. 
Mr. Madigan. What did you say? 
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a 
Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another 
matter. 
Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollecti n 
of any investigation of that particular tip? 
Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.
