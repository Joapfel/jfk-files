As a.participant at NSC meetings who frequently attended dis­
cussions. in the Oval Office relating to national security affairs, 
John.Eisenhower testifieo that nothing that came to his atten-
tion in his experience at the.White House "can be Gonstrued in 
my mind in the remotest way to mean any Presidential knowledge 
of or concurrence in any assassination plots. or plans" (Eis_enhower, 
7/18/75, ·p. 4). 
* Douglas Dillon testified that the subject of assassination 
never· arose in his ''direct dealings with either President 
Eisenhow~r or President Kennedy (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 22). He was 
asked by a member of the Cornrnittee, however, to speculate upon 
th~ general philosophical approach that Presidents Eisenhower 
and Kennedy would have taken to decisionmaking on the question 
of u~ing assassination as a tool of foreign policy: 
Senator Hart (Colorado): I would invite your ~peculation at 
thi~ point as a sub-Cabinet officer under President Eisen­
hower, and as a Cabinet Officer under President Kennedy, I 
think the Committee would .be interested in your view as to 
the attitude of each of them toward this subject, that is 
to say, the elimination-, violent elimination of foreign 
leaders? 
Dillon: Well, that is a difficult thing io speculate on 
in a totally diiferent atmosphere. But I think probably 
both of them would have approached it in a very pragmatic 
way, most likely, simply weighed the process and con­
sequence rather than in a ,'way that was primarily of a 
moral principle. That is what would probably have been 
their attitude in a few cas~s. Certainly the idea that 
this was going to be a policy of the U.S., generally 
both. of them were very much opposed to it. (Dillon, 
9/2/75i ~p. 22-23.) • 
Dillon served as Undersecretary of State in the Eisenhower 
Administration and as Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy.
