Origin: Basic program inaugurated in 1954 and expanded in 1955 
and 1958~ Purpose: To provide for acquisition of posi~ive intelligence 
and investigative information through three principal face·ts: (1) Receipt 
of notification from-six other agencies pf arrival,in UoS. of intelligence 
personnel of friendly foreign governments; (2) At SJE cific request or with 
specific approval of Deputy Under Secretary of State Robert Murphy or 
official designated by him., maintenance of technical su_rveillances on 
official establishments in United States of countries located in trouble 
areas; (3) With prior.State Department approval, development of live sources 
within establishments of friendly countries, as Bureau's intelligence and 
investigative requirements demand extension of coverageo Seo~ and Cost: 
(1) Under first category Bureau receives notification from other intelli­
gence agencies of arrival of intelligence personnel in U.So Handling of 
these notifications is confined to•Seat of Government and principally 
involves review of any file references and indexing procedures at nominal 
costs. In appropriate instances field is alerted to presence of intelligence 
personnel but activt investigation is not instituted in absence of infor- . 
mation which would form basis for security-type case. (2) In past 6 months 
we have had technical coverage under second category covering 6 foreign 
countries, 2 of which now discontinuedo Present coverage consists of • 
technical surveillances on New York and Washington establishments of Iraq 
and United Arab Republic; French and Cuban embassies in Washington; and 
other Cuban establ ishmenps in Washington., New York and Miami. Based or. _ : 
latest available field estimates, the tech~ical surveillances now in c,_1./,..~ .. ) 
operation cost approximately $16,850 a month consisting almost entirely of 
salary of Bureau personnel. (3) Under 1 ive informant phase we now have 20 . _ 
informants or sources actually connected with official foreign establishments:·- .. ::_-
in United States and additional 20 under consideration as potential infor- - ··_ • 
mants or sources. OJ the 20 currently in use, three are paid for actual 
services plus expenses and remaining 17 are cooperating with Bureau without 
cost to us. Entire monthly cost of this phase of Program in terms of pay-
ments to informants does not exceed #265. Tie-In With Other Programs: This 
program supplements, and is supplemented by, a number of programs which
