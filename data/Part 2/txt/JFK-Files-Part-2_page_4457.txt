at the same time. Neither this, nor the other efforts to

with full success by the end of the reports period.

• • • • ~ (b) The Cuban lawyer recruited 1n May 1962 -
(see paragraph ~above) developed a secow target in September, 
_ a former membor~f the CUban General Staff now awaiting re~ssign­
ment. The agent was instructed to recrui and train this 
military Officer in S/W. At the end of the reporting period • • 
it was not p9ssible to determine tho success ·of this potentially­
excellent operational devolopment. 
(c) Included in this discussion is the 
partially successful recruitment of a Cuban army engineer who_ 
is stationod in Santiago. The agent cited in (2b above) has • 
been in contact with this target, a ~aptain, since July 1962, 
but has not succeeded in completing the full recruitment. He 
has obtained OB from the captain, but we feol the operation 
will not have roached its full potential until the captain has 
been trained in S/W and is reportj,.11g dir~ctly to us .. 
(d) Since mid-August the Agency has been 
pursuing a lead to the G-3 of the CUban Army. The basis of this 
pursuit was fitted together from innumerable reports, and finally 
centered, in early October, on a plan to try to effect the reoniit­
ment using a letter from a former army and prison comrade. ay· 
cut-off data, the developmental activity had reached the point 
where the only remaining matter was to deliver the letter into 
the hands of the Officer.

figures in the Cub~n economy and to develop a#ess ·to them as _ 
rapidly as possible, wherever the opportunity-has arisen.· Oil, 
Nickle and Sugar Industries have been assigned to us having the 
highest priority.
