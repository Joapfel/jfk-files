:.:-:.._: :SUBJECT: COINTELP_RO/Petersen Report 
JUN 5 1979 
On June 4, 1975, Yi.r. Elliff of.SSC reviewed the 
39-page Petersen Report. Afterwards, he had a confer­
ence with me from 4:15 to 4:45. The conference resulted 
in a modification of the previous request. I told him 
I would be back in touch •with hiJn at an appropriate ti.l'!le. 
He also indicated a probable future course of action by 
the Conuni ttee. 
The modification is as follows: 
·1 As to Appendices A-E (the su:m.:-naries prepared by 
the FBI of certain COINTELPRO operations) Cammi ttee • 
-___ staff access is reauested. Hr. Elliff advised that .he 
• understood that th; FBI raw files question was most 
sensitive, and that he would propose to h~ve staff of 
the Committee review these Exhibits, and, if the infor­
mation in these Exhibits was not sufficient for their 
·purposes, to then request an expanded summary of any 
particular toprc-sununariZted, wi t:hout reaching the issue 
of access to the Bureau'Ei nraw files 11 • • I 
. , 
As to F-•J-Staff Assessments - ha feels these a1~e 
not of.pressing present iraportanc~. 
As to K-L (su."r!mary reports on €Spionage matters),

I as 1mpor·tant as A-E above.

these are not of L~mediate interest.
