1 0. A publication circulated during the conference was the 
November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to 
be renamed, starting January 1,- 1974, Computers and People. 
The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which 
concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of 
a prediction that organized crim!:' would someday put its own man 
in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted 
to the profession of data processing and the use of computers. 
The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in 
Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an 
abundance of ar~icles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate 
published in the past year. 
11. Another organization which received publicity at the 
Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the 
Intelligence Community ( CARIC). 
12. A representative of Computers and Automation handed out 
this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took 
notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said 
during the proceedings. 
13. The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again 
during the morning session. The absence of current may have 
affected the tape recording. • 
14. The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after 
1:30 p. m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch, 
and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a 
later hour. 
15. No document of any kind was issued to the persons who 
paid $15. 00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name 
of the organization which gave them access to all furtlier meetings 
that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently 
not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were 
taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No 
information on address, occupation, etc. was required.
