1. In accordance with existing arrangements, we

whereas only certain segments of the others remain in 
classified status. Copies_ of the affected materials 
are attached.. ••••

2. We see no reason to continue the restriction 
on document B. Similarly, document A would normally 
require no further withholding from the public domain, 
but Wfr:... checked with Mr. David Murphy, an, Agency official 
tmder~epartment of State cover) and he requested that 
his true af filiatioi?2not be revealed at this tiille. He Sl. 
is still under cover and uncoordinated revelation of his 
true status could become an embarrassment to the~epartment.)

to release now about our dealings with defectors and the 
determination of their legitimacy.
