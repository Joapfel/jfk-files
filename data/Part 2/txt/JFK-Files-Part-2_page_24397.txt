(a) Plots: Early 1960 
(1) Plots to Destroy Castro's Public Image 
Efforts against Castro did not begin with 
assassination attempts. 
From March through August 1960, during the 
last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the CIA considered 
plans to undermine Castro's charismatic appeal by sabotaging his 
speeches. According to the Inspector General's Report, an 
official in the Technical Services Division (TSD) recalled dis­
cussing a scheme to spray Castro's broadcast_ing studio with a 
chemical which produced effects similar to LSD, but rejected the 
scheme because the chemical was not reliable. During this period, 
TSD impregnated a box of cigars with a chemical which produced 
temporary disorientation, hoping to induce. Castro to smoke one 
of the cigars before. delivering.a speech. The Inspector General 
also reported a plan to destroy Castro's image as "The Beard" by 
dusting his shoes with thallium salts, a strong depilatory that 
would cause his beard to fall out. The chemical was to be adminis­
tered during a trip outside of Cuba, in which it was anticipated 
Castro would leave his shoes outside the door of his hotel room 
to be shined. TSD procured the chemical and tested it on animals, 
but apparently abandoned the scheme because Castro cancelled his 
trip. (I.G., pp. 10-13.)
