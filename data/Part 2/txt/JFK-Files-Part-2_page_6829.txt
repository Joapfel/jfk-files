Memorandum to Mr. Tolson 
At the conclusion of our discussion, the 'Justice reiterated 
once again the action he planned to take with the establishment of an "arbitrator." 
He stated that I should keep ln touch with him on a confidential basis regarding 
this matter.· He also stated that I should not hesitate in the future to get in 
touch with him concerning any problems in which the FBI's interest should be 
protected. He reminded me that the President had great faith in the Director 
and the FBI ~d that in many instance~ we undoubtedly found ourselves in a 
position where we could not protect ourselves. He also stated that while the 
President had issued specific statements concerning wiretapping· and usage of 
electronic devices, he nevertheless realized that t4e FBI had to have the 
advantage of such devices in order to adequately handle its responsibilities 
both in the security and criminal fields. He stated the President's only concern 
had been his opinion that there were too many electronic devices in the political 
field. He stated we of course were not guilty of such practices. He stated he 
recognized this and he also recognized that the entire hysteria concerning the 
usage of microphones and electronic devices had been brought about as a result 
of Bobby Kennedy's brash practices. He· stated he deeply resented the fact 
that Bobby Kennedy had thrown his former partner, Sheldon Cohen (Director, , ✓ 
Internal Revenue) to the wolves in connection with these matter~. ~ .. c.•· 1•~ . . .... /'At (a, < 
ACTION: (1) Pursuant to the Director•s·instructions I will advise Marvi 1• 
Watson today o! the background and current employment o! 
Courtney Evans. 
(2) If the Director agrees, I will advise Justice Fortas that 
the Director is or the opinion that Ross Malone would probably be the best 
__ man to serve as an "arbitrator. "·
