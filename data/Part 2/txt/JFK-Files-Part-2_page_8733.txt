Memorandum to Chief, 
1 October 1962 
AMLACE-1 was asked about succession in the event 
of CASTRO's death. He responded in October 
1962 that in the event of CASTRO's death, even 
the gusanos (wonns) say it would be useless to 
kill Fidel. No one thinks that his death would 
be useful to the counter-revolution.
