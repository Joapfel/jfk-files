It is particularly important in light of changes which 
were subsequently made in the covert action plan to 
note the language of the approved policy with reference 
to the paramilitary operation: 
Initially, a cadre of leaders will be 
recruited after careful screening and 
trained as paramilitary instructors. In 
a second.phase, a number of paramilitary 
cadres will be trained at secure locations· 
outside of the US so as to be available for 
immediate deployment into Cuba to organize, 
traini and lead resistance forces recruited 
there, both before and after the establish­
ment of one or more active centers of resis­
tance. 
At no point in this Presidentially-approved plan 
for covert action by the Agency is there any hint of 
invasion. 'The paramilitary activity was cle'arly to 
be in the context of guerrilla warfare with leader­
ship and training to the dissident activities inside 
Cuba being provided by Cubans trained by United States 
technicians.* Finally, with reference to the approved 
* Colonel Jack Hawkins (USMC) who was Chief, WH/4/PM 
. correctly noted in his memor.andurn for record of PM 
operations for Project JMATE that: 
The only approved, ~ritten policy 
governing paramilitary action against 
.Cuba is contained in paragraph 2d of 
the Policy Paper approved by the Presi­
dent on 17 March 1960." (Emphasis added
