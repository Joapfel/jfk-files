indicated his displeasure about the lack of consultation 
on the impropriety of the att~mpt itself.* There is no 
evidence that the Attorney Ge1eral told the CIA that it must 
not engage in assassination plots. 
At a meeting of the Special Group Augmented in August 
1962, well after the assassination efforts were underway, 
Robert McNamara is said to have raised the question of 
whether the assassination of Cuban leaders should be explored, 
and General Lansdale issued an action memorandum assigning 
the CIA the task of preparing contingency plans for the 
assassination of Cuban leaders. While McCone testified 
that he had immediately made it clear that assassination 
was not to be discussed or condoned, Harvey's testimony 
and documents which he wrote after the event indicate that 
Harvey may have been confused over whether McCone had 
objected to the use of assassination, or whether he was only 
concerned that the subject not be put in writing. In any 
* Documents show that the Attorney General, Robert Kenriedy, 
learned in May of 1961 that the CIA had used underworld 
figures in an operation against Cuba. The documentary record 
further reflects that the Attorney General was not told that 
the operation had involved assassination efforts until May 
of 1962, and that the operation was then described to him 
as having been terminated in May 1961. There is no evidence 
that the Attorney General suspected the true nature of the 
operation until that briefing, or that he learned that it 
had not in fact been terminated. While it is curious that 
the Attorney General would not have inquired further into 
the nature of the operation when he discovered that Sam 
Giancana had been invo 1 ved in it, there is no evidence that "' 
he did.
