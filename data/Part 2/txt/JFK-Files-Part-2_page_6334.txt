Subj: Review Board's Proposed Regulations 
1400.2(e) (3), Storage facilities and locations, presents a 
possible conflict with our continuing protection of~ 
1400.5, Requirement that assassination records be released 
in their entirety ... and no portion withheld solely on 
grounds of non-relevance. For that portion of the documents 
we have declared non-relevant that is operational and is 
clearly non-relevant we should argue strongly with the 
Board. The Director's statutory responsibility for the 
protection of sources and methods must be defende.d; and we 
can be sure that it was not anticipated that a KGB officer 
in Mexico City would be transferred to another country and 
go on generating much operational information. Furthermore, 
we saw it as the Board's responsibility to review the 
records we identified as non-relevant and to support -­
publicly those of our decisions that they felt were 
justified! 
1400.6, Originals and copies, could cause problems if the 
Board gets fussy about it. Originals of memos sent outside 
the agency would be gone(to the addressee). Originals of 
cables and despatches are virtually non-existant. 
1400.S(c)," ... the Board must determine that the record or 
group of records will more likely than not enhance, enrich, 
and broaden the historical record .. " Like some of this stuff 
might be non-relevant?
