DISSEI1[1fATION OF DATA DEVELOPED IN SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS 
1? Policy 
Proper utilization of information received is foremost among Bureau's 
responsibilities. Information obtained during investigations should 
be forwarded to other interested agencie~ in executive branch unless 
there are compelling reasons not to do so. Delimitations Agreement 
and Presidential directives provide f·or dissemination to other agencies 
which have present or potential interest information relating to espionage, 
sabotage, subv-ersive activities, and related matters. 
2. Bureau requirements 
Because all conceivable situations cannot be anticipated, data below 
pertains to representative situatio·ns which occur frequently. Basic 
rule is that security information must be furnished promptiy to inter­
ested agencies in executive branch. Term "interested agen,cy" must be 
interpreted in light of reason and common sense. Bring any unusual 
situations to Bureau's attention promptly for consideration. 
Considerations affecting national defense in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto 
Rico necessitate broadest possible construction to requirements for 
dissemination to intelligen_ce services. in those areas. See Manual of 
Rules and Regulations, part II, section 5, pertaining to Bureau's 
overall responsibilities, policies, and exceptions in dissemination. 
a. Members of armed forces ~ 
Delimitations Agreement between FBI and armed forces intelligence 
agencies (see section 102B, volume IV, of this manual) requires 
each agency to exchange freely and directly with other subscribing 
agencies all information of mutual interest. Any information 
dev-eloped concerning members of military serv-ices must be referred 
immediately to appropriate military branch hav-ing primary respon­
sibility, even though allegations have not. been fully resolv-ed or 
verified. Specifically point out in such instances that infor­
mation has not been verified. When it is determined security 
subject is member of armed services, discontinue investigation 
im:nediately, advise Bureau, and dis~eminate pertinent reports 
locally to appropriate intelligence agency.· Dissemination regarding· 
military personnel is not confined to subjects, of security investi­
gations but extends t,o any s"ubversive data deve:J-oped against member 
of armed services during FBI investigations. If member of armed 
forces has been in contact with security subject or any individual 
or group with security implications, immediately advise appropi·iate 
local intelligence service, even though security aspects of contact 
have not been resolved. Point out in such instances that infor­
mation is unverified and transmit any additional developments im­
med~ately.
