The I .G. REPOR'I' of 1967 (CIA) contains the followinp; description of the events of Aur:;ust 25, 
1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek 
trarr,edy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saip;on late in the eveninr; .of Aup:ust 211, 
1963, a date made more sir.;n:Lficant because it was a Saturday. Washinr;ton usually· empties on 
swnmer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation. 
"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON. 
It was drawn up at a meetiri,::r, called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRD"1AN and HOOER 
HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task 
force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIHEC'L'OTT 
JOHN McCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRE'l'I\RY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

and the telegram long on its way. 
" ... the cable proved historic. For the first time it r,:ave t~e sip-p~l to .

of one war at a time. It envisae;ed the generals' makinp.; war on their own government, and 
with the implicit blessins; of the United States.
