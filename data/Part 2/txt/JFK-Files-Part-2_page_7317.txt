MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 
SUBJECT . . Senator Gary Hart's-Request to Talk 
to QJWIN While Traveling in Europe 
75/1009 
This is for your information concerning Senator Gary 
Hart's request to talk to a former-agent while the senator 
is traveling in Europe. 
The agent is· QJWIN. He was first approached. -in 1958 
through the head of the Luxembourg intelligence service. 
At first he was used mainly to spot potential agents in 
various European countries. Later he became the major 
asset under ZRRIFLE. In this.capacity he made a brief 
.visit to the Congo, but took no actions. • 
On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate 
Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters 
reading files, .including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others. 
QJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read. 
So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the 
time when we ended our contract with this agent. We have 
not contacted him since. 
We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select 
Cornrni ttee staff telephoned QJWIN-. This report remains 
• unconfirmed. We have protested to Bill.Miller. 
It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could 
·_ talk to a former agent without arousing _the interest of 
the local intelligence service (probably Luxembourg)· and __ -
:of the host government who might wonder about the propriety· 
of investigations being conducted on their territory and 
involving· one of their citizens. -
. In any event, an approach of this nature would be 
of interest to the Department of State, and the senator 
might _wish to consult with the Department before ·p_roceeding·. _-
