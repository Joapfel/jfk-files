--_-_ "Ramparts" magazine is largely sta.ff produced and has 
nothing to offer ·out the guts and freedom of its reporters to 
report facts as they see them. 1·Ramparts 0 does not edit the 
reporters' articles for opinion or value of concept. These_. 
a~ticles are.only edited £or size and po~~ible emphasis for a' 
·particular iss~e so that there would not be four articles on 
Vietnam in a single issue, for instance. When "Rampartstl sends 
a reporter to do a story it prints what the repdrte~ writes 
even though the Editor does not necessa:l:'ily agree with that 
:::\eporter' s viewpoint. • -

SCHEER feels that the United States is more· 
afflicted with an .. extremely biased press because in the United 
States we have the illusion of freedom and Americai:s are rais~d • 
to l:>eTiev~ that we have a free press while in.fact the press is 
controlled through "an interlocking..,,.directorate of big business, 
big military and big governmeht 1; that effectively manages the -
news so that it is not troubling or ups~tting to their interests.

. SCHEER believes that the honest reporting of news by' 
11Ramparts" is doing rian awful lot of good" because a generation 
is being raised in the United States that knows how to be·fre~ 
- for a change and "is not going to buy the nonsense that comes 
out of Washington"-. The youths are asking some very searching 
questions about-American society and are not satisfif3d with the 
tisual glibness so ~h~y ar~ willing t~·go on marches bebau~e 
they db not buy these answer·s. This is a. very large_ minority 
of youths. 
Most of the American soldiers in Vietnam have been 
ra.ised to believe that their country ,always does,right and have 
an implicit racism~ They realize.that the.Vietnamese do not 
really share United States objectives. For in•stance nThere. • _ 
is a 650,000 man Vietnamese army that never does anyfightingW'.

from the-countryside - and has done some very fine things in'the 
countryside~ ti

There are some crac~s in the bra1nwash1_ng and some 
disillusionment- with the war in--Vietnam even among Arrteri.can troops. 
M're people have refused to fight and more people in the army
