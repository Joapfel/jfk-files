were flown each month, weather permitting, until Septembe~ 1962, when the 
number of flights was increased. 
Also, even before 1962, regular electronic reconnaissance and photographi~ 
flights were flown by the military on a regular basis over international waters 
but not over the Island of Cuba itself. 
In addition, during the same period, thousands of human source ,reports 
were collected and assessed. Included in these reports were many which con­
tained allegations of missile-related activities and of the presence of Soviet 
ground combat units in Cuba. However, although the reports were checked to the 
greatest extent possible, the intelligence community obtained no confirmation 
of such activities. 
In recognition of the increasing importance of the Cuban problem, the 
intelligence community in early 1962 intensified their intelligence activities 
and stated a greater urgency in their collection requirements with respect to 
Cuba. The routine one-a-month flight over Cuba was increased to two a month. 
The intelligence community was alert to the implications of the communization 
of Cuba. However, on the basis of the information collected and the assessment 
of this information, the intelligence conclusion at this time was that the 
activities were primarily de,fensively oriented. No Soviet combat units or 
strategic weapons were discovered. 
( 
The intelligence community, although agreeing that the activities in Cuba 
were then primarily directed towards defense, did conclude in early 1962 that 
it might probably be expected that the IL-28 (Beagle) light bomber would be 
supplied to Cuba by the Soviets in the future.
