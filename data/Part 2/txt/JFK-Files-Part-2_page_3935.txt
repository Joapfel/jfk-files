• • • c:~n1'i:.m. each and ever~ &.bdertion ma~e by its. au~hor,. Thomas c. Lucey •. Mr. Lucey, despite 
h~s c1t1ng a· substantial number of 1naccurac1e_s, has nonetheless depicted a vast areii. of 
what may be termed 1the fundamental truth. With this in mind; °J,have tried to setlthe 
record straight only insofar as it· pertains to ·those inaccuracies - and omissions 
-. which iri my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.. • • l 
In order to view Mr. Lucey's account in a so:newhat ~ifferent perspective, I s.~11 
begin by advising that I first went: to work for the Central Intelligence Agency ~uch 
earlier.than Aup:ust 1962. It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned as a Gase 
Re•iew Officer with the ·Counter Intelligence· Corps at Los Angeles, that I was ini tiJ.lly. 
recruited into- the CIA' s farflung net·work of informa~ts and agents, one of a number~ I 
·suppose, within tho Defense Department's , intelligence community who helped the Agency ; 
_ .. keep an eye on its not. always· ta.me competitor. lly recruitment ·was. handled by a Her~ert 
• '. Leibacher, ·an e.eent of _the CIA' s Los A1:1g~les office~ and _a Joe DaVanon_, later identified·. 
• • to me through photographs. as e.n official from CIA headquf~rters, then located on_! "E" . 
. '· street in Washington, ·n.c. Motivated by a degree of naivete and the• Agency's subtle 
• -· reminders· that· I owed a greater duty to my country than to the military establishment ,1 - I 
·_ . serve~ _ as a- non-paid, . confidential ~nf?rmant off ~nd on ui:itil my res~enation from !the 
• ·Army 1n October 1959. A complete dest:riphon. of the 1nformo.t1on I supplied to the Agency. 
:during iny military career would only a_dd to what must perforce· become a lengthy addendum; 
:may it suffice to say -"hat it_ did not always seem gern:ane to iritelligerice affairs, !but 
when ii did it con•sisted mainly of an assortment ·or .data that .for so-called discretio4ary. 
reasons was _· seldoa p_assed on to the . Agency: .( or for that matter, to our own hiiher . 
echelons) through regular cllannels. . • •• 
Kr. Lucey.' s statement, "Being married • to a· foreign national meant an autom~tic 
removal from • intelligence work so Nagel 1 decided to· leave the Army," is misleading !and 
incorrect in its entirety. The only military intelligence organiza.tiori from which an 
individual is normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the CIC -
primarily a security type orgen - and this rule does not necessarily apply when the agent 
is an enlisted man or warrant officer. As ·a commissioned officer, . I Wfls declared 
ineligible for further duty with th_e CIC effective 14 April 1959, a full year afteti my 
morriage to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even ~ore 
sensitive, MI organizations such as Field Operations·' Intelligence, then the clandes~ine . 
·espionage department of military intelligence •. - As for the reasons I left the Army, \hey 
were clearly if euphemistically explained in my seconr\ letter of resignation, d~ted . 
• 31 August 1959, nameiys • "I· desire to tender my resignation because I wish to fur the~ my • 
•-.·._ civilian education.- It. is not possible· for me• to pursue the curriculum of which<( am~":'~ 
desirous while on active duty. Also, conipc.ssionate reasons of a peri::onal nnture exist • 
for desiring to tender my resignation at this time." 
My patronage under the .CIA did not end with my.,dischar1~e from the Army and ensuing 
• . employment in. December 1959 as an investigator for ·the State o·f California; in fact, 
henceforth I was offered-remuneration -for my services, ·however .nominal it F-ometimes was. 
• • ·irhat my new . tasks . comprised • is·. of no real pertinence to this addendum or to later 
_ developments, except perhaps to mention that one ·or my-conte.cts said he worked out of 
"Domestic Intelli1:ence," possibly the forerunner of the present-day Domestic Operations 
Division, which ·illegally keeps tabs on _a wide range of American civilian orgnnizations 
• and activities. • I should· also point out that I did not quit my position with ~he State· 
of California "to work for the CIA.," as implied by Kr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June 
:· 1962, at my ·own option and in my opinion for doing my job. ( The following month I we.a 
. • shot thro.ugh the right chest nuring : an al terca.tion with a pereon whose identity I have 
• never disclosed •• • • ~ npt through the left chest by myself, . my wife, a.n Alcoholic 
• .Beverage Control_ inspector then under investigation or by a Los Angeles police officer 
"because of communistic -. implications," as has been reported at various· times by various 
a~~tces). • •
