Leopoldville ·or that.ha had·maans of dealing directly vith 
the Chief of Station in Leopoldvillo without going through 
you? 
Mr. Tweedy. He always said that any DDP, of course, 
I that has the capability, and right, it wan never my impre••ion 
that ho was uaing it and going around me, no. But that • he 
did, but he might have done it, I wouldn't gainsay it, he 
certainly had the right and capability to go into it. 
Mr. Dawson. Can wo go into how tho right was able to be 
exercised? 
Mr. 'I",,eedy. All heh.ad to do was send a cable. He 
could establieh his own channel to Leopoldville with his own 
set at slugs which would exclude the Chief of African Division.

a cable or messenger to the Chief of Station in another

He obviously had the authority. My relationships with 
8is3ell were such that I do not believe it. 
I never had the impression that he ever had any inten­
cion or desire to go around me on matters of this kind. 
Mr. Dawson . Who elae other than the DDP or DCI 
would have such authority? 
Mr. Tweedy. I don't know.
