ships and cargoes. Now appears AMLEG agents generally 
unsuited for violent sabotage. 
DIRECTOR 39186 Dated 11 May 1963 
Restriction on sabotage applies only to explosive 
and incendiary type actions such as limpets and shape 
charges. Wish to explore possibility of non-violent 
methods of sabotaging Cuban ships. Wish to minimize 
USG sponsorship of sabotage acts whenever possible. 
This program is to be held on stict need to know basis. 
Therefore, no briefing of State personnel without prior 
Hqs. approval. Request for approval in most cases will 
be denied. Rationale fc;rr revision is that State fully 
represented in approval this program and may brief their 
Chiefs of Mission thru own channels if they wish. 
_lRESEARrnER COM-ffiNI' : In view of large number of persons 
briefed on the program in a short period of time, it 
appears likely that the Gov't of Cuba could have possibly 
learned of the program by June 1963, some four months 
before the assassination of President Kennedy. The State 
Dept. approved the operation and Ambassadors were to be 
infonned on a strictly "need to know basis." There was 
a minor flap when it was learned that .Amb. McArtlrur 
(Belgium) was infonned of the program.T
