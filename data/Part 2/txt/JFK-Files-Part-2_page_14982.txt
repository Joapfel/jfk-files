computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and 
criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27, 
1967. At the present time the fallowing police agencies are directly 
on-line to the FBI computer:

St. Louis Police Department 
New Orleans Police Department

\
,v Denver FBI Field Office

• These agencies are entering records on wanted 
persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property. 
They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds. 
For example, a police officer- on the street in New Orleans through 
the use of his car radio is able to get infor1nation from the FBI 
computer here in vVashington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California 
Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled 
to join the NCIC system on Mar.ch 20, 1967. The system has had a 
steady growth in building up the information tha1t is stored in the 
computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is 
"on the air" and in adding new participating police agencies.
