Biogra~hical background 
Opinions on PFIAB generally 
Never heard of E«ecutive Action· 
III know of no plan,plot, operational organization that 
ever came to President Eisenhower with respect ao any 
assassinations, "JUOl (2272-3) 
In- 1960, Eisenhower "approved a four point program, s:mkmx 
sabotage, stepped up economic sanctions, propaga~da,_ 
and the :tke training of Cuban refugees" 
There was one w:e llwell known individual" on PFIAB 
who would ask at each CIA briefing on Vietnam "have you 
6orisidereJ trying ·to bump off .some of the le~ders in Noith-. I 
Vietnam". imemRmltml'lfmimK~xm-a: Gray says that "Agency policy 
was against assassination on the ground that it didn't­
accomplish anything". 
"I know of no (assassination) plan or operational 
capability that has ever been authorized at any high 
level of government~ 
Rmemidem At a meeting with Gray and a representative 
of the Cik-in 1958, "the President told me that he-wanted 
the 54/12 gropp to:pass upon all activities of this 
government which impinged upon the sovereignty or the 
people of some other nation .... President Eisenhower was" 
very sensitive to the necessity of having the top people 
in government from the appropriate agencies pass upon 
the ~i4dom, and in some cases, feasibility of those 
kinds of operations." 
Gray is unenthusiastic about proposal for Joint Congression 
al «oversight committee because of danger of leaks 
Gray recommends creation of a "chief intelligence officer" 
(either the DCI or a §pecial Assist. t9 the Pres. for Int.) 
« tRHJ±bbO: Gray did not recall Ambassador Farland's 
• .-report in May, 1960 that dissidents in the Rom. Rep .. wanted,"'..( 
high powered rifles with telescopic scopes:x and subsequentl;~: 
received authorization to provide them by the Assist. Secy -
of State through the DCI. 
Gray did not recall Special Group meetings at e~d of Eisen­
hower Admin. (11/29/60; 1/12/61) at which it was agreed to 
furnish arms to dissisents in the Dom.Rep. 
--"I would think our concern was, if we had that kind of 
concern, wa~ with being of assistance to the dissidents, 
and not assasssination, or that kind of activity."
