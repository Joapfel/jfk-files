• \Ve have concluded that the best solution is to have this 
officer attend a university in the Midwest for at l~ast 
a year; working to,,vards an adyanced degree until the.re 
has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan 
to n1ake no operatio.ial use of tile CIA Offi:..:.:;::· w;1atsoever,. 
during the period of time that he is attending the: university. 
Upon completion of his year I s study, we will review the , 
situati"on and decide the next course of action at that t'ime. 
Paragraph 1. c. is deleted because it contains sensitive 
Agency opc_rational methods and techniques. 
d. FR Divisio::1 has been bric:fcd in general on the 
_existence of an audio opcr.:1.tion done h'>' the FBI but \vith close 
TSD support in San Francis co. This operation is directed 
against IOEN-62. I under stand the operation has 
been exceptionally well done. Ho\_.•cver, the responsibility 
for this activity has co1ne f!o1n Chief, TSD in conjt.in_ction . 
with SB Division. 
e. Three 1nicrophoncs were planted ii1 various locatio;.1s 
in the IDEN-61 by the FBI. The equipment was pro­
duced by CLl\. and the overall operation was joint, although no 
CIA perso·nnel have entered the· premises. The operation was 
deactivated and is presently dorinant. The mikes, however, 
are still in place. If discovered the operation could cause 
some e1nbarrassment to the American Governn1cnt, but lt is 
unlikely the finger would point to CIA.
