when we got into discussions about operations or what have you~ they seemed to 
be more concerned about when they were going to become a division chief, a 
station chief, and when they were going to become DDP and then eventually, 
"how do I get to be DCI?" And finally after all of that is over, "What about 
my pension rights?" 
INTERVIEWER: That's already coming? 
MR. HALPERN: Yea, in the very beginning in '71, '72, '73, and at least '70, 
'71 and '72 when I was more concerned about talking to them because by '73 we 
were having difficulties with the Schlesinger turnover and what ~ave you .. But 
this was one of the things that struck me ver-y strong, and I was bothered by 
it, and these were the best of the applicants. -They had already been through 
all of the machinery.and all 'the screening processes and what have you and 
these were the shining stars from the academe, and I was concerned about 
that. But again, what do you do? 
INTERVIEWER: Were others troubled as well? 
MR. HALPERN: Yea, some of my colleagues were. They picked it up the same way 
I did except on a different level. They were doing it in the branches or in 
the staffs, most in the branches, or in the area units and I was looking from 
across the board. But it was the same idea. We used to kick this around at 
lunch. How do you get instilled into the new group, the upcoming generation, 
the guys who are going to take over from us, that there is more to this 
business than worrying about your pension? I tried. to tel 1 .some of them, look 
some of us are going to be in this business their whole career and never see­
the DCI's office let albne te the DCI. And so I said, "In 111 organitations 
not everybody can be the field marshall. Some of them have to be privates and 
stay as privates our whole career." And that didn't go down at all.
