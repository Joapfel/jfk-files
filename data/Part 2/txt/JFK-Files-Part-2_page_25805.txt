Now reporter Smith is dictating a 
story ready for. printing. 
Smith rolls on, swiftly and 
fluently, adding fresh details as 
"pandemonium" breaks out •

telephone _niche. 
Searching his mind £or 
impressions of the_ shooting, 
Smith adds all he can remember 
to the story. The shaken wire

sniper, what kind of weapon 
he used, or where the
