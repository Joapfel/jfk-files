And fivl, ofvour Presidi.•nts [Eisenhow-'

thought so, too. 
Q. Since you say the assistance .was proper • 
and just another form of U.S. aid; why, then,' 
the secrecy.and method of payment?

lai111<.:hed the campaign to. lJlock. ·the 
Hawk .anti-air.craft missile defe11se sys­
tem to Jordan. Fortu11ately, the li)bby 
failed. 
Q. How much of a setback do you feel the 
storJ has been to the peace-with-Israel 
_campaign? 
A. 1 forvcntly hope. of comsc, that it 
will not he a setback. Admittedly, it may 
• have a dl' lcterious effi.x·t on our JW:tcc• 
efforts, hut I plan to persevere rcgard­
lc'.ss of attempts to sabotage a just and 
durable -peace. 
Q. What, for example, do you fJel the story 
will do to your differences with the PLO and 
attempts to form a joint de/eg<1tion • for the 
, Geneva talks? Is. a joint delegation still a 
realistic possibility? 
A. A PLO delegation is in A111111a11 this 
wcck:mcl the ,,,hole. (Jttt.•sth)n or a joint 
delegation is still very much in qtwstion.

Q. Is it your impression that the PLO Is now 
ready to amend its basic charter and agree to 
coexist peacefully with Israel In a West Bank­

A. This is the d!'cisio11 tlll'v 11111st face. 
B1it it is <'qually important tc; know what 
the lsr:l<'li position wi-11 l>c. Wh~• should 
the PLO take such a step 111iilatcrally?

ity-"tsracl ret'ognizes·a West Bank-Ga7,a 
Palestinian state and the l'akstinian·s 
recognize Israel. 
Q. Is it your intention to negotiate with the 
PLO prior to Geneva a new organic link be­
tweena possibl~ Palestinian state on the West 
Bank and Jord1m proper? 
A. This has been suggested hy many 
leaders i11 the area as a possible coi1-
iitructive development and wv certai1_1-
ly J?lan to explore' the· po~sibilities. 
But I must caution ,·011 against overopti•• 
mism. The resumptjon of the Geneva 
conference by itself means 11ntlti11g and 
if it doesn't produce quick results .. 
then .:there will he the danger of a 
letdown, of the, pc·11d11\111 .. 1 ~wi11gi11g

fore· aga°in. 
Q. How do you think the latest CIA story ·will 
affect relations between Jordan and the Unit­
ed States? 
A. Throughout all I hcse years I havt· 
been very proud oftlH' growing strength 
of tlw rnlationship with our American 
friends. vVe identified with principle, 
your forefathers . hl'ld dear. We built 
our relations on the basis of mutual 
·respect, confidenc;e and faith. and be­
yond that anything I did to cement 
relations with the U.S. was based on- a 
deep conviction aho11t our connnon oh­
jectivc•s-stahility, peace. an,l progress 
in. the M icldle East. 
My duty is ·10 develop rny country, its 
hum,m resources, anncd forces and scct1-
rity and ihtelligencc S(~r'vices., lo face the 
trenwndous threats that lie ahead. The 
road is strewn with mines to sabotage thl' 
pC'acc process. One has j11st c>~ploded in 
v\lashington. There will he others. 13111 
hear in mind that Jordan is 1101 1111iq11e in 
receiving Slll'h help. Israel falls into the 
same catcgor~' and is :1 far grcal<'r exam-· 
pk of' all ki1,ds or assistance. As E1r as I 
am l'on,:erned, thcs<' will he 111v first and 
'vn~• last ·,qm\s 011 that 111atlc,:. 1\J~, per­
sonal pride is a verv tn11l'h~• s11hj1"Cl. And 
my main concern is lo prcserv<' Jordan in 
freedom. 
Finally. regarding your media attacks 
against a branch of y,rnr government, if 
you choose to clen udc a vital arm that is 
there to protect yo11, that is vour affair, 
n_ot Jonla11's.
