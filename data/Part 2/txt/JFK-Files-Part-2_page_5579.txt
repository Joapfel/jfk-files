,J•·-~-lS~!;a 
On my return ~ my•office this morning I checked on the notes 
of meetings which were;laij,t by m;Y, secretary~ and they confirm Mr. 
Helms' recollection .. lam ~ttaching a copy of the relevant page of the 
calendar. • Although it is clear from this page that there was such a 
meeting, I continue to havj! absolutely no recollection of it, and there­
fore cannot tell you wha\'Was discussed beyond what is stated in the 
calendar itself. • , 
It was not my custom to make notes on sucli meetings. and 1 ·• 
doubt that there are in the files of the Department any notes made. by 
me. However· it is. po$Sible.tbat Mr~ .Yeagley or Mr. Foley made such 
notes .. lbelieveMr~'.Foleyis~,,deceased. but Mr. Yeagley is now 
a judge in uieDi~ of Colfunbia;'aii'd per~ps h~ would have: some 
recollection of the meeting. • • • • :, , r; ,-., ~•· .
