William Henry Rentschler, aged.43, former news­
paper reporter, has been co-owner an9/or President of a 
candy company since 1956. He has been extremely active in 
Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several 
years. He was involved in adulterous relationship with a 
woman other.thail;his wife for .approximately three years and 
later married that woman. This was a well known fact by 
those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement 
in notorious divorce action pr~sents serious questi6ri of 
his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator 
Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told 
him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass 
the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the 
investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an 
intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of 
politics. Several persons pointed out he lacks business· 
ability, fails to follow through on details and does not have 
a feeling for finances. Some individuals did not recommend 
him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser­
vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum 
containing the results of investigation to date was furnished 
to the White House on February 10, 1969. Outstanding investi­
gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H. Stans, Secre­
tary of Commerce, and several other individuals who have 
been unavailable for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter­
viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un­
favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial 
irresponsibility and his moral life. Additional investigation 
is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary Stans.
