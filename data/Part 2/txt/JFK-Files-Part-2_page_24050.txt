5. American Officials Had Exaggerated Notions About 
Their.Ability to Control the Actions of Coup Leaders 
Running throughout the cases considered in this report 
was- the expectation of American officials that they could 
control the actions of dissident groups which they were support­
ing in foreign countries. Events demonstrated that the United 
States had no such power. This point is graphically demonstrated 
by cables exchanged shortly before the coup in Vietnam. 
Ambassador Lodge cabled Washington on October 30, 1963, that he 
was unable to halt a coup; a cable from Bundy in response stated 
that "We cannot accept conclusion that we have_no power to delay 
or discourage. a cou·p." The coup took place three days later. 
Shortly after the experience of the Bay of Pi8s, CIA 
headquarters reqOested operatives in the Dominican Republic 
to tell the dissidents to "turn off" the assassination attempt.·, 
because the United States.was not prepared to "cope with the 
aftermath." The dissidents replied that the assassination 
was their affair ~and that· it could· not be turned off to suit 
the convenience of the United Stai:es Government.
