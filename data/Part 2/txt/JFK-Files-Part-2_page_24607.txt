d. The Question of Authorization in the Johnson Administration 
1. SU1TDT1ary of the Assassination Activity. As discussed above (see pp. -~....:), 
the Agency delivered arms to AM/LASH in.Cuba in March and June 1964. In early 
1965 after .Mf/LASH became more insistent that a Castro assassination was neces-
sary and had asked for a silenced weapon, the Agency put AM/LASH in contact with 
the leader of an anti-Castro group, B~l, with the intention that AM/IASH obtain 
such a weapon. Thereafter, the Agency learned that AM/LASH had received a 
silencer and other special equipment from B-1 and was preparing to assassinate· 
Castro. 
2. The Issue of Authorization. The.issue of authority in the Johnson Admini­
stration is similar to that in the Kennedy Administration. During this phase of 
the .Mf/LASH plot, Helms continued as Deputy Director for covert operations, and 
the principal members of the Kennedy Administration continued in their positions 
in the relevant period of the Johnson Administration (Robert Kennedy left the 
Administration in the midst of this period, on ).* Helms' testimony 
-----' 
that he believed a Castro assassination was within the scope of the CIA's authority 
iri view of Administration policy towards Cuba applied to the Al\1/LASH operation in 
both 1963 and 1964-65. (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 137-138.) Again, there was no evidence 
that McCone or anyone above the Agency sre<:ifically authorized or knew about the 
1964-65 plot. We discuss below four other matters occurring during the Johnson 
Administration: (1) the covert action program against Cuba in 1964-1965; (2) 
the Special Groups' action in investigating reports of Cuban exile unden.rorl'd 
*Rusk (Secretary of State), McNamara (Secretary of Defense), McCone (Director 
_of Central Intelligence); and Bundy (Special Assistant for National Security 
and ChaiJ1!lan of tl~e Special ~roup).
