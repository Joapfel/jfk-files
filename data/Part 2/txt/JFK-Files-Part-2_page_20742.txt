PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972 that it is di~ficult 
to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs 
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of 
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was 
substantially controlled by the SWP .. Source explained that the 
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the 
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia 
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert 
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion 
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic 
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation 
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic 
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and 
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract 
members of the SWP to their organization.
