Mr. Johnson. Could you giva a brief example of the Cil\

I will have meetings with tho following people. I'm not 
going to announce it until a week before I leave. 
So it gives you a time span of two months to use'all or

favor his role or favor his mission and helps him out. And 
that's what we are trying to seek and have been trying to seek 
for a long tine, Rut there has to be~ way of knowinq what 
are oone of the intontiono of the governncnt in order to 
ii .:irlvance it through disinfornation or deception.
