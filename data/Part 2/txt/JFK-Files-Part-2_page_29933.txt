Fost~r remarked that the Bolden case was unique in his 
experience because of the nondisclosure by authorities 
of information that is automatically released to the 
probation officer in a given case. 
Specifically, in every other case which Mr. Foster 
has processed, the prosecutor gave the probation officer 
a "version 1 " i.e., a recital of fact about the crime and 
the circumstances surrounding it. Only in cases where an 
undercover informant is under parole supervision is the 
name of the informant withheld, but even then a version is 
always presented despite the witholding of the name. In 
Bolden's case, the prosecutor·gave the probation officer 
only the indictment. Bolden's prosecutor was named Richard 
T. Sykes.

to make clear that at least one of the witnesses. upon whose 
testimony the conviction was based subsequently recanted h;is 
testimony. The recantation, however, did not enable Bolden
