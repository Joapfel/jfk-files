@.oviets or the West, such as Sukarno and certain South American 
countries, so that they will understand they are not leaning on very 
much when they lean on the Soviets_;] 
6. Explained that I had given a complete briefing to General 
Eisenhower and conveyed to the President General Eisenhower's 
expression of friendship and support. 
7. Discussed briefly my talk with Robert Kennedy and urged 
the President to send a message to Kennedy but not to see him until 
after the first of the year. I asked for the President• s approval to 
invite Kennedy to accompany me to Saigon. 
NOTE: This invitation has been extended but Kennedy 
felt it was untimely because of personal family commitments, 
responsibilities to Jackie, concern on the part of his wife, 
Mrs. Kennedy, and for other reasons. 
8. Mr. Bundy joined in part of these discussions. The President 
asked what the Attorney General intended to do, that is, stay on or leave. 
I told the President the Attorney General intended to stay on as Attorney 
General, but it was not clear to what extent the President wished him to 
become involved in the activities outside the area of the Office of the 
Attorney General, such as, intelligence work, NSC problems, counter 
insurgency matters, etc. I explained to the President that I had told 
Bobby he could not bring back the intimacy of relationship with the 
President which he had had with his brother because that was a blood 
relationship, not an official relationship. A type of relationship which 
is seldom found between brothers and never found between officials, 
either in business or government. 
9. I gave the President a copy of the memorandum on Soviet 
Foreign Aid.
