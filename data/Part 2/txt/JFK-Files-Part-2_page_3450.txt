well in fact that•most had given up hope of ever go1ng 
anywhere else or accomplishing anything new. 
compartmentation was a way of life, and management was 
remote fro• the rank and file. Kalaris was appalled to 
learn that his chief of support, who had worked in the staff 
for tour or five years, had never met Angleton: he had only
