",, 
Colonel Steakley was present for Items 1 'and 2. 
Mr._ Cheever was pr~se.t1t_ tCJr Item ~. 
1. 1~onthly Reconnaissance Forecasts 
a. NRO 
The NRO forecast for September was approved as presented, 
with one exception. This had to do with the second Laos/North Vietnam. 
flight, which had been requested in order to "replenish the bank." 
Mr. Johnson asked that he be briefed on the results of previous 
reconnaissance in this area so that he could weigh the value of the 
product against the political risk involved. 
It was noted that this procedure will not delay operations, 
since one approval remains outstanding for Laos/North Vietnam. 
b. DOD 
The .DOD September forecast was .approved with the exception 
of the proposed trip of the USS THOMASON. Mr. Johnson objected to 
the proposal to transit the Kita Uruppu Suida Passage. He said that 
the Department is in favor. of continuing to exercise our rights of 
free navigation in the Sea of Okhotsk; but the projected voyage of 
the hydrographic ship REHOBOTH satisfies this requirement. Further, 
U.S. merchant shipping does transit the Passage. In view of these 
considerations, he did not believe it desirable at this time to send 
a U.S. warship on this route. The Group concurred with Mr. Johnson's 
position. 
General Carter said that in view of certain other indications 
recently received, YANKEE PASHA is considered by the intelligence 
community to be even more urgent than before. 
Mr. Johnson raised a question about the mission of the USS 
STATEN !SI.AND in the Chukchi Sea, asking whether the objective could 
not be met by staying 15 miles from shore rather than 12. Colone::]
