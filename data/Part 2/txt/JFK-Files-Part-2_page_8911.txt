SU~™ARY OF CONCLUSIONS 
CONCERNING NOSENK01 S DONA FIDES 
NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in 
successively senior positions of authority from which he 
derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and 
results of I<GB ope~ations against Americans in the Soviet 
Union in the pericd 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, 
he provides an impressive array of information about KGB 
personnel, organiz~tion and operations which, to the extent 
that it has been confirmed, is presumptive evidence of his 
bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including intelli­
gence off1cers, h.Jvc generally corroborated NOSENKO's 
claims. Accordinq to some of these sources, NOSENKO was 
a senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensitive 
positions, who enjoyed considerable authority and trust 
despite personal shortcomings, and whose defection, "the 
greatest loss ever suffered by Soviet Intelligence", 
paralyzed the work of KGB 
The examination has compared each element of NOS:r:NKO's 
biography relevant to l1is claimed KGB service with known 
facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects 
the test: to which his accounts were put: whether his 
accounts are internally coherent and consistent with known 
fact, and whether he actually gained the information he has 
from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held. 
In short, is he what he says he is, .::i.ccordin']' to his own 
dCCOUnts?
