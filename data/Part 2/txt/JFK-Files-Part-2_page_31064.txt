Please pass to Asst. Sec. Mann :from.Alnbassador Telles: "I saw President 
Orlich and Minister Quiros Sasso on 18 November and conveyed reference position. 
The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government was not in-
volved in this arms shipment. After some discussion with Minister Quiros, 
President Orlich rec;.uested tr..at we not issue license for AMB.C\NG-1 shipment. 
President Orlich made clear he would be happy at any tioe to undertake 
action such as this ii' US government wanted him to. While he does wish 
see CUba free he inclined to agree with"US position Re Hit and Run raids 
undertaken principally for publicity sake. President Orlich's decision 
based on (1) relaization that he would not be doing us a favor and, (2) 
further realization that CRG would be hard pressed to explain s~ch a 
$70,000 purchase of arras if it became a campaign issue in 1965."
