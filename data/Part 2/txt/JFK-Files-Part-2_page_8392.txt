As is clear from the attached study and the log of activities of CRUZ 
during October 1970, CRUZ is extremely busy, has many contacts, and is 
probably one of' the more accessible members of the Cuban .Embassy~ On

press matters, and handling the Cuban :Embassy side of Prensa Latina, that 
the Station does not believe he has practically any time free for intelli­
gence assignments. (Since the arrival of the Cultural. Attache in 
January 1970, CRUZ has dropped all cultural activities. He no longer 
handles the Mexican-Cuban Cultural Institute.) He is on the phone with 
or visiting the Prensa Latina offices -several times each day. i He 
arranges for subscriptions to publications {magazines-and newspapers) 
through Prensa Latina from the United States and Latin American countries f; 0 
... ~and he orders books from various bookstores in Mexico City. He al.so • :;, g

commercial nights from the Prensa Latina representative in Peru. He > 3. 
orders photographic and other related supplies in Mexico and New York, ~ z . 
and handles visas for newsmen who wish to travel to Cuba. Mercedes does Iii- 3 lot to help CRUZ, as he does not have ·his own secretary. As can be seen :c.. u­
