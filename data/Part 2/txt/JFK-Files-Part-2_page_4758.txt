, MR. HALPERN: Oh, if by anxiety you mean concern that the thing 
might leak. 
INTERVIEWER: Yeah~ 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah .. The-re always was and this is why .it was so 
tightly held .. If you are thinking about'using anxiety in terms 
of mora·lity. no. Because as far as we were concerned, I think· 
most of the guys on the Task Force, we were at a war with 
Cuba. I mean, when you start sending in_ people to shoot up 
somebody else's country and blow up parts of somebody else's 
country and they take losses, I mean human losses, and we, take 
human losses, that's war as far as I am concerned.·· I don't 
care what you ca 11 ·it. ca 1l it po 1 ice action-, ca 11 it something 
'_,, ' 
else, but anyway, we were at war. And of course, some people 
coul.d even call it by today's terminology, terrorism._ 
International t4rrorism. We weren't targeting market places, 
though, and bus stations and things like that obviously. We 
were going after industrial plants, power plants, sugar 
. plants. Things like that. But peopl·e did.get hurt on both 
sides. So yes, there ~as that kind of an anxiety in terms 6f 
keeping our hand out of the assassination plots as much as 
possible. Having been involved in only one of them, I have no 
idea, for ex amp 1 e. if Bil 1 Harvey was mucking around with 
Rossel 1 i of the Mafia. Bill knew how to keep a secret. And 
even though I was his Exec,· I had no idea and I know his deputy 
had no idea at all. And as a matter of fact the deputy didn't 
have anj.idea of the AMLASH operation.
