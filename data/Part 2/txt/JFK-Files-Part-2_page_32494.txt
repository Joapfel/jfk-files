Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti-Communist Move 
Continued Communist-incited disorders and an alleged 
Havana-Moscow plan to take over the government 
prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional 
_guarantees in Peru and institute a nationwide state 
of si~ge early on 5 JanuaryQ Military commanders 
assumed political control in their respective zonesj 
and a reported 800 Communist Party leaders and pro­
Communist subversives have been arrested. The 
Lima headquarters of several Communist and 
Communist-front organizations, as well as their 
publications 9 have been closed. 
According to the Communist plan, subversive activity 
was to have been intensified between 15 and 20 
January in all parts of Peru 9 with assaults on 
banking and commercial institutions 9 military 
garrisons, vital communications facilities 1 and 
universities. A clandestine radio station 6perating 
on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct 
and co-ordinate this activity. 
The junta has re~arded me~bers of the leftist but 
non-Communist American Popular ·Revolutionary 
Alliance (.A...PRA) a greater danger than the 
Communists and originally tended to blame them 
for the disorders. There is no proof that APRA. 
has been involved in anything but lagititmate 
strike activity. Suspension of constitutional 
guarantees would enable the junta to strike at 
APRA to discredit and weaken it before the scheduled 
elections next June. (SECRET)
