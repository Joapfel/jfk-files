New assassination Records - "M" [Miscellaneous] Series 
The ARRB submitted 53 numbered "Requests for Additional Information and 
Records" (CIA-# and CIA-IR-# series) plus many informal requests on individuals and 
subjects in their search for additional assassination records. Theses requests 
generated several 100 additional assassination records including 185 audio tapes from 
the Mexico City telephone taps. Additional material related to the JFK Act including DO 
cables to the field and working files of the HRP project officer were declared 
assassination records in the final actions of the Board. Over 4500 pages and 17 tapes 
have been reviewed and prepared for transfer to NARA. The remaining records and 
tapes are scheduled for completion by September 1999,.
