report. What was that report? 
Mr. Angleton. At one stage in all of this -- and it was 
much later, after all the dust settled -- Helms got the 
Inspector General, who had come from the clandestine side of 
our business, to institute -- I don't like to use the word 
inspection, it is too authoritative -- to go into the Nosenko 
matter and see if there is anything there that he should know, 
because Helms is fully aware of the split on this whole 
question of bona fides, and it bothered him, because I had 
brought him in touch with Golitzen, and he was fully aware of 
all my activities, and travels and so on. 
And so this person who was chosen began to interview 
everybody and reopen the whole thing. I mean, there were 21 
safe leads of stuff if you really got into all of the Golitzen 
and Nosenko and the other things that pertained, as I pointed 
out. to the Warren Commission, to the asininity of what has 
happened, of 27 years of experience of myself and my two 
colleagues, that these are the facts, that there are 20 cases 
Mr. Schwarz. You said Warren Commission. You mean 
Rockefeller? 
Mr. Angleton. Excuse me, Rockefeller. 
There are 20 some odd cases that a counterintelligence 
officer in our busienss should know before he even begins to 
get his feet wet.
