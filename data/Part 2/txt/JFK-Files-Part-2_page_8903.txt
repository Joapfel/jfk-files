(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-1964) 
NOSENKO's Information 
SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First 
Chief Directorate because of his business· transactions 
with a number of ·soviets who visited his store and in 
whom he seemed to show more than casual interest. The 
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that 
SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with 
some Soviets, to study them. SLESINGER had visited the 
Soviet Union several times. Learning SLESINGER planned 
another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he 
might make some contacts or do something interesting" 
while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to 
resolve its suspicions that SLESINGER was possibly an 
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KGB had 
a file on SLESINGER, md a senior case officer in the 
American Section of the Seventh Department, Yu. M. 
DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer. An agent 
of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo­
graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to become friendly 
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet 
Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence. 
SLESINGER went to Odessa- to visit relatives, and DVORKIN .. 
directe~l°' the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. who 
could watch his behavior. If there had been ~ny indication 
of intelligence activities, the KGB would have attempted 
to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed, 
no approach was made. SLESINGER had travelled to the 
Soviet Union before, several times. 
A sensitive source 
Comment: had reported to the 
FBI that the KGB suspected SLESINGER to 
be an FBI "plant" and that KGB officer 
"might be trying to develop 
SLESINGER to act as a courier or in some 
other agent capacity." 
NOSENKO's information was substantially 
correct. Alfred Lazarevich SLESINGER, 
reported to the FBI in July 1962 of his 
June 1962 visit to Moscow and Odessa. 
In Odessa SLESINGER was contacted by a 
Soviet official who exhibited "intimate 
knowledge" of his business in New York 
City and had asked whether SLESINGER had 
"ever been bothered. by the FBI."
