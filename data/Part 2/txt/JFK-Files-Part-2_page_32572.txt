This complex problem needs a high level decision

do To Deliver a Signal That Can Be Heard 
(1) Soviet jamming of propaganda broadcasts.raises 
serious questions concerning our ability to deliver a signal that 
can be heard above the ja.11ll'f1inr," To be sure» some of our broadcasts 
get through because they are unable simul taneousJ.y to jam broadcasts 
in all areas nor do they in practice jam a given broadcast trans-
mission at all hourso • 
For future plarming pu.."'1)0ses~ however9 these factors 
seem clear: 
(a) Soviet capabilities for jmnming a.._-r-e large and 
on the increaseo 
(b) The degree of their jamming seems to be r!8= 
lated to their estimate of the harmful effect of the broadcasts on 
their interests,, Hence9 the more effective parts of our pi.."'Opaganda 
are likely to be jammed even though other parts get :through!> 
{ c) We have no present capabilities to monitor 
their jamming if they usa1......,.gs they probabl,y do in congested areas­
