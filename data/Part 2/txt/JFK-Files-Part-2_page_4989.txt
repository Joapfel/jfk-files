EXERCISE FIELD TO WORK OUT. CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL NOTED THAT 
THIS WOULD HAVE ASSEMBLED ALL OR MOST OF THE CCC MEMBERSHIP IN 
HAVANA IN AN OPEN AREA WHERE IT COULD BE OBSERVED AND 
PHOTOGRAPHED. THE INVITATION, COMING AS IT DID AS A ONE-TIME 
OPPORTUNITY WITH NO PRECEDENT, FUELED SUSPICIONS WITHIN THE CCC 
AND THE INVITATION WAS DECLINED. 
7. A SERIES OF EVENTS INVOLVING RAFAEL ALCIDES, A NOTED 
CUBAN POET AND FIRST HUSBAND OF TERESA ((FERNANDEZ)) MARDONES (A 
MEMBER OF THE CCC), WAS SIGNIFICANT TO THE CCC BECAUSE IT CALLED 
INTO QUESTION WHERE ALCIDES' LOYALTIES LAY. ALCIDES AND FERNANDEZ 
HAD ONE CHILD, A SON, TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE DIVORCED AROUND 
LATE 1993. FERNANDEZ HAD REMARRIED AND WAS LIVING WITH RONALDO 
((ROQUE)) (COUSIN OF REINALDO ROQUE), AND ALCIDES WAS SPENDING 
CONSIDERABLE TIME AT THE ROQUE RESIDENCE, PRESUMABLY TO BE WITH 
HIS SON. THE CCC BECAME CONCERNED WITH THE SECURITY OF THE 
SITUATION AS FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO CCC INFORMATION AND WAS 
ASSESSED AS BEING EMOTIONAL AND TENDING TO CONFIDE TOO MUCH. 
MARTINEZ-AMORES WAS DISPATCHED BY THE CCC TO FEEL OUT ALCIDES, AND 
REPORTED THAT HE SPOKE COHERENTLY AND LOGICALLY AGAINST THE 
CURRENT REGIME. MARTINEZ-AMORES APPEARED TO BE REASSURED. 
SUBSEQUENTLY HOWEVER, IN CONVERSATION WITH ALCIDES, REINALDO ROQUE 
LEARNED THAT ALCIDES WAS PART OF A DELEGATION OF THE CUBAN 
NATIONAL UNION OF WRITERS AND ARTISTS (UNION NACIONAL DE 
ESCRITOREs·y ARTISTAS DE CUBA - UNEAC) THAT VISITED MADRID 
SOMETIME AROUND 1994. WHILE THERE, ALCIDES SAID THAT HE WAS 
INVITED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER UNEAC DELEGATES TO LUNCH WITH 
CARLOS ALBERTO MONTANER. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE LUNCHEON WITH 
MONTANER MUST CERTAINLY HAVE RECEIVED CUBAN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL, 
AND THE GROUP MUST HAVE INCLUDED CUBAN SECURITY PERSONNEL.) 
ALCIDES TOLD ROQUE THAT ON HIS RETURN TO CUBA, HE ATTENDED THE 
FUNERAL FOR A SISTER (NFI) OF FIDEL CASTRO AND DELIVERED THE 
FUNERAL ORATION. FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL, HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE 
EMBRACED BY MINISTER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES GENERAL 
RAUL ( (CASTRO) ) RUZ .
