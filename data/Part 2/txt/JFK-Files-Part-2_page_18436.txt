made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee (, 
(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the 
Deputy Attorney General,until such time as the Department 
can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning 
of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75. 
Memorandum Wannall to Adam~ dated 6/30/75, reviewed 
a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department. This 
draft copy is dated 6/25/75. It .is identical in content with 
the final version dated 6/27/75. 
Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported 
the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney 
General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was 
pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerable/ 
difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of~ 
a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the ~ 
ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any 
specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department. 
and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over 
the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification. 
In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we 
should take no action responsive to the requests levied on 
the FBI in this letter. To date, we have received no infor­
mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification 
of the SSC has been sent. CJ J RE'C-10 t ?-- II 0 3q_r - yJ /)
