Richard .Bissell was in attendance (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 21). 
Dillon stated that this discussion could not have served as

concern typified a prevalent attitude toward Lumumba that might.· 
have justified the CIA' s develop~ent of a capability to as,sassinate

p. 50) . But after bein.g informed of the pois~n plot, Dillon made
