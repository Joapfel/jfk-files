Book V, p. 78 Victor Espinosa, a Cuban exile, involved 
in the transporting explosives to New 
Orleans in 1963, contacted INS with 
information about the AMI.ASH operation. 
This information was turned over to the 
FBI which informed the CIA. Both 
agencies interrogat.ed Espinosa in June 
mt 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 172 
of 1965 and found that he knew that 
AMI.ASH and others were planning a coup 
which involved the assassination of 
Castro and that the CIA had been 
involved with AMI.ASH and others in the 
planning. 
Espinosa and AMI.ASH were life-long friends 
but during the interrogation he gave no 
indication that he was aware of the 1963 
AMI.ASH-CIA meetings. Espinosa's 
information noted in the 1967 IG Report 
suggests a link between the AMI.ASH 
operation and the CIA plots to assassinate 
Castro using underworld contacts. 
Therefore, Espinosa's information raised 
the possibility that underworld figures 
who were aware of the Harvey plots may 
have been aware of the AMI.ASH operation. 
CIA reaction to this interrogation was 
to terminate the operation immediately.
