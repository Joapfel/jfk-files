Mr. John Waller 
Special Assistant to the DDO 
Covert Action Operations Against 
Right Wing Governments 
. : Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated 
18 July 1975 
. Subject: "Summary of_ Covert Action 
Opera~ions Against Right Wing Governments" 
I. EA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible

then in power. In· fact, just the opposite is true. All of these 
operations, while covert in ~he sense that the U.S. Government harrl 
was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of 
the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing 
advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these 
elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking 
participation in the governmental process. 
2. While all of the operations have been terminated, the 
INSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three~ in that

oppositio.µ ele~ents in South Korea. As noted above, the purpose of 
this contact-was not to overthrow the ruling government but rather to 
assist the opposition in establishing itself as a more viable force in its 
effort to establish a two-party system in South Korea. The Agency today
