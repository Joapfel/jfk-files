Conduct of interview. 
(a) Interviews of subjects entitled to the warning and waiver 
shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements set 
forth in Volume I, Manual of I]J.structions, Section 2B, 
page 15. If the interview is being condw~ted for intelligence 
information rather than an admission or confession of 
guilt, no warning is required. Moreover, if the investigatidn 
has failed to develop information indicating a possible 
violation of Federal law by the subject, it would be 
permissible to interview the subject without a warning as 
he does not fit the criteria of those entitled to a warning 
of rightso Carefully plan interview so there will be no 
compromise of sources, sensitive techniques or interviewing 
personnel. An overriding consideration to always bear in 
mind is that interview should elicit from, not provide 
information to the subject. 
(b) Interview at subject's place of employment should be 
avoided if possible. If attorney or aide is present during 
'intervlew, interview must be conducted by two Agents. 
(c) If, during conduct of interview subject desires that his 
attorney or aide be present, the interview should be tact­
fully terminated, and FBIHQ should be informed with recommen­
dation whether or not to resume intervie\·1. 
(d) In all other instances, SAC has responsibility and option 
of deciding when two Agents should handle interview. Safety 
of Agents is first priority to consider. 
Direction of subject's activities. 
Prior FBII-IQ approval is required before taking any steps to· direct 
.the subject's activities even though he may appear to be cooperative 
during the interview.

report or LI-1\1 unless .circumstances indicate need for more 
eA'}Jeditious reporting. In cover letter or administrative
