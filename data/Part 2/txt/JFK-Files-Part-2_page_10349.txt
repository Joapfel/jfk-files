• • _ DOMESTIC TESTS FOR 
.AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOP~IBNT EFFORTS 
1. ·-As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the 
research and devc.lopr.ient 9f equipraent and techniques 
for·Ag~ncy applicitions in foreign intelli~ence, we 
conduct experiments and ~ests in the United States._ 
Clearly,.the design and develop~cnt of our intelli­
gence _equip~ents can be clone more ecqno~ically and 
~ore secur~ly iij this couhtry. Although most of 
the tests of -our R&D equipme'nts arc performed in 
closed laboratories or in secure areas simulating 
the for~ign environment, some of the tests and experi­
ments, of necessity, reveal domestic informatfon. 
~ 2. A review of the surveillanc~ equipment or 
techniques which have at some time or other been 
exposed to dbmestic testing is as follows~ 
.,. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser 
_probe developed by ORD was tested by TSD in 
San Francisco under very closely controlled 
conditions. The ORD Project Officer witnessed 
portions of the test. Recordings. that were 
.made of laser probe output were carefully 
1contro1led as classified material and it is 
- believed that the tapes have long since been 
destroyed. (Wood/TA)

• b ~- Microwave· Intercept System . - About 
1968, this system was :cs :ed in a light ~ir­
craft near the·Naval Ordnance Test Station 
1n Identity 127:, California. This system is 
d~signed to permit intercept of microwave 
tel~phone communication channels of systems 
such as Identity 130 . _ _ • It 
works equally well against the Bell Telephone 
TD-2, _as they are generically th~ same. Re­
cordings of these telephone .intercepts were 
carefully ·controlled and were destroyed several 
years ago.
