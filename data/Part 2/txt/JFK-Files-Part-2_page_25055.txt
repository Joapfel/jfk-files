T P SECRET 
this Special Group meeting took place on August 25th, is that 
correct? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, there is a possibility, because August 
was the month, if one was going to take any time off _in the 
summer, it was likely to be in August. 
Mr. Dawson. It was best to take it off during August 
because of the miserable summers? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes. l\nd my family had a summer place where 
I had gone since childhood in Maine, and it was easy to get to. 
I do have enough recollection to know I was there a coctple of 
times •:rhen I had to get back for a Security Council meeting 
and there were certain weather problems from the Coast of 
Maine. I recall one time, it could have been this year, or it 
cofild have been a year earlier. But I know I was there those 
summers for a few days. And it could have been in August. 
Mr. Baron. In reference to the meeting at the Pentagon 
that was the subjedt of your affidavit, you mentioned to me 
before we began this testimony today that from what you have 
read recently, it is your impression that the remark of the 
CIA representative at that meeting which, as you have said, 
in effect turned off the suggestion of an assassination 
attempt against Lur::mrilia, might have been made simply because 
the group was too large for such a disc~ision? 
:-Ir. Dillon. It might have been -- I said that because of 
what I have learned since, an~ I have learned more today --
