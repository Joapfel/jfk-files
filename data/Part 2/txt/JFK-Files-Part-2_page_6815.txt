These records include documents that CIA had in its files • 
before the assassination, a large number of records that CIA 
received later as routine disseminations from other agencies, as 
well as the reports, correspondence, and other papers that CIA 
pr~pared in the course of the assassination investigations. I 
should emphasize that these records were assembled into the 
present collection as a result of specific inquiries-received from 
the Warren Commission or the.House Select Committee on 
Assassinations. I have prepared a chart that illustrates this point. 
As you can see, prior to President Kennedy's assassination 
CIA held only a small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted 
of33 documents (approximately 110 pages), some of which 
originated with the FBI, State Department, the Navy, and 
newspaper clippings. Only 11 documents originated with the 
CIA. I have brought along a copy of Oswald's file as it existed 
before the assassination so that you can see first .. hand how slender 
it was at the time. As I have already noted, we have declassified 
the CIA documents in this file with quite minimal "deletions, and 
·we are providing them to the National Archives. The records in 
this file dealt with Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 
and his activities after his return in 1961. By contrast, it was only 
after the assassination that CIA accumulated the rest of the 
material on Oswald--some 33,000 pages--most of which CIA 
re·ceived from other agencies after November 22, 1963.
