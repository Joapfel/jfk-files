4. Two unsuccessful kidnap attempts were made, one on October l9, 
the other on October 20. Following these attempts, and with knowledge 
of their failure, the CIA passed three submachine guns and ammunition 
to Chilean officers who still planned to kidnap General Schneider. 
5. In a third kidnap attempt on October 22, apparently conducted 
by Chileans other than those to whom weapons had been supplied, General 
Schneider was shot and subsequently died. The guns used in the abor­
tive kidnapping of General Schneider were, in all probability, not those 
supplied by the CIA to the conspirators. The Chilean military court 
which investigated the Schneider killing determined that Schneider had 
been murdered by handguns, although one macl.ine gun was at the scene of 
the killing.• 
6.· While there is no question that the CIA received a direct 
instruction from the President on September 15th to attempt to foment 
a coup, the Committee received sharply conflicting testimony about 
whether the White House was kept informed of, and authorized, the 
coup efforts in Chile after October 15. On one side of the conflict 
is the testimony of Henry Kissinger and General Alexander Haig; on the 
other, that of CIA officials. Kissinger testified that the White House 
stood down .. CIA effor.t:s to promote a milit.acy coup d'etat in Chile on 
October 15, 1970. After that date, Kissinger tes tified--and Haig. agreed-­
that the White House neither knew of, nor specifically approved, CIA 
coup activities in Chtle. CIA officials, on the other hand, have testi­
fied that their activities in Chile after October 15 were known to and 
;'I: Th~ Committee has not been able -to determine whether Or net 
the machine gun at the scene of the Schneider killing was one of the 
three supplied by the CIA.
