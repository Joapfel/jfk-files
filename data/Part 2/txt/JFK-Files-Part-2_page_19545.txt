DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY 
IN VIETNAM; WASHINGTON, D~C,, JANUARY 15, 1968 
HEA~Y Phpressed great dissatisfaction with the 
basic organization c~ the gatherin~- She wanted an organi~ 
zational· meeting ins~ead of a rally type meeting which 
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied 
the whole thing was a waste of her time. 
In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN 
worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and 
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and 
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very 
critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as 
"resource people" for the group. She said she thought this 
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a 
situation that was quite different in that she was working 
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented 
individuals and it was a real learning experience .. ELAINE 
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while 
the snirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and 
HELEN~FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs 
of America~ women in giving a concrete program on which to work. 
Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The 
Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist 
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY, 
and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about 
an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem 
and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group. 
LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The 
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON, 
but they were not in their offices, After leaving a copy of 
the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the 
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment) 
they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and 
BRCCK ADAMS. Mr. HICKS was ou~ or town. Mrso HGRSLEY knew.the. 
CongreSSII).an personally and her son knew· two of the ·office· • ' • 
personnel. She asked th3t they relate to him that she was 
vitally interesLed in peace and social justice. 
Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent 
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his 
political views and some of the political machinations of his 
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY 
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her 
son who is attending Harvard University.
