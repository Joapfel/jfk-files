said. So I think that whatever records there are of NSC 
meetings before that, that they may not have kept such records 
in detail. And that meeting -- if you can find any meeting 
that Mr. Johnson took the notes of just prior to that, that 
is probably the meeting. 
Mr. Baron. So you vwuld assume that the language used 
by the President, heard by Mr. Johnson, which indicated to 
Mr. Johnson that an assassination was at the least acceptable 
means of getting rid of Lumumba, is probably the language 
referred to here by Mr. Dulles? 
Mr. Dillon. It would sound so, seems so. 
Mr. Baron. And would you also assume, from your knowledge 
of Special Group meetings and the way the minutes were written 
up, that very straightforward action could be a euphemism for 
assassination? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I wouldn't necessarily think that. It 
wculd just mean strong action to do something to get rid of 
Lumurnba, it could be a revolution, it could be anything. I 
think it comes here that they would not necessarily rule out 
consideration of any particular activity. I would think, if 
they were really going to mount something, they probably would 
have come back to the Group. But they might not have. And 
again, getting back to Mr. Dulles, I do not think he would 
have gone back to the President and said, now, I have got the 
capability to assassinate Lumurnba, and I am going to do it
