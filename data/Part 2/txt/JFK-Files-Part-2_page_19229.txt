Women n:ust use thei-r rdnds, thei-r voices, and 
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; _to do 
less is tc ignore our special responsibilities to 
the human race. 
1110,000 
be killed in 
ir.g to go to 
in ,Vietnam. 
woEen have sat back and let thei-r sons 
Vietna~. If we· had 10,000 wcmen will­
jail if necessary we could stop the war 
You can.."'lot have wa-r s '\1i thcYu:t ":"·oritn. 11 
Jeannette Rankin r.:e.de the above stat·ement in 
Nay of this yec1r. Fifty years a.go, as the first· 
woman elected to Congress, she voted a.ga inst t:orld 
Wa.r I. She has cons·i stent ly n!ainta ined bet' strug­
gle for peace, and e.t'88 she is as courageous and 
vigorous as ever -- ·an inspiTation to·all wo3en. 
The p-resence of the United States foTces in 
tbe internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral arid 
illegal. There can be no possible justification 
for our interference in the dor.;estic affairs of 
this tiny diste.nt la.nd. 
This 86-year-old wo~an has stated that sh~ 
is willing to 8tay in iail until the bo~bin~ is 
~ ~ ~ 
etopped. Not 811 women Pre :-ree to join heT, but 
\1:e c1;1n a8eure her that thousa.nde of ~:romen will 
m0rcb pe0defully beside hci-r. Some will picket, 
ethers will go to jail unti;J.. bail is a-rTanged, 
and othe-rs will etay in jail with Hiss R2nkin. 
Every woma.n1 s p2--rticipa.tion is equally valuable. 
·:1e are confident each one will do the ma.xirrum of 
"TI'!}ich ~he is capc1ble." 
On j·c1nuaTy 8th, women from all over the land 
1,,ill conve-rge on Washington to den~a.nd the end of 
this dishonorable war. 1\e shall come a.s indi vid­
uals, or as organiza,tions, but ·we sha.11 join to­
fether as concerned uo~en undeT the aegis of 
Jean...r1ett e Rankin~. 
Will you join us to Eave the ~en you love~ 
from death, and the country you love from eha~e?
