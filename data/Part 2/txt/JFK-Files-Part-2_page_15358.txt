The Bureau ··ts requested to obtain Department ·_ 
of State authorization for the development of. sources and 
infonnants at the caption~d ~stablishment. • 
This request is. being made in vfew of existence - · 
of strong Communist Party iri Brazil and absence of diplomatic , 
relatJ..ons bet·ween Brazil .and the USSH.. It seems· likely that , .... _ 
N6w York City is a logical:Pl~ce for contacts between ~--
pro-Communist Brazilians .and Russian officials.. Also, news h 
reports in recent months ·have. indicated that there is strong r=~ 
sentiment for increasing commerical activity between Brazil f.j 
andt.Russia especially in view.of Br-azil's increasingly precarious~ 
economic situation. • It is felt that information· concerning ~·~ 
the-background and activitie~·or Brazilian offici~ls in the g 
New York ':1-rea is of vital.i~portance to the internal security ·@ 
of the United States. ~-
