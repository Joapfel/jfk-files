as a record that is related to the assassination of President· 
John F. Kennedy, that was created or. made available for use 
by, obtained by, o~ otherwise came into the possession of ,the 
Warren Commission, the Rockefeller commission, the Church 
Commission, th~ Pike Commission, the House Assassination 
Committee, the Library of Congress, the National ltrghives, 
Presidential libraries, any Executive agency, any indeperi~ent 
agency, any other office of the Federal Government, and any 
State or local law enforcement office that provided support or_ 
assistance or performed work in connection with a Federal 
inquiry into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
I understand ·that autopsy records donated by the Kennedy 
family to the National Archives pursuant to a deed of gift 
regulating access. to those records, . or copies and 
reproductions made from such records, are not included.
