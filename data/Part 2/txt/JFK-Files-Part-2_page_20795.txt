EATON admitted there were some problems in 
the past with regard to friction within 'i"vONAAC about SWP 
and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to 
her observation, never seemed a serious one, and is quite 
minimal today. With regard to the 11walk out 11 of si'x 
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC, 
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because 
of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because 
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a 11referral 
agency 11 , while those who stayed felt it should not. By 
'. 
referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer 
callers to a specific location or place where abortions 
could be obtained.
