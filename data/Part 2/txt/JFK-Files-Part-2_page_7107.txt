Since the 11 July 1963 military coup, the 
Ecuadorean government's careful monitoring of

Rafael Echeverria, leader of the hard-line faction 
of the Ecuadorean Communist Party (PCE), is re­

then so that he can "prove his good faith" to the 
Cubans; he expects to be offered financial aid. 
Other clandestine sources report Cuban aid 
has been offered to supporters of former presi­
dent Velasco Ibarra and that aid is being of­
fered to followers of former resident Arosemena.

supported subversion in El Salvador during the 
past 10 months. The Castro government probably 
helps members of the Salvadoran Communist Party 
(PCES) and its front groups to get to Cuba for 
guidance and training. Havana radio, heard 
clearly in El Salvador, provides a propaganda 
line which can be echoed in locally published~--­
