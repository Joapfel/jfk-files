not give him this i~stru~t.i~~;·'·i;;;t'·I· d;, • Mr. Chairman. 
The Chairman. Did Mr~ Bissell at any time during the 
r 
period under question; or at any later time, ever inform 
you of CIA activities or involvement in assassination attempts 
against any foreign leader? 
Mr. Bundy. No. 
The Chairman. Doesn't it strike you as strange, since 
Mr. Bissell was aware of such attempts, that he would not 
have told him? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, I don't want, for reasons that I ·:· 
have already explained, to speculate as to why he did or did 
not. I was operating, working on the assumption that I 
would know that kind of- .. ,thing if it existed. 
The Chairman.Senator Mathias? 
Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to leave 
the record, or Mr. Bundy's mind, or in the alternative, my 
mind, in a state of confusion as to what exactly Mr. Bissell's 
recollection was. 
Now, he was depending somewhat on Mr. Harvey's recollec­
tion and notes in the first instance. But as I recall, he 
was very clear as a matter of independent recollection that 
he had been horsed along a couple of times by the White House 
on proceeding with the development of the Executive Action 
Capability. And that was a matter of independent recollection
