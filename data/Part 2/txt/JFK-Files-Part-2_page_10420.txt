MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Conversation vvith Ja:::k Bauman 
a. 
1. ,vhilc on leave visiting Disney ·world in Florida, I 
dropped in to see Jack Bauman ,vho lives in \'iinterbaven, Florida. 
J,a.ck retired from the Agency abo'-1t five years ago on disability cc.e 
to a serious heart condition. He was with the Office of Security for 
aboµt 20 years prior to his retirement. 
2. ~uring a private conversation Jack tole. me that he had 
been interviewed three or four times by the FBI in connection with 
the lvkCord-H'-!nt affair. I asked him why he had been interviev-.-cd, 
and he told znc that.in late 1971 he had bce::-1 contacted by Ho,vard 
Hunt who suggested that he consider an assignm~nt as Security 
Officc.r for the Republican Party. Jack visited \ 1fashington in 
January 1972 to discuss the proposed position -..vith Ho,-,ard Hunt 
who apparently was acting o.i. behalf of the Repqblican Party. Ja.ck 
furnisli:ccl a resume to Hunt a.id discussed the position ~,vi.th him. 
Ultimately, he decided not to accept the position because he felt 
that his heart condition would not allow him to become in\·olved in 
such activity. 
3. According to Jack, during the meetirlg with Mr. Hunt . 
they discussed some of. the requirements of the job. At that time 
they discussed a need for both a positive and a countcraudio program 
and a need for a good security system both before and during the 
National Convention. Jack indicated that he· sincerely believed that 
the Republican Party did need a security officer and a good security· 
programmer b':1t felt that he could not affo.rd to accept the job even. 
though it was a very lucrath·e offer. Apparently, money ,,:as not a 
problem.
