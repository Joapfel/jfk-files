spent looking for opportunities to recruit Cubans who came to 
Mexico City. The shop also ran a debriefing center for Cubans 
who left Cuba by way of Mexico. He also said that one of the 
primary activities of the Cuban shop would have been to identi­
fy the DGI officers in the Cuban Embassy and their functions, 
duties and assignments whenever possible. Mr. Phillips said 
that he was still involved in propaganda activities at this 
time specifically recalling a Mexican broadcaster whose ~adio 
station could be heard in Cuba. Mr. Phillips pointed out that 
he had been a close friend of Mr. Flannery's and that Mr. 
Flannery was made Chief of Covert Action in Mexico on his, 
Phillip.' s, recommendation. 
Mr. Phillips' said that he had "quite good" relations 
with Win Scott and that he reported directly to him as opposed 
to reporting through the Deputy Chief of Station which would 
have been the routine manner. Mr. Phillips stated that he thought 
that Robert Shaw had been in charge of the Cuban photographic 
surveillance operations and that they had two penetration 
agents in the Cuban Embassy. He stated that he could not 
remember the names of the penetration agents and was not sure 
of the cryptonyms. 
Mr. Phillips was asked why his name came up so infrequently 
in a review of Agency documents of this period from Mexico 
City. He said that his name should appear on any "formal 
project" he had going, but that he ''did like to delegate work." 
He said that his name must be on many papers.
