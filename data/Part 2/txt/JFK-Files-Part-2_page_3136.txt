From the time of the official approval of the 
anti-Ca-stro policy by Pres.ident Eisenhower until the 
collaps·e of the effort at the Bay of Pigs the question 
of personnel and personnel management for Project 
JMATE was of constant concern. Even though the 
Director of Central Intelligence "emphasized the 
significance of ~he Project, by saying that he would 
recall Agency personnel from any station in the world 
if the .individual.'s abilities were required for the 
successful achievement of JMATE objectives," some of 
those who were closest to the personnel problem be­
lieved that DCI Dulles failed completely to keep that 
promise. 113/ Jake. Es.terline, Chief, WH/4 has re­
marked as follows: 
It was obvious that .as the operation 
began to increase in size that the Divi­
sions didn't have. t;:.he personnel, the 
senior personnel;· to staff out the organ,­
ization; or if they did have them, they 
·weren't about to release them from the 
LSD (Landing Ship Dock) whi~h was to carry the landing 
craft to t~e area of the Bahia de Cochinos was ready 
to load at the naval base at Vieques for the invasion. 
As the text above confirms, however, the Admiral was 
read into the· act relatively early in the game and 
should have had plenty of time to make preparations 
for the activities of April 1961.
