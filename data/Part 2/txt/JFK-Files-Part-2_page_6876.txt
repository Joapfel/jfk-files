These ind_icators of progress do not mean that we have all the answers about our 
security classification system or that there aren't tremendous hurdles to clear. For 
example, the implementation of the new system has been uneven among the major 
classifying agencies, and a few are only now just getting started; the costs of 
implementing the system at some agencies are higher than we anticipated; and 
resource limitations are having a clear impact on agency compliance and oversight. To 
. be sure, the standards and goals established within-the new Executive Order are 
unparalleled. We are not yet certain that every agency, or perhaps any agency, can 
achieve them. However, only if the targets are difficult can reaching them be 
noteworthy. 
I recognize that the focus of today's hearing is the legislation before the Committee. 
will try to answer any questions you may have concerning the similarities and 
differences between the security classification system that currently exists and the 
system that S. 712, as currently drafted, would impose. The Administration has serious 
objections to certain provisions of S. 712, particularly as they could impinge upon the 
Presider:,t's authority and flexibility to manage the classification and declassification 
programs. Legislating in this area can be perilous, given the great deference 
traditionally given to the President in the areas of national defense and foreign affairs.
