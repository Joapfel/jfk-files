-c. Telephone Intrusion Study - The objec­
tive of this current prograr:1 1s to develop a 
means-to utilize foreign telephone systems as 
a communication link without the kno·h·lcdge of 
the.host system. In order to carry out this 
objective, it is riecessary to learn the com­
plete supervisory si,gna_lling and· sequencing 
control system hierarchy for the various foreign 
telephone syste~s. Many of these arc patterned 
after the U.S. system and, for this reason, 
limited monitoring to test the operation of 
intercept equipnent· in the United States is 
planned. The data to be collected would be 
merely the signal tones from which supervisory 
codes can be extracted. ~Iessagc content is 
of no interest and will not be recorded. Over­
seas.testing is planned at a subsequent date. 
To date, some domestic testing of this concept 
has boen carried out at the contractor's plant. 
No recordings have been made of such data. Ex­
tremely brief tests exercising U.S. and foreign 
telephone systems through supervisory tone sig­
nalling have been carried out to verify initial 
concepts. The duration·of testing was less 
than one-half hour. 
d.·. Other Sensor Testing - Examples of 
engineering <levelop~ent tests of special sensors 
within t11-:! Uni tecl Sta t~s include infi-ared .and . 
high-altitude photography, forward-looking IR 
(FLIR) flights, laser scanners, industrial efflu­
ent sampling for isotopes, and airborne magne­
tometer surveys for metal (rifles and trucks). 
In all these cases, the data o"utput of such 
.testi~g has been used for engineering develop­
ment and the content has been restricted to 
dissemination to those in Government involved 
with the engineering de~ign.
