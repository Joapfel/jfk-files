,~ Within the area of contiactual responsibiliti~s, the 
following items are pert~nent: 
a. In February 1971,Lfolonel L. K. Whit~] the then 
Executive D.irector-Comptro·11er, called me t~ttend a 
meeting in his officet also attended by Mr. William Colby. 
· Colonel White exolained that the Technical Services 
Division (TSD) had been req·uested to provide· a.ssis_tance 
to the FBI for a Mnsitive Mject _ ·7 . • . . · · _ Jf 4fl.4) . Colonel \·/hi t!:J did not dis­
close the purpose of the as· stance being provided by TSD 
but did iristruct me to assist TSO on purely contractual 
matters .. S:i.nce the Office of' Logistj cs has no iniormation 
co~cerning the mission or purpose of Project, sub~ 
stantive questions concerning the subject should be 
addressed to TSD. Other nrocure~ent actibns accomnlished 
for the .FBI-~c--. 'I'C-Dor..:ted be 1 n,.~. Specif,ic ·mention is made, 
however, of t.he Project because of the dollar magnitude, ap-
proximately Sl million, an4· the conplex technical equip­
. fuent that has been involved in the undertaking. 
b. The Procur~ment Division, OL, currently has two 
requisitions in hand fror.1 TSD v:hich ,,·oulct involve reim­
bursable sales to the FBI. One such reouisition in the 
amount of $36,900 is for t,.;o ·l':estinghouse telev{sion 
cameras. The second requisition in the a~ount of Sll,200 
is for two wide-angle surveillance probes m~nufactured by 
Bausch.and Lomb. No action is being taken on either of 
these requirements periding further instructions ~hich • 
will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management 
and Services. • 
c. Over the years, this[Agenc)=J. has often _supported 
other Government agencies frora a contractual or materiel 
standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially appro\.~1,,/_~ .j . .i\ 
·request, supporte.d by a transfer of funds ,(the Agency) Ufl-Ul,bl 
would either enter into "accomraodation procurements" for 
the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by 
the issuant~ of materiel frorn stock. Such actions are 
legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This 
Act authorizes one agency to support the n~eds of, or pro­
~ide a setvice for, another Govern~ent igency ~hen such
