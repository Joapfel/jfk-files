On 9 January 1963, Morse Allen of SRS wrote the first 
memo spelling out Wiley's detailed use by the Agency. It 
is quoted in part as follows: 
"UTILIZATION FROM 19S7 TO DATE

. used for special research work, sp~cial investi­
·igations, and in very general terms, as a penetration 
into right-wing groups and the right-wing literary 
fjeld in New York City. He has conducted research 
on organizations of interest to SRS, carried out 
specialized assignments of a covert investigative 
nature on individuals of interest to this Staff,

the Communist World Youth Festivals in Vienna (19S9), 
and Helsinki (1962). In addition, he obtained con­

attendance at the Festivals and the Communist tactics 
used in these Communist sponsored meetings.

many trips in behalf of SRS, including a journalistic 
trip to Cuba where he served a jail sentence in 
Havana in an effort to obtain information of a matter 
of grave interest to this Agency. He has made many 
trips overseas; has visited most of Africa, the Near 
and Middle East, most of Europe, much of Asia, the 
Satellite countries and has been twice in the Soviet 
Union on our behalf. In addition to important in­
