•. On April 2, 1964, as Deputy Director of Plans, I, along withi 
·-oavid Murphy, Chief of the Soviet Bloc Division,, and Mr. Lawrence\ 
R Houston, the General Counsel to the CIA, met with Mr. Nicho-: 
:'. las Ka,tzenbach, then Deputy Attorney Generar of the United. 
.. 'States; Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Chief of the Internal Security Divi-:. 
• ision ofi the Justice Department; Mr. William· E. Foley, who,. was;,. 
<then Mr. Yeagley's First Assistant in the Internal Security Divi~' 
sion; and Mr. Harold F. Riese from the Office of Legal Counsel in· 
the Justice Department. . 
The meeting took place in Mr. Katzenbach's office in the Justice 
• Department. The purpose of the meeting was to define Mr. Nosen­
.ko's legal status in the United States and to anticipate what kind 
of legal problems might arise in connection with the Agency's 
ongoing custody of Mr. Nosenko. 
!"i The Agency provided me a copy of the memorandum for the 
. record ~itten by .Mr. Lawrence Houston describing this meeting 
:On April 2, 1964, and a second memprandum which reflects the 
su~tance of a telephone call from Mr. Foley on the following day, 
Apnl 3, 1964. These documents were in part declassified by the 
'~ 4gency on September 18, 1978, and I wouldJike to make them part 
f ii()Uhe record of these proceedings.

·:-••"•:·. As M_r. Houston~s memorandums relate, Mr. Nosenko's technical 
• ,.ia!us m the Umted States was one of "exclusion and parole," 
__ ,Wh1c~ means that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had 
.techmcally excluded Mr. Nosenko from the United States but had 
'19:lso tem:porarily "paroled him" to the custody of the Central Intel­igence Agency. 
M It is my understanding !ha_t the terms of the parole provided that 
r. Nosenko would remam m the custody of the Agency unless it 
was determined whether Mr. Nosenko should be deported or 
whether he should be permitted to settle in the United States.
