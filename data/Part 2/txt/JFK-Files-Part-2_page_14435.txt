exposure: I also gave you my assurance that we ·would assist in• 
the clearance of multi-a·gency papers involving CIA, some of 
which are on your ·earlier request. 
A speed-up in the Agency's paraphrasing process is 
being undertaken, although as you can a,ppreciate, this involves 
senior personnel _with heavy demands for substantive work, and
