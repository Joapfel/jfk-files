(a) In February, --1951, when Xe117 was head of the"1Semocratic :Sloe. 
three of his men.arrived··iu Athens, coming directly from IRO campe. 
They needed.- shelter, but_ had no money. TiieY' were put··on salary, but it 
was not enough to cover ·thEt sixmonths advance rent which it is the custom . . 
. to pay when .a lease is made_ iii Athens. Thgs. Kelly's advance. account was: _· :: i ••• 
credited with ·BJUoNM@h the amount of (.a.i~':) $850, which was to be used ·_·· 
to pay the re_ntal advance~ ~e three men were to pa_y i_t back in monthl7 ..

Two such installments were paid by the men when Kel]Jr was ~interned n • •• • 
by our·people. The·men were then able to complain that Ke:tl:7 had forced 
them into quarters best described as "very inadequate, insecureaa a:ml · ••• • 
unhealthy'." • • • ••. .. . . . • . .· .. 
Comparing the quality of 'the quartess with the amount advanced -for 
rent,it becomes quite-·certain that X:el]Jr me.de some sort of deal with the 
landlord.. in • order to make ~ome money.. . _·. . . .. 
·It should· be kept in. mind that Kelly forced three of his_ own countrrmen· • 
to live in these quarters, from which they were forthwith .. removed for • 
health and ~ecurity r~aso-ns. · • 
(b) Just:prior to his: removai, it was discovered that. Kelly~- a.

by us that Llly had not .written the manuscripts at all~ Allen l1tarned this . : 
himself when· the real author wrote to him_ demanding the return. of hia .. -. • • 
works. The author said-that_he had a statement from Keli7 disclaimingali 
credi,t for the manuscripts. _.l!'urthermore, the real author had seen nothing 
of the $'.300 gi•en to Kell7,. although they apparently had agreed to go 
50-50 on 8.D7-profits realized from the publication • of the manuscripts.· ·._ ._ .-·· 
lEt is clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone else's literary:· 
talentsin the hope of gaining noteriety and money himself~ • • • •
