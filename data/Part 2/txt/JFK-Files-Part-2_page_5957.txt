Re: PRIORITY - CIA IR-19 (DNIAO 32c) JFK/ARAB 
INCA & Permindex 
Gary, , 
As I mentioned in my note of a few minutes ago, noted below is CCS's search response re INCA & 
Permindex. My records show that all DA action is now complete regarding CIA IA-19 DNIAO 32a, 32b 
and 32c). As you we~e advised in my memoranda dated 6 and 7 August 1998, the Garrison (Volume II 
refers to Gorder Duane NOVEL and Edward Scannel BUTLER) and the Andrew Clarence Anderson files 
are available for your review in CCS. Please contact Curt if you wish to see those files. Frieda

Curt: 
Thank you very much for your status report w/respect to your search on the 38 names and your search re 
/NGA and Permindex. 
Pursuant to a call that I received moments ago from Gary Breneman, would it be possible for you to 
advise as to whether you have located 8f1Y information on /NGA and/or Permindex. Gary is frantically 
trying to close out IR-19 and your response will assist him greatly. Thanks in advance for addressing 
these two items separately. f rieda
