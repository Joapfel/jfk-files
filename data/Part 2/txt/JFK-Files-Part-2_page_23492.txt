GENERi\L BACKGROUND 
1. Staff Responsibilities Under Eis°enhower: 
Gray said that the structural chain of command ran directly from the 
DCI to the President during the Eisenhower administration. Allen Dulles

subjects that Gray work~d. on. Gray was responsible for long-range planning; 
Goodpaster was responsible for spot work. Gray said that Goodpaster 2J1d he 
kept each other "inti1nately :iufonned". However, Gray said that any covert 
action progrJJn would go through him and not Goodpaster. "Although I Hould 
tell Goodpaster about anything I discussed with the President." Some covert 
action programs were extremely tightly held, for example, on the U-2 incident 
only the following people were knowledgeable: Eisenhower, Goodpaster, and John 
Eisenhower. 
''I didn't live with Eisenhower 24 hours a day. I don't know everything 
that he did. But I do think I knew every major decision, ~1pproval, or action 
of Eisenhower's." 
2. Special Group Function 
At the 54/12 committee, Gray said, 11I represented the President's interest, 
that was my role.''
