C. In any event, we know of only two coun­
tries--Mexico and Uruguay--where Castro 
appears inclined for the time being to 
forego inciting violence, and this only 
because he wants a favorable climate for 
his operations into other countries. 
II. Even before the October missile crisis-~and 
with increasing rancor since then--Cuban leaders 
have been exhorting revolutionary movements to 
violence and terrorism, and supporting their 
activities. 
A. Cuban support takes many different forms. 
We have occasional evidence of direct 
participat.ion by Cuban nationals, as in 
the La Oroya disorders in Peru in December. 
We know that some funds move, generally in 
cash by courier, from Cuba to the revolu­
tionaries in other countries. While we have 
not been able to come up with the kind of 
_airtight proof a court would require that 
weapons move directly from Cuba to these 
same groups, we do know that Cuba furnishes 
money to buy weapons, and that some guer­
rilla forces in Peru, for instance, are 
equipped with Czech weapons which most 
logically would come from Cuba~
