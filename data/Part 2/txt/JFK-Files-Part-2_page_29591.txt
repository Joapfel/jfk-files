614/ The Chief of the Mexico Branch at Headquarters has told 
this Committee that it is his belief that the tapes were 
probably still in existence at· the time of the assas­
sination. (HSCA Depositicn of John Scelso, 5/16/78, 
p. 76-77.) But the tesitmony of the persons at the 
Mexico City Station is.ccnsistent in saying that the 
tapes did not-exist at the time of the assassination.
