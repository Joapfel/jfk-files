Flasl1 from Dallas 
.Just as Secret Service men reacted instinctively, rushing to protect the 
presidential party, reporters reacted instincti\·ely to get the news-sketchy 
as it was at first-to the world. United Press lnternational's Merriman 
Smith, dean of the ,vhite House correspondents, describes on pages 32-33 
his frantic rush to call the Dallas UPI bureau. Reproduced here is the result 
of Smith's first efforts-the actu.al Teletype copy tint almost immediately 
clacked out oE hundreds of lJ PI machines in newsrooms. radio and 
television stations, pressrooms, and business ollices all over the world.

At 12:34 the Teletype was 
supplying copy on a 
Minneapolis murder trial. 
The Dallas bureau, alerted by 
Smith over radiotelephone from 
the press car as it careered 
toward the hospital, sends out 
the first sparse news. 
Minneapolis starts to add more 
details on the murder trial. The 
New York bureau, knowing 
that ace reporter Smith is covering 
the President's trip, tells all 
bureaus to "uphold"-get off the 
wire. "Dallas, it's yours." 
Atlanta tries to interrupt, but is 
quickly squelched by the 
New York bureau. 
The Dallas operator begins 
sending the rest of Smith's account 
from the press car. 
At the hospital, Smith sees the 
President's limp body in the ca1 
and races to a telephone. At 
12:39, nine minutes after the 
shooting, the grave news flashes 
over the wire.
