languages (Spanish and Italian), and his admirable command of English 
prose which enables him to write crisp operational communications 
witn speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities 
in a superior manner. 
Subject does not become a victim of routine. In addition to 
developing the effective referrals system noted above, he has also 
on his own initiative created our own "skills bank" in which we are 
able to locate suitable NOC candidates, and those on board, in terms 
of needed profession31 or area experience, rare and esoteric language 
skills, etc. to the point that we can supply "leads" to divisions 
in a matter of minutes. (Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board 
personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.) 
Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful 
and useful management tool. I find him a thoughtful and canny colleague, 
careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but 
quick to perceive opportunities to support and assist the divisions 
within those limits. He is a firm, fair, no-nonsense supervisor of 
~ranch personnel. He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when 
differences occur between him and me. It is my conviction that he is 
ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons 
of the Directorate and has by now proven that he is as adept at staff 
responsibilities as he was previously impressive in his field and 
desk uperational responsibilities. In short, a comer and a cherished 
colleague.
