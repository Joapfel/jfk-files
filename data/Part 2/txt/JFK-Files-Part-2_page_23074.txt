back, if you are saying that if anybody outlined an op!!irational 
plan to me, did I help construct the plan, did I make a contri­
bution to a plan, my answer is again no. We talked earlier, 
you asked me about those exploding sea shells of which I said

up, you know, if something happened to Fidel Castro, if he is 
thrown over, if he do~s something foolish himself or if somebody 
is succdssful in assassinating him, somebony who decides sudden­
