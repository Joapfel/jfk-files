become the holiest of grails -- constantly, and un­
successfully, to be sought throughout the course of 
the operation by Agency planners. 
The proposed paper for the Special Group (the 
paper.which Mr. Helms·found somewhat lacking) empha­
sized those areas highlighted in previous Special 
Group sessions -- anti-Castro propaganda, disrup- • 
tions of the Cuban economy, including large scale 
sabotage operations, and the development of instructor 
cadres to provide both communications and PM training 
cadres to resistance groups already extant in Cuba. 
Interesting, too, is the fact that at this early 
stage of US planning mention was made of the offer 
from the Guatemalan Government of a training site 
for the PM cadres, or "action groups" as they were 
.called. A financial annex included in the proposals 
\ 
for the Special Group indicated the need for $900,000 
for the remainder of FY 1960 and $1. 6 mil.lion for 
FY 1961.* 34/ 
* Apparently Mr. Helms failed to read the financial 
annex carefully enough, for the estimated r.equirement 
for fiscal. 1961 which is ·shdwn as $1.6 million, was 
either a typographical error, or a mistake in addition 
-- the sum of the parts shown for FY '61 is $1.7 million. 
It also was noted that for the remainder·of FY '60, 
the Agency reserve funds would have to be drawn on to 
meet these "non-program requirements."
