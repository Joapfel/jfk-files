in terms of reporting from Miami? 
Mr. Halley. Could we go off the r~cord? 
(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. diGenova. Mr. Halley, we have just had a brief 
discussion here about some of the things that Wt!re covered 
before I arrived by Mr. Daron and•jou. I do not want to cover 
any more of that ground. 
it is my understanding in discussing the structure of 
JMWAVE's relationship with llt!adquarters, General LansdalP.'s 
10 name came up, and that on one occasion, r.eneral Lansdale actua11, 
11 came down to Miami to visit the Stat.ion to q03t firsthand 
12 knowledqt of what was transpiring. Is that correct? 
13 Mr. Hall~y. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. Do you hav~•any idea when that was? 
Mr. Halley. No. I stated earlier it was in 1962. It 
16 probably was in the summer of 1962 because it was after my 
17 family arrived in Miami. I do not rememhr::.r the exact dates. 
18 It could be established probably from records of the Agency.

I do not recall it specifically. 
Mr. diGenova. To your knowledge, did he travel by himself 
or was he with compatriots or aides? 
Mr. Halley. My r!ocollection of that. was that he came do.,m 
on a special airplane. There may have been oth~r people on the 
plane with him, I do not r-,call, hut he landed at Homestead 
/\ir l"orc~ Rase. As I recall, we picked him up from there.
