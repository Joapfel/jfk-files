SUBJECT: Covert Ope rations Against Cuba - Security Within 
the Government 
As you know, in August the u. S. Government directed two 
"exile II raids against targets in Cuba. From the evidence now 
available, it appears that our security, with respect to u. S. 
participation in these operations, was excellent. 
While there will always be public speculation as to the extent

the u. s. involvement. Among others, the Navy knew where the 
attack boats were going; the Coast Guard, Customs, and INS 
knew about the "comings and goings" of the raiders; a few DOD 
people, who had to procure special equipment for the raids,

the raids. 
I think there are two important, if obvious, security lessons 
we have learned from the August raids -- one, that it is in the 
nature of the problem that many people probably have to know 
something about such raids; and two, that these people apparently
