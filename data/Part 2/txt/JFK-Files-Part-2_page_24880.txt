A. Findings Concerning the Plots Themselves 
1. Officials of the United States Government Initiated 
Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro and Patrice Lumumba 
The Committee finds that officials of the United States 
Government initiated and participated in plots to assassinate 
Patrice Lumurnba and Fidel Castro. 
The plot to kill Lumurnba was conceived in the latter half 
of 1960 by officials of· the United States Government, and quick­
ly advanced to the point of_ sen~ing poisons to the Congo to be 
used for the assassination. 
The effort to assassinate Castro began in 1960 and continued 
until 1965. The plans to assassinate Castro using poison cigars,. 
exploding seashells, _and a contaminated diving suit did not 
advance beyond the laboratory phase. The plot involving under~ 
world figures reached the stage of producing poison pills, 
establishing the contacts necessary to send them into Cuba, 
procuring potential assassins within Cuba, and, a6cording to one 
witness, delivering the pills to the island itself. In the 
1960 plot involving a Cuban pilot and in the AM/LASH episode / 
from 1963-1965, the CIA gave active support and encouragement I 
to Cubans whose intent to assassinate Castro was known, and 
provided the means for carrying but the assassination.
