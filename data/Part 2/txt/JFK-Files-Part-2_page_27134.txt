SECRET 
By way of explanation, we can illustrate the ineffectual 
coordination with a case involving a long-term Soviet pene­
tration in the Agency. A very important staff agent was 
unmasked by virtue of information supplied by the aforemen­
tioned defector, but in the process the FBI officially tdok 
the position that the candidate who was submitted by the 
Agency was not the Soviet agent in question, and by memo­
randum they proposed that we submit all of the data to the 
Department of Defense on grounds that the penetration agent 
was more likely a past or present asset of the military. 
Subsequently, a high-level source confirmed our original 
identification, which in turn was accepted by the FBI. The 
case is illustrative of the inability within this Government 
to resolve interagency differences in all of those sensitive 
fields affecting penetration. 
The result of the 1973 changes was a decentralization 
of counterintelligence, a retrogression to the inadequacies 
of the period 1949 to 1955. Now, as then, counterintelligence 
in CIA lacks the necessary specialists and the requisite 
interaction at the Agency's highest levels. Some of the 
present grave problems are not new, but the recent changes 
have greatly magnified them. Among our present·weaknesses 
are the following:
