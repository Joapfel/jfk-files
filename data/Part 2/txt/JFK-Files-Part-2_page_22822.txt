you would agree with.the testimony we have received from 
General Taylor? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes, I would. 
The Chairman. Mr. Smothers? 
Mr. Smothers. Mr. Bundy, perhaps we could get some help 
in how the recollections come together here. I might pursue 
for just a moment some of the background regarding other 
sources of information you may have had regarding the subject 
matter of his testimony. 
You indicated earlier that you had talked with Mr. 
Bissell about his testimony . 
Did you talk with persons other than Mr. Bissell? 
Mr. Bundy. Oh, yes. 
Mr. Smothers. Did you talk with Mr. McNamara? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes, indeed. 
Mr. Smothers. Regarding these events? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes. 
Mr. Smothers. Have you spoken with Mr. Gilpatric?
