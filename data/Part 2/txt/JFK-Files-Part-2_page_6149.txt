Many of the most important documents relating to President Kennedy's murder 
have been unobtainable through FOIA. n122 Nevertheless, FOIA and the .r 
Assassination Records Review Board do share a common purpose: to break through 
government's historical habic of classifying information that otherwise could -
and should - be open. n123

VI. The Business of Secrecy 
Today, keeping information secret has become a massive industry in Washington. 
nl24 According to officia·l estimates, the government took 6. 3 million 
classification actions in 1994, creating an estimated 19 millio~ pages of 
information that only selected government officials can see. n125 More than 
32,000 government workers are employed full-time to determine what should·be 
secret, what level of secrecy the material should have, and whether the 
document.s should be classified. n126 The government .holds hundreds of millions 
of pages· of secret docn,1mezi.cs: indeed, the precise number has gone beyond the . 
government's ability to count. n127 • •
