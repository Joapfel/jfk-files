NOTES 
A.· USSR New activity involving Soviet range instru­
mentation ships in the Pacific appears to be forth­
coming. Three instrumentation ships left Petropav­
lovsk 12 days ago and are apparently headed for the 
more distant Pacific impact area, 6,500 miles from 
Tyuratam. We are looking for extended range ICBM 
tests but we do not exclude a space event. There 
has so .far .been no announcement closing the area.

B. Congo-USSR Soviet embassy personnel have not yet 
left Leopoldville, but their departure is expected 
momentarily. They were ordered out of the country 
after the Congolese turned up good documentary evi~ 
dence of their complicity _in anti-government plots. 
One of the items taken off a Soviet diplomat the· 
other day was a letter from an anti-Adoula leader 
now in Brazzaville asking for funds and arms to over~ 
throw the Leopoldville government. 
C. Britain The Labor Party scored again in the Dundee 
West by-election Thursday, increasing its 1959 
majority of 719 to a thumping 4,955. Heartened by 
this, Labor is now pushing for general elections at 
once. Prime Minister Home is not likely to accede. 
D. Ecuador The military junta which has run Ecuador 
since July may be about to come unstuck. We have a 
report that one of the less savory members of the 
group, air force Colonel Freiles, will try to take 
over full control this weekend. We are not sure 
of the reliability of this report, but Freiles is 
known to have been making motions in this direction.
