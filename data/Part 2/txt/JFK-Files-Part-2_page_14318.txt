Prior to Mr. Mohr's interview by the Staff of the SSC, 
Section Chief William O. Cregar met with him. Mr. Mohr was advised 
that should repr~sentatives of the .Staff pose any questions to him 
which could lead to the identification of sensitive sources, 
sensitive methods of FBI operations or material derived fr0m other 
U. s. agencies or foreign governments, he could decline to answer 
such questions until he had an opportunity to consult with a Bureau 
representative. Mr. Mohr understood· the purpose of Mr. Creg~-r,.

Following our arrival at the New Senate Office Building, 
Mr. Mohr and Cregar were met by Staff Members Mark Gitenstein, 
Thomas Dawson, and Lester B. Seide 1. • As we proceeaed to the 
office where the interview was to be conduc-ted, Mr. Gitenstein 
referred to a previous conference he had with Assistant Director 
Wannall at Quantico qn 5/5/75 at which Mr. Cregar was present. 
Gitenstein observed that this me~ting haq proved very, very 
beneficial and that he believed that future' personal contacts 
between members of the Senate Select Committee, 'Staff and the FBI 
could prove useful and allow the SSC 'Staff to better un~;,r;stand 
how the FBI was administ~red at Headquarters. ~~M0f ;- ~·
