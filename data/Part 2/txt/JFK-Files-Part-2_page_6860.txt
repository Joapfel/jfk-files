GATES: No, ma'am, what I would appoint that panel to 
do is examine all the redactions that we had made, and to 
examine all of the documents that we decided could not be 
declassified, and then provide a report- to the American people 
on whether or not any of those redaetions or those withheld 
documents had a bearing on the assassination. 
They wo~ld not make the decision to declassify. 
REP. MINK: Now, would the establishment of such a <: Q . 
panel of outside experts in effect also under your definition J 
violate ~he Privacy Act? 
GATES: I don't know the answer to that. I would have 
to have--I would have to have our attorneys look at it. 
REP. MINK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
REP. CO?i,YERS: Than~ you very much, Mrs. Mink. You've 
touched on some very important areas_. 
There are just two related considerations that I'd 
like to bring to your attention, Director Gates. One is in the 
Freedom of Information Act, where electronic data is a 
discretionary matter with the agency, and we would like you to 
review the problem with the release of CIA electronic data of 
previously released requests. It's a technical point, but I 
bring it to your attention for your future consideration. 
And finally, with regard to the Castro records, and 
AMLash and Gilverto Lopez (phonetic), it is my hop·e that you 
will elevate those as high.up on your agenda for reconsideration 
for release as _soon as appropriate. There are a number of 
members in the Congress that have asked me to bring this matter 
to your attention as ·well-.- --- - - -
GATES: I think we can do that, Mr. Chairman. I 
REP.· CONYERS: Thank you v.ery much. And on behalf of 
the committee, we deeply appreciate your app~arance before us today. •• 
GATES: Thank you, sir.
