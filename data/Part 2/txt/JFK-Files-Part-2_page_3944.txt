to the .Agency. Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted 
on 29 April 1968 after his.claim of temporary insanity at the tilil.e of 
the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American 
neurologist, Dr. -Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue 
of RAMP.ARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGEL!, had been involved 
in the assassination plot against President :tCENNEDY and that he had been 
"salted away".. Subject denied any· involvement in any conspiracy and denied. 
that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his 
fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted.in his mind by 
. Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2 of interview report). On page ·3 of the interview 
report Subject _states he no loriger believes that it is realistic to think that the 
CIA was •trying • kill him. •
