SECURITY INVESTIGATION~ 
:,,. 
Subject no longer dangerous or- potentially dangerous 
Frequently information is received or investigation develops that 
subject is no longer threat to internal security by reason of 
physical condition, defection, or expulsion from subversive move­
ment. Such defection may be shown by lack of activity and obvious 
disinterest over extended period or declaration of opposition to 
principles of subversive movement. 
When there is sufficient information regarding subject's present 
sympathies to conclude he should no longer be considered da~gerous, 
request authority for interview or advise Bureau why subject should 
not be interviewed. Bureau will not cancel security index card with­
out consideration being given to interview. If, upon interview, s~b­
ject proves cooperative, advise Bureau by letter and recommend can-
cellation. • 
g. Subjects removed from security index solely upon basis of application 
of security index criteria, with no affirmative indication of de­
fection 
With passage .of time, limits specified in security index criteria will 
operate to remove subjects even though there is no affirmative in­
dication of defection. When recommending such removal, ·consider if 
facts warrant inclusion of subject in section A of reserve index. 
Following procedures are for subjects not being recommended for in­
clusion in section A of reserve index: 
(1) When subjects are removed from security index solely on basis of 
application of criteria, retain security index cards bearing de­
scriptive matter on reverse sides; •i.e .• , cards previously filed 
in geographical, special, or unavailable sections. Destroy cards 
previously filed in alphabetical section. Those offices main­
taining two sets of ge ogra.phical cards should retain only one card. 
(2) Mark "cancelled" across face of each card retained and file in 
reserve index, section B. 
(3). Above instruc.tions do not apply to individuals removed from 
security index based upon activity in Nation- of Islam. Their 
cards should be destroyed. 
Priority apprehension program 
a.. Purpose 
Some security index subjects, be·cause of their tra·ining, violent 
tendencies, or prominence in subversive activity, would be more 
inclined or more capable of committing acts against U.S. in time 
of national emergency than others. Such subjects must be immobilized 
in least possible time. Individuals in security index tabbed 
priority I, and possibly priority II, would be arrested first in 
event of limited but grave emergency, probably without ~rrest of other· 
subjects.· Ih all-out emergency, consideration for apprehension will 
be given to all subjects~ Decision as to priority of apprehensi·on 
should be based· on subj~ct' s subversive activities and revolutionary 
tendencies. 
b. Priority tabbing 
(1) Each security index subject should be considered for priority I 
tabbing who falls within following categor_ies: 
(a) All top functionaries 
(b) All individuals considered to be hard-core national and 
state leaders of basic revolu+.ionary organizations and 
leaders of other subversive organizations and unorganized 
groups and individuals who have rndicated propensity for 
violence and/or have received special training in sab~tag~, 
espionage, and/or guerrilla warfare., or have engaged in 
underground operations 
(c) Individuals employed in or having-access to key taciliti~s
