c. Helms Testimony that he, Doubted Hhe ther he kid 
Authorizecfa-Specif{c AssasslnaEio11 At: tempt or w;is Informrd 
of the.Passage of the Pills 
There is some doubt whether Helms ever authorized a specific attempt 
at Castro's assassination, or was informed of the passage of the pioson 
pills to Roselli in April, 1962. Although Helms testified that Harvey 
regularly reported to Helms on Harvey's Mongoose work (Helms, 6/13, p.95), 
and Helms "would have thought" that Harvey would have reported to Helms 
the transfer of the pills into Cuba (Helms, 6/13; p.1O5), Helms does not 
recall Harvey ever telling him that the pills were delivered to Roselli. 
(Helms, 7/17, p.22). 
Thus, as indicated above, Jlclms, tcsf:ifiocl lw never inforr.icrl the Special 
Group Augmented or any member of that Group that ilarvey hacl 0iven the pills 
to Roselli in Niami "because I am not even sure I knew about it at the time." 
(Helms, 7/18, p~ 18.)* And with respect to the pills, Helms testified that,

call having okayed the killing of Castro myself in that form." (Helms, 7/17, 
p. 9.) 
d. Helms' Perception of Robert Kennedy's Position on a Castro 
Assassination 
In testifying as to his perception of authority, Helms emphasized the 
particular role played by Robert Kennedy in pressing for progress and results 
Helms' testimony that he may not have been informed that the pills were 
delivered is corroborated by Harvey's testimony. Ha~vey testified that 
when he returned from Miami he reported to Helms on his contacts with 
Roselli. But Harvey said that he only "briefed Helms generally", on the 
subjects of Harvey's takeover of the Roselli operation, the prospects 
of the operation, and the fact that Harvey J,ad dropped Maheu and~iancana • 
from the operation. {Harvey, 6/25, p.65).
