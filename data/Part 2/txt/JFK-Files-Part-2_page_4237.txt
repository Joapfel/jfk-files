1. Cuba - Covert Activities. 
A lengthy discussion took place on covert action potential 
to weaken the Castro-regime; The first part of the discussion 
constituted an exchange of opinion of a general nature. 
The following points were emphasized: Continued covert 
action received stippor.t although divergence on the level of 
activity was registered. There was a consensu~ that the present 
level of operations was no longer effective in attaining the 
b~sic objective of toppling Castro b~t harassment might keep 
the regime off balance. The~e was an area of disagreement on 
proofs of effectiveness of current and past measures. 
Mr. Bundy sutnr.1arized the di-lernr:ia by noting that the high 
risk, dangerous operations are the rewarding one~ and the low 
noise, innocuous operations prove to be unrewarding.

to.be co.nplctcd before the next OAS meeting (presently unscheduled). 
Mr. Bundy indicated that a Cabinet level meeting with higher 
authority would have to be held evcntua l ly to determine r.ow far
