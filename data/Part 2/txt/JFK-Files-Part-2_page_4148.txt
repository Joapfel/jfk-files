I pointed out that copies of the Memorandum had been sent 
to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice but there had been 
no conversation on the subject. 
ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms 
steps we should take to establish the 
credibility of the report; also communicate 
with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also I 
should call the Attorney General personally. 
4. Prior to the meeting Mr. Vance ~sked my opinion of using 
the 22 million psyops leaflets which inadvertently had been printed on 
U .·S. manufactured white sulphite paper, all as reported in MACY 
cable MAC SOG 5050 dated 18 June 1964 (IN 09143). I told Vance that I felt 
·'v\e should go ahead. It was too bad it had been done this way, but it is one of 
those things that a person not thoroughly acquainted with this type of operation 
might overlook. He was in agreement and.presumably will instruct the release 
of the leaflets.
