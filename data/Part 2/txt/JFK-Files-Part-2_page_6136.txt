Second, although t.he Commission had access· to some high-quality int.elligence 
information, it did not receive everything. The CIA, FBI, and Attorney General 
Robert F. Kennedy failed to reveal informat.ion that would have helped identify a 
motive for a conspiracy. n44 The failure to disclose all infor111ation to the • 
Commission was particularly damaging because of the distinguished character of 
its seven members. n45 Its chairman was Chief Justice Earl Warren, a person 
noted for probity and fairness. n46 The Commission was really divided into two 
subgroups. Four of the members - warren, Hale Boggs, Gerald Ford, and John 
Sherman Cooper - had relatively litt.le experience with intelligence matters; 
however, the other three - ~ichard Russell, Allen OUllas, and John J. Mccloy 
we~e fully conversant with national security issues and the sources and methods 
used by the intelligence services. n47

The Commission's success depended, in pare. en the ability of the three 
intelligence-savvy members to raise the right questions. They seem not to have 
done.so. For example, the Commission never discovered the existence of Operation 
MONGOOSE, n48 a coverc scheme concocted by President Kennedy and his brot.her, 
Attorney General (•9] Robert F. Kennedy, to assassinate Fidel castro wit.h 
the help of organized crime. n49 When these plans reached the public several 
years later, critics of the Warren Commission had a field day. nSO The 
Commission's conclusion that a foreign g-overnment lacked a sufficient motive to 
murder the President now crumbled·. n51 Indeed, the Commission looked silly and, 
even worse, to be a part of the plot because its critics could plausibly assert · 
that its distinguished members should have guessed at such a possibility.
