aware that the Chief of Station had an agent thought t6 have direct 
access to Lumumba (Bissell; 9/10, p. 80).

knowledge of the specific operation'' (Bissell, 9/10, p. 21). 
Bissell's lack of recollection of discussing his. assignment to 
Justin O'Donnell·kwith Tweedy was the reason for his speculation that 
~•, Bissell's assignment to O'Donnell° is discussed in Sections S(a) 
(i) and S(a)(ii), infra.
