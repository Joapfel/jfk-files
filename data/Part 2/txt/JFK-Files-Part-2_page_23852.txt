Senator Huddleston~ We are eliminati~g a lot of cover. 
Mr .. Aaron. That's the first thing. 
Now, the second thing and these are nonoffocial cover 
' categories. The second thing that we are doing is trying to 
place somewhat greater authority in the hands of the ambassador 
and the missions overseas to know what is going on. That is 
something that they can do when it is in their house. It· is 
something that's extremely difficult for them to do when it is 
off in the forest someplace. 
So it is -- and as Joe just s~id, it looks like a recomrnen 
dation to use more proprietaries,. in part because it is int the 
same section, but in reality because that is one of the ways 
they might do it, and I. just wonder how much we have thought 
i 
through for ourselves where the balance of our recommendations 
lie, particularly since most of the stuff is derived basically 
from operational experience anyway. 
There was a period, toward the end of Mr. Bissell's 
careerJin the Agency, or maybe shortly thereafter, when they 
began to try to put more people in unofficial cover, and it 
was:n • t a- very good experience for them. 
Mr. Kirbow. David, how does the ambassador lose control, 
whether it is official or unofficial, except that he has got 
them in. his compound? Itl is an official government function 
over which he has absolute control.
