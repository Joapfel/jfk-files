/ ~J ,., On 6/9/75, ~Jlr. K. Wil\iam O'Connor advised me that the 
Senate· Select Committee would like to obtain access to Appendices A 
through E of the original Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO. 
He adv.ised that the Deputy Attorney General had requested him to " J 
determine by the morning of 6/10/75 whether the FBI would object to 
disclosing the Appendices to the Committee. Subsequently, Mr. O'Connor 
sent me a copy of a notehe addressed to the Deputy Attorney General . 
dated 6/9/75, and its enclosure (a copy of a letter from S.enator Church 
to the Attorney General dated 6/9/75), both of which pertain to the 
Senate Select Committee request to have access to Appendices A through 
E of the Petersen report. The letter also requests. access to .Appendices 
~ K an_d L for inspection by designated Committee staff at the Department of 
. fl • Justice. (,Qopies of these two are attached).
