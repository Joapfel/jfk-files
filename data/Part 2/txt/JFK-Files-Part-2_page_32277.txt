The Brigade should be disbanded as a military unit 
and individual members urged to accept civilian training 
or to enlist in the existing U. S. military program 
for Cubans and join a Brigade reserve unit thereaJter. 
Our moral obligation would be discharged to the Brigade 
members and creation of a privileged class in the exile 
connnunity would be avoided.
