view. therefore, condition number (3) haa been satisfied . 
. Ac;cordin9ly, with the· .exception of the case of Hund,tz; Y, 
Uu:l teu1 Stites, there appear to he ·no ongoln; court cases . relating to MHCHAOS or HTLIRGUAL files that necessitate the 
·retantion of those materials. All HTLIHGUAL materials relating 
to Leo T. Hun,itz, therefore, ahoul4 be retained. _In addition, 
any l'ecords per~aininv to Dr. Sidney M. Peck (Pegk Y, C:IA) 
- should be retained. X ac not aware of any other matters that 
would require retention of the files at the present time, but 
you should contact the Agency's l'OIA Coordinator to determine 
if there are any outstanding 1'0IA or Privacy Act requests 
-·rel1tin9 to MHCHAOS or HTLl:HGUAL that shoul4 not be destroyed. 
If so, matarials should be retained in accordance with the 
requirements of the Records Disposal List. Finally, of course, 
information that the Agency must maintain that is ol fareiqn intelligence value •1so sbould not Z:,e destroyed. 
4. I would also point·out that the terms of the National 
Lawyers Guild settlement require that all agencies of the 
Federal Government, including the CIA, shall not use, release or disclose, within or outside the Government. ce~tain information relating to the National Lawyers Guild and its 
subunits. Accordingly, if there is CIA information derived.· 
from the FBI'• i.nvasti;atioa. relatin; to the National Lawyer5• 
Guild, A9ency records, files or indices fll\llt ba appropriately 
marked so as to permit implementation of the settlement 
agreement. This means that, to the eztea.t MHCHAOS records are 
not isolated but are contained in other -Agency files, some 
means of ensurin9 that the information is no't disseminated must 
be made. 
s. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any 
question■.
