Re: Proposal for a Multi-Agenc.y Declassification Review of Joseph Callfano's Army • 
hpers under the TFI<Act 
Gentlemen: 
The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to 
declassify six boxes of Anny records from the files of Joseph Califano. The files date. 
principally from the period 1962-63, during which Mr. Califano served as Army General 
Counsel and as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The records had been 
deposited at the National An:hives and Records Administration, where they were 
recently located. A description of the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities 
related to Cuba, is attached hereto. We have identified what appears to us to be 
equities of numerous military entities in the Califano papers as well as equities of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the United States Information 
Agency, and others. • 
Deadlines 
Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board's. current sunset date of 
September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the 
records. 1 We have slated the Califano papers far reuiew by the. Board at its August 5-6, 1997 
~ting. The Review Board staff is prepared to assist you in making arrangements for a 
prompt and efficient review of the Califano papers. 
1The Review Board is seeking from Congress a one-year, one-time extension to 
September 30, 1998. Congressman Dan Burton is sponsoting a bill to extend the· life of 
the Review Board. Should the Review Board receive the proposed extension, we may 
be able to revisit-the schedule proposed below.
