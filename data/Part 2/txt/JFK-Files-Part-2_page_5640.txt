SUBJECT: Interview with John Whitten (S) 
9ould subject him to criminal penalties in Austria~ He stated on 
several occasiDns, should his affiliation become nown, he would 
have to leave ~us~r~. On o~ o.c,s:asions, he stated that he • 
would turn himser 1.n to the Viennese) authorities and offer his 
~ervices as a consultant tote porice or intelligence service. 
He ?bviously wa~ extr 7mely distrau~ht and was voicing.what he 
believed were his options should his name be released by the 
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of 
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no 
matter what ha~pens he would never betray the CIA by telling 
anyone about his work as an intelligence officer. (S) 
5. By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he 
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions, 
I had assured him that CIA was doing everything to protect him 
and Gunn had stated he would argue for h_l~ protection to the -
Board. He clearly looked upon Gunn and(_!Jas his allies in this 
process and even stated that he had a "wonderful" day talking to 
us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident a_ll would 
t~rn out well. (S) 
6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn 
about how this issue would be handled by the aoard. Gunn 
b~lieved that it was more than likely tha~ the Board would agree 
to. protect him and that he would· make the· strongest ,~~ment he 
could to them .. The Board will make its decision in~ next 
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for 
anyone from CIA to come.down to that meeting. We agreed that 
should the Board make the- reprehensible decision-of releasing 
whitten's name, that we could not imagine a stronger case on 
which to bring an appeal to the President. (S)
