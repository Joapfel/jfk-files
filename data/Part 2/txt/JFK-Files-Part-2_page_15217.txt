Inmy memorandum of 10-6-61 it was pointed--out that we 
had proposed to the Department. of State the expansion· of this •·\., 
program to fifteen Central and South ·American countries. TI1e program.~:}' 
. involves the developing of live sources in diplomatic- establishments • '",, .. 
. in the U.S. of foreign countries with emphasis on countries faced ~,_:,~ 
with communist subversion, Sino-Soviet bloc activity or .revolutionary··':{ 
situations. We felt the existing situation in Latin A.t11erica ~-•• 
warranted this expansion. In view of the fact that U. Alexis • ... , 
• Jolu1son, Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, • :J-
•. , declined State clearance for this ._expansion it was recommended 
• and approved we go on record with letters to Secretary of. State 1 ~ 
. _· Rus~ and the Attorney Gener·a1 informing them of the_ program and 
its- merit and pointing out we were.unable to further implement . ". 
this program in view of the State Department decis_ion. '~··&, •• 
• ~ 
There is an additio~l factor here which warrants 
• consideration. Mr. U. Alexii·,'. ohJ1son, with whom we discussed 
this matter at State, has bee . ··extremely cooperative with the 
Bureau from time to time. He was particularly helpful in con..11ection 
with the opening of the office of the Legal Attache in Manilao In 
fact, on_ our behalf, he exerted pressure on the U.S. Ambassador . 
·there in order to secure his approval of the establishing of the 
office .. :He undoubtedly can be helpful in the future on such matters.
