4. USSR-India 
Israel is buying missile components 
in the US and England. 
c. We think this missile pro­
gram is independent of another 
Israeli venture: Tel Aviv 9 s con­
tract with a French firm, Marcel 
Dassault, for the development of a 
system which will be abl~ to deliver 
a 1,600..,.pound warhead to a maximum 
range of 300 miles. 
a. Moscow has promised the 
Indians to ship the equipment for 
one surface-to-air (SAM) training 
site early next month. 
b. The Soviets had agreed to 
provide eight SAM sites. The rest 
will probably not be serit until the 
Indians have learned to handle the 
equipment about a year from now. 
c. As we noted last Sunday, 
there are some Indians who have 
doubts about the Soviet willingness 
to live up to the letter of their 
military aid agreements with New 
Delhi.
