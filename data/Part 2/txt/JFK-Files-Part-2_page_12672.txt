s: .N 87. SECURITY INVESTIGATIC ,. 
While none of the above may be of sufficient value alone, a 
combination m::i.y constitute convincing proof. Revolutionary 
purposes of subversive organization are frequently cloaked in 
veiled language or in language significant only to persons 
familiar with Marxist or revolutionary terminology. Such 
statements should be fully reported. Develop and report all 
revolution~ry statements and circumstances under which made. 
Position and importance 
(a_) Information showing importance of ·individual to sub-· 
versive organization or movement should be fully developed 
and re ported. Member or affiliate may be dangerous or 
impor·tant because of his position, influence, or activities 
inside or outside organization, or both. 
{b) Concealment-of membership and underground activity 
Msmber or affiliate may be highly dangerous although he 
takes no part in overt activities of organization. Subject 
.may have assignment in underground and is not to contact 
or associate openly with others in subversive movement. By 
virtue of this assignment in secret operations, such in­
dividuals must be considered most dangerous. Be continuaily 
alert that individual may be serving in underground capacity. 
All logical investigative techniques should be used to de­
velop fully individual's activities in underground; identities 
of other individuals engaged in underground operations; and 
method of operation, extent, and purposes of underground. • 
Coverage must be sufficient :to insure -underground activities 
of subversive moYement are known. Identities of individuals 
who are directing underground operations; location of hiding 
places of fugitives and underground leaders; and locations 
of secret printing presses, mimeograph machines, and large 
·stationery supplies must be known at all times. 
Missing security subjects 
(1) Location of all dangerous subversives must be known at all times. 
Each subject remaining out of control at time of national e~er­
gency represents threat to national security. 
(2) When subject of pending investigation fits standards for security 
index and his location is not known, recommend for unavailable 
section of security index. 
(3) When information is received that security index subject has 
changed his residence and/or employment, case must be opened 
and assigned for active investigation to locate su-0ject. 
(4) If subject has deliberately absented-himself to avoid detection 
by us, has gone into hiding, or is working clandestinely in 
underground capacity, he can be classified as missing subject 
and should be included in unavailable section of security index. 
When FD-122 is submitted to Bureau placing missing subject in 
unavailable section, also send cover letter advising of ·investi­
gative steps already taken to locate him. 
(5) Investigations to locate missing se'curity index subjects must. "be 
given preferential and continuous attention. Investigation must 
be handled as thoroughly and promptly as fugitive investigation. 
(a) Advise Bureau each 45 days by letter of steps tak~n to 
locate missing security index subject. Do not submit 
reports which merely set forth negative results of investi­
gation to locate subject. 
• (b) If subject may have gone to Mexico or Canada, request Bureau 
to alert appropriate Government agencies to this possibilitY. 
and to seek verifying information through liaison channels. 
.If subject is reported to have gone to any other foreign . 
country, request Washington Field Office (WFO) to check 
records of Passport Office of State Department for verifi­
cation.
