NY T-7 on· July 18, 1972, and l'JY T-11 on July 19, 
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference w~s 
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on 
July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972. 
NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of 
this convention because this city is considered to be 
the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so'far . . 
Discussionshe;? at this conference centered on 
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal 
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to 
end forced sterilization. 
A discussion was held concerning the attacks 
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other 
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their owri 
bodies. 
NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session 
of WONAAC occurred on July 15; 1972, and it was immediately 
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting: 
Independent women who wanted to make statements during 
this session were voted down by m;qp floor leaders and 
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all 
issues. 
The group of independent women from various 
geographic areas, that is, those women ·who were not 
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the 
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem 
of how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women 
were not political realists in their goals, they did 
believe in working throughout the existing system rather 
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of 
revolution. 
It was decided that the independent feminists 
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They 
did not want to have decisions for them being structured 
by a male dominated group. They also decided ~hat m~n~y 
being collected by lv'ONAAC in the name of abortion law
