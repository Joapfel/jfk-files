VIETN/\M DAY COMMITTEE ( VDC) 
A booklet published by the VDC contained the 
following policy statement of tl1e VDC adopted 
by the general membership, June, 1965: 
The Vietnam. Day Committee is a group of stuc"'.ents ~ 
faculty and other members of the Bay area 
community ovposed to Americ2.::i intervention in 
·vietnam, the Dominican :Republic and wherever 
else it may occur. Revolutionary struggles 
for self-determination are sweeping the world 
today. American suppression of these move­
ments, we believe~ is immor2.l and a threat to 
the peace of the world. The Vietnam Day 
Committee is organizing non-violent direct 
actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing 
and other educational activities to oppose 
American intervention. We believe that the 
struggle for self-determination in other 
countries is related to the struggle for 
democracy in America--a democracy in which the 
people have the facts and the power to make 
decisions for themselves. The struggles in 
.A.merica against racism, poverty, and bureau­
cratic c-::mf ormi ty are part of the same move-
ment as the struggle against American militarism. 
We must build a New America and -;oin with those 
people in Asia, Africa and Latin. America building 
a New World.
