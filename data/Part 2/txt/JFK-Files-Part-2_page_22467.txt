the part of these people or whether they were instructcc to 
do it. I tried to run that down and I have been unable tc . 
Q At what locations has it been reported that pick~ts 
were located? 
A Airline offices in New York, Miami. I think another 
place. I forget where it was . 
Q Have you in fact been able to verify that these 
persons were Cubans?
