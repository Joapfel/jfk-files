himself had not been straight-forwardly told about the operation.* 
The failure to either inform those officials or to make 
certain that they had been informed by Dulles was particularly 
reprehensible in light of the fact that there were many occasions 
on which Bissell should have informed them, and his failure to 
do so was misleading. In the first weeks of the Kennedy Adminis­
tration, Bissell met with Bundy and discussed the development 
of an assassination capability within CIA--executive action. 
But Bissell did not mention that an. actual assassination attempt 
was underway. Bissell appeared before the Taylor-Kennedy Board 
of Inquiry which was formed to report to the President on the 
Bay of Pigs and the Cuban situation, but testified that he did 
• not inform the Commission of the assassination operation. As 
chief of the CIA directorate concerned with clandestine operations 
~nd the Bay of Pigs, Bissell frequently met with officials in 
the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations to discuss Cuban 
operations, and his advice was frequently sought. He did not 
tell them that the-·CIA had undertaken- an effort to assassinate 
Castto, and did not ask if they favored proceedine with the 
,., Even assuming that Bissell correctly perceived that Dulles 
understood the nature of the operation it was inexcusable for 
Bissell nov to have briefed Dulles in plain language. Further 
even if one accepts Bissell's assumption that Dulles told the ' 
Presidents, they would have been told too late because Bissell 
" • d" h d h ' guesse t ey woul ave been told that the operation "had 
been planned and was being attempted".
