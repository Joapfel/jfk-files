In iate J\llY and early August' our intelligence noted a significant 
change in the situation in Cuba. A sudd~h rise in military aid from the Soviet

activity in Cuba increased significantly. These reports were checked out as 
scrupulously as possible, but even though many of them included consistent 
and similar descriptions of some form of missile acti\lity, there was no confir­
mation of them. 
At the same time, there were human source reports that some of the ships 
were unloaded at night under rigid security with all non-Soviet personnel 
being excluded from the dock areas. The practice of unloading at night in 
small easily guarded ports, remote from large population centers, was known

some of the arriving personnel during this period were primarily young, trim,
