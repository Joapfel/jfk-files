nn•:::i? rn question. The recorcer is s:o-,•,er.! 
to 15 16 inches per secc:id a:~d p,ay~d. The 
sourid. no !onger recognizao:e as a human 
voice. is a long. low rumble. 
The PSE itself is built int-:: an attache case. 
The case opens to reveal a c:iart or:vo. sim­
ilar to an electrocardiograph. and a n:.imber 
of buttons and knobs. A s:r.g,e cable con­
nects the PSE to the tape recorder. 
As th_e tape recorder reels siowly tum. 
and a rumble issues from its speaker. the 
PSE stylus dances back and forth across 
the moving chart paper, leaving benind a 
ragged trail. Then the recorder is stopped, 
the chart paper is stopped, and that's all 
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper 
with a squiggly line. The rest is up to the 
human eye and brain. 
On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz 
showed us what to look for. The unstressed 
voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with 
stalks of different heights sticl<ing up (and 
down) at irregular intervals. But add some 
stress. and that hedge begins to look 
:rimmed. The greater the stress. the 
The more I read. 
the more I doubted

smoother the shape. It the subject was 
e;,periencing the hard stress which accom­
panies deception, the over-ail outline of ti1e 
figure tends to take on a rectangular shape, 
a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz 
showed slide a.lier slide oi charts made dur­
ing actual police :nterroga:icns. He told us 
!he background of each case and pointed 
out the tell-tale signs of deception. when­
ever they were present. 
·That night each student took a PSE back 
to his room to practice operating it. So!'T'e 
coordination must be le3rned to become 
facile in handling the recorder and the PSE. 
but clearly the difficult part of the course 
would be learning how to read and interpret 
the charts.

I ran my first real interrogation taps. 
The interrcgatior, always includ~s the 
question. "Are you afraid that I will as:-< vou 
about sometr:i~g ·1.-e have r.ot discusseo':'" 
A negative ansN:r with no sign of s'.r<~ss 
e!iminates the Ol.tside-issue prob!t!m. Also. 
the examir.er.a!ways aslt.s sorr~ inn.)cuous 
quest1ons, such as. "Do you like the color 
blue?" in order lo obsar,e the suoj.sct's 
general state of tension. And there is always 
one ··red-herring" question. 
The red herring is used to icientiiy the 
"guilt complex responder." Such a i:;erson 
shows stress when he respor.ds to any 
accusatory question. The examiner may 
ask, "Did you steal the watch?" when it is 
money, not a watch. that is missing. A 
stressed denial will alert the examiner. who 
carefully compares this response to the 
stress produced by questions about the 
missing money. 
That night the ~lass was given tapes of 
real police interrogations. In most cases, 
Kradz was the examiner; and in every case, 
he knew the background and reso!ution of 
the matter. One case I was assigned con­
cerned a yourig man accused of stealing 
money from his father's store. Kradz started 
by asking the "outside-issue" question. No. 
the young man replied, he was not afraid 
Kradz would ask him a question they hadn't 
discussed. Then the following exchange 
took pl~ce: 
"Do you live in Howard County?" 
"Yes." 
"Do you suspect someone of having ~ak~n 
the money?" 
"No.•· 
"Are you wearing a white shirt?" 
"Yes." 
"Do you know who took the money?" 
11
No." 
"'Are you wearing a ring?" 
"Yes." 
"Did you take the money?'' 
"No." 
There were a few red-herring questions 
to check for tt1e guilt co.or.plex resp:,n:;;e. 
The questions about wearing a white shirt 
and a ring and livlng in Howard Cou~t, had 
been included to measure the background 
stress elicited by irrelevant issue.s. 
I ran the tape and charted it on the PSE.
