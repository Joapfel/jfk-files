J briefed f.aines for 30 minutes on LICOOKY 
giving him the full background on her ~io. 
education, CI4relationship---fro:i recruit­
ment through current use in Mexico. My 
suggestion was that she be told to go to 
NY and find a j,1b which would give her a 
means of 1i ~,.~lihood as well as cover for any 
future CIA income. After 6 months (or some 
other specific period cf time) it would be 
arranged that either we contact her or she 
contact us to determine what her personal 
situation was and whether she would then be 
in a position to ~arget against selected 
persons of interest to CIA in the NY area.

for herCIA work. Mr. Gaines wanted to 
think about it but thought that 'this would 
be the best approach. He will talk to you 
before Fr_iday. 
His only question was whether we had any 
·indication whether she was under develop­
ment by the opposition---Soviet. Cuban, etc. 
I told him that as far as I knew there was 
no such indication. If I am wrong (per 
your and Bill Johnson's recent activity) 
you better correct this.
