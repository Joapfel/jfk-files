this equipment might be dangerous from 
the security aspect. Allowing a ship­
load of equipment manned by a Cuban 
crew to evade our Coast Guard would 
probably bea better method. The most 
secure means of help would be giving 
the money to Castro, who could then 
purchase his own arms. A combination

By late fall of 1958, when it became apparent 
that the Batista regime in Cuba was about to go under, 
the Agency in conjunction with the Department of State 
supported a plan to have Batista bow out more or less 
gracefully and to have the government of the.country 
taken over, not by the Presidential candidate who had 
been elected, in the rigged.election, but by a junta 
pending subsequent free, democratic elections. When

biased against,Castro.' One report in the fall of 1958 
indicated that Castro definitely was not a Communist, 
citing as a reason for this: "Ninety-five percent of 
h.is followers are good Catholics. Three Catholic

the Sierra Maestra, and one has joined Raul C~stro 
and his troops in the Sierra Cristal. The rebel forces 
under the Castros, therefore, have four chaplains, 
while·. the entire Cuban Army does not have a single 
chaplain'. ,(Source comment: The United States should 
not be taken in by President Fulgencio Batista's attempt 
to label the revolutionary movement as Communist in­
spired, dominated, or influenced.)" 16/ 
The source for this evaluation of Castro was, as 
one might surmise, a Catholic priest.
