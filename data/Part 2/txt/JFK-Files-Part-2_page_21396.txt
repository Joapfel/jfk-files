In connection with a claim by the American Deserters 
Committee, Sweden, that agents for the CIA had tried to infiltr_ate the 
committee to break it up, it was determined at CIA that Richard Thomas 
Gibson, an informant of that Agency, had been maintaining some qontact 
with US deserters. Gibson had been involved in at least one operatiOR 
to influence a deserter to return to the US. Gibson also had been u~ed 
by CIA throughout Europe as a penetration of Black Power and New Left , 
groups and had been the source of considerable information from CIA. 
The impression had been received that Gibson had possibly been compromised 
and it could not be discounted that his involvement might become 
publicized including the allegation of a connection with CIA. (Brennan
