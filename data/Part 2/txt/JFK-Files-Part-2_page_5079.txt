In accordance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act 
of 1992, I am writing to inform you that the Assassination Re~ords Review Board has 
made additional formal determinations concerning the public disclosure of CIA 
records on September 9, 1998 and September 14, 1998. 
Enclosed is a list of the determinations that the Review Board has made. These 
decisions were premised on several factors, including the historie:al interest in the 
documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause 
. harm to the United States or to any individual. 
You have seven days to appeal these decisions to the President. You are invited to send 
your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for 
which determinations have been made and to discuss the determinatio~ with my staff. 
Sinc~rely, 
-~ Laura A. Denk
