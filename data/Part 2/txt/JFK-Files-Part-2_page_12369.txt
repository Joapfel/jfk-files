SECTI0:T 107-SECURITY INFORM.I\.NTS .AND CONFI.I.AL SOURCES. 
Contacts· by Agents 
a. Except in es pi·ona.ge· and foreign nationality matters where frequency 
of ·contact is dependent on circumstances, informants shou:Ld be con­
tacted as often as necessary, but at least one personal contact 
should be made every two weeks. If such frequent contacts cannot be 
establis·hed, obtain specific Bureau authority for exception to this 
requirement. . 
• b. During each contact, carefully review informant's activities since 
previous contact and make certain informant has furnished all in­
formation which he has obtained since last contact. 
c. Contacting .Agent should not only collect information but direct· 
informant, be aware of his activities, and maintain such close 
relationship that he. knows informant's attitude towards Bureau.

not become too familiar with .Agent. Promptly advise Bureau of any 
indication informant is wavering in Bureau relationship. 
d. Arrangements for paying informant or personally contactirrg him must 
be specific and no doubt ·should be left in minds of either Agent 
or informant as to methods of payment, amount, place, and time. • 
e. Informants should use only public telephones in communicating with

informants nonpublished office telephone number for emergency com­
munication. This rule is not practical in all espionage and 
foreign nationality matters but should be followed where applicable. 
f. Positive information received from informant should be subject of 
written statement by informant or memorandum prepared by contacting 
Agent to be placed in informant's subfile and appropriately 
channelized.

informant's administrative file. Memorandum or form FD-209 may be 
used. If informant contacted frequently, one ·memorandum or form 
may be used for several contacts. 
h. Dates of negative contacts and file numbers of cases involved must 
app~ar in informant's administrative file. Where file ~as more than 
one subject, name of subject under inquiry should be noted. Do not 
set forth title of case involved. 
i. If positive information received from informant, show only dates of 
contacts in informant's administrative file. Place positive informa­
tion in informant's subfile and appropriately channelize same. 
j. Alternate Agent should be designated for contacts with informant 
and should be thoroughly acquainted with informant so that contacts 
may be handled by alternate Agent where necessary. 
Checking reliability 
a. Reliability of all active informants must be constantly checked. 
b. Give consideration to use of any investigative technique deemed 
necessary to be certain they are completely reliable and are fur­
nishing accurate, truthful information. 
Fingerprints 
a, After informant has been developed and unless some reason to 
contrary exist-s, obtain and forward his fingerprints to Identifi­
cation Division if they are not on file there. 
b. If informant refuses, do not force issue. 
c. Forward informant's fingerprints as enclosure to FD-165 using 
applicant-type fingerprint card, form FD-258, fully executed.· 
Appropriate field office should be shown as contributor, field 
case file number in number space, and 11inquiry 11 in space for
