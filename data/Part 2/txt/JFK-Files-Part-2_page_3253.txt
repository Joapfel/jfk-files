rather than in direc.t action programs against Cuba, 
representatives of the Special Projects Group, Counter­
intelligence made a pitch to Chief, JMATE to acquire 
a vessel which -- for its acquisition, operational 
'" 
maintenance, crew, including incentive bonus would 
run roughly $200,000 for a 6-month period -- could 
also be used in deception operations against Castro. 
In responding to this suggestion from the.Special 
Projects Group, Col. Jack Hawkins quickly put the ---~ 
quietus on this request, noting that it was doubtful 
that the Cubans had either enough sophisticated radar 
or comma gear so ,that they would react to "the false 
radar presentation, deceptive communications traffic, 
noise makers,. signals, smoke, explosions, etc." Con-
sequently Hawkins concluded: 
In view of the high cos.t involved, 
and the other factors mentioned above, 
I do not concur in the acquisition of 
this craft for deceRtion purposes as 
proposed in the reference. 46/
