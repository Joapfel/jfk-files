3. MIG-21 Fighters - Although the Soviets had supplied the Cuban Air 
Force with MIG-15, 17, and 19 aircraft prior to the Spring of 1962, the pre­
sence of the modern supersonic MIG-21 fighter was first confirmed by a. picture 
obtained on September 5, 1962. 
4. IL-28 (Beagle) Bombers - As early as the Spring of 1962., the intelli­
gence community was of the view that the Soviets might send the IL-28 (Beagle) 
light bomber into Cuba. This apprehension was confirmed by a picture ta.ken on 
September 28 which was later evaluated as showing crates containing IL-28's 
a.board a Cuba-bound ship. This evaluation was not ma.de until October 9 and was 
disseminated to the intelligence community on October 10. 
5. Medium Range and Intermediate Range Missiles - As has already been 
indicated, during all of this period there was a great vol~ of unconfirmed 
reports and rumors from human sources about strategic missile-related activity 
in Cuba. None of these reports were confirmed prior to October 14., 1962. It 
is evident that many of these reports in fa.ct referred to the SA.-2 missile, 
which, although nowhere near the size of the strategic missiles later identi­
fied., still appears large to the untrained observer. 
However., after mid-September some reports of missiles being introduced 
into Cuba were suggestive enough of strategic or offensive weapons to arouse 
the suspicions of intelligence analysts. This resulted in the conclusion-­
apparently reached near the end of' September, 1962--that there was a suspect 
medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) site in Pinar del Rio Province. As a 
_result, photographic coverage of the suspect area. was proposed and on October 
14 a Strategic Air Command U-2 reconnaissance aircraft overflew the area and 
emerged with hard photographic evidence of the San Cristobal medium-range 
ballistic missile complex.
