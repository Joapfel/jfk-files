Committee, I remember, for example, Senator Huddleston, who was on the Church 
Cammi tttee and 1 a ter was on the I nte 111 gence Cammi ttee. During ·the days of 
the Church Committee he was talking about, "You can't just have CIA or the 
intelligence people talk to a couple of people up on the Hill and that's it. 
You've got to talk to everybody." After he'd been on the Intelligence 
Committee for a while, and I've got his clippings somewhere in my stack of 
clippings, Huddleston said, "The Congress,.the members of Congressll -- he was 
addressing his own buddies -- "the members of Congress have to accept us on 
the Intelligence Committee as your surrogates." And that is all we were 
trying to d6. ·rn an intelligence community to have an intelligence committee 
be the surrogate -- and there was four of them -- be the surrogate for the 
whole Congress. But Huddletson when he was on the Church committee said, "You 
can't do that, you can't do that. We all have to know." Well, he fo~nd out 
personally. 
INTERVIEWER: He finally ch~nged. 
MR. HALPERN: He changed his mind. 
i NTERVI EWER: That' s neat. 
MR. HALPERN: So you know, that's all they were saying. And tt finally, it 
took him a long while to·get around to it, but he finally did it. 
INTERVIEWER: Some get educated faster than others. 
MR. HALPERN: That's right. So when you talk about. The !74 break, I 
think, was a big thing, a bi~ thing. And I think if the election of Congress 
in '74 had gcine a little bit differently, and there hadn't been that total 
break and disorder up on the Hil), the disarray I call it, whtch all began 
with the Vietnam business and aided by the Watergate -
INTERVIEWER: And Nixon resigning in '74.
