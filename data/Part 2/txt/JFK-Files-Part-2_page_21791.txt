joined ~after you took over getting general tradecraft? 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir, no, sir . 
Mr. Wides. And to your knowledge it was only report 
writing? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, they trained them in each one of the 
sections, and I didn't train the debriefers, so if a naw man 
was hired and he was put in a debrie5ing, he was trained u 
usually by the Chief of the Debriefing Group,·he was put in 
there to work along with other debriefers to catch onto the 
thing. 
Mr. Wides. Now your testimony with regard to surveillance 
training, who issued that, or how many people? 
Mr. Sarno. If I am not mistaken, it was four or five. 
Mr. Wides. When you first came, or shortly therafter? 
Mr. Sarno. Yes, it was all at the -- now, now, just one 
second, because I went in surveillance training myself. 
I don ,·t recall whether this four or five whom we trained 
in surveillance were trained while I had them or they were 
19 trained before I took them. 
20· Mr._Wides. Now after that, those four or five, no other 
2l ~people to your knowledge received any surveillance 
22 training, is that your testimony?

Mr. Sarno. Nobody.
