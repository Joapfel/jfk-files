MINNESOTA WOMEN'S ABORTION 
ACTION COALITION CONFIDENTIAL 
Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed 
interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of 
policy. The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion . 
movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement 
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG, 
both male and female. While the vast majority of women in 
the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes 
in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal 
or change also include professional women, medical doctors, 
.lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all 
walks of life.
