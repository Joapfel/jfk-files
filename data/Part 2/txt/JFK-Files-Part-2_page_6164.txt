techniques associated with photo reconnaissance-by spy planes and satellites. 
See id. (discussing 800,000 reconnaissance photographs taken by the CIA. from / 
.1960-72 and kept secret). There is now. however, growing information about the 
capabilities of the oniced Stat.es during the Cold war. see id.; see also Stuart

If che passage of time makes .no difference, then the American people would 
never have a right. co all of the in£ormation used·or denied by the Warren 
Commission. The passage of time neuters secrecy, and eventually~ like Douglas 
MacArthur's old soldiers, secret.a just fade away. If there are any·secrets that 
a democratic government has a right to .keep permanently from its.people, surely 
the murder of the· President would not. be one such secret' .. , 
Then there is the problem of what ·cheory the Board should adopt to explain 
events in Dallas. Gerald Posner. for example, has pub- [*;34] lished a widely· 
.read book on the assassination entitled Case Closed. n199 It c.oncludes that Lee 
Harvey Oswald murdered Presidenc Kennedy. that he did so acting alone, and that 
there is no .evidence of a iarge:r: conspiracy, foreign or domestic. n200 That 
notion of the assassinacion is countered by a host of critics that insisc on 
just the opposite. n201
