5. Development of u. S. Military or other u. S. Government Personnel 
Whenever it becomes desirable to develop a member of the u. S. Military 
or an employee of another Government agency as an FCI asset, FBIHQ 
notifies the respective military service or ageney of our interest. 
To facilitate this notification the office desiring to develop such an 
individual should submit to FBIHQ 5 copies of an LHM setting out: 
a. Proposed asset's name, rank or position, and current place of 
assignment. 
b. Area of FBI interest in the asset, in general, and the foreign 
intelligence service, and official, if known, against which it is 
anticipated asset will be directed. 
c. Extent of anticipated coverage to be provided by the asset, i.e., 
describe the services he will provide. 
d. The last paragraph of thi~ LHM should read: 
"It is requested that no further dissemination of the foregoing 
be made without prior reference to FBI Headquarters. If you 
agree with our contemplated use of the above individual, please 
return a copy of this memorandum with your acknowledgement." 
e. Members of the military: estimated time period within which you 
wish to utilize the asset; desirability that the asset remain in 
his current area of assignment for a specified period of time. 
Upon receipt of clearance from the military, FBIHQ will select 
code name for future use in identifying the asset. This code 
name will be furnished to military intelligence component at 
headquarters level and to FBI field divisions. Every 6 months 
thereafter, as long as the FBI has continuing operational interest 
in the asset, an LHM captioned with code name should be transmitted 
to FBIHQ, by routing slip captioned with informant's symbol number. 
The LHM is to contain a statement that the asset continues to be 
of operational use to the FBI, and a statement detailing any 
difficulties encountered in control or direction of the asset or 
a statement that no such difficulties exist. 
NOTE: Generally, the u. s. Armed Forces may not be utilized to 
enforce the civilian criminal law; however, they may be utilized 
for foreign counterintelligence purposes. In foreign counterintel­
ligence investigations in which there is a possibility of criminal 
prosecution, use of military personnel as assets might jeopardize 
successful prosecution, and all such cases must be discussed in 
detail with FBIHQ prior to utilization of such military assets .
