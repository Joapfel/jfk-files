I do not recall any discussion of any assassination plan 
connected to .the United States Government during the entire 
course of my government service. I do not recall ever 
hearing of the.CIA adopting any assassination plan, nor do I 
recall ever hearing the President make a statement that 
could be construed as an order for the assassination of 
Patrice Lumumba. 
3. In answer to a question from Mr. Baron I said that 
in my opinion the language used in the Memorandum for the 
Record of the Special Group Meeting of August 25, 1960 is 
sufficiently broad so it could be interpreted to cover a 
• discussion of as~assination: 
It was finally agreed that planning for the 
Congo would not necessarily rule out "con­
sideration" of any particular kind of activity 
which might contribute to getting rid of 
Lumumba. • 
However, I do not remember any such discussion, nor do I have 
any direct recollection of the substance of that meeting.

assassination:
