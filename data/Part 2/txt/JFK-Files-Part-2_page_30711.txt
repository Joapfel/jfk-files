"Rey is balieved to have accomplished prati~ nothing towards the eff'ort 
to overthow ~tro. Instead, it seems that whenever we pl.eyed with bis so­
«--aJled assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or 
operations I several d81'S after some other group had already' set them up or 
claimed tbem. Whenever it came to producing and bflcldng ey bis cla1rns, he 
al~. came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has 
al~ tended to try to take over other goeys, rather than cooperate with 
them, and 'When he couldn't take them over he wou1d "politic" against them. 
His actions all seemed to be direceed toward maJdng him the future pover 
in Cuba rather than toward. overthrowing Castro. It is beUeved that Manolo 
RAY is so f'ar "left" in bis tb1nkfng that he would be ·as dangerous (or more 
so in the long run) to United states interests as Castro, if he ever got to 
be the power in CUba.
