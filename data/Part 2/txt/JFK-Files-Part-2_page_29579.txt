In considering ·the above detail~d allegations, it is im­
portant to distinguish betwee~ .the allegation that~ 
photograph was found at headq~arters as opposed to the 
assertion that a photograph W3.S founq. in Mexico City. 
It is also important to remember that these allegations 
are ~hat'can be termed "grapevine stores." There was 
a photograph found in Mexico city of a man that was 
thought possibly to be Oswalc. This photograph and 
the circumstances Surroundinc it will be dealt with in 
~ subsequent section. Ms. Arne Goodpasture of the 
Mexico City Station found thjs photograph. (See below.) 
In the absence of any ·evidence otherwise~-Note :_. The 
. Watson allegation says there was a photo ··in· ~Iexico' ·city in the 
• mid-60' s; not that it was fOlmd there--i t is most 
likely that the grapevine st<>ries about a photo being 
found in Mexico arise from M:;. Goodpasture' s report- • 
ing ·the ·photo of the man who has since become known as 
the Mexico mystery m·an in th,~ same cable that reported 
Os~ald's visit to the Soviet Embassy .. (See below.) 
The findings of this Committ~e regarding the general 
Mexico.City surveillance opecations·are presented in 
Section II, A and B above. In summary, ·this Committee 
found that there were three ;>hotographic surveillance 
bases_ (four camera~) that may .have photographed Lee·. 
Harvey Oswald in September and October of 1963. This 
was determined .from analysis of project files for these 
operations and the testimony 6f.CIA officials. (See • 
preceding sections.)
