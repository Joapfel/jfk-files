·-.-··=."added ·that -i~asr.-mch as - it• then appe·c>.red to him that R.Ut,A. ·had left 
voluntarily, he also concluded he h2d ·no reason to fear for the 
safety of RIHA. Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had 
been subsequently quoted in the 11Colorado Daily" or any other 
newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe, 
such quotation would have been correct. 
Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not 
feel, however, that the explanation about RIHA was adequate and 
for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of 
the Foreign Agents Registration sec~ion within the Justice Depart­
ment, who::n he knew well. He thereafter received a reply that the 
Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased. 
He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to 
the sa~e section mentioned above within the Justice Department in 
mid-·Deccmber, 1969~ again inquiring about RIP...A, but as yet has 
received no reply. 
He stated he did not know of anything of value ever 
. received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.
