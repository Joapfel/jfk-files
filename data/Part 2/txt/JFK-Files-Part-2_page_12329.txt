receipt cannot be obtained for a particular payment, complete circumstances 
should be set forth on the blue slip at thi time reimbursement is claim~d. 
a, Receipts should be of such a nature that they will be self-sufficient 
so that, if it becomes necessary to_intr_od,uce the .. receipi;;s in evidence 
• durin·g the course of a triai, the receipts will not relate to qther 
documents or file.s. 
b, Receipts should clearly show:

e. When transmitting receipts and itemized statements of expenses to the 
Bureau, they should be stapled directly to the blue slip, leaving a· 
margin of at least one· inch to one and one-half inches at the top to 
avoid contact with the Acco fastener punch. The staples should be 
placed in such a manner that the date or other data appearing on the 
receipt will not be mutilated and all information on tht:? receipt _can 
be easily read without detaching it from the blue slip. Care mu~t 
be taken that receipts are of such a nature that they clearly show 
payment of money and do not refer to any other documentary material 
contained in Bufiles.
