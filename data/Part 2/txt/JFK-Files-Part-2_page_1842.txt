Subject, vbo has been ln grade ns n GS-10 just two years, 
hns been· Chief of the Reg·istry o·f the London Station for eighteen 
months. Subje-et, fresh from a Saigon assignment, brought with 
him a broad a~~ varied background of field experience (Far East) 
and several F..c.:a.1quarters' ussignments. Ht> hns been in one or 
annthC"r a.:.f,"':C".. r_;! n:cords mana~1:mcnl work :,;ince he stnt·tod with 
us as a very jWJior clerk in 1952. 
81\bject'fi Iiti1ess reports, since ·he has been in London, 
testify to the_ high regard ·111 which he, is held by the Stnt,ioµ 
and the exce 11..€.ot rcsu.l ts he has managed to achieve. When he 
arrived at the :Station, tho start had been made on n file reduction 
program but 2.:; <:normous amount of organized work remained ta be 
done. Subject set about it with greit enthusiasm and u high degree 
of professiofizl organization. As a result, tho R~gistry inventory 
toctny is the uanest and tho most efficient the Station has seen 
for many a lou~ .. day, if ever bofore. To a great extent this. can 
I~ latd at Su~jcct's own door tind he personally dld much of the 
work. At th,: :-;.1uu•J time, Suli.Jcct surveyl'd :rncl reorg:inizcd the over­
