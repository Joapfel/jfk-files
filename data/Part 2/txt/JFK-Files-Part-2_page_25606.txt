-Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had ··made arrangements for 
Hughes to. live at the Desert Inn vhen Hughes first ·arrived there in late 1966. He 
said that he had received a·call f'rorii Maheu, who ·needed to make arrangements for 
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu., no one wanted to give 
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles 
and went up to las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who ovned 13~ ~f. 
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the. pe~thouses-
at • the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu ·Has in charge of security and ~~ponsible for 
seeing ~hat Hughes arrived unnoticed in I.as Vegas. Kolod acquiesced a~ told • 
Roselli that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be ·available at the goirig rate, 
but. that they would have to leave the hotel by Nev Years- •. When the New Years date 
was approaching, Maheu ca lied and said that· they h~ received notice from Ko~ and 
• were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to e.11.<;>~--t'h.em .•
