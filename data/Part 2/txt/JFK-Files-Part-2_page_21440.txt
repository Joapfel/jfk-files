In view of this latest development, it is most strongly ' 
urged that the Bureau, through liaison,. have CIA interview "SUGAR", 
specifically concerning the following point-s: i 
(1) Any and all knowledge "SUGAR" has 
• concerning activities and contacts of 
HOWARD BRUCE FRANKLIN while the latter 
was in France~ 
• (2) Any and all knowledge of DAVIDA 
FINEMAN. In this connection, it is 
suggested that CIA be requested to 
encourage correspondence between·"SUGAR" 
and FINEMAN . . 
(3) "SUGAR" furnish CIA with all corre­
spondence to and from the RU and that 
"SUGAR" be directed in a logical way to 
encourage .. such correspondence with the RU. 
. . 
. In view of LEIBEL BERGMAN'S admitted difficulties over 
communic;ations with Reel China and lack of knowledge of current ;,'­
events in that country, it is believed that if ''SUGAR" can 
favorably establish himself with the RU as a contact in Europe ~ 
he will be able to furnish valuable _information on any other 
contacts the RU.may attempt to establish on the Continent and 
might even'be utilized as a cutout by BERGMAN for the RU. 
In view of the delicate nature of the information 
contained in.the LHM, ·the Bureau may wish to restrict dissemi­
nation to CIA only. 
In referring the above requests to CIA, the Bureau 
should insure the bona fides of "SUGAR-" as a CIA operative and 
his reliability lest SF 3169-S be compromised. 
San Francisco will continue to follow this matter 
with SF 3169~s.
