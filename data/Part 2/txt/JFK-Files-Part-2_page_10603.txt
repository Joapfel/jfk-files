By letter- dated July 9, ~enators Frank Church 
and John Tower requested our appearanc in :Executive Session 
before the Senate Select Cotnaittee to discuss matters of 
concern to me and steps which might e taken to expedite 
responses to requests for document essential to the 
Committee's inquiry. 
It is my intehtion to raise the question of privacy 
as well as the protection of s urces at this forthcoming 
meeting. In the most recent equcsts of tho Senate Select 
-CollllUittee dated June 30 and uly 8, 1975-, copies of which are 
in the possession of Mr. o• onnor, the Committee appears to 
disregard the rights of ce ain individuals' privacy, going 
so far as to ask for copi of the annual performance ratings 
of certain former Specia Agents of the FBI. 
It is my inte tion to request the Committee to J relieve the FBI from t e obligation of violating the 
privacy riahts of ind· iduals or placina in jeopardy
