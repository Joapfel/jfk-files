"On the morning of September 4, 1969, 
the Metropolitan Police Department was advised 
by the Washington National Airport Police that 
some silverware had been found near one of the 
entrances to the terminal at the Washington 
National Airport. The silverware was recovered 
by the Metropolitan Police Department and 
processed for latent fingerprints without 
success and the items were returned to Mrs. 
Kraft upon her identification of the silverware. 
No suspects were developed by either the FBI 
or the Metropolitan Police Department in the 
investigation of the matter." 
\ 
Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the 
burglary. Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant 
to the August 5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this 
question. 
The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes 
in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press r.eport about 
the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look 
into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other 
documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary? 
What files of the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate 
about how the conversation about the burglary took place?
