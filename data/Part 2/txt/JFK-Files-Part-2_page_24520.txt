In the fall of 1961, Lansdale had been asketl by President 
Kennedy to examine the Administration's Cuba policy and to make recommen­
dations. Lansdale test~fied that, in reportinp; his recommendations to 
I 
President Kennedy, he emphasized that "Castro ... had aroused con-
siderable affection for himself personally with the Cuban population .••• '' 
(Lansdale, p. 4), and that the U.S. "should take 11 very different course" 
from the "harassment" operations that had been directed against Castro 
up to that time. (Lansdale, p .. 3). These prior U.S. operations were 
conceived and led by Americans, Lansdale informed the President. (Lans­
dale, p. 5). _In contrast, Lansdale proposed that the U.S. work with 
.... 
all exiles,particularly professionals who had opposed Batista and then 
became disillusioned by Castro. (Lansdale, pp. 4, 10-11); Lansdale's 
ultimate objective was to have "the people themselves overthrow the 
Castro regime rather than U.S. engineered efforts from outside Cuba."
