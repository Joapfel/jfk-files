SECRET 
Talking Points For Use With Senator Gary Hart On His Proposed 
Contact With QJWYN 
1. Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the 
risk of his exposure to his local government and the press. 
Because of his former activities and relationships he 
2. 
might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible 
prosecution for espionage at home from his local govern-
. ment and harassment from the media. 
Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have .. 
· further cause to believe that the American intelligence 
service is incapable. of protecting its informants from dis,­
closure. Contacting an agent.under the insecure conditions 
involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former 
informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship. 
3. Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in 
• liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional 
and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about· 
the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with 
the CIA. 
4. It is possible that the local government involved might 
lodge a formal protest to the-US mission protesting the 
unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee 
· interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty 
without requesting formal permission.
