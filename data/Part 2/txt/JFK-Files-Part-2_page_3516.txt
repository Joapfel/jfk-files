THE PRESIDENT''S ASSASSINATION: 
The Reuters correspondent in Madrid has advised the US 
Embassy that he has been queried by a New York client about 
an 8 December El Tiempo report that Spanish police have de­
tained a Cubannatlonal--45-year-old Enrique Pascual R_uedolo 
GQngora, alleged to have arrived in Spain via an IBERIA flight 
from New York on 23 November--in connection with a plot against 
the late President Kennedy. Local police have confirmed deten­
tion of Ruedolo. However, they claim that he arrived in Spain 
on 29 November and to the best of their knowledge has abso­
lutely no connection with the assassination. They maintain 
that he was expelled from the United States for undetermined 
reasons and is being held because he has been unable to··· 
arrange onward travel to Cuba. CAS is pursuing the matter 
in Madrid. (Am Emb Madrid, 1155,7 December, CONFIDENTIAL)
