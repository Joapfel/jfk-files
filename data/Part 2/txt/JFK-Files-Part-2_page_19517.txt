continued as an independent organization 1 rallying support 
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate 
and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF 
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but 
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky .. 
A source advi"sed on March 2, 196lj that Claude 
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated a,t a meeting 
of the Communist Party in Baltimorej Maryland 1 on February 25, 
1961, that tre Communist Party is not connected with any 
progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence 
in the SCEF. 
A second source, who is familiar with some phases 
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised 
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in 
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of ✓ 
and worked actively in the SCHW; however 1 since the formation 
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not .been encouraged 
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is 
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a 
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along 
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly 
on the racial issue. 
A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that 
George Meyersi a Communist Party functionary, expressed 
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF, 
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view 
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far 
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a 
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,· 
and influence other organizations for the better. 
The second source also advised on June 3, 1966, 
that many people who are officials and supporters of the 
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.
