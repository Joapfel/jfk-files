that W.E.B. DU BOIS joined the Communist 
Party after applying for admission on 
October 1, 1961. 
In May 1963, the first source informed that the 
"San Francisco News and World Report," although Hritt8n and 
edited by members of the club, was run off on a mimeozraph 
machine located in th<:: offices of the "People's World;" however, 
in March 1964, this source advised that the newsletter was no 
longer mimeographed by the "People's Horld" because of the 
unreliability of the machine and, in addition, the name was 
changed to "The Insurgent" upon recommendation of one of the 
club officers who felt the new name sounded more militant. 
The first source has also stated that commencing in 
May 1963, the DuBois Club had no permanent headquarters and 
used to hold its meetings at 307 Page Street, Apartment 3, 
San Francisco, California. In March 1964, this source advised 
that the club is currently active as a membership organization 
and has its headquarters at 1007 Mc~llister Street, San Francisco.
