counterintelligence personnel should be allocated to the 
counterintelligence unit in Headquarters. This 10 per cent, 
~omprising 566 officer and clerical employees, would still 
fall considerably short of our counterintelligence strength 
in the fall of 1945 when O.S.S. was dissolved. 
The Counterintelligence Staff was nevertheless able 
to work effectively against its major targets. The scope 
of this paper prohibits an adequate resume, but there is an 
indication of the results achieved in the fact that during 
the years 1961 through 1963 eight major Soviet penetrations 
of American and foreign liaison intelligence services were 
uncovered and that six of the eight exposures resulted 
directly from CIA's counterintelligence work. Fifteen Soviet 
agents were arrested, as well as more than twenty others 
who were working clandes~inely for one or another of the 
East European services. 
In August 1973 as a result of the change in leadership 
in the Agency, there was put in motion a series of baffling 
administrative and functional changes which ignored the 
state of the art; the need for resolving many inter-Agency 
problems in counterintelligence, and, particularly, the 
need to work out with the FBI in depth a number of conflicts 
concerning the bona fides of sources; the handling of defec­
tors; and authoritative research and analysis pertinent to 
these differences.
