shipborne radio bro~dcasting operations, and to investi­
gate the feasibility of an airborne radio transmitter 
capable of black broadcasts into Cuba.* Aside from 
the broadcast operations, there were a number of ad­

was ruled·out early in the planning stages because 
it was "a terribly expensive operation." Based on

per week·to six selected Cuban cities -- among others, 
Havana, Santiago and Cienfuegos -- over a two month 
period would show operating costs in excess of $83,000, 
plus an additional $f0,000 .for transmitting equipment 
on a C-54, _and a cost of $250,000 if the C-54 were 
lost. 7c/
