Ms. Barbara L. Mosley 
-.-
June 15, 1977 
Please be advised that Ms. Barbara Mosley, 
resume attached, has been interviewed by Gerald 
Hamilton, Jackie Hess and myself for the position 
as secretary/typist assigned to the MLK Research 
Task Force. 
Ms. Mosiliey certainly qualifies ror this posi­
tion, and we all agree that she is the mature indi­
vidual for whom we are searching to fill this spot. 
She has been employed on Capitol Hill for some time 
and surely knows the many ins-and-outs. 
I strongly recommend that Ms. Mosley be hired 
at $1?!0~ annum and report for duty on Tuesday, 
Jun~l977. 
~ 'Tom, I certainly appreciate your consideration 
/.·.-··-✓ ,i /bn this matter. Thank you.
