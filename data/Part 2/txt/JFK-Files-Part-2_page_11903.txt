SOURCES. 
a. ·Except in espionage and foreign nationality matters where frequency 
of contact is dependent on circumstances, informants should be con­
tacted as often as necessary, but at least one personal contact 
should be made every two weeks. If such frequent contacts cannot be 
• established, obtain specific Bureau authority for exception to this 
requirement. 
b. During each contact, carefully review informant's activities since 
previous contact and make certain informant has furni-shed all in­
forma.ti on which he has obtained since last contact. 
c. Contacting Agent should not only collect information but direct 
informant, be aware of his activities, and maintain such close 
relationship that he knows informant's attitude towards Bure•a-u. 
Good judgment must prevail in handling informant to see he does 
not become too familiar with Agent. Promptly advise Bureau of any 
indication informant is wavering in Bureau relationship. 
d. Arrangements for paying informant or personally contacting him must 
be specific and no doubt should be left in minds of either Agent 
or informant as to methods of payment, amount, place, and time. 
e. Informants should use only public telephones in corn.'!lunicating with 
contacting Agent and consideration should be given to furnishing 
informants nonpublished office telephone number for emergency com­
munication. This rule is not practical in a.11 espionage and 
foreign nationality matters but should be follovied where applicable. 
£. Positive. information received from informant should be subject of 
written statement by informant or memo~andum prepared by contacting 
Agent to be placed in informant's subf~le and appropriately 
channelized. 
g. Record dates of all contacts, whether negative or positive, 
informant's administrative file. Memorandum or form FD-209

contacts in informant's administrative file. Place positive informa­
tion in informant's subfile and appropriately channelize same. 
j. Alternate Agent should be designated for contacts with informant 
and should be thoroughly acquainted with informant so t~at contacts 
may be handled by alternate Agent where necessary. 
Checking reliability 
a. Reliability of all active informants must be constantly checked. 
b. Give consideration to use of any investigative technique deemed 
necessary to be certain they are completely reliable and are fur­
nishing accurate, truthful information. 
Fingerprints 
a. After informant has been developed and unless some reason to 
contrary exists, obtain and forward his f~ngerprints to Identifi­
cation Division if they are not on file there. 
b. If informant refuses, do not force issue. 
c. Forward informant's fingerprints as enclosure to FD-165 using 
applicant-type fingerprint card, form FD-258, fully executed. 
Appropriate field office should be shown as contributor~ field 
case file number in number space, and "inquiry" in space for
