Activities--;,• recorrimendedthatthe Administrative Division 
and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate 
response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be con­
ducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of 
Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for 
employees who are called to testify before the Senate 
Select Committee and who desire private counsel. We have 
also undertaken to present the statutory considerations 
governing the provision of such representation in a legal 
proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing. 
Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states: 
11Except as otherwise authorized 
by law, the head of an Executive 
department or military department z-=-

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that 
only the Attorney General has the authority to make a 
con~ract for special employment of an attorney. This 
Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, ob­
viously does not have authority to do that which is 
denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of 
coequal stature to the Department of Justice. ~--.
