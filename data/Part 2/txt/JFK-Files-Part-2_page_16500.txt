' I 
It should be • clear that the police institute w1lJ· not in any 
way benefit the bl~ck. and: Latin con1n1unipes, the working 
people or the youth of this country: will not in any way help to -
solve the · serious problems we face-racial : inequality,· 
imperialist wars, poverty. In fact, by en1phasizing a policy: of 
overwhelming police power and-.~ontinued repression it may 
aggravate the problems. 
We n1ust expose. and educate people. to understand the role 
of this institute and the pigs. \Ve must demand that~this 
institute be· stopped. 
While we demand that the police institute get off the Chicago 
_Circli • can1pus, it •• is not because-·. we see the University as 
some sort of "ivory tower" which must be~rotected f~on1 
war research, military and corporate· recruitii1g; ROTC-:--is 
· as_ .. much a part of the· racist power strllctu_re as any other 
institution.· We want the-vig institute off the campus as a first 
step to stopping it pern1anefitly. If it is moved off the -canipus • 
and into the ,con1munity we _ will . organize tf) stop it there. 
Cur program should be ba·sed on the de1nand: STOP THE PIG 
INSTITUTE.
