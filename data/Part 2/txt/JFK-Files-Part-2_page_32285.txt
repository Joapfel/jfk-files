B. Contigency Planning 
New opportunities for accomplishing our 
objectives may arise either as a result of Bloc 
action in other parts of the world; as a result 
of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions) 
by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a 
result of uprisings or internal conflict within 
Cuba. l 
I 
Our c:ontingency planning, which will be 
undertakeri immediately, should include preparations 
·for incre:ased multilateral and/or bilateral 
potitica_lj and economic measures, large scale use of 
Cubans wh;o are now inside Cuba; more extensive 
air activ!ity including both high and low level 
flights· p'.rimarily directed toward surveillance 
and coll~c~ion .of intelligence, and which may also 
, have the :ieffect of embarrassing the Castro 
'·'gcrve'i:·nme~t and keeping the Castro forces on 
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as 
appropriate, including the imposition of a 
POL bloc~ade; harrassment of Cuban officials in 
other countries; severance of communications 
to Cuba; :major acts of sabotage on shipping 
destined. for Cuba and on key installations to 
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; anc'; ultimately, 
the use ·iof U. S. military force. To the extent 
feasible, U. S. military forces employed against 
Cuba shduld be accompanied by U. S. militarily­
trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of 
those Latin American nations desirous of 
particip~ting in the U. S. effort.
