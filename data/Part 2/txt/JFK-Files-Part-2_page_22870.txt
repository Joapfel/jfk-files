Mr. Bundy. What I recollect about the fall of 1961 is 
this question, what would happen if he is not there? 
Mr. Schwarz. Which would be a relevant question tocBk 
if one was talking about assassination. 
Mr. Bun<ly. Yes. But I have no independent recollection 
of talks about assassination, Mr. Schwarz, and I musn't lead 
you by saying that I did. 
Mr.· Schwarz. In any event, passing from talking about or 
discussions or contingencies, to authorizations for action, 
and specifically focusing on this concrete period, was 
assassination authorized in the fall of 1961? 
20 I Mr. Bundy. Absolutely not. 
21 Ji Mr. Schwarz. In fact wh;it was authorized in the fall of 
22 I 1961?
