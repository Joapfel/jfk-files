The documen

tJ recently received by this Committee!, from Jack 
Anderson, had pr

eviously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff. 
The documents appJar to be a: few of. those requested fcir FOIA review 
by David Belin.1 ·rtl is my understanding, after these dJicuments were 
declassified, Df~fd Belin furnished copies to both David Martin(AP) 
and Jack ~dersop.! . . . l;J . 
The Cnurchi~ommittee was permitted to review the '.entire Oswald 
201 file, the ~SH file, Gp.rrison files and selec;::tedl Office of 
Security files. [tie Committee primarily concerned itsl!l.f with the 
early period of ~he investiglition(November 1963 - October 1964), as 
it believed the information to be received from this time period 
to be more relevkrtt in evaluating the performance of 'the intelligence 
agencies with d~sp

the Church Committee contact at the ¢IA, was the 
individual resp6nsible for the declassification of documents 
re la tin~ ~o t~e I as:sassination o~ President Kennedy. D~~in~ this 
declassification.I p;rocess, Dan Niescher consulted the (fommittee staff 
to make sure thiif. 1we were aw~re of ?e 7tain documents. ~n a~di tion, 
Mr. Kaler as had I g1.,ven the staff unl:1.m:1.ted access to a]l f 1.les we 
believed necess~ryl to conduct our investigation. I'. 
Yet, the po~s:ibility still remains that the staff' was not 
shown everythingL Fhe CIA has maintained throughout th?t the Oswald 
201 file was a. ¢.bmplete comp:i.lation of the material r~lated to the 
assassination o~ I p:resident Kennedy. However, informat:ilon relating to 
who Lee Harvey q~~ald was, and what he was doing are q9t included.in 
their files. The10swald 201 does not attempt to question Oswald's 
connection with lbo:th pro-Castro and anti-Castro group~ i or any of
