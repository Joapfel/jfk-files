became DDP-wide and the DDP hierarchy was opposed to that too. Because if you 
work wi t,h us long_ enough and you don't change these by-1 i nes often enough, 
somebody can sit and pretty much zero in on who the source is. And it is a 
hell of a lot of extra work. Believe me, a hell of a lot of extra work. But 
Des insisted. Again being Des; and then ~hen he became DDP, he put that 
system in effect thro~ghout the DDP. And unfortunately he was in the DDP only 
a short period before he died in July of '67. So when you're talking about 
the time frame of breakdown, it began in '63. Des took that system into WH 
when he became the Division Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division, as it's 
called now LA. And then he took it into the DDP when he became DDP in '65. 
INTERVIEWER: My goodness. 
MR. HALPERN: And he remained there until 1967. 
INTERVIEWER: Gee. That's good background. 
MR. HALPERN: S6 best when you are talking ibout breakdown of the dispute, or 
the fight between the two, there were very valid reasons for both sides to 
maintain the position that they had at the time. I can see their side. 
Having been from R&A, I can understand what their problem was, like I 
understand our problem on the collecting side. And so, but gradually, I don't 
know what the system is today and how it works, but anyway we began to break 
it down, but it took, well, it-began in '47 and took until '67. • 20 years. 
What you've got 1s two different worlds. And this is one of the reasons I 
keep telling journalists who talk to me, we're both in the same business. You 
are collecting information, and you want to protect sources. That's what we_ 
are doing. You do it to get a Pulitzer Prize and we do it to protect the 
United States.
