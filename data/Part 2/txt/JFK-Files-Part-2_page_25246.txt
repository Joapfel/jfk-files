OCCURRENCE: On October 30, 19 , m a 
quotation appeared: " .... We do not accept as a basis for U .s. policy that we have no power 
to delay or discourage coup .... We cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your 
rressage that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention .... U.S. authorities 
will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side .... " ( the IG Report here 
states without further showing the author of the above rressage that "the White House re­
peats its instructions on cormand of the country team after LODGE leaves.

'Ihe inference 
can probably be drawn that the rressage although looked upon as a CIA cable to Saigon, it 
was undoubtedly emanating from the White House.)
