A Huy 26, 1961, memorandum from Bowles to Bundy begins: 
"Following up on our discussion of the Dominican 
Republic at yesterday's meeting of the Special 
Group, I am forwarding you a draft telegram which 
we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our C6nsul 
General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementing the 
guidance he will be receiving on the recently 
approved contingency plans." 
~inutes of the Special Group meeting on May 25, 1961 do not, 
however, reflect any discussion of the Dominican Republic. 
If, as Bowles' memorandum suggests, a discussion concerning 
the Dominican Republic did occur at the May 25 meeting, it is 
not known what the discussion involved or ~hat decisions, 
if any, were made. 
Richard Goodwin personally prepared alternate drafts to 
the proposed State Department cable to Dearborn. Goodwin testi-
fied that it was his intent in revising the cable to communicate 
to Dearborn, President Kennedy's personal belie 
States: 
" . didn't want to do anything that would 
involve us further, the United States further, 
in any effort to assassinate Trujillo."
