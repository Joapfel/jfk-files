Shellfish Toxin. 
By the late l960's, a stockpile of some 15 to 20 different BW agents and 
toxins was maintained on a regular basis by SOD for possible Agency use. The 
supply included such agents as food poisons, infectious viruses, lethal botulinum 
toxin, paralytic shellfish toxin, snake (krait) venon, Microsporeum gypseum which 
produces severe skin disease, etc. Varying amounts of these materials ranging 
from 100 grams to 100 milligrams were maintained. 
As noted above, with the Presidential Order requiring the destruction of 
Army BW and toxin stockpiles, the question was raised as to the disposition of 
Agency materials. Though specific accounting for each agent on the list is not 
on hand, DOD indicates that, with the.likely exception of. the shellfish toxin, 
a 11 of these materials were in fact destroyed by SOD personnel. 
The she 1 lfi sh toxin -- along with 8 mi 11 i grams of cobra venom -- was found 
by David Boston, currently Chief of the Chemistry Branch, in Vault B10. in the 
basement of South Building which houses OTS. This vault is a lightly used 
laboratory area and historically associated with the Biology and Chemistry 
• Branches of OTS. It has been regularly used for the storage of dangerous material, 
of various types. In past years, the combination to the vault had been available 
only to the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Chemistry Branch and their secretary. 
More recently, the combination had been given to other members of the Chemistry 
Branch as well. With the discovery of the material on 20 May, however, the 
combination was changed and is now available only to the Chief of the Chemistry 
Branch, his secretary, and OTS security officers. On 13 June the vault was put 
under 24-hour guard.
