b. The Setting In Which the Assassination Plots 
Occurred Explains, But Does Not Justify Th~m 
The Cold War setting in which the assassination 
plots took·place does not change our view that assassination 
is unacceptable in our-society. In addition to the moral and 
practical problems discussed elsewhere, we find two principal 
defects in any contention that the tenor of the period justifi­
ed the assassination plots: 
First, the assassination plots were n6t necessitated by 
imminent danger to the -United States. Among the cas_es studied, 
Castro alone posed a threat to the United States, but then 
only during the period of the Cuban missile crisis. C ~fo;; s A-;:,fi/c--/ ;-

course of action during the crisis. 
Second, we reject absolutely any notion that the United 
States should justify its actions by the standards of totali­
tarians. Our standards must be higher, and this difference is 
what the struggle is all about. Of course, we must defend our 
democracy. But in defending it, we must resist undermining 
the very virtues we are defending.
