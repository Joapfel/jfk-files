and Services of the CIA, was presenc·ed in court. In the affidavit 
' ~ Mr. Brownman delineated the relationship between~CIA and SAT and the 
_authorities for purch~sing and later selling the capital stock of 
SAT. He also defined the employment status of the plaintiffs _as 
not being government employees and not being CIA employees and 
::,,:- . .... 
therefore not being· eligible for participation in the CIA Retire­
ment and Disability System. 
In the Order Granting Motion for Summary Judgment, the court 
found that the sale of SAT capital stock to Mr. Williams was not in. 
violation of law; the plaintiffs claim to be U.S. Government employees 
and entitled to CIA ret_irement benefits invalid; and that the SAT 
employees were not deprived of any civil right under any state law.: 
.. 
As a result, the action was dismissed with prejudice as to the 
plaintiff. Although this suit di_d cause the relationship between 
the Pg,ency and SAT to be officially made public, it did establish, 
iri a court of law, two points .. favorable to the Agency: 
a. The sale of SAT to Stanley.Williams violated no laws 
and was within the aut~ority of the DCI; and 
b. The directly hired employees of CIA-owned proprietary 
firms such as SAT do not necessarily enjoy the status of 
U.S. Government employees.
