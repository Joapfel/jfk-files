A 2 July 1965 handwritten note apparently pre­
pared for a briefing of Wiley states partially, "Turn 
over any assts to 'B' (FBI) they want - cooperate." 
In July 1965, Mendoza received information from 
Wiley concerning his contacts with the American Security 
Council (ASC). and a mid-W~st speaking trip during the 
period 24 May to 1 June 1965. The latter trip, according 
to Wiley, was paid for by the Young Americans for Freedom. 
Regarding his contacts with tne American Security Council, 
Wiley advised: 
"My contact with A.SC goes back to the 
middle 1950 1 s wh~n I first met John Fisher. 
At that time he Fas setting up the organization 
based on Harry Jung's files. Before it was 
named A.SC, the org. was the Mid-American 
Research Library, and, later, Fidelifax. 
(Perhaps vise versa). 
"Over the years I've been in touch with 
ASC frequently. In addition to Fisher, I know 
J~ck !s~~ a~d Bil! L2~b1~ - both formPr ~kl 
men who worked on the subversive desk in New 
York (and elsewhere?). Ison left ASC in 1962 
to join ~he Hoover Co., Canton, Ohio. My 
last information is that he was in their White 
Plains, N.Y. office. Another man in the Chicago 
office whom I met was D. Alspaugh, a research 
specialist. I have ·no knowledge of his back­
ground. 
"In the Washington Off ice, I know Lee , Pennington 
a friend for years before he joined ASC. While he was 
in Washington, I also knew Frank Johnson (a former ONI 
man?). I believe he is presently in Europe. 
"My first contact with Dewitt Copp was in the fall 
of 1964. (NOTE: During my conversation with Copp he 
told me that the Chinese Air Force U-2 Flights were tied 
in with CIA). I spoke to him about my trip to Asia 
because of his having been in the area and to obtain 
outlets for material. Copp was in close touch with 
the Chinese Embassy, and I think it was Frank Toa who
