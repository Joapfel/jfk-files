Thus, at a·Special Group Augmented meeting on October 4, 1962, Robert 
Kennedy stated that the President "is concerned about progress on the Mongoose 
program and feels that more priority should be given to trying to mount sabotage 
operations". And Robert Kennedy urged that "massive activity" be undertaken 
within the Mongoose framework. In line with this proposal, the Special Group 
Augmented decided that."considerably more sabotage" should be undertaken, and that 
"all efforts should be made to develop new and imaginative approaches with the pos­
sibility of getting rid of the Castro regime". (Minutes of Special Group Aug­
mented meeting, October 4, 1962, p. )*. On October 30, 1962, however, the 
order to stop all sabotage operations was issued (Lansdale, Ex. 8).** 
.... 
* The SCA also decided on October 4, 1962, that Robert Kennedy would chair 
the Group's meetings "for the time being." (Id., p. ) . Subsequently, 
at a meeting on October 16, ·1962, Robert Kenn~y stated that he was 
going to give Mongoose "more personal attention" in view of the lack of 
progress and would hold daily meetings with the working ~roup repres~n­
tatives, i.e., Lansdale, Harvey, and ·the other Agency members. (Harvey, 
Ex. 12, Memorandum of Meet inc;, October 16, 1962, by Helms, p. l). Helms 
testified that he did not recall any such daily meetinrs with the 
Attorney General, but he had the .impression there may have been several 
at first, but then they ceased. (Helms, 7/17/ , pp. 51~-55). 
,HJJarvcy testified that he had a "confrontation" with Robert JCcnneJy 
at the height of the Missile Crisis concerning Harvey's order that 
a8ent teams be sent into Cuba to support any conventional U.S. mili­
tary operation that might occur. Harvey stated that Robert Kennedy 
"took a great deal of exception" to this or\:ler)iriq ril."st, a it~sul,t·~cCqne.
