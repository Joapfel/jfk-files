We are requesting State to· grant clearance for:~-US to conduct > 
.a program to develop sources and info_rmants at diplomatic establishments '_ 
in the lfnited States of the Government of ·the Republic of the Congo 
in view of political crisis existing in that country and,: in view of 
Soviet support and support of other African and pro-Soviet countries 
of procommunist political group in the Republ_ic of the Congo •. 
The Republic of the Congo obtained its freedom from Be·lgium 
in 1960 and since that time has been involved in a political turmoil 
"~. between opposing fac.t ions. The· procommunist - pro-Soviet faction was 
represented by Patrice-Lumumba who was killed in the Republic of the 
Congq during February, 1961 •. • As, a result. of his death, procommunist 
and anti-i1estern ·demonstrations· were ·held in the Un'ited States and ·tn __ 
many countries of the world. Lumumba 's Lieutenant Antoine. Gizenga, -" 
who is pro-Soviet, has assumed Lumumba's position with the dissident • il-t 
group. In view of critical politi~al .situ0:tion existing in the_ Republic~·

. 
of the Congo and the fact that. sovzet Russza and other pro-Soviet ·- • • ; 
African. countries (Ghana, Mali and Guinea) are supporting the -: 
pro-Gizenga faction in the Republic of the Congo, it was believed . :»<. 
desirable in late 1960 that we should endeavor to establish sources in ·f3. 
diplomatic establishments of the Republic of the Congo in the United t>' 
States. Through such sources it was believed we c~~obtain Bi I 
inte l Z i gence information of value to the United States--.Y.J..overnment a,:ui @ \ 1 
be in a position to promptly institute investigation of any matter g: I 
coming within our jurisdiction through such coverage. Both New York ·.~l. ,

and flFO have made inquiries in the past and were unable to ascertain iii 
• ~hat the ~epu.blic of. the Congo had set ~p any diplomatic e_stablishm_~ts

temporary.officejbr its United Nations Delegation has been set up i 
at 145 East Porty-ninth Street, New York City, and New York has .I 
requested authority in order that investigation can be coTJ,ducted to f
