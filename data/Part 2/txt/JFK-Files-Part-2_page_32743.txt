The Report itself did not express a preference for either proposal, 
and indicated there was little to choose between the proposals. Both 
proposals were certified by General LeMay and Admiral Anderson to 
meet military requirements. My examination of the facts, in consultation 
with my advisers, convinced me that, as compared with the Boeing pro­
posal, the General Dynamics proposal was substantially closer to a single 
design, requiring only relatively minor modifications to adapt it to the 
differing requirements of the Navy and the Air Force, and that it embodied 
a more realistic approach to the cost problem. Accordingly, I decided to 
select General Dynamics as the development contractor, since I concluded 
that it was best qualified to design the most effective airplane that could 
be produced at the least cost, in the least time, to meet c;mr military 
requirements. It should be unnecessary to add that no other considera­
