Donner Laboratory people at the University of California, Berkeley • 
entitled "Some Biological Effects of 730 Mev Protons". This may

t-.. Well~ this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons. With 
neutrons there is this question of RBE and it was one of the major 
points of discussion at the Symposium. 
39. Q. Did the· Soviets say anything bearing on physicul maasurements of 
radiation in space in terms of relative biological eff~ctiveness factor 
and implications for future manned space flights? 
A. All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they 
are after: good physical measurerr£nts of radiation of a type th~t 
might be anticipated in space. 
40. • Q. Was there anything s~d on mapping and profiles for space radiation?

h .. 
There was nothing on this. 
Did the··soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and 
components for application to l.ong space flight electronic equipment? 
This Symposium was all biological, so ther-e was ·nothing on this. 
Haa thzre anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding? 
It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about .the 
investigution of dose fields, th-;? radiation of experimental animals with 
·protons of high• energy, implies that they would be· using some kbd of 
shielding to get the animal expo~ed.
