Pro-Castro and Communist elements moved quickly 
to exploit the January outbreaks of violence in 
Panama. For some four months preceding the 9-11 
January incidents, Havana had been increasing its 
pressure on its contacts in Panama to cooperate in 
starting revolutionary action. Revolutionary 
leaders of the Castro-supported Vanguard of the 
National Revolution (VAN) were urged as early as 
the threatened banana workers' strike in October 
1963 to cooperate in initiating an anti-government 
campaign. Planning quickened after the early 
November visit of Victor Rico Galan and possibly 
other Castro agents. Some of the approximately 
100 Panamanians believed to have received training 
in Cuba were planning to give guerrilla warfare 
courses in December and again in May.
