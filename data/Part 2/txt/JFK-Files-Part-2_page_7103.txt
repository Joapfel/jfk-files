had increased to the point where they covered all 
major cities; Rio alone had seven. Similar or­
ganizations existed at the national level, such 
as the Society of Friends of Cuba and the National 
Committee Against Intervention in Cuba. Cuba also 
broadcast daily to Brazil in Portuguese. 
Brazil under Goulart also affordec Cuba an 
excellent base for promoting hemisphere-wide, pro­
Cuban front groups. The constituent congress of 
the Single Center of Latin American Workers (CUTAL)-­
which is planned to replace the moribund Confedera­
tion of Latin American Workers (CTAL)--was held in 
Bl'azilia in late January. The Brazilian delega-
tion to the Cuban-supported Second Latin American 
Youth Congress {LAYC), held in Santiago, Chile on 
9 March, was headed by President Goulart's nephew, 
who brought a letter from the President warmly sup­
porting the conference. Brazil was also used as 
a transit area for some Latin American subversives 
returning to their countries after having received 
training in Cuba. 
In late.April, the dissident Communist Party 
of Brazil (CPB), which follows a pro-Chinese line, 
was reported to have directed two Cuban-trained 
leaders to begin paramilitary operations in Sao 
Paulo and Goias. CPB members have been encouraged 
by their Cuban comrades--many have been trained in 
Cuba--but Havana is not known to have given them 
direct support.

The government of Premier Cheddi Ja~an is openly 
pro-Cas_tro. Thus, Cuban activl tfes ''Iii Br!t"i§n Guiana, 
1.n contrast to subversive efforts elsewhere in the 
hemisphere, are designed to support rather than to 
bring down the existing regime.
