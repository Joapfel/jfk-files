Dear Mr. Miller: 
Oct. 27, 1975 
Through the good offices of Senator Hansfield, we met. some 
weeks Jgo to discuss certain problems related to possib[~IA 
activity in Cambodia. As you know,I am particulrtrly ii:terested 
in why the CIA cannot or w·iLL not find out who carried out the 
massive herbicide attack ;:i,gainst C;:imbodia in the spring of 1969. 
The CIA has under the Freedom of Informntion Act provided me 
with some documents from my file which bear directly upon this 
strange episode and Senator Church's efforts to find out information 
for me. When we met you indicated that CIA activities in Indochina 
were to be investigated by the Select Comr,1ittee. I would greatly • 
appreci:ite kr.owing about when you think this subject will come 
up. I would also very much like to submit some of the documents 
I have received from the CI.I\. and my personal testimony to the 
Committee. I believe that Professor A. Westing and myself were 
the last officitl guests.of the Sihanouk regime before it was 
temporarily deposed. 
I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.
