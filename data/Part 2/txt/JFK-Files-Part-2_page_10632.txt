Director Sec'y_ 
At 11:40 a. m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O'Connor, 
Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General 1s Office, telephonically 
advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more 
restrictive limitations on Committee a~cess to witnesses were not 
successful. He said that the Department liasaetermined that the 
'
procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive 
a request for the availability of FBI personnel for intervi~w and would 
determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable 
secrecy agreements would be reinstituted. 
I asked Mr. O'Connor whether this meant that the Depart!llent 
no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees 
as "demandn situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department 
as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O'Connor said that the Department 
l
would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should 
make all determinations necessary for the appearance of witness es for 
interview.
