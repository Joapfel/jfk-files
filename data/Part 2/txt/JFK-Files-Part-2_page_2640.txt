In Febniily 1976 ojollowing the emergency hospitalization and 
retirement of my (~.i'fy, Subject became my new depllty, a position he 
has filled since that time in addition to performing most of the 
assignments he had been tasked with earlier. His undiminished energy 
and enthusiasm for his work is a hall-mark of his performance since 
that time. Subject has, on his own initiative, developed our referrals 
system (finding new NOC applicants and those on boa1·d for filling 
specific area priority needs) to a point where it is serving the entire 
Directorate with distinction and precision• especially in the "eris is" 
areas of NOC needs, such as Africa and Near East Divisions. Thanks 
to his creation of an orchestrated system of finding and "shopping" 
new-hire applicants with rare skills, we have also begun to serve 
the newly~created Clandestine Corps program with dozens of such 
applicants, in addition to serving normal area division NOC needs. 
As a Branch supervisor, Subject deals with the entire spectrum 
of Branch activity in my absence with sureness and confidence. His 
broad operational background abroad, his near-native ability in two

I became C/CMS on 1 October 1976 and thu• my comments must be restricted 
to the October-December 1976 time frame. I have no basic disagreement with the 
narrative comments but do challenge the letter evaluations. While Mr. Kent's 
performanc!I has been strong and he has amply demonstrated he is a GS-15 level 
ofiicer capable of assuming greater responsibilities, l cannot concur that his 
performance "is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of 
others doing similar work as to warrant special recogn.ititm". On purely technical 
grounds there. is no other officer serving as DC/CMS/NOC and thus the comparison 
is invalid. Secondly, as Chief, Career l'vfa.nagement Staff and administrator of the
