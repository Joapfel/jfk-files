2. The documents shown to me do not in any way refresh my 
recollection beyond the statements contained therein as to events related to the • 
Congo in the summer and early fall of 1960. I still do not have an independent 
recollection of any specific conversation regarding the assassination of Patrice 
Lumumba other than that described in my affidavit to the Rockefeller Commission 
and in my testimony before the Select Committee on September 2. 
3. I was informed by Mr. Dawson that Mr. Robert Johnson has testified 
that he recollected a statement by President Eisenhower at an NSC meeting which 
he construed as being an order for the assassination of Lumumba. After seeing 
the documents listed above I am of the oI!>inion that it is most likely that the NSC 
- . I 
meeting of August 18, l 960 is the meeti1g referred to by Mr. Johnson. Although 
the record shows that I was present at that meeting I have no personal recollection 
of any such statement or order by the Pres idem. 
4. I note that as to the Memorandum of Discussion at the 456th Meeting 
of the National Security Council, Thursday, August 18, 1960 (reference C, above) 
a page or. pages immediately before the second page of the exhibit seem to be missing. 
5. It is my understanding that the six exhibits noted above, will be 
appended to this affidavit for filing by the Select Committee. 
Prepared by me on this 23rd day of September, 1975.
