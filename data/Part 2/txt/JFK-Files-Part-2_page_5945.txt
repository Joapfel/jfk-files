Response.to CIA-IR-11 
Barry & Gary: 
I have reviewed the draft response to CIA-IR-11 dated 13 August 1998 and following are my 
comments and requested changes: 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 - OK 
. Para 2a: EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found.no files identifiable with subject; a file was found 
on an individual with the same name but: with research, it was determined that the individual was not the 
Edward J. Epstein who is the subject of this request. DA searches found a Center for CIA Security, 
formerly the Office of Personnel Security, file and a Publications Review .Board file on subject, as well as 
three "hits" to records destroyed pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The destroyed 
records involved three Freedom of Information requests that mention Epstein's name in the subject line. 
None of the requests were for information on Epstein. 
Para 2b: LANE, Mark 
4th line - Please change Public Affairs to Privacy Act request 
Para 2c: MEAGHER, Sylvia - A reference to the fact subject made a Privacy Act request was 
found. In addition, the Center for CIA Security found that it had, at one time, a folder on subject and a 
1968 Ramparts Magazine article. Both subject's Privacy Act request file and the impersonal folder have 
been destroyed pursuant to normal record control schedules. 
Para 2d: defer to DO 
Para 2e: WEISBERG, Harold 
11th line - Please change Office of Security to Center for CIA Security. 
In.so far as DA equities are concerned. I concur with draft letter once the above changes have 
been incorporated.
