conclusions. 
·Asa general principle, the Intelligence Community should 
make available its records after the passage of a reasonable 
amount of time when current sources and methods would no longer be 
compromised. The American people have a right to assure 
themselves to the greatest degree possible of the accuracy of the 
historical record of our government. The timely release of all 
documents of historic value and importance helps to assure that 
even the most secret programs of our government will be operated 
in accordance with basic American values. Current intelligence 
operations will be even more carefully conducted when it is 
recognized that they will be scrutinized by the public during the 
lifetime of many of those who administered the programs.· 
This is not to ·say that all of the files should simply be 
pulled from the vaults, turned upside down and dump~d onto 
Pennsylvania Avenue for general. consumption. Careful review is 
required to ensure responsible public policy and fundamental 
fairness. Even after almost thirty years, there remain 
governmental interests, as well as individual privacy interests, 
that we must consider. But these concerns must not stand in the 
way of disclosure unless they a~e shown in a given case to be 
especially compelling~
