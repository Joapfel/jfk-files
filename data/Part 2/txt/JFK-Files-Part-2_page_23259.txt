Mr. Tweedy. I do recollect that and you brought it 
to my attention, when you and Mr. Widoe and I diacuaeed this 
a couple of montha ago. t do remember the cryptonym and 
remember generally the circumstances in which he waa sent as 
a aort of general purpose agont to tho Congo with tho thought 
if wo got involved in paramilitary activity he would be helpful 
and he was recruited on that rather general baeia, and when you 
diacuaacd with me a later alarming exchange of cables which 
indicated that he landed running and modo aome rather irrespon­
niblc remarks and we commented on them to the Btation . 
My beat recollection is that in the long haul he stayed 
on in the Congo and I think became, I be l itwe he became a 
somewhat useful intelligenca source~ but Hedgman would 
have a much better recollection of that. But I do remember 
quite well his dispatch. He had been seen.by two or three 
members of my Division, including my··dcputy. I don't 
recall that I ever met him unless I met him in the Congo. 
If I did I just don't remember. But I remember he was asscss1..•d. 
as it were, recruited in the United St~tcs and dispatched on 
a general purpose mission. 
Mr. naron. So, he would be viewed as one of the ~~jor 
aaseto that l!~dgman h<'ld in the Conqo at that point?
