Fraud against Government (FAG) violations 
a. Policy · . 
(1) Upon receipt of information indicating violation of this type, 
initiate investigation under 11Security Matter - Fraud Against 
the Government 11 character and immediately advise Bureau. • 
(2) Investigate and report criminal fraud violation (such as con­
cealment of arrests) arising during security-type fraud investi­
gation on same subject in conjunction with investigation of 
security-type fraud. Bureau will present both violations to 
Department. If security-type fraud investigation. is discontinued, 
handle criminal fraud separately f~llowing instructions in section 
section 47, volume II, of this man~al. 
(3) If admissible evidence developed does not warrant submission of 
prosecutive summary report, submit results in investigative report. 
b. Investigation 
{1) To establish jurisdiction, it is necessary to prove that form . 
was presented to Government agency for action or determination, 
and this should be first investigative objective. If form 
was not presented to Government agency, conduct no further inves-
tigation and so advise Bureau. • 
(2) It must be established that subject actually signed form by 
testimony of witnesses to signature, handwriting examination, 
or other conclusive evidence. Original of form must be located. 
Thoroughly interview any sources who furnished pertinent infor­
mation concerning subject during any previous investigation and 
other potential witnesses to determine basis for each item of 
pertinent information furnished and identities of ot-her potential 
witnesses. 
(3) Where affiliation with subversive organizations is involved, 
interview individuals who were members of same uni ts as sub_je ct 
fer evidence of his membership, such as attendance at closed 
meetings, payment of dues, holding of office, etc. If possible, 
develop evidence to supplant pertinent information furnished by 
current informants. Obtain prior Bureau authority to interview 
subject. 
(4) Interview subject and potential witnesses furnishing pert.inent 
information under oath and obtain sworn signed statements if 
possible. Exception may be made whfln interviewing established 
sources, such as current informants, if oath and/or signed 
statements not considered desirable under circumstances. Be • 
guided by instructions below concerning interviews with subjects 
of security investigations when interviewing potential witnesses 
with subversive backgrounds. • 
c. Legal questions 
If question of law arises as to existence of violation, advise Bureau. 
and hold investigation in abeyance for Departm~nt's opinion. Depart­
ment has no fixed policy as to prosecution in these c•ses and desires 
to consider each case. Submit basic facts concerning execution and 
filing of document and subversive activity denied in report for pres­
entation to Department, even though basis for concealment or fradu 
lent statement does not appear to be material.
