COUNTERESPIONAGE WORK AGAINST THE SOVIETS 
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) 
and its ~ntelligence organs constitute the major counter­
espionage problem confronting the FBI. The United States 
is the major target against which the Soviet espionage

sources in a position to know confirms this. At this time 
52S Soviet officials with 643 dependents are in the 
United States. Of these officials 1L122,::~:\ are known and 
suspected Soviet intelligence officers. There has been 
a. steady annual increase in Soviet intelligence officers
