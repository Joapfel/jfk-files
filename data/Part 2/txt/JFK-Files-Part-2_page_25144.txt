OC~U HREHCE: "Most manif~s!atic~ms of political oppostion," wrote Henderson "were 
vigorously suppressed. Civil 1:Lberties remained an unfulfilled ideal. Ele~tions were 
far from free an~ l!lany of the devices used to stimulate popular support for the regime 
bor~ th~ ~he familiar stamp of modem totalitarian practice. No doubt these moves could 
b~ JUst1~1ed,. at ~east to some e~tent,. in tenns of the overwhelming problems confronting 
Diem dur~ng his first few years in office and also the inexperience of Free Viet Nam1 s 
peo~le with the_ forms and substanc~ of .democracy, but ... Diem had still to prove that his 
P:Ofe~sed_devoti?n to the_democr':t1c cause represented anything more than a facade to 
d1sgu1se 1ncreas1ngly plain real1ty of stem dictatorship." (164-~~i'\

ITLi.li tary authorities and at that tin-e I clid not realize what was going on. They had net w 
the President I s brother, NGO Dll\IH CAN who was considered the war lord, in a way, and some 
decisions were rmde, of whlch I was not aware of (sic). We returned quite late the night • 
the 7th; though I wanted to stay, the MINLSTER OF ;TnE INTERIOR told rre it would be irnpossj: 
I wanted to see the celebration of the birthday of Budda. I wanted to see burnt boats wit· 
the candles lit going down the perfwned river, but it was not to be. The next day there ws.· 
an attack by the military forces on the Buddhists. At that tirre, the Buddhists as an ent '. •• 
was not a political force and therefore thour:J1t of being, and when the attack on the Dud(]}
