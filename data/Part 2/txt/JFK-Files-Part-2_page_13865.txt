RE: MISS GANDY'S QUESTIONING BY SENATE 
SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING 
FEDERAL AGENCIES WI'lH INTELLIGENCE­
GATHERING FUNCTIONS 
Miss Gandy and I appeared before the staff of the 
subcommittee for questioning on May 15, 1975, our appointment 
being set for 10:30 a. m. The group consisti.aj' of Messrs. Gitenstein, 
Epstein and M. S. Talley immediately proceeded to the former 
v Carroll Arms Apartment building which is now used as an office 
building by the U.S. Senate. We were taken to the sixth floor where 
we entered an empty office which contained telephone equipment, 
some chairs, and a desk.

Mr. Gitenstein had apparently drawn µ_p a list of 
questions he wished to discuss with Miss Gandy and he referred to 
this list throughout the questioning period. 
There is attached a rough draft memorandum 
consisting of four pages and dated May 15, 1975, \'\hich was prepared by 
Miss Gandy concerning her recollection of what transpired during 
the interview. The interview, incidentally, lasted until ~~ ~?~ 
0 • .; I 1 p. m. when a one-hour break was taken for lunch. The session 
~~~ reconvened at 2 p. m. and was terminated at 3 p. m. •

~ ~-~ r,)1 I am setting forth hereafter in numbered paragraphs 
~ ~

~ items which I recollect transpired during the interview which 
§~~should be helpful in embellishing Miss Gandy' s :rre morandum. 
~-!;! (1) During the early part of the questioning, Mt. Gitenstein 
~m~1 attempted to draw a chart of Mr. Hoover's office in the Department of 
Justice building. He said he had previously visited Mr. Kelley's suite in 
the Justice Building. His effort at charting the office was poor at best 
and he requested my assistance. A rough chart was drawn showing 
Mr. Hoover's personal office on one end and Miss Mooney's office on 
the other end. In making up the chart I inadventently left out the supply 
room which, of course, would nave been q! ~itt1e or no significance to 
the questioners since this room contained supplies only and no files.
