medicine and that the small amount of arms involved should not be cached~ 
Otherwise the operation was approved. 
Alexis Johnson and Mr. Bundy raised questions of the consequences 
of finding an arms cache or.knocking over an infµtration at the time of the 
OAS debate on the Venezuelan problem. Arg~ents were persuasive that 
we should go slowly during this period. I read from the February 25th 
Cuban checklist of the deterioration of the spirit of the people of Cuba, the 
feeling that we were about. to recognize the Castro govermnent and the apathy 
toward further resistance as evidence of the price we are paying for 
slow-downs and deferments of action against Cuba. I said that I thought our 
Cuban program was in complete disarray. We had no policy or covert 
operations. We now are hesitating on infiltration and exfiltration, our 
economic denial program was failing, while Castro is making significant 
progress. •
