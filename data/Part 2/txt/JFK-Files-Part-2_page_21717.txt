T P SECRET 43 
my assumption at that time was that authorization by Frank 
Wisner would have been all that would have been required to 
proceed with the project had it ever materialized. That is 
the Chief of the Clandestine Services. 
Now whether Frank would have been required to go to 
Allen Dulles, I rather doubt it. I think it is something that 
he would have been able to authorize himself. 
Mr. Baron. All right. Let me ask you now before we get 
into Colonel Pash's version of the story, which we will, 
whether it is possible that you are confusing the time periods 
here? 
So as not to hold anything back from you, Colonel Pash 
has said that the time period has to be off because he 
retired from the Agency, or left the Agency in probably late 
'51. It's possible that it went into 1952. But he wasn't 
with the Agency in any capacity after '52. And in fact, his 
status was .that of a military officer who had been detailed 
to the Agency from approximately 1948 to '52. 
Now does that affect your recollection in any way of the 
period '54 to '55 as the period when your conversation with 
Boris Pash took place? 
Mr. Hunt. Well, from 1950 to 1953, I was in 
Mr. Baron. And where were you from the time that you 
-
joined the Agency until you went to Mexico?
