Now, are you able to testify with respect to the likeli­
hood of the conversation you have recounted taking place 
prior to the 25th or the 26th of January 1961 . 
Mr. Bundy. I would rate it very, very unlikely. 
This is a matter I have thought about since you did mention 
those dates to me. And I would say that the chance that_ 
within the first four days after being sworn in I would have 
been drawn to consider this question is, from my side, as 
near zero as I can put it. I had hcen teaching international 
relations over a period of ten years. I was deeply interested 
in many of the immediate problems, most notably the problem of 
the crisis in Berlin and the concomitant question of relations 
with the Soviet Union. And I was pieoccupied with all of 
the things that happened when you moved to Washington from 
helping the Secretary to buy a house, and working out a 
stgff, and I was under instruction from the President to 
reorganize the White House National Security staff. This 
subject was far out of my mind, and I would not have brought 
it up. I doubt that anyone wouldhavc brought it to 
me in those early days. 
The Chairman. May I interrupt for a moment. 
As I understand yo~~ testimony, Mr. Bundy, you were 
briefed on the concept of Executive capability sometime early 
in 1961, and you can't remember now who it was who briefed you. 
Do you recall whether or not you instructed anyone at
