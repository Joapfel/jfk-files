2. The LIEMBRACES i\rve suryeilled CR~uite of'ten, ~ only one 
unusual contact wa'- note~ That, was a thre hour luncheon with an 
(Argenti ue l e:rti st, Ma.ximcf '$3:MPS0N Grinberg~ _a__fnre-igti corresp.Q~ 
in M~~ico for the magazine Medicg_.Moderno~7Generally speaking, CRUZ 
. . leaves tne --:e:m.7:>assy dtn•ing-tn:i,.-:-working day alone on his errands, rather 
• # than with another Embassy employee, which is more often the rule with 
the other officers. CRUZ us~ goes with his wife on errands during 
the lunch hour or in the afternoon before returning to the Embassy. 
These errands are on personal bustness such as to the furniture store, 
;:;u._per market, optics, doctor, etc; but also on business, such as to 
bookstores. CRUZ' days are very long, as can be seen from the attached 
log. 
3. While Mercedes and CRUZ are very busy and have many contacts, they 
do not seem to make close personal friends, and the persons with whom they 
are in contact appear almost exclusively to be business contacts. The 
Station has been unable to locate any person who might make a good access 
agent to ~UZ. None ot the Station's agents mentioned in paragraph 6 of 
HMMA-38920 were close to CRUZ. The closest companion would be the Subject 
ot 201-860095. The Station is reporting separately on its attempts to • 
develop and recruit this person. • 
i . 
4. The Station has even considered approaching CRUZ' maid, 
especially when it became known she was so unhappy with her lot as a 
servant. However I since the maid almost never leaves the apartment and 
she is virtually inaccessible, the Station has been unsuccess:f'u1 in 
having 8l1Y asset establish any degree of rapport with her, although a 
contact of LITAINl'-2 has been able to engage her in telephone contact 
and hopes to date her eventually. 
5. Since the Station believes that CRUZ is almost entirely 
dedicated to press affairs, and no really good access agents are in 
view, the Station will not make a pf"iority effort to develop an entre into 
CRUZ' circle except via the operatipn now underway to recruit 201-860095. 
It this operation is successful, the Station would have an excellent asset 
in frequent contact with CRUZ f'or a\better personal assessment and . 
1nf'ormation on CRUZ' assignment in t· co f'or the Cubans. Until this . 
type of 1nf'ormation becomes avail.ab e, however, the Station believes it 
has identified CRUZ' role as almost ely press, and we have been unable 
to detect any wlnerability data on,either CRUZ or his wife.
