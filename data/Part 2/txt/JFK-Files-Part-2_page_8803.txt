Transmitted intelligence debriefing reports on Operation 
FINA exfiltrees. Debriefing of Caridad MACIAS Rodriguez. 
On 26 July 1961 MACIAS was involved in an action to kill 
Fidel CASTRO at the 26th of July ceremony at the Plaza 
Civic. The action was to kill Fidel CASTRO by firing 
a bazooka shell at the speaker's platfonn. This action 
failed because of a defective firing device on the 
bazooka. The G-2 had had persons involved; working in 
resistance, tmder surevillance for some time. MACIAS 
was connected with the MRR. A G-2 interrogator said that 
the Cuban security forces knew everything that was going 
on in the resistance movement. They pennitted these 
resistance organizations to organize and exist until 
it was decided to roll up the group. She seemed to be 
connected with AMBRONC-5 (a CIA on-island asset) who 
was arrested and executed the latter part of August 1962.
