supporting the flimsy documentation on 
Oswald handed over to the u.·s. Government 
by the USSR. This would also tend to disa-
vow any relationship between the USSR and 
Cuba in clandestine activity. 
2. Penetrations: With one or more 
exceptions, he stated that there were no 
penetrations of the U.S. Government. This 
assertion flew in the face of the overview 
which Golitsyn gave to us regarding Soviet 
Bloc penetration of Western services and 
strategic deception. 
3. Order of Battle of the KGB at Home 
and Abroad: There are many instances where 
Nosenko's information contradicts Golitsyn's. 
We have concluded on the basis of present evidence that 
Nosenko was dispatched· to the West to mutilate the counter­
intelligence leads which had been revealed by Golitsyn~ 
As to his observations regarding Oswald, it was the Sovi~ts 
who have pushed ·the deception theme to the effect that 
Oswald was an instrument of the military - industrial com-
plex of the eastern United States. This thought was first 
raised by Khrushchev in Cairo in an unusual interview which 
he had with an American journalist. It has since been pur-
sued t,y the Soviets through various channels, mainly KGB,_­
and it is now common currency in Soviet newspapers and other 
media.
