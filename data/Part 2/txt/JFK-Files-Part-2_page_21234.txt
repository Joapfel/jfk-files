Infot'mation set forth above regarding the cases 
discussed in the CIA paper has clearlr indicated that the 
current series of interrogations ·of NOSE!{KO_ in 1967 and 
1968 have been much more thorough and·have produced 
voluminous information clarifying data obtained from him 
in pt'evious interviews., Of particular significance, 
however, in addition to that set forth above is information 
obtained during the cur.·rent series of interviews which is 
completely new., Some of the information relates to new cases 
and some of. it is new information on cases mentioned previously".,, 
. '. 
Set forth below is a summary of the most significant data 
in these categories ,and additional new and confirma.to:cy data 
obtained during the current interrogation., Thi.s material not 
only suggests that the previous interviews were inadequate 
but also appears significant in assessing the bona fides of
