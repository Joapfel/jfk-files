perpetrated by t~ castro regime to serve as the cause of 
!nvaa1on or (b) foment a·revolt Within Cuba which would 
call for US military intervention. 
• . I• . 
f. Engineered provocation would provide greater.advantages 
in control, timing, simplicity, and secu~ity than would a 
fomented revolt. It would be most d1ff1c~lt to generate a 
widespread effective revolt. However, ~he st~ging of a local 
uprising as a contrived incident ·should not be precluded. 
g. The Uni.ted States should: 
(l) Initiate a coordinated program to create a pre­
text for US military intervention in Cuba. 
(2) In support of the above, undertake a fleT.1"?ly 
phased effort to build Cuban resistance potential, com­
menoiilg With th!3~tntens1f1cat1on of 1ntoll1gence collec­
tion and sabotage in Cuba, and the creatiori of a frame­
~ork for guerrilla activity. 
(3) At a propitious time, launch appropriate military 
action to remove the castro· commun1qt-govoniment. 
h. Implementation of the above would involve many 
agencies of the Uh1ted States Government. It would appear 
necessary that one governmental organization should-be 
given the primary responsibility for developing such a 
national plan. 'l'he Joint Chiefs of ·staff should participate 
in the development of this national plan. 
1. 'l'he broad concepts he:i:-e1n and the views of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff should be forwarded to the Special Group 
(5412 Committee) for consideration under the pl'Ov1s1ona of 
NSAM 57.
