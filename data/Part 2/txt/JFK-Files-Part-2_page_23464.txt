It was agreed that the operations in question rrius t go forward and that 
the amount did not seem .unreasonable for activities of this scope and 
scale but it was understood that Messrs. Merchant and Gray could not 
state that they had reviewed in any- detail the manner in which the 
estimates had been arrived at. Following further discussion, it was 
ag1·eed that this matter should be laid before the appropriate higher 
authorities and a presentation would be arranged hopefully within the 
next ten days. This was believed to be wise, not because any actions 
involving major poli ti.cal risks were to be taken in the near future, but 
because the Agency would soon become committed to various substantial 
expenditures which should not be undertaken without reasonable assurance 
that the operation was to go forward.
