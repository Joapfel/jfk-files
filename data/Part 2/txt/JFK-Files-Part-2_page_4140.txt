MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Meeting of the Special Group 29 August 1963 
PRESENT: Mr. McGeorge Bundy 
General Marshall Carter 
Mr. Roswell Gilpatric 
Mr. U. Alexis Johnson 
Mr. Thomas A. Parrott 
Mr. Bruce B. Cheever 
1. Mr. Johnson opened the discussion of the paper 
"Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups" (i.e. 1 Support 
to Commandos L) by commenting that he was under the 
impression that Mr. McCone had indicated at the last 
Special Group Meeting that he would look into the 
proposal further and that Mr. Johnson wondered what his 
views now were. 
2. Mr. Cheever was not able to express Mr. McCone's 
personal views on this matter, but pointed out in general 
terms the reasons why we considered the proposal desirable 
as a supplement to the already approved program. Further 
discussion centered on the question of the use of 
British territory and the possibility of attribution of 
the raids to the United States. No mention whatsoever 
was made regarding the question of attacking Cuban ships. 
After an inconclusive discussion 1 Mr. Johnson reiterated 
his desire to hear Mr. McCone's personal views on the 
proposal. Mr. McBundy concurred and the question remains 
open until the next Special Group Meeting. 
3. Mr. Cheever has the distinct impression that 
State continues to be completely opposed to this proposal 
and hopes Mr. McCone will "shoot it down" for them, 
whereas it is believed that Defense will concur but will 
not "front-run" the proposal. Mr. Bundy appears open­
minded on the matter.
