The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr. 
Chairman 
Committee on House Administration 
House of Representatives 
Washington~ D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I am requesting that you consider authorizing a 
retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counsel 
of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K. 
Tanenbaum.;. Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee 
was erroneously terminated,at the close of business July 31-­
three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee. 
This administrative error was an oversight, which went unno­
ticed until after the August pay period when he notified the 
Committee that he had not received a paycheck for August l 
through 3. His annual rate of pay was .$36,000; therefore, 
the amount I am requesting he be retroactively paid is $300. 
Mr. Tanenbaum was a valuable employee, well thought 
of by the Cammi ttee. I regret the error and am hopeful that 
you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay 
he has earned. If there is anything further I can provide, 
please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to 
this matter is very much appreciated.

Si nee rely yours, 
LOUIS STOKES · 
Chairman
