IX:I .. -,:; =, . •. • Cuba 
CCURRENCE: With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SCJ\ dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no infonnation on 
this operation since early October, was patently false. Specific references made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concernine a report for the CIJ\ which he 
used as a basis for rnemorandtnn dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald KirlqJatrick. This refers to 
-----------a~t·e-i-ephonic-conversat-ion-on-the-evening.-of-30_Oct._l9_62 between Lansdale and~Jre:g~;}: 
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on nages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu. 
I have discussed this matter in clet;iil wi thBTu-"tf&'ifo:rJand clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandtnn. 
D..lring this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a hrief 
discussion of the COBRAltffl\\miW&,fil.!OR,}DJ teams and Lansdale did not ask, according tofimg.l:!.v,~.:E..'.:"Il 
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
--s-our~CE: woulcl logically have led to the discussions at thcttmf ST/\PF: 
of the Matahambre op'.eration."
