A. If Mr. Wiley, because of his talents 
and capacity as a writer-journal~st 
and his considerable knowledge of 
Soviet activity throughout the world, 
is offered a highly remunerative job 
job with a major publication, news 
service or radio chain, Mr. Wiley 
(ostensibly) will sever his connection 
with us and go on the payroll of the 
organization chosen and will retain 
our connection on a purely personal 
bas is. 
B. If Mr. Wiley does not find this 
situation attractive, he is to be 
considered for conversion to staff 
employee, where his considerable 
capabilities could be f~lly exploited. 
"Howev~r, these ideas are not yet at the point of develop­
ment and Mr. l'iiley is to continue to operate under the current 
arrangement."

the Deputy Chief, Security Research Staff as follows:

report on Charles William Wiley which was requested by

after numerous conferences with Mr. Wiley by Miss Finan, 
Miss Mendoza and Mr. Allen. The attachment referred to 
as a 'Contact List' was prepared upon our instructions 
by Mr. Wiley himself and no additions or corrections· 
have been made. It is believed self-explanatory. 
"2. For matter of record, we wish to again em­
phasize that certain items are omitted from the Con­
tact List and omitted generally from the report itself 
for security reasons. These are as follows:
