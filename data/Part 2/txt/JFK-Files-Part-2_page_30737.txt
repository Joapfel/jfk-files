Please pass to .Asst. Sec. Mann from PJ:ri assador Telles: "I saw President 
Orlich and Minister QUiros Sasso on 18 November and conveyed reference position. 
The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government "Was not in-
volved in this arms shipment .. After some discussion with Minister QUiros, 
President Orlich requested that ve not issue license forQMBANG-!]shipment. 
President Orlich ma.de clear be wul.d be happy at any time to undertake 
action such as this if US government wanted him to. While he does wish 
see CU.ba free he inclined to agree with US position Re Hit and Run raids 
undertaken principally for publicity sake. President Orlich's decision 
based on (1) relaization that he would not be doing us a favor and, (2) 
further realization that CRG would be hard pressed to explain such a 
$70,000 purchase of arms if it became a campaign issue in 1965."
