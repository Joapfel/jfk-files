Interview and Meeting Summary - "Victor Hedgeman" 
w/Bill Bader, August 22, 1975, S201 
After an extended tour with the United States Army and 
some education at San Diego State, Hedgeman went to Harvard 
where he studied in the Department of International Relations 
working to a degree in political science. He didn't finish 
his degree but went after being recruited at Harvard into 
the OPC. He then became an NOC in Europe and for a number 
of years worked in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. His pri­
mary responsibility in Belgium was that of surveillance of 
Soviet operators in Europe. While in Brussels in 1959 he cam 
to meet a good percentage of the Congolese who would be 
important in the Congo after independence: Ileo, Mobutu, 
and Adoula. In January of 1960 he became the first Chief 
of Station in the Congo; prior to that time the Agency had 
had merely a liaison service. In late July of 1960 Hedgeman 
returned to the United States with Ambassador Timberlake to 
press for a U.S. policy of political action in the Congo. 
Hedgeman's position was that the Soviets were moving large 
amounts of equipment and manpower into the Congo and that 
something had to be done to head it off. At the time he 
first went to the Congo he was the only man in the Station. 
A year later there were five or six and eventually the Sta­
tion would reach upwards of twenty.Hedgeman mentioned that 
! 
the relationships and staff that he built in the Congo per-
sisted, and that when the Laotian operation started the 
group would move almost intact to Laos. Hedgeman believed 
that the Congo was vitally important to American interests,
