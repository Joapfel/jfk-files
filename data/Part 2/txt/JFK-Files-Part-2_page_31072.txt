4. Memo to Acting Chief, Contact Division dtd. 20 May 1964 
From: Chief, Miami Field Office 
subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray 
Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity 
buildup for Ray in full sv.i.ng. Tad Szulc reporting Hay's war movements from 
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times. 
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez 
Menoyo. Thin.lt's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly 
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's- "war" is little more than e.n 
-.MGM-type New York Times production so far.
