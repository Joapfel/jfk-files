"presumably would be used against key members of the Trujillo 
regime." The m·emorandum recommended that the arms be provided, 
since the fall of the Trujillo regime appeared inevitable, 
and therefore U.S. relations with the opposition should be as 
close as possible. "Providing the arms as requested would 
contribute significantly toward this end." 
(CIA memo, 7/1/60) 
Specifically, the recommendation was to deliver to dissidents 
in the Dominican Republic 12 sterile* ri::les with teles-. 
copic sights, together with 500 rounds of ammunition. 
Paragraph 4 of the memorandum stated: 
"4. Approval for delivery of these arms has 
been given by Assistant Secretary of State 
Roy Rubottom, who requests that the arms be 
placed in hands of the opposition at the earliest 
possible moment." (Id.) 
Gomez's· recornnendation was concurred in by Richard 
Helms, ·as Acting DDP, and approved by General ~abell, 
(I.G. Report, p. 26). 
The kind of arms approved, sterile rifles wit~ 
telescopic sights, together with the statement that they would 
be preswnably used against key members of the Trujillo regime

intended. (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 77). 
On July 1, 1960, a cable was sent to Dearborn by CIA 
Headquarters informing him of ·the plan to airdrop 12 
telescopibally-sighted rifles into the Dominican Republic. The 
*"Sterile" rifles are "untraceable" rifles. (Bissell, 7/22/75,p.69)
