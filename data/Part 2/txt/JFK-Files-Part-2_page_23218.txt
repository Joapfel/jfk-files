restricted channo17 
Mr. Tweedy. Yee, all sensitive cables are sent in 
various types of re9tricted channels I a.m aure you aware. 
22 
Mr. Darono This channel evon more tightly held and 
closely restricted than the normal cablo traffic that would 
flow to the Chief of Station? 
Mr, T'Weedy, That would be a very fair statement, 
Mr. Baron. Do you know whether the cable included in­
structions to destroy it after reading it? 
Mr. Tweedy. That wouldn't hAvo been normal. 
Mr. Daron. Would you aaaumo that on a subject like this 
such an instruction would have boen gi_ven? 
Mr. Twoecty. It would really be up to the Chief o! 
Station, I think. It would be up to the Chief of Station 
what was in the cable and the degree to which he felt he 
needed to m4intain a record for quick reference purpoaos in 
the future. 
J3ut, he was pe~fectly capnblc of keeping A file 
whlcl1 would be acceasablc only to him and the station and 
if he w~s sure of his own security within the station I don't 
think this would have been a problem for him,but to answer your 
question I don't know what Jledgman himself did . 
Hr. Daron. What kind of response did you receive from 
Hedgman or from the Chief of Station in Leopoldville?
