CAR,R.Y OUT ANY-CRASH PROGRAMS ON WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPOR­

Chief of Station that the message had been -"SEEN AND APPROVED AT 
COMPETENT LEVEL" in the State Department (CIA Cable, 8/26/ 60) .

of assurin~ the Chief of Station.that he was authorized to act 
unilaterally in ·a· case where the United States Ambassador to the 
Congo would prefer to remain uninformed: 
TO THE EXTENT THAT AMBASSADOR MAY _DESIRE 
TO BE CONSULTED, YOU SHOULD SEEK HIS.CON­
CURRENCE. IF IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, HE 
DOES NOT WISH TO BE CONSULTED YOU CA"N" ACT 
ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT 
PERMIT REFERRAL HERE (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).

Ambassador would want to .,be in a position to "plausibly deny" 
United States involvement. DDP Richard Bissell testified that he 
was "almost certain" that he was informed about the Dulles cable 
shortly after its transmission and that.it was his "belief" that 
the cable was a circumlocutious means of indicating that the 
President wanted Lumumba to be killed (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33, 
• 64-65). ,•,
