Re: WONAAC 
The SWP specifically wished the convention to 
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete 
control of the female body by the individual female. 
This specific issue, "women control their bodies" was 
adopted by the women's orianization and all other propo­
sals ware rejectedo 
Workshops were organized for each of the many 
separate racial and ethni2 groups represented at the 
conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci­
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by 
the SWP. 
A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop 
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending. 
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the 
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi­
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard 
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups 
all to often find themselves without a voice when real 
issues are involved. 
Of particular importance to the group was the 
La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas 
which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor­
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group 
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want 
children and are forced to live with men ~ecauss of the 
mores of American society. 
Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

The convention adjourned after an agreement that 
an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972. 
This action would serve to keep public attention focused 
on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective 
support from the many thousands of women who want to right 
to chooseo
