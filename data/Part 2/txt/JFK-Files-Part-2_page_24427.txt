At a meeting on October 3, 1963, AMLASH-1 
again raised the possibility of defecting, but indicated that he 
would be willing to continue working against the Castro regime if 
he received firm assurances of American support (Case Officer 2, 
pp. 48-49). According to Case Officer 2, AMLASH-1 asked for 
military supplies, a device with which to protect himself if his 
plots against Castro were discovered, and a meeting with Attorney 
General Robert Kennedy .( Case Officer 2, pp. 48-49). 
Desmond Fitzgerald (now deceased), who was 
-
then Chief, SAS* agreed to meet AMLASH-1 and give him the assur­
ances he sought. The Inspector General's Report states that Fitz-
gerald consulted with the DDP, Helms, who agreed that Fitzgerald 
should hold himself out as a personal 
General Kennedy ( I. G '. , p. 89) . ** 
representative of Attorney J {. ~ ( I I j 
. r, i /," 
Helms testified that he did not recall the con-
versation, and speculated that the Attorney General might not have 
been consulted because 
"this was so central to the whole theme of what we had 
been trying to do ... (find someone inside Cuba who might 
head a government and have a group to replac.e Castro). 
This is obviously what we had been pushing, what every­
body had been pushing for us to try to do, and it is that 
context that I would have made some remark like this. 11 
(Helms, 6/13, p. 117) 
* SAS (Special'Affairs Staff) was the name given to Task Force Win 
early 1963 when Fitzgerald replaced Harvey as head of the covert Cuban 
operations. The AMLASH Case Officers reported directly to Fitzgerald. 
** The contact plan for the proposed meeting stated: 
"Fitzgerald will represent self as personal representative of 
Robert F. Kennedy who travelled to (fcreign capital) for SPJ­
cific purpose meeting AMLASH-1 and giving him assurances of 
full support with a change of the present government in Cuba. 11
