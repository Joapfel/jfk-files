3. I was unaware that research such as he presented was being done in the· 
USSR. His demonstration was a good piece of scientific work, that is, 
his procedures and results in pathological consequences of radioisotopes 
fit reasonably well with our procedures and results in the US. He dld 
not present anythin new in his paper and it must certainly reveal 
tat t ey are a ew years t e in biology and radioisotope 
studies and applications. They are apparently still testing the toxi­
city of radio elements, which we have already established and accept, 
knowing the effects and using them accordingly. In other words, we 
are through with his reported work, feeling that it is completed; ap• 
parently they are not. Else, they don't yet know the toxicity bound­
aries, are still experimenting along these lines, or are experimenting 
to see how much more they can learn. But his paper reveals remarkable 
research. 
Dr. Moskalev understands English reasonably well, but speaks it less 
well. Therefore, his appearance alone at the conference was· even more 
unusual.
