answer questions about it. • 
O. Your government spokesman said-the 
story was a combination of "fabrication. and 
distortion." What h_ai; been fabricatel ~nd 
what has been distorted? •

. 0. The Intelligence .Oversight Board set up 
rn February 1976 reported to President Ford a 
rew mont~s later that they regarded the pay­
