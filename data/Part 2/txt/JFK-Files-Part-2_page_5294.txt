JFK Working Paper - Internal Use Only 
II. Alias documentation and accommodation addresses 
[Multiple documents -- I briefed you earlier on this issue] 
AR.RB staff proposed compromise: 
Documentation (driver permits, SSN, membership cards, etc.l­
a. If documentation c.an be obtained by anyone (pocket 
litter: National Rife Association card, club memberships 
cards, etc.), the presumption will be to release. 
b. If documentation would be expected to require 
agreement of another government entity (Federal, State or 
Local) or private company or organization, the presumption 
will be to protect. 
• c. Items that are considered by the ARRB staff to be 
important to the story, .or that do not fall clearly into one 
of the above categories, will be considered on a case-by­
case base. The Agency may be required to provide additional 
evidence to protect in these cases. 
Accommodation Addresses: 
.. Release as much of the address as possible without 
identifying a specific location or otherwise providing 
information that could lead to identification of an 
individual cooperating with the Agency. For example delete 
house number, release street. 
Aliases [when true name is released] 
If outside of the JFK timeframes (generally 1960-1964), 
the presumption is protect. 
If within a JFK timeframe, presumption is .to release; 
additional evidence will be required to protect. 
Action: The HRP and DO JFK teams will re-review the 
documents applying the proposed compromise guidelines. If 
we conclude that the Agency•s equities can be protected 
under this compromise, the ARRB staff will present the 
guidelines to the Board at the April meeting with the 
recommendation that the be adopted. The staff will describe 
the new guidelines as much preferable to the case-be-case 
approach which requires extensive research by the Agency 
consume an inordinate amount of staff time.
