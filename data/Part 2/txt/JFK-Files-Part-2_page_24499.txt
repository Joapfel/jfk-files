so important as a planned invasion of a neigh­
boring country, and that if you knew at the 
time in addition to the planned invasion there 
was an ongoing attempt to assassinate the leader 
of that country, that you would tell Mr. Kennedy 
about one matter and not the other.'" 
Mr. Bissell: Well, Mr. Chairman, it is quite
