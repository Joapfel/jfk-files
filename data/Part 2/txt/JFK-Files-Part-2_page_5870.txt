• Russ Holmes Working Files to be completed and a 
declassified version transferred to NARA by December 
1998. 
o Mexico City tapes (186). to be completed and transferred 
to NARA by September 1999. [CIA-IR-15] 
• Post-September 1998 Discovery of Assassination Records. 
Diligent searches have been made and we are aware of no 
assassination records being withheld from the Board. 
However, given the Agency's decentralized records systems, 
it is possible that assassination-related documents will be 
discovered in the future. A guide has been prepared for 
those officers whose work requires them to review Agency 
documents and material (Executive Order Review, FOIA, etc.) 
that may be subject to the JFK Act. Any assassination 
records that are discovered will be processed according to 
JFK release standards and forwarded to NARA. A copy of the 
guide is attached. (TAB 1) 
• Referrals not complete by 30 September 1998. The CIA 
proposes that it complete its review and return to 
originating agency by April 1999 all urireviewed third 
agency referral documents which were received prior to 30 
September 1998. To date the following referral have been 
tdentified for possible post-September 1998 review: 
a. Army's Investigative Records Repository ('from ·Review 
Board): 
b. 
c. 
File on Alfredo Mirabal Diaz 151 pages 
SSCI -- Church Committee Records TBD pages 
(to be identified by Review Board staff) 
JFK Presidential Library: 
Records from Robert Kennedy files 1484 pages 
These documents have not been formally designated as 
Assassination Records. The CIA proposes that these be 
handled in a manner similar to the John F. Kennedy 
National Security Files on Cuba that were reviewed in 
1996 by a joint CIA-State-DOD-Review Board task force.
