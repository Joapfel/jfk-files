RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION 
MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF OF OPERATIONS, CUBA PROfWm'S DOCUMENT 
Subject: Justification for US Military Intervention 
in Cuba (TS) 
1. Reference is made to memorandum from Chief of Opera­
tions 1 _Cuba Project, for General Craig, subject: "Operation 
MONGOUSB", dated , March 1962 whl ch requested brief but 
precise description or pretexts which the Joint Chiefs or 
Starr consider would provide justification for US military 
intervention 1n Cuba. 
2. The. projects listed in the enclosure hereto are for­
warded as a preliminary submission suitable for planning 
purposes. It is assumed that there will be similar sub­
missions from other agencies and that these inputs will be 
used as a basis for developing a time-phased plan. The 
individual projects can. then be considered on a case-by­
case basis . 
3. Thi.s plan,. incorporating projects selected f'rom the attached suggestions or from other sources, should be 
developed·to focus ail efforts on a specific ultimate 
objective which would provide adequate justification for 
US military intervention. Such .a plan would enable a 
logical build-up of incidents to be combined with.other 
seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate 
objective and create the necessary impression of CUban 
rashness and irresponsibility on a large scale, directed 
at other countries as well as the United States. The plan 
would also properly integrate and time phase the courses 
of action to be pursued. The desired resultant from the 
execution of this plan would be to place the United States 
in the apparent position or suffering defensible grievances 
from a rash and -irresponsible government of Cuba and to 
develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace 
1n the Western aemisphere. 
4. Time is an important factor in resolution of the 
Cuban problem. Therefore the.plan should be so time­
phased that projects would be operable within the next few 
months.
