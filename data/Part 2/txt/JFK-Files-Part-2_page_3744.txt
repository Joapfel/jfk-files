Reference is made to paragraph C of subject's previous fitness report 
dated 10 January 1963 which is still applicable. During the period 
covered by this report subject has done an excellent job in the handling 
of a significant student exile group which hitherto had successfully 
res_isted any important degree of control. Under subject's direction 
an exile teachers' group reached a high level of effectiveness in the 
propaganda field and was turned over to ano.ther case officer. 
Subject has effectively terminated unproductive operations in the prop 
field (one magazine and a news letter) and is building-up Station radio 
capability directed at the maintarget. 
His high professional standards, complete comprehension of the problems 
faced by the Station and strong urge to win in our strue;gle with the 
opposition make it ~ distinct pleasure to see him take over as Chief 
of the PW branch.
