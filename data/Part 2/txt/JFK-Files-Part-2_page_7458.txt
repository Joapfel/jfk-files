• ✓ 
Purging a 201 dossier fs the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires 
-discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the 
simple distinction between o~cial and unofficial papers; it. will therefore take 
place under the supervision of a llecordi Officer. Purging should be done 
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should 
be purged. • A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments . 
( 7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information 
contained in other documents in the file; a.uthorization for destruction is 
by the Reco1-ds Officer.

over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification 
authority. If the document· cannot be downgraded· the file should be retained 
at the· desk· or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
