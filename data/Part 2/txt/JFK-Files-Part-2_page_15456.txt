It cannot be said with any assurance that a11 of this

~1\N~tions Dele~ation_of each ?f the 16 countries mentione9 above

iliand one additional one is being installed. Of these 85, 31 are in 
~ Bureau cases and four are exclusively maintained at the request of 
the National Security Agency ·(NSA). Vie are also installing coverage 
of teletype facilities of seven additional establislnnents at NS.b. 
-request, which will increase·:our count from 35 to 92. TI1e addition 
of technical surveillances in: instant matter will probably raise the 
total to 1oo·pr more, of which 11 will be.at NSA request. We have 
proposed· that·· in the future we not include in our over-all count those 
technical surveillances which.are maintained at the request of NSA. 
The best way to test the potential in instant matter is to 
install coverage on six or eight establishments, see what we get, 
replace the unproductive coverage with new coverage of new 
establishments_,, and, in general, continually probe the potential of 
this coverage oy changing our targets selectively.
