!:' from NOUrING to IDDGE, that the governrrent of South Vietnam took that period and raided 
~ Buddists pagodas and essentially sought to surpress the Buddihist dissidence. COLBY stated 
~ that DIEM went out and supressed this kind of active dissidence, justifying it in his mind 
~ and publicly as not accepting this kind of dissidence d~ing a wartime situation, which that 
~ country was faced with. COL8Y clain:ed that this suppression only served to adversely affect 
DIEM's image here in the United States and intensify the feeling of dissent within the educa­
: ted class in Saigon and in tre cities, weakened himself, rather t~ strengthen himself.

OCCURREtiCE: Higgins asked Diem in an interview on August 7, 1963 w et 1er 1em t 1oug 1t 
the United States was plotting against him. Diem replied: ~I do not th~nk Amba~sador 
Nolting is plotting against me. I do not think Richardson _lof ~he CI!if 1s I?lotting 
against me. I know there are American officials who are preparing the way in the event 
the decision is taken to try and get rid of me. I cannot forsee the future. . And I . 
cannot believe that America would turn against an ally under attack, engaged 1n a struggle 
for its very existence. But some people are crazy- -and th~ \v~rld is crazy. Still, 
Miss I-liggins, I hope that your government will take_a reallst~c_look at these roung 
geHerals plotting to take my place. How much maturity or political understanding do 
they have- -of their own country, ;let alone the world?" (169)
