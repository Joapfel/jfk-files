The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located 
in Safe# 102095 tn the Reading Room of Room 3381 
of the Committeeoffices. 
About 4:05 P.M. June 23, 1978 Mark Flanagan upon returning 
some autopsy material to the Security room along with Lance SvendsQn 
of Security staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several autopsy 
photos were lying loosely on top of the other books. The photos 
removed were 39El, 39E2, 40 E and 41 E. This'was two pages consisting 
of 4 photos. Photos 39 El and 39E2 had been ripped from .the book. 
One photo 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and laying loose. 
A quick check showed that these photos were from Book Five, Part One. 
An immediate check of all books was begun by Flanagan and Svendsen 
to ascertain if any other photos might be missing. No other photos 
were found to be.missing or tampered with. Book Five,Part One had 
not been signed out recently according to the check out log. 
Both Mark Flanagan and Lance Svendsen stated they would have noticed 
the photos when the safe was open at 10 AM June 23, 1978 if they 
had been lying were they were. They both feel there is no way this 
could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter safe and do 
this. The safe was unlocked but shut.
