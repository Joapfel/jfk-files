Operational Developments: 
1. Se.ven SW messages were received from AMFAUNA-26 during the 
period, and two were sent to her. Two SW messages written.by AMFAUNA-2' 
• no .. 34 and no. 36, have· not been received and it is not known what has 
happened to them. It. has been observed that mail to and from Cienfuego! 
is very slow and uncertain; SW message no. 10 sent to AMFAUNA-26 on 6 
November did not reach.her until 22 December. 
2. A continuing effort was made during the period to activate 
AMFAUNA-26's OWVL and medium speed radio systems. OWVL transmissions

October, ·November and December 1963) and the fact that AMCUTLER-2 was

her SW·message no. 35 of 25 October, she reported that her radio set is 
calibrated in meters instead of kilocycles and she had been unable to 
find the correct· frequency.·· JMWAVE then sent AMFAUNA-26 instructions 
for"converting kilocycles to meters, and began transmitting dummy 
messages, giving AMFAUNA-26 a simple code for reporting by commercial

she was able to decipher.

One package was buried by AMGLEN-9 in Pinar del Rio Province (see WAVE-
5887 of 16 October 1963),· and AMFAUNA-26 was informed of its location 
in OWVL message no. 1 of 16 October and SW message no. 10 of 6 November.
