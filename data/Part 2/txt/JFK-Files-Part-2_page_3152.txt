They [the DDP] would bring a man in, 
and then another man would come in to 
replace him. It was really a tremendous 
task to keep up with it, because a lot of 
these people had. personal problems. In 
some cases they 'would cable and request 
release from tqeir assignment for personal 
reasons~ We attempted to satisfy most of· 
these requests. Herb Juul was the assigned 
Personnel Officer within the project. He 
had to constantly keep a check on the'loca­
tion of our personnel, and when their time 
was up for replacement, he woul9 then visit 
with the Clandestine Services, and also the 
Support components, and give them a list­
ing of the· names of potential TDY returnees. 
The Support components and Clandestine 
Services then provided names of .. people who 
would be replacements. That was a hell of 
a task, now, believe me. When you have a 
ful·l time project running 15 months or more, 
you have people returning on a 90 day basis, 
and constantly·being replaced ... you can't 
expect the greatest efficiency in opera­
tions. 134/
