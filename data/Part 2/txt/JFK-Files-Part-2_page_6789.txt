While we expect that a large amount of material can be . 
declassified under our program, I assume that there still will be 
---- ·- -- --· --·- ---- -- -
- • ·infomuition that cannot be -refeaseci to the public for a variety of • 
reasons, including privacy-concerns or the exposure of 
intelligence sources and methods. Let me take a moment to give 
examples of this type ofmaterial.-Puring.the investigation by the 
House Select-£ommittee on Assassinations, I understand ·that 
security and petsonnel files_ were requested on a number of 
Agency employees.-_ These files contain fitness reports ( or 
performance evaluations), medical evaluations and credit checks 
on individual CIA officers. Although irrelevant to the question of 
who killed President Kennedy, these and other personal 
documents ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of 
documents. l do not ,believe that the benefit to the public of 
disclosure of this information outweighs the. clear privacy interest 
of the individuals in keeping this information confidential. 
Similar.privacy concerns exist with docunients ·containing 
·-· 
derogatory information on particular individuals where the 
information is based on gossip or rumor. Our files also contain 
names of individuals who provided us intelligence infonnation on 
-a...promise of confidentiality .. We would not disclose their names 
in breach of such a promise. Where we cannot disclose such 
information_ to the pubU9_,_Jh.e_ Agency wiH make redactions and_ 
summarize the information in order to ensure that the maximum 
amount of information is released while still protecting the 
identity of an agent or the privacy o( an individual.
