Photographic reconnaissance was unable to detect precisely how many 
ballistic missiles were introduced into Cuba. Prior to the Soviet announce­
ment that 42 missiles would be withdrawn, our photographs bad revealed evi­
dence of only 33. It could not be established, therefore, how many ballistic 
missiles were, in fact, introduced into Cuba or how many the Soviets planned 
to introduce. 
Additional medium-range ballistic missile sites and intermediate-range 
ballistic missile (IRBM) sites were located by high al.titude reconniassance 
missions flow after October 14. Six MRBM sites were located, all of which 
had achieved a full operational capacity on October 28 when the dismantling 
of the sites commenced. Three IRBM sites were located and it was anticipated 
that a fourth would be established. None of the IRBM sites became operational 
before being dismantled, it being the estimate that they would have become 
operational by December 15. 
The medium-range missile is estimated to have a range of about 1100 
miles and the intermediate range missile is credited with a range of 2200 miles 
c. Failure to Identify Soviet Organized Ground Combat Units 
As has already been noted, notwithstanding some reports that many of 
the Soviets arriving in Cuba after mid-July were military units, and notwith• 
standing the evidence of a drastically increased buildup in modem and sophis­
ticated ground weapons, the intelligence community did not identify the pre­
sence of Russian organized ground combat forces in Cuba until October 25 
when new pictures obtained by low-level photography, coupled with a re­
analysis of previous photography, led to the conclusion that there were, 
in fact, four organized, mobile, and powerful armored Soviet units in Cuba.
