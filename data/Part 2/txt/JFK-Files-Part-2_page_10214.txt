hi·s mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Tr:t?t'e are other

in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the 
principal informant.

7. There is .c_onclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed . 
interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good growids.a. 
for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such 
·!ile to the Cuban while she \vas still in RID. There is also evidence 
that the· female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent 
contact with her friend,. the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On 
one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions 
from the Cuban to 0/ S: s principal informant. The informant has no 
knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been 
levied on or satisfied 'by the SB employee. Neither does he know of 
the extent of contacts by this couple with oth~r Agency employees 
except social contacts. •

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied 
with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures 
to resolve doubts about the case. 0/S has followed, the course of watch-. . -~ ful waiting, hopin_g the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that 
would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge
