Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo 
Re: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
We have prepared an airtel to San Francisco with an 
enclosed letter for Mr. Todd in response to his request. We 
are having the San Francisco Office hand deliver the letter 
so that any questions he may have can be answered. 
We have not regarded requests for interviews as 
"demands" within the meaning o:f; 28 CFR 16.22; therefore, no 
release from the Department is necessary. 
, 
Regarding his request for access to Bureau files, 
we have not had former employees make this request previously. 
Our position should be that they not have access but rather 
rely on their recollection. If they cannot answer a specific 
question, the Committee can be referred to the Bureau. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
Attached Airtel with enclosed letter to Mr. Todd 
be approved and sent.
