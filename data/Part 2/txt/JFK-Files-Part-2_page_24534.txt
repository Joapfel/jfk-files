With the scheduled conclusion of that intelligence collection 
phase in Aui:;ust 1962, the Special Group Augmented considered whether to 
adopt a "stepped-up Course B plus," which, in contrast to Phase I, was 
desirsned to inspire a revolt against the Castro rer;ime. (Memorandum for 
the Special Group Auemcnted, 8/8/62, from Lansdale, p. 1). Initially, the 
Special Group Augmented decided against this course and in favor of a "CIA 
variant," at. a meeting of Special Group Augmented principals on August 10, 
1962. (Minutes of Special Group Augmented meeting, August 10, 1962). The 
"CIA variant," which was proposed by McCone on August 10, posited more 
limited actions to avoid inciting a revolt and sought not Castro's over-
throw, but a split between Castro and "old-line Cormnun1· sts." ( Id 2) _., p. . 
The onset of the Missile Crisis caused an initial reversion to the 
stepped-up Course B plan, but ultimately, however, an order was issued on 
October 30, 1962· to halt all sabotage operations. (Lansdale, Ex.8, Memo 
···"\ 
.( __ ) by Lansdale, 10/30/62) 
Thus, on August 20, Taylor told the President that the Special 
Group Augmented perceived no likelihood ofan overthrow of the Castro gover:n-
ment by internal means without direct U.S. military intervention and 
' ... 
that the Special Group Augmented favored a more agressive Mongoose program. 
(Memo from Taylor to President.) Shortly thereafter,. on 
August 23, McGeorge Bundy issued NSC Memo Number 181 to.Lansdale and Taylor 
stating that, • at the President's directive, "the line of activity projected 
for Operation MONGOOSE Plan B plus should be developed with all possible 
speed." One week later, on August 30, the CIA was instructed by the Special 
Group Auc;mented to submit a list of possible sabotage targets they might 
propose and it was noted that this list could serve as the limit for action 
on the Agency's own initiative: "The Group, by reacting to this list, could 
define the limits within which the Agency could operate on its own initiative."
