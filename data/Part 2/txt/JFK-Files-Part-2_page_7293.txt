CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE SSC TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES fOR ITS 
DEALINGS WITH ITS MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFFS. ALTHOUGH NOT FINAL HQS 
BELIEVES IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAT WASHINGTON BE THE PLACE WHERE 
OPERATIONAL DETAILS Of CIA ACTIVITY BE CONVEYED TO THE SSC. FIELD 
ELEMENTS SHOULD ONLY DISCUSS THEIR· OPS AND ACTIVITIES/IN GENERAL 
TCRM~, I.E., OPERATIONAL PRIO~ITIES, TYPES Of OPERATIONS, PARTICULAR 
PROBLEMS AS EVOLVE fROM THE LOCAL OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EMBASSY {CONSULATE} AND LOCAL MILITARY 
SERVICES. IN ALL CASES DISCUSSIONS WILL MEET APPROPRIATE SECURITY 
STANDARDS IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS. HQS IS ASKING THE SSC 
TO REFRAIN FROM ASKING TO SEE THE TEXTS Of OR GENERAL NOTES ON 
INTELLIGENCt AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE u.s. AND HOST GOVERNMENTS SINCE 
THESE ARE CONSIDERED BY THE HOST GOVERNMENTS AS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, 
POLITICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY AND CANNOT BE DIVULGED WITHOUT THE 
CONSENT OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT ■ E2 IMPDET-~
