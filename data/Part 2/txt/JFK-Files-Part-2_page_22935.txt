Mr. Kelley. That's right. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now·,at that period of time in the fall of 
1963, were you aware that through the offices of Ambassador 
Atwood, or Mr. Atwood, as he may i-1have then been called, and 
through the offices of a French journalist called Jean Daniel, 
another effort was being made.to establish contact with Mr. 
Castro? 
Mr. Bundy. I remember the Atwood effort, as I recollect 
that he came to see me about it. I don't recollect specificall 
Jean Daniel, although it strikes a chord as you mention it. 
Mr. Schwarz. What the purpose, very briefly, of Mr. 
Atwood's effort? 
I· 
Mr. Bundy. Well, as I understood it, he had been approach d 
by someone he knew from Cuba and had been given to understand 
that there was interest in, Castro had an interest in, opening 
communication, and he W~!, ex9loring with us whether he could be 
' encouraged to undertake such an explanation. 
Mr. Schwarz. And .'.did you encourage him? 
Mr. nundy. The exact form of our messaqe to him, or our 
if you want to call it, the instruction to him, the President's 
:\ 
decision, I can no longer recollect, but my impression is that 
I 
! 
we were interested, and that we did want him to explore it with~ut 
engaging the President any more than he could help.
