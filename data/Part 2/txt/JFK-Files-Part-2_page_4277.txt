He noted that Secretary Vance does not particularly like this pro­
position because of the possibility that the explosions would be 
attribute_d to torpedoes. While recognizing the validity of Mr. 
Vance's argument, Mr. Gilpatric felt that this risk was acceptable. 
The Chairman summed up the preliminary reactions of the Group to 
the proposals as follows: 
a. The proposition for dealing with selected exile groups 
is a good one, but the method of dealing with them will have to be 
more carefully defined. 
b. There is no objection to limpets, subject to further 
technical studies. 
c. Surface attacks on Cuban ships do not appear particularly 
attractive, nor do shore-based attacks of a similar nature. 
d. Externally mounted hit-and-run attacks against land 
targets appear worthwhile. The operations in this category which 
can be run in May, will be discussed with higher authority. Refineries 
and power plants seem to be particularly good targets. Operations 
of this kind will be especially valuable if done in conjunction with 
other resistance activi~ies. 
e. Internal resistance should be stimulated, again in 
conjunction with related operations.

The CIA paper of 19 April was approved with little discussion. 
The Chaipnan said that his only concern was whether we are counnitted 
to spending money at this rate forever. Mr. Tweedy sa-id first that 
if the Adoula government should fall, it would probably be in the 
U.S. interest to support a successor government in a somewhat similar 
way and, secondly, he pointed out that there are no firm commitments 
made, although of course the recipients do come to expect a subsidy. 
Mr. Bundy said he would mention this project to higher authority. 
7. Final Status Report, Italian Election Project 
Mr. McCone ran over the highlights of the prognostication for 
the Italian elections, as summarized in the CIA paper of the· 22nd of 
April. He noted that virtually all the allocated money will have 
been passed by this time. Mr. Bundy said that the CIA forecast is 
generally consistent with reports he has had from Italian sources .
