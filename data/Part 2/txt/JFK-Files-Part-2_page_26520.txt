arrested some 48 members of the URJE (Union of 
Revolutionary Ecuadorean Youth). The leaders ·of 
the group admitted having received guerrilla 
training in Cuba, but there was no other evidence 
at the time of any Cuban involvement. The URJE, 
however, was a Communist-front group whose leaders 
had thrown off the discipline of the regular Com­
munist. party, and this January the Communists man­
aged to have a URJE convention, run by Young Com­
munists, expel the leaders. They were accused, 
according to published accounts, of having wasted 
$44,000 supplied by Cuba for guerrilla activities. 
One of our reliable sources in the Communist Party 
((a regional Communist leader in contact with the 
Cuban charg~ in Chile, and a member of the PCE 
inquiry commission)) has informed us that the 
next-to-last Cuban charg~ in Quito blamed the 
fiasco on the fact that his successor had passed 
the money to the URJE without coordinating with 
the regular Communist party. 
D. A highly placed Guatemalan Communist who defected 
last November has given us a specific account of 
procedures by which Cuba sent cash to Mexico to 
buy weapons which were then smuggled into Guate­
mala.
