6. At 12:30 I went to the President's office in the Executive 
Office Building to tell him of the information received from Mexico 
City. In attendance was Mr. Bundy. Following this I had a brief 
exchange with President Eisenhower who was visiting with President 
Johnson at the time. 
7. This evening I called Secretary Rusk and reviewed with 
him the information received from Mexico City, most particularly 
the holding of a Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy by 
Mexican officials for interrogation concerning Lee Oswald. I 
explained to Rusk the information that we had transmitted to the 
FBI and to the authorities in Dallas. Rusk had not known of these 
developments prior to my communication with him. 
8. I offered the assistance on the part of Mrs. McCone and 
me personally and also the Agency in connection with the appropriate 
handling of official visitors arriving from all over the world who 
might overwhelm the State Department's capacity. Rusk appreciated 
this offer and said he would call on me. He further said that there 
may be visitors we would like to meet with and, if so, he would make 
appropriate arrangements. He indicated that he intended to avoid 
having all incoming visitors appear as guests of the United States. 
Each had their own embassy to take care of them, however, he 
thought there might be some obligations in which I could be helpful. 
He said that following the Arlington service on Monday afternoon 
he wouldJiold a reception in the Department which would be in the 
form of some kind of a buffet and this would be the extent of any 
planned activities. He thought it was quite probable that the President 
would meet with several Heads of States at various times on Tuesday 
and Wednesday.
