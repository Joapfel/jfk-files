Navy; refers to a CIA tel~type numb~r 7467j of 10 Oitober 1963 
(referring the possible pres~'rice of Oswald in Mexico City), and requests 
that two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald be provided to 
the CIA for purposes of d~terminlng whether hi and the individual in 
Mexico City were~one and the s~me. Enclosure (3Y to appendix C is a 
copy of CIA teletype number 74673 of 10 October 1963. It was also 
obtained from the CIA on 25 April 1978, and is in the format in which 
the CI A has re 1 eased it to .the pub 1 i c in response to Freedom of 
Information Act requests. The ONI ·file on Oswald contained a copy 
of a CNO message with a date/time group of 1020122 October 1963, which 
readdressed CIA teletype number 74673. A copy of that CNO message was 
one of the documents referred by NIS to the CIA on 15 August 1977. 
To respond directly to the Select Committee's questions, the 
reason that a photograph of Oswald was at one time contained in an 
envelope marked "Received 14 Nov 196311 and "CIA 77978" appear to be 
that it was obtained as a result of the request of the CIA set forth 
in Enclosure (2) to appendix B. There is no documentation in the 
Oswald file revealing the manner in which the identification photo­
graph of Oswald was obtained. References to the photograph appear on 
copy pages numbered 268, 278, and 282 of the material that was for­
warded to the Select Commi'ttee. Those documents are dated 22 and 23 
November 1963, the day of and the day following the assassination of 
President Kennedy. The references to the photograph on the copy page 
numbered 278 indicated that,Admlral Taylor, who was then the Director 
of Nava 1 I nte 11 i gence (DN I), wou 1 d 11 •••• requ.l re at 1 east two extra 
copies of the photograph of Oswald, for forwarding by DNI to Mexico 
City, by mail, and for Mr. McCone." 
On 25 April 1978, the identification photogr~ph of Oswald which 
had been mailed to Mexico City, and the envelope in which It was 
• mailed, were viewed at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia. The 
photograph was a 3" x 3" print which was stapled to a piece of paper 
indicating lt had been received ~t 1530, Mexico City time, on 
26 November 1963. The envelope indicated it was mailed, Air Mall­
Special Delivery, by CNO (Op-923M) to an individual at the Embassy 
of the United States of America, Mexico City, and was postmarked on 
23 November 1963. (In 1963, Op-923M was the administrative code for 
the General Services Branch, Administrative Division, ONI.)
