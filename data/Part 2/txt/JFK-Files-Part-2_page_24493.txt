The effort would have been to hold to the 
absolute minimum the number of people who knew 
that the President had been consulted, had been 
notified and had given, perhaps only tacitly, 
his authorization." (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 5-6). 
However, Bissell testified that Dulles never told him he had briefed 
President Kennedy and he did not recall asking Dulles. (Bissell, 6/9/75, 
p. 34; 6/11/75, p. xx; 7/17/75, p. 27). In contrast, Bissell testified that 
on certain other occasions, Dulles had mentioned that a "circumlocutious" '--~l-~J 
~-vvr­
approach had been used to brief President Eisenhower on sensitive subjects Tf(L. 
(Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 10-14). Bissell also said that he never asked to 
what degree Dulles had advised Mc.George Bundy, Special Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs, of the assassination plot. (Bissell, 
6/9/75, p. 34). 
b. BISSELL TESTIFIED HE DID NOT INFOR."1 THE PRESIDENT OR WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS OF THE ONOOING ASSASSINATION PLOTS. 
When asked if he had infonned anyone outside the CIA that an effort to. 
assassinate Fidel Castro was underway~ Bissell stated, "not to my recollection." 
He added that he :was not told that any Administration official had been rnade 
aware of such efforts. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 28-30). 
After the change of Administrati9n, McGeorge Bundy was the White House 
official who was the liaison with Bis_sell concerning Cub_a and in general was 
the principal White House official responsible for CIA matters (Bissell, 6/9/75, 
p. 16). Bundy was a former student of Bissell's at Yale and they were personal 
friends (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 28). Bissell testified that he did not tell Bundy 
about the ongoing Castro assassination plots (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 28-29; ?/22, 
p. 31), and Bundy confirmed this (Bundy, p. 41).
