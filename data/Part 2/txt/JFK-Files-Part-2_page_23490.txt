Re: DELETION IN SPECIAL GROUP MINUTES OF NOVEMBER 3, 19SO 
Date: July 7, .1975 
In a phone 6onversation with Jim Wilderotter of the White House, 
Wilderotter assured me ai that after the line ''beyond our£~ capabil­
ities" ori page 3, there was a double space followed by 
Item 2, which deals with the African continent (not Congo), 
followed by a double space, then Item 3, which deals 
with Southeast Asia. 
Wilderotter assured me that neither item related to 
our inquiry. He said that there was nothing deleted on 
page 3 that related to KCuba.
