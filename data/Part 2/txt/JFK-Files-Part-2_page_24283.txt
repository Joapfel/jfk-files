the current written policy of the Agency that "to the degree that 
domestic proprietary or cover companies are required, a clear 
justification will be developed as to the relationship of their 
support of our overseas operations." 
In the one area of continuing large-scale activity, the 
investment complex, the Director has moved to insure propriety 
even in an area where there is no evidence that any illegal con­
duct has occurred. The current policy, established as of 
June 1975 is: 
Project MHMUTUAL will be operated in conformance with 
appropriate legal restrictions. Arrangements are being 
made· for the briefing of the appropriate Congressional 
committees. Particular attention will be given to 
avoiding any possible conflict of interest situations 
with firms with which the Agency has contracts. Parti­
cular concern will also be exhibited over possible 
improper influence on the stock market or stock dealings 
through the investments involved in MHMUTUAL. 
The Committee is mindful of the potential danger inherent in such 
operations. Therefore, it recormnends that the review of this 
and other similar projects by the appropriate oversight Committees 
be stringent in the extreme. 
The disposal of proprietaries has also generally proceeded 
along legal and ethical lines with more than due concern for con­
flicts of interest. Most notable in this spectrum of actions was 
the degree to which the Agency tried and did in fact avoid any 
conflicts of interest when it sold off.Southern Air Transport. 
Such internal vigilance no doubt should and will continue. More­
over, with the establishment of .a permanent oversight committee, 
the CIA's job in this regard will be made easier because it will 
be able to report on its dealings on a regular basis and avoid 
criticism.
