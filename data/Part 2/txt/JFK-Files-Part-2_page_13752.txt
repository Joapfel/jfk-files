NOTE: According to referenced communication, Mr. Doar requested 
to review a communication he caused to be sent while in the Department 
asking for information concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic 
Party Delegation. The Deputy Attorney General had asked that the 
documentation concerning the request and our response be located and 
furnished to him. The Department also asked our views as to whether 
he should be given access to or delivered the documents for the purpose 
of refreshing Doar's recollection.
