who later became the Washington Post guy. Pincus and Paul <I am trying to 
remember what the first name of Paul was> but we always regarded them Pincus 
and Paul: P squared. 
INTERVIEWER: That is P-A-U-L? 
MR. HALPERN: P-A-U-L, yes. And they were problem children in terms of having 
to advise the field; the State Department had a similar problem advising the 
Embassies on how to handle these guy~ and how to brief them, what to brief 
them. We weren't trying to hide anything, or kid them or lie to them or 
anything like that, but_ it was a matter of how·you really work with these 
people to try to get them to understand what you are trying to do: These guys 
were always traveling around Southeast Asia, in particular, and it was mostly 
during the Vietnam War problem .. And the second team <we called them L&Ms> 
first the L stood for-·Loweristein was th_e L <and I'll be damned if I can 
think of what the Mwas>. But I think in looking into.The New York Times in 
1973 and 1974 long before the Watergate thing and the Church Committee 
business began, these guys were always floating around as Congressional 
staffers. I forget if they were the Senate or the House but anyway they had 
these two teams which were real:problems in terms of the Executive branch of 
the government having to deal with the Congressional branch of the 
government. The old conflict of foreign policy that lives in the 
Constitution. I think the Constitution was made that way, to. have the 
stresses and strains that we still see today. 
INTERVIEWER: Were these teams looking at the ·domestic? 
MR. HALPERN: No, no. This· was al 1 foreign. 
INTERVIEWER: Oh, a 11 foreign. 
MR. HALPERN: They were a 11 looking at foreign at that point.
