ing the Cuban sugar industry. The study examines the world 8 
sugar market and the vulnerabilities of Cuba 1 s sugar industry, 9 
and proposes a phased lnteragency program which would: 10 
a. Initially reduce Cuban sugar production by 11 
approximately 30 per cent from the anticipated 1966 12 
production level. 13 • 
b. Expand US ifffluence in the world sugar market lh 
by assignment of quotas and other actions to insulate 15 
the free market from the effects of Cuban sugar losses. 16 
3. Apart from economic measures, the proposals made in 17 
the study are within existing or attainable military capa- 18 
bilities 0 Se~eral actions are proposed. Key among these 
is the introduction into Cuba of Bunga, a plant P?-l"3site 
against sugar cane. It appears feasible to introduce
