National Security Council on serious interagency problems which 
have a direct bearing on the plans and capabilities of the 
Communist Bloc and involve the more sensitive operations of 
counterintelligence. Alternatively, consideration could be 
given to the responsibilities of the Chairman of PFIAB, which 
might be enlarged to satisfy this need.
