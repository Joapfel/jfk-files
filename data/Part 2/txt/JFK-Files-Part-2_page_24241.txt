At the time of this 1970 review by the IG, MHMUTUAL held a 
surplus of $9 million. It also earned income from sources sup­
ported by public taxation. It appears from the questions that . 
were raised at the time about briefing congressional committees 
on MHMUTUAL that this was not done, providing a situation where 
an organization with assets of $30 million has been created and 
was operating without oversight knowledge or approval. Moreover, 
because MHMUTUAL was no ~onger a project after its removal from 
the Domestic Operations Division, there was no annual allotment 
and no annual operational review. 
Houston indicated that MHMUTUAL had been operating "before 
we told our committees any detail. I think it was mentioned as 
a problem that we had to make arrangements to cope with insurance 
.. 
problems fairly early on. But the fact that it was a business 
and a business of this substance was not done for some time. My 
recollection is there was not deliberate avoidance; we just didn't 
get to it.

• On the question of lack of annual project review, 
Houston commented that this was "technically correct." But, he 
added, 
As a ~atter of practice I would say that MUTUAL was 
more carefully reviewed in some respects than almost 
any other project in the Agency in the sense that we 
had the bookkeeper inside the project who was a finance 
officer and bookkeeper. The project published at least 
monthly reports in detail which went not only to me but 
to Colonel (L.K.) White (the Comptroller) and the 
Director. These were very detailed reports which often 
raised questions which went back for answers.
