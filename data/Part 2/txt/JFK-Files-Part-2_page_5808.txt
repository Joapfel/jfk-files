EXDIR Declaration Signature, 23 September 1998 
Memorandum for the Record: 
This is to confirm that I replaced the first page of the ExDir's signed JFK Declaration, dated 23 
September, with letterhead st.ationery to assure that the statement was comparable.to that signed 
by Mr. Cohen, as earlier requested by the Board Chairman. The wording of the decl.BT"ation was 
unchanged; only the letterhead stationery was changed. I called Michelle in the EXDIR's Officer to 
confirm that the Executive Director would have no problem with such a change (simply rep-laci~-g 
the first page). She called back, saying that she had asked Mr. Carey, and he had no problem with 
this change. 
Mr. Harrelson of this office will be hand carrying the EXDIR's declaration to the Board today, At the 
same time, and in accordance with my agreement with Chairman Tunheim of yesterday, Mr. 
Harrelson will be retrieving the earlier declaration signed by Mr. Cohen, the DCI letter of 16 
September, both of which are being withdrawn. The Judge Tunheim also agreed yesterday that 
since the EXDIR had agreed to sign the declaration that there will no longer be a need for the critical 
language in their report on this issue.
