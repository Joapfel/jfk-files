WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

Director of Central Intelligence 
Central Intelligence Agency 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Mr. Colby: 
On May 27 and June 2, the Senate Select Committee informed 
the Central Intelligence Agency of the Committee's plans 
for examining the field of foreign intelligence and the 
subject of covert action. In the area of the domestic 
activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Select 
Committee intends to address a wide range of issues, 
including the domestic aspects of CIA's foreign operations. 
The Committee intends to approach the issues of the CIA's 
domestic activities with a broad perspective, realizing, 
as I am sure you agree, that thi threats to United States 
security and the need to protect sources and methods of 
intelligence, as well as CIA installations and personnel, 
cross our national borders. 
Basically, the subjectsof investigation fall into the 
following fi've headings: 
1. Counterintelligence activities at home and those 
counterintelligence activities abroad which involve 
American ~itizens, including activities undertaken 
pursuant to the Director's authority to protect intel­
ligence sources and methods. 
2. Foreign intelligence activities at home and those foreign 
intelligence activities abroad which involved American 
citizens. 
3- The domestic ocerations of the CIA undertaken in sup­
port of activii!es abroad.
