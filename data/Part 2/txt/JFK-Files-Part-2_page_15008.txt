FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY 
LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965 
The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins 
Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement 
officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from 
5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and 
Thailand). (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the 
graduating class of the 75th Session of the, National Academy on 
May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General.) 
On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum 
to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National 
Academy representatives be included under the La,v Enforcement 
Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance 
in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI 
National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence 
on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that 
indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Act. The Director pointed out that while 
we anticipate .having a continuing demand and desire to attend this 
Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the 
allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act. 
It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966, 
that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus 
the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates 
it would be unnecessary at this tin1e to be concerned about sub­
sistence aid. , 
It was estimated that approximcitely $80, 000 for , 
subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and 
that it ,vould vary so1ne,vhat for each class and that if the Acting 
Attorney General approved this concept, the Director stated a 
request for a grant would be submitted on proper docu1nents to 
the Office of La,v Enforcement Assistance .
