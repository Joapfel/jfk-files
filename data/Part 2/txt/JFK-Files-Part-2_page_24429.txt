AMLASH-1 also requested high-powered rifles 
and grenades (Case Officer 2, Il· Tr). A memorandum by Case 
Officer 2, dated November 18, 1963, states: 
"C/SAS (Fitzgerald) approved telling AMLASH-1 he would

AMLASH-1 was told on November 22, 1963, that the cache would be 
dropped in Cuba (Case Officer 2, p. 92). 
(2) -The Poison Pen De¥ice 
On November 22, 1963, Case Officer 2 met with 
AMLASH-1 in a foreign capital, offered him a ball-point pen rigged 
with a hypodermic needle, and suggested that Blackleaf 40 would be

The needle was designed to be s'o fine that the victim would not 
notice its insertion (Case Officer 2, p. 103),

of a sort that AMLASH-1 might reasonably have been ex­
pected to have devised himself." ( I. G. , p. 92)
