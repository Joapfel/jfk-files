The ARRB staff disagrees with the Board ori this issue and will recommend that the release date remain 2017. However, they are not 
confident that the Board will accept their recommendation and has.requested the Agency's position on the 2010 date. If the Agency 
opposes the 2010 change in the date, I will need a memo from the DO explaining why. We could offer a compromise--accept the 2010 
date provided the Agency has the same right in 2010 as 2017 tci review and appeal thnelease of the records. I have ask OGC for a legal 
opinion. Please riote that this decision iiffects only those documents designated aNBR" by ARR.B. The documents declared to be
