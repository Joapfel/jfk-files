Re: REQUEST BY U. S. SENATOR WALTER F. 
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
MID✓.IBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES 
The Senator rais_!3d a question concerning_a folder on the 
Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (6~-108230-1) 
and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I 
determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September, 
1964, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he 
felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised 
Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of his in the newspaper field .
