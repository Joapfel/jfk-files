1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement 
was reached that the ~OFIRM relationship with her wuld be terminated. 
A memorandum of contact (t4YM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached 
herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No admin­
istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters

was formally terminated once before (1966). Her file can be retired, 
again, and this time presumably will be the last time. 
2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 nolds no ill­
will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship 
with WOFIRM anymore. • 
3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time 
to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the , 
meeting to wish the writer a pl~asant Easter, as she had forgotten· 
to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal 
contact.
