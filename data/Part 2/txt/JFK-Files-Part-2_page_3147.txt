would be transferred to the project Table 
of Organization, effective the beginning 
of the first pay period in July 1960. 
Employees on detail to the ·project from 
the Clandestine Services offices will not 
be transferred since DDP considers them 
temporary assignments with the personnel 
returning to their parent office when the 
project is completed. Colonel White 
pointed out, that although DDS personnel 
would be transferred to the project, there­
by relieving slots in the various DDS ele­
ments, each office head should keep in 
mind that his employees will·be returning 
to him, and he should plan accordingly. 126/ 
Colonel White's comments are quite understandable 
in view of the fact that of 104 personnel·· on duty with 
JMATE on 7-8 June 1960, only 32 were Clandestine Serv­
ices careerists; and excepting a few with DOI career 
designations, the bulk of the personnei were Support 
careerists. By 14 June 1960, Colonel King was appeal-
ing to the DDP for an increment which would bring 
total JMATE personnel to 234, including 131 employees 
who were to be in the field. Apparently, however, 
the Deputy Director for ;Plans approved a-·. total ceiling 
of only 158 staff personnel by the end of June 1960; 
and .. in August of 1960, Chief, WH Division forwarded 
a revised staffin·g guide, calling for a total of 274 
positions and requesting that "as soon after 15 August 
as is possible, a total of 40 additional staff personnel"
