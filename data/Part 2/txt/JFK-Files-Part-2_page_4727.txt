INTERVIEWER: I think so. Okay. How about moving towards the Hearings. One 
writer said about Mr. Colby that Mr. Colby believed salvation for the Agency 
lay in cooperation with the investigations, while other intelligence 
professionals thought intelligence secrets were forever. 
MR. HALPERN: I'm with the second group. 
INTERVIEWER: You are with the second gro~p. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah. And I will refer you to Colby's own book in which he says 
-- t~is is before the Church Committee was created -- January the 15th, 1975. 
Colby went to testify in public before the, I think it was the Armed Services, 
it might have been Appropriation1. I forget now. I think it was Russell or 
Vinson, I forget the exact person. But anyway, and he says in his book after 
he testified, after he testified in which he exposed for the first time, even 
though the law didn't require him to do that,·by the law, as a matter of fact, 
you're supposed keep secret the organizational structure and breakdown of 
CIA. Colby blew it for the first time, exposed the whole organizational 
structure in public and went far beyond even that for the first time in public

his office in Langley, it suddenly dawned on him that he might stop off at the 
White House and alert them to what he has.just done so that the news doesn't· 
hit them cold. And in my book, that in effect damned the hell out of Bill 
Colby. Because as a serving.officer, as .a serving DCI, his first port of call 
even before he went near the Hill would have been to go into the P-resident's 
office, I don't care who the President is, his boss and say, "Boss, this is 
what I've been ask~d to do, lhis is what I intend to do. Is it okay with 
you?" He never did. By the time it got to the White House, it was too late
