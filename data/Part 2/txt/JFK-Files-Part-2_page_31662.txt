PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY ( PLP) 
PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT (PLM) 
A source advised on Apr11, 20, 1965, that the PLP, 
formerly known as the PLM, held its first national convention 
April 15-18, 1965, at Ne~ York City, to organize the PLM into a 
PLP. The PLP will have as its ultimate objective the establish­
ment of a militant working class movement based on Marxism-Leninism. 
"The New York Times," City Edition, Tuesday, April 20, 
1965, page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary 
socialism" was formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the name 
of the PLP. The PLP was described as an outgrowth of the PLM. 
Its officers were identified as MILTON ROSEN, New York~President, 
and WILLIAM EPTON of New York and ~ORT SCHEER of San Francisco, 
Vice Presidents. A 20-member National Committee was elected 
to direct the party until the next convention. 
According to the article, "The Progressive Labor Movement 
was founded in 1962 by Mr. ROSEN and Mr. SCHEER after they were 
expelled from the Communist Party of the United States for asserted­
ly following the Chinese Communist 1-ine." 
The PLP publishes the "Marxist-Leninist Quarterly," a 
theoretical magazine; "Progressive Labor," a monthly magazine; 
"Challenge," a New York City newspaper; and "Spark," a West Coast 
newspaper. 
The June 1, 1965, issue of "Challenge," page 6, states 
that "This paper is dedicated to fight for a new way of life -
where the working' men and women own and control "their homes, 
factories, the police, courts, and the entire government on every 
level." 
The source advised that the PLP utilizes the address of 
General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn 1, New York, but also utilizes 
an office in Room 622, 132 Nassau Street, New York City, where 
PLP publications are prepared.
