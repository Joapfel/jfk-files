Invcs·'.:-igation. 'i'his use need no-ti be limited to the dev·eloprnent of

connec"tio:1 with :i.nternal sec·:.:.rity matters equally as impo:::-tant as 
~he chty of developin 6 evici.8r:,ce for presentation to the courts an.d 
. the national secu.~ity requires that the FBI be able to use microptcne 
, surveiJJ_.?..nce for the proper discharge of both of such functions. 
The v::::partment of Justice ap;,2·m.res the use of microphone sur--.-,-eillance 
. by t}:ie .?Br under these circu::1stznces and for these purposes. 
T do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court. 
in Irvine v. Califo:cnia, s1.m1·a, requires a different course~ That 
catieisreadily cli.st:inguisha'ole on :Lts f D..ctso The language of the 
Court, ho~;rever, indicates .certain uses of r:iic:cophones which it would 
be well to avoid:, if pos!3i'ole, even in internal security invE:stiE;c.­
tions., It is quite clea2· that in the Irvine case the Justices of the 
Sup:..~e:r.-.c Court we:r-e outraged by what they regarded a.s the ind.ecency of 
installine t m:icropho~e in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization 
of su<:h rr.eJvhods of .investigation in a gambling case as shocking,. The 
Court' 8 action is a clear inciicat:i.on of tqe need for discretion G.:."1d 
intelligent rest:r<1int in the use of microphones by the FBI :in all 
cases, :i.nclud:i.ng internal security matters. Obviously, the installa­
tion of a rricrcphone in· a bedroom or ir. some comparably intimate 
location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however, 
that in~portant i-:yt,ellisence or- evidEnce relating to ~;:::~t~_qr_CrJnnected 
with the na.tio:ial. secu:::-ity ca.."1 only be obtained by the instal1.ation of 
a ip.5.crophone in such a l"oca.t:i.0~1. It is Trr'J opinion. that under such 
ci:!'Cl'['[::3tc...'1CeS the i:1stallatio::i is proper and is. not proh\b:i,ted by the··r
