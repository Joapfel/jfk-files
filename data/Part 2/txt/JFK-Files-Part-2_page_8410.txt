23. Telephone contacts: 
( 
Cruz receives and makes many long distance phone calls 
at his home. Calls crone in from Havana, the Cuban 
Mission in New York, and from cultural/press contacts 
throughout Mexico. This was quite true during the 
pre-Olympic season when the Cubans had many cultural 
affairs {dance teams, art, etc.) circulating around 
Mexico. Now the calls mainly concern press matters. 
He calls the Cuban Missions in Canada and New York 
re purchases they are making for him. Also calls Havana 
and they call him at home. 
24. Tobacco: 
• Mercedes used to smoke "KOOL" cigarettes when she 
was in Paris. 
As of November 1970 it does not appear either smoke now.

25. Alcohol: 
March 1968 Mercedes said Cruz was drunk the previous 
night. No more details. (LISAMPAN/BAKER). 
LITAINT-2 reports Cruz cannot hold liquor, but insists 
on drinking cognac. (November 1970) Gets drunk 
occasionally. 
26. Eating habits: 
15 August 1968: Cuban maid said Mercedes and Cruz I 
eat very little ordinarily. They prepare barely 1· 
enough so nothing is left over, and a last minute guest 
is a problem. Insinuation is that Mercedes is very 
tight.
