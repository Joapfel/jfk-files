the floorboards. When he got on those highways he was 
murder. This is what always made me think somewhere 
during those weekends he must have seen Bobby, because 
he came in all charged up. I asked him over and over 
again, not just once but several times, where the heck 
is this pressure corning from? I don't see it myself 
except through you. He said "It's corning from high 
places." He never said Bobby. It's corning from 
outside the agency, and Des is an honest guy, I can't 
say he's making this up. Why would he be doing that? 
So I have to assume he's getting it from somebody who's 
got the authority to tell him, without going through 
the chain of command. It's a surmise on my part; I 
can't prove it. 
BL: Who up the chain of command knew about Charley and 
Bobby? 
SH: Carter. Marshall Carter, the DDCI. 
BL: And that was all? 
SH: As far as I know. Helms never knew. I know that much. 
MW: Fitzgerald? 
SH: No. It was all over by then. Charley's activities 
stopped after the Missile .Crisis. 
MW: Ok, ok. Fitzgerald didn't come in until 1963. 
SH: January 1963. 
MW: McCone? 
SH: Unless Carter told him. 
MW: Why would Carter be in the loop and not McCone? 
SH: I don't know. I'm looking at Angie Novella's logs, 
that's the only way I know Carter's in the loop. It 
says Carter, right there.
