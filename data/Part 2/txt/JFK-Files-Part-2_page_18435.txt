Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
On basis of foregoing request, Phillips 
telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz 
who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested 
withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from 
Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2) .. Mintz asked 
that Phillj._ps _touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence. 
In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building, 
Deputy AD T.~ Leavitt concurred with Mintz. At about 5::30 p.m., 
7 /22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phill.ips as 
indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not ~or (3) at 
this ti~e-. Arrangements were then made for interview of 
Shea morning of 7/23/75. 
Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported 
separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not 
appear there will be any further request as to item (3). 
ACTION: 
None. For information.
