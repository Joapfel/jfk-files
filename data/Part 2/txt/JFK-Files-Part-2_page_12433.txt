SEC'nON 107. SECURITY IN"F~RMI\.NTS AND CONFI.TIAL SOURCES. 
Contac.ts by .Agents 
a. "Exc.ept in espionage and foreign nationality matters where frequency 
of contact is depende.nt on circumstances, informants should be con­
tacted as often as necessary, but a.t least one personal contact 
should be made every two weeks. If such frequent contacts cannot be 
· established, obtain specific Bureau authority for exception to this 
requirement. 
b. During each contact, carefully review informant's activities since 
previous contact and make certain informant has furni,shed all in­
formation which he has obtained since last contact. 
c. Contacting Agent should not only collect information but direct 
informant, be aware of his activities, and maintain such close 
relationship that he knows informant's attitude towards Bureau. 
Good judgment must prevail in handling informant ·l;o see he does 
not become too familiar with Agent. Promptly advise Bureau of any 
indication informant is wavering in Bureau relationship. 
d. Arrangements for paying informant or personally contacting him must 
be specific and no doubt should be left in minds of either Agen·I; 
or informant as to methods of payment, amount, place, and, time. 
e. Informants should use· only public telephones in communicating witli 
contacting Agent and consideration should be given to furnishing 
informants nonpublished office telephone number for emergency com­
munication. This rule is not practical in all espionage and 
foreign nationality matters but should be followed where applicable. 
f. Positive information received from informant should be subject of 
written statement by informant or memorandum prepared by contacting 
Agent to be placed in informant's subfile and appropriately 
channelized. • 
g. Record dates of all contacts, whether negative or posi~ive, in 
informant's administrative file. Memorandum or form FD-209 may be 
used. If informant contacted frequently, one memorandum or form 
may be used for several contacts. 
h. Dates of negative contacts and file numbers of cases involved must 
app~ar in informant's administrative file. Where file has more than 
one subject, name of subject under inquiry should be noted. Do not 
set forth title of case involved. 
i. If positive information received from informant, show only dates of 
contacts in informant's administrative file. Place positive informa­
tion in informant's subfile and appropriately channelize same~ 
j. Alternate Agent should be designated for contacts with informant 
and should be thoroughly acquainted with informant so t~at contacts 
may be handled by alternate Agent where necessary. 
Checking reliability 
a. Reliability of all active informants must be constantly checked. 
b. Give consideration to use of any investigative technique.deemed 
necessary to be certain they are completely reliable and are fur­
nishing accurate, truthful information. 
Fingerprints 
a. After informant has been developed and unless some reason to 
contrary exists, obtain and forward his fingerprints to Identifi­
cation Division if they are not on file there. 
b. If informant refuses, do not force issue. 
c. Forward informant's fingerprints as enclosure to FD-165 using 
applicant-type fingerprint card, form FD-258, fully executed. 
Aporopriate field office should be shown as contributor, field 
case file number in number space, and •11inquiry 11 in space for
