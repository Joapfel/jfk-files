Apparently selected for Task Force W because 
of extensive paramilitary background. Not sure 
whether slotted by Harvey or Helms. 
Prior to his Task Force W•assignment, Harvey 
was known to Cheever by ,reputation only. He des­
cribed Harvey as one of _the finest operatives the 
Agency ever had, citing Harvey'· s Berlin tunnel. 
' Cheever understood that T~sk Force w was 
Mongoose's instrument to get rid of the Castro 
regime; that the Cuban operations had White House 
backing; and that the Agency had been given an 
operational carte blanche, with the caveat that 
each operation had to receive explicit SGA approval 
prior to getting off the drawing board. ' 
Cheever told us: "You don't pull in fast-rising 
men like [Ted] Schakley unless you have solid back­
ing." Cheever believes that Lansdale was RFK's 
representative and that Task Force w would not 
suggest aggressive covert action to the SGA with-
out Lansdale's approval. '
