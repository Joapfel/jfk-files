1. The Manufacture and Use of Documents 
The Agency maintains a capability for producing and providing to 
its agents and operatives a wide range of "alias" credentials. Most such 
documents purport to be of foreign origin. Some, however, are docu­
. ments ordinarily issued by other branches of the U.S. go\·ernment or 
by private United States businesses li.nd organizations . 
Amorig the United States "alias" documents furnished from time 
to time to Agency personnel and operatives are Social Security cards, 
bank cards, professional cards, club cards, alumni association cards 
and library card-s. The Agency has recently stopped producing alias / 
driver's licenses, credit c.ards and birth certificates, unless needed in 
a particularly sensitive operation and approved in advance by the 
Deputy Director of Operations. 
While the Ageney does not produce false United States passports, 
it has in the past altered a few by the addition of entries to evidence 
travel which haa not actually occurred. • 
The purpose of alias documents is to facilitate con•r during CIA 
operations. These documents are not· "backstopped/' i.e., manufac­
tured with the consent and knowledge of the coinpany or organiza­
tion whose card is being manufactured. They are useful only as flash 
identification. Only the Social Security Administration has been told 
that the Agency is manufacturing its cards. 
The Commission found no evidence that any Agency employee has 
ever used false documentation of this kind to his personal advantage.
