THEFT OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY 
As a result of Bureau investigation, on January 11, 1960, 
captioned subjects, all students at Washington and Lee University, 
Lexington, Virginia, admitted stealing a radio antenna from a 
vehicle belonging to the Internal Revenue Service on the night of 
} 
September 16-17, 1959. This ant~nna was valued at approximately 
$37 .so.· . 
Subjects apparently are members of prominent families, 
with Purnell the son of a prominent Dallas, Texas, attorney and 
Friedrichs related to Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Groner 
was a star football player who recently signed with the Dallas 
team of the new /}rnerican Fo~tball League. 
U.S. Attorney~John Strickler at Roanoke, Virginia, 
insisted upon prosecution of ~il f6ur for Theft of Government 
Property. Strickler in additiori leaked the facts concerning 
this case to the local press indicating that arrests would be 
forthcoming~ 
• In view of this matter b~ing a potential source of 
embarrassment to both the Bureau and the Department, the facts 
were brought to the attention of·t~e Criminal Division on 
January 12, 19600 The Criminal Division subsequently advised that 
they had discussed this matter by telephone with u. s. Attorney 
Strickler who reluctantly agreed to proceed against subjects by 
Grand Jury. The Department indicated they were upset with the 
manner in which Strickler released this information to the tiewspapers 
and that Mr. Hayden Crawford of the Department was to separately 
take up this matter with him. 
The '.Proctor at Washington and Lee University ha~· indicated 
that University officials are holding any action against subjects 
in abeyance and would await final action by the Grand· Jury. All 
four subjects remain enrolled at·washington and Lee at this time.
