Gentlemen: 
In responding to an FOIA litigation from Harold Weisberg 
(enclosure 1), we have surfaced reference to 46 documents 
which originated with your agency. Three of these documents 
are referred by listing only; and either first pages or full 
text copies of the remaining 43 documents are enclosed. This 
information is being forwarded to you for review and direct 
response to the requester. 
We will advise the requester of this referral in our 
response, which we expect to complete in the near future. 
Please note that the docwnents listed, and those of 
which just the first pages have been included, have not been 
reviewed to see if they contain CIA information. In the 
event that they do, we request that this material be coordin­
ated with us before being released to the requester. 
If you have any questions, please contact Karen Wolfe 
or Allie Falardeau, 351-5615, and refer to our request F76-

Sincerely,
