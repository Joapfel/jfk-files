This interim report is based primarily on the testimony received from 
the intelligence chiefs who appeared before the Subcommittee. It does, however 
include some information from other sources. 
Since our inquiry is not yet completed, this report does not contain any 
overall or comprehensive conclusions and recommendations. Major findings, • •-•• 
based on the testill!ony and evidence thus far received, relative to intelligence 
act~vities during the military buildup have been incorporated. Our general 
recommendation at this time is that an alert vigilance be maintained over all 
activities taking place in Cuba. 
II. SUMMARY OF MAJOR FINDINGS 
1. While hindsight shows that the performance of the Central Intelli­
gence Agency and the military intelligence agencies can be criticized in some 
areas, in other areas they performed creditably. Offensive weapons systems 
were identified before becoming operational and their locations and performance 
characteristics spelled out in a limited period of time despite adverse weather 
and an almost completely closed society. 
2. Although photographic reconnaissance has limitations, it was this 
capability which ultimately produced incontrovertible proof of the presence 
of strategic missiles and offensive weapons in Cuba. Credit is due to those 
involved in this mission. 
3. While a reasonably competent job was done in acquiring and collecting 
intelligence information and data, in retrospect it appears that several 
substantial errors were made by the intelligence agencies in the evaluation of 
the information and data which was accumulated.
