Dear Mr. Sprague: 
October 19, 1976 
I was so intrigued by your selection as Chief Counsel 
and Staff Director of the Select Committee on Assassinations 
that I had to write to you. I am an extremely bright and 
capable graduate of Columbia Law School (May 1976) who hap­
pens to be one of your cousin Ziporah Mordana's daughters, 
and one of Debora Horowitz's granddaughters. 
I hope you will forgive me for thus invoking kinship, 
but I am so eager to work with you that I am tempted to use 
any and all reasonable means to help,achieve that objective. 
"Uncle" Louis heartily agreed that I should acquaint you with

My educational background includes being a Stone Scholar 
and "VG" student at Columbia Law School, and a Phi Beta Kappa 
at Barnard College (undergraduate division of Columbia Univer­
sity). While in law school, I persuaded the Columbia Graduate 
School of Journalism to admit me to some of its professional 
workshop& (in reporting,.writing, editing, etc.), and completed 
half the Master's Program in Journalism. 
My professional legal experience has involved a great deal 
of litigation practice, from doing research and discovery, to 
writing complaints, interrogatories, pre-trial memoranda and 
I 
appellate briefs 0 in areas ranging from anti-trust to customs 
seizures. 
My most challenging employment has been with the American 
Civil Liberties Union, where I have been working since the 
Summer of 1975. In my capacity as law clerk to the Legal Direc­
tor, I was giv~n the responsibility for handling the pre-trial
