a small boat could not recover its position and get back to the 
mother ship to be picked up and it was·adrift or came in to one 
of the islands or came in to the Florida coast anywhere and was 
picked up and picked up by Immigration· insp~ctors, then they 
would ask to have thei~ case referred to a particular individual

phrase. Dut then Immigration would get in touch with us and say 
we have this group, here is what they say, what is your interest 
in this particular group, and then that would be adjudicated 
at that point. 
Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a 
number of patrols and at times when boat loadinCJs were conducted

any agent who was arrested for anything from drunken driving to 
illegal possession of fire~rms woulrl be quickly released." 
Is that accurat~? 
Mr. Halley. I commented on that before, and we are on t.he
