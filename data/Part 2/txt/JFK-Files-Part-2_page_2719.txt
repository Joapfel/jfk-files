SUBJECT Request for Quality Step Increase (HR 20-37), 
Mr. William M. Kent, GS-13 
1. On the basis of the information presented below, it 
is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for 
Mr. William M. Kent. 
2. Kr. Kent has made a most valuable contribution to 
the Covert Action mission of this Division. On occasion of 
tha discovery of a Cuban arms cache in Venezuela in Novsmber 
1963, of the January 1964 riots in Pana.ma, of the April 1965 
revolution in the Dominican Republic, of many other crises 
and situations which have developed, Mr. Kent immediately 
took the initiative within and outside this Division for the 
initiation and coordination of Covert Action efforts to 
safeguard the u.s. image and support u.s. objectives in each 
case; this, of course, without neglecting his other, routine, 
day-to-day responsibilities. Mr. Kent has been energetic, 
imaginative, and professional in his work to a degree much 
beyond that normally found or expected. He speal=.& excellent 
Spanish, and this has been an essential ingredient in his 
critical abilities in the handling of his assigned tasks. 
3. Mr. Kent bas been with the WH Division's Covert 
Action Staff since 1963. In 1964, he attended the Hid­
career Executive Development Course No. 4. He has con­
sistently maintained a very high level of competence, con­
scientious application, and strong dedication to his duties. 
In this connection, despite an illness which lasted from 
December 1964 to July 1965, he took only two days of sick 
leave and did not allow his work performance to suffer. 
There is every reason to believe that Mr. Kent's exceptional 
proficiency and effectiveness will continue.
