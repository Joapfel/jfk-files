already out of off ice (Dillon, 9 / 2/ 7 5, p. 48) . ·k When reminded 
of the fact that Lumumba' s movement and communi.cations were 
not restricted by the UN force and. that the Congolese army 
• continued to seek his arrest lorig after the NSC me·eting, Dillon 
acknowledged that during this period Lumumba continued to be 
viewed by the United States ·as a potential threat and a volatile 
force in the·. Congo: 
He had·this tremendous ability to stir up 
a crowd or a group. And if he could have gotten 
6ut and stirted to talk to a battalion of the 
Congolese Army, he probably would have had them 
in the palm of his hand in· five minutes. (Dillon,. 
9/20/75, p. 49.) 
John N. Irwiri TI, who attended the NSC meeting as Assistant 
.Secretary of Defense, stated that although he had no recollection 
of the discussion, the language of the minutes was "broad enough 
to cover a discussion of ~ssassination'' (Irwin affidavit, 
9/22/75, p. 2). 
Richard Bissell testified that, based upon his understanding 
of the policy of the NSC toward Lumumba even after Lumumba was 
in UN custody, he would read the minutes of September 21 to indi­
cate that assassination was contemplated "as one possible means" 
* See Section 3,~upra,for discussion of CIA cable traffic 
indicating that Lurnumba continued to be regarded as capable 
of taking over the government after he w.as deposed and that 
pressure to "eliminate" him did not cease.until his death.
