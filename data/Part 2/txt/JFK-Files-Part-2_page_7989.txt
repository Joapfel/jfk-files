Procedure for Withdrawal 
Sixth, a procedure should be established for 
withdrawal from the cooperative. If the withdraw­
ing firm has not been a member for a predetermined 
time, perhaps one or two years, a sliding scale 
penalty fee for withdrawal should be established. 
Procedure for Admission 
Finally, procedures must be determined to govern 
the admi~sion of new members into the cooperative. 
Perhaps a unanimous affirmative vote by current mem­
bers should be required to_ admit a new member. The 
current members should also decide if a newly admit­
ted member should be required to pay a predetermined 
portion of the cooperative's startup costs and if 
the cooperative should limit membership to firms of 
the same approximate size as current members. 
Conclusion 
With due care taken in following the above steps, 
establishing a successful cooperative service bureau 
should be relatively easy. Companies would be well 
advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooper­
ative service bureaus offer a viable and in many ways su­
perior alternative to the more costly inhouse computer 
and the less satisfactory outside service bureau.
