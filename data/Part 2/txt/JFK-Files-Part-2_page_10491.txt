which has as its fundamental objective the long term manipu­
lations of selected agent asset~ operating against EA Division .. 
difficult targets in the leftist and coffimunist milieu in various 
parts of the .world. Although targetted overseas these·agcnts are 
often exposed to and directed against A~erican radical, leftist, 
and communist targets to gain a practical knowledge of the lcftwing, 
radical, communist world. There is a possibility that an asset 
might become suspect and be accused of being an employee of the 
Agency or the Bureau; or it Di&ht happen some asset would, for 
some reason, become disenchanted with his role and expose his 
Agency relationship and his activities, with resultant ccbar­
rassment. To mihimize potential problems, therefore, each 
case is cleared with the FBI and through CI/SO the Bureau is 
kept. informed on a regular basis.
