Dear Mr. Chairman: · 
This letter is the Assassination Records Review Board's sixth monthly progress report, 
as required by the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight report on H.R. 
1553 (now P.L. 105-25), that extended the authorization of the Review Board until 
September 30, 1998. 
At the January 22 closed meeting, the Board processed for public release approximately 
3,600 FBI records, 1,000 CIA records, and 350 records from other agencies. The nearly 
5;000 records processed by the Board is its highest total for a single meeting. In 
addition, the Review Board recently released approximately 600 pages of military 
records regarding U.S. policy.toward Cuba from 1962-~. • Additional military records 
related to U.S. policy toward Cuba in the early 1960's will be ready for public release in 
the coming months. 
The 710 records that the QA made available for Review Board action at the January 
meeting is the highest monthly number of records released to date. In addition, a total 
of 289 HSCA documents with CIA equities were opened in full pursuant to discussions 
with the QA. Although the Review Board believes that the pace must continue to 
increase, the momentum is unquestionably in the right direction. The CIA also has 
advised us that it has added additional ~viewers and indexers, which we believe 
should help it process more records during the upcoming months. We now are 
conducting weekly meetings with ClA for the purpose of evaluating the pace of the . 
review process. The CIA also has increased its progress in responding to our requests 
for additional information and records. The requests that we had identified as priorities 
have now been answered either in whole or in part and the CIA has shown an increased
