NOSENKO's Eventual Retraction Regarding Recall telecram 
NOSENI~O mo.in tained throughout his interrogations 
in 1964 and 196~ that there was the recall telegram and that 
it prompted l1is defection, In October 1966, however, while 
being questioned again, NOSENI<O stated that there had bee,: 
no telegram recalling him to .Moscm.r from Geneva, and he 
signed the following statement: 
"On 4 February 1964, I told my CIA contact 
in Geneva that a telegram from Headquarters in 
Moscow hacl Lieen received in the KGB Residency in 
Geneva recalling mn immediu.tely to Moscow. I said 
at the time that this telegram said that I was 
recalled to participate in a conference to plan KGB 
activity against tourists for the 1964 season. I 
maintained this story as fact throughout subsequent 
interviews and interrogations by American authorities 
in 1964 and 1965. No such telegram ever existed. 
No telegram was received in Geneva. I admit that 
the story was a lie. I myself invented this tele­
gram in order to hasten my defection. I was nervous 
and afraid that LP{ contacts with American Intelli­
gence might be noticed."

The notes NOSENKO brought to CIA in Geneva in 1964 
(see p.319) included Lrief reference to thirteen other KGB 
operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as 
tourists during the 1962-1963 period. For reasons cited 
in the description of these operations in Annex B, these 
operations .:ire not material to tJOSENKO's claim to service 
in 1962-1963 as ciLher Chief of the American-British 
Crn'llllom;eal th Section or as Deputy Chief of the Seventh
