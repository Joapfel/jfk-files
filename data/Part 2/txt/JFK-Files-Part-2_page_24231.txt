which cannot be traced to the United States Government. It provides 
covert procurement for the Office of Logistics (CIA). Its total 
purchases from January to September 1974 were $437,500. It has no 
outside connnercial business and has five employees. Yet, as of 
December 31, 1974. that entity had invested $149,000 in time deposits. 
Another covert procurement mechanism under this same Office is 
SPECIAL STOCK ACCOUNT #3. This is also a Delaware corporation with 
an address in Baltimore which purchases arms, ammunition 1 and police

Headquarters officials in_ alias. As of December 31, 1974. that 
entity had invested $37,500 in a certificate of deposit.
