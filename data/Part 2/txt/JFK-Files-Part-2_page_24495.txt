Secretary of State Dean Rusk testified: 
"I never had any reason to believe that anyone 
that I ever talked to knew about had any active 
planning of assassination underway." (Rusk, 
pp. 65,49). 
Likewise, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that he had "no 
knowledge or infonnation about. .. plans or preparations for a possible assass­
ination attempt against Premier Castro." (McNamara, pp. 7,4). [The question 
of whether McNamara once raised the issue of assassinating Castro is discussed 
at Section ,infra. J 
Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense under McNamara, said. that 
killing Castro was not within the mandate Qi the Special Group which he con­
strued to be the weakening and undermining of "the Cuban system." (Gilpatric, 
p. 28). 
This was supported by General Maxwell Taylor, who chaired Special Group 
meetings on Operation Mongoose. Taylor stated that he had "never heard". of 
the assassination effort against Castro (Taylor, pp. 72, 7-8). Taylor stated 
that he never raised the question of assassination with anyone. (Taylor, p. 
19). Moreover, Taylor testified that he was not aware of a directive for an 
assassination effort from·the President or the Attorney General, nor was he 
aware of a proposal for the assassination of a . foreign leader in any form by 
anyone to the Special Group (Taylor, pp. 41,45,62). 
McGeorge Bundy stated that it was his "conviction" that 
"no one in the Kennedy Administration, in the 
White House, or in the Capitol, ever gave any 
authorization, approval, or instruction of any 
kind for any effort to assassinate anyone by the 
CIA." (Bundy, p. 54)
