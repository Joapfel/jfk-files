As discussed·below in detail at pp __ , after the subject 
of a Castro assassination was raised at the August 10, 1962 meeting of the 
Special Group Augmented, Lansdale directed Harvey to prepare a plan for the 
"liquidation" of Cuban leaders. However, no such plan was ever prepared and, 
as the IG Report concluded, the August 10 meeting was "unrelated to any actual 
attempts at assassination." (IG, p. 118)~ 
With respect to the possibility that Robert Kennedy 
might have by-passed the SGA and Lansdale to deal directly with Agency 
officials on a Castro assassination, Lansdale testified: 
"I never knew of a direct line of communication 
between the President or the Attorney General and Harvey 
apart from me on this .... " ....

into these allegations of assassination efforts by the U.S. government,
