During ini iiial st~igcs of development and on occasion active inforrnants 
may raise a personal question concerning their own position if it 
becomes known pu11licl y that they are affilia.ted wi·l;h a su1,vcrsi ye 
organiz,d;ion. In ·bhe ~vent a potcnt.ial informrtnt or info:r1nan·h inquires 
as to what can be done for him in such a case, he may be told that 
his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
a~ises concerning his loyalty wa will consider making the facts of his 
cooperation with the FRI-known to his employor or to the responsible 
individuals. It should be pointed out that this actfon may make it 
impossible for him ·bo continue on behalf of the FBI and the s erv:i.ce 
which he is performing for his country may be terminated. Before 
taking steps to A.clvjse anyone of a potenti~l informant 1 s o>:- informant's 
cooporation,.prior Bureau authority muat be obtained. 
Specifically ad-vise. each potential informant that he is hot ancl cannot 
consider himself a Bureau employee or "undercover ltgent" of the FBI. 
In this regard, the seriousness of -violating the impersonation st&tutes 
must be impressed npon the informa~t. • • • 
Advif:e ·po·ten•!;ic1.l informant tha·~ his cooperation must be strictly confi­
dential at all times and if ho should feel he cannot maintain this· • 
confidence he should so adv-:i.se. There should be no doubt left in ·!;he 
mind of the informant th-"1.t ·his relc1.tionship must remain on a confidential 
basis and if he vi c,la·l;cs the confidence he will .be of no -v~iluG and by 
so doing the Bureau's investigative activity may be jeopardi¼ed. This 
must be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you·acc~pt him 
as such. If the informant has a special problem which would requiro 
his revealing his relationship to his w~fe, etc,; this should be lear~-i 
from him during the initial interview· and a recommendation made to t]· 
Bureau when the results of the interview c1.re furnished. The special 
circum~tances will be taken into corisidoratfon by the ~ureau.· 
If a prospective informant is connected in any manner with a labor 
union, inform him ·hhat the Bureau is not interested in employer­
employee relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
information on the infiltration in labor unions by su.bversi ve elements·. 
·rf the po·bential informant is a studenti, tc".cher, or has a:ny similar 
relations with a school, college, or university, i~ his initial interview 
and subsequent handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern­
ing investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities. 
From the firs·i; interview with a pcten·l;ial informant through his develop­
ment ·and until he is discontinued, extreme cauti.on should be used a.t 
all times to be certain he is not a plant. 
,. 
! 
When potential informan·h begins to furnish current infori'!w.tion and 
otherwise qualifies for designation as informant., assign pormanen·!; 
symbol number and advise Bureau. This co'r;!Inunicatiori must be pcrso-na.lly 
initialed by SAC or ASAC acting in his ~bsence; individual 1 s background 
must also be thoroughly reviewed at this time, keeping in mind possibility 
of using informant as a potential witness, If individual has any 
weaknesses, set forth safeguards being followed to insure security and 
to prevent embarrassment to Bureau.)
