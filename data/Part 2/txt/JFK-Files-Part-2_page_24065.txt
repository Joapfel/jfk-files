e. Castro 
• There was no evidenc·e from which the ·cornrni ttee 
could conclude that Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, or Johnson, 
their close advisors, or the Special Group authori~ed the 
assassination of Castro. 
We find that the effort against Castro was clearly autho­
rized through the level of DDP. It is not certain whether 
Allen Dulles knew.about the plots, although Bissell and 
Edwards were of the opinion that he did, and the credibility 
of their beliefs is buttressed by the fact that Dulles knew 
about the Lumurnba assassination plot, which was planned and 
attempted at the.time of the early Castro plots. We can find 
no evidence that McCone was aware of the plots which occurred 
during his tenure. His DDP, Richard Helms, testified that 
he never discussed the subject with M6Cone and ~as never 
expressly authori,;~d by anyone to a,_s_::;_assinate Castro. 
The only suggestion of express Presidential authorization 
for the plots against Castro was Richard Bissell's opinion 
that Dulles would have circurnlocutiously informed Presidents 
Eisenhower'and Kennedy after the assassination had been plan­
ned and was underway. The assumptions underlying this opinion 
are too attenuated for the Committee to adopt it as a finding.
