The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether 
secrecy agreements were ~vei signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board 0), and 
offers options to address t~at issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both 
internally and externally (ff,Bl, White House), to locate any secrecy agret:Jments that members of the 
Board may have signed. 7ihose searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have 
been found. We are also Jearching selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference 
to, or indication of, particul~r secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition, 
we are attempting to locatJ any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any 
secrecy agreements the m~mbers may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these 
actions will bear fruit are nbt good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the 
outset, the FBI was given 'Fsponsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board. _.,./

Our primary goal iry this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to 
future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified 
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified 
information). The last mefiting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of 
business as of 1 October. lff we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September 
meeting will be our last op{?ortunity to do so;(OtFiefwfsiiwe will have to deal with eachBoard member ana- , , '' 
staffer individually, if at all.Before considering the oetions se.Uortb.helDw,_itJs worth noting that whatever 
approacfi we-take with-thfrBoard, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to thelioard's 
unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the 
Board. With that in mind, qur options are: • 
I 
1. Do and say nothing, and hope that Board members and staffers will voluntarily submit any 
future writings for prepubli~ation review. 
i 
2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation 
not to reveal classified info'rmation in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and 
again hope that they will vdluntari/y submit any future writings for prepublication review. Board members 
and staffers sign nothing. I 
3. Provide a gene}ic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation 
not to reveal classified infokation in any way,· and also makes available our prepublication review services 
I 
to assist them in this regard, if requested, with respect to any future writings (related to their work as Board 
members or staffers). Boatd members and staffers sign nothing. The success of this option depends 
upon the willingness of Bo~rd members and staffers to voluntarily submit any future writings for 
prepublication review. I 
I 
4. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have 
an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their 
work as Board members oil staffers) as p~rt of their obligation to pr9tec;~ classified information, and hope 
the B,oard does not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed 
secrecy agreements). In essence, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.
