1. ACTION: None. This memorandum is for your informa­
tion. 
2. In co.nnection with Task Force W efforts to split the 
Cub an 1 e ad er s h i p , . some ti me ago we tar g e t e d Ju an a Ca s tr o Ruz , 
half-sister of Fidel and, Raul Castro Ruz. A number of reports 
have been.received indicating that Juana Castro Ruz opposed 
the strong communist nature of the Cuban regime and was 
prepared, at least to some extent, to cooperate with anti­
regime elements. In May 1962 we reestablished contact with and 
recruited Mrs. Virginia Leitao De Cunha, Cuban born wife of 
the Brazilian ambassador to the USSR and a long time pers-0nal 
friend of Juana Castro Ruz. 
J. On 11 June 1962, on our in~tructions, Madame De Cunha 
proceeded to Havana where she maintained _frequent contact 
with Juana Castro Ruz and other prominent Cuban leaders until 
1 July 1962. She discussed. the current regime quite frankly 
with Juana Castro Ruz afl~, ac~ording to Madame De Cunha, she 
obtain~d Juana's agreement to provide intelligence on the 
Cuban political l~adership and to work against the Cuban 
communist regime, short of engaging in activity which might 
result in direct personal harm to her brothers Raul and Fidel. 
According to .Madame De Cuntia, Juana has agreed to proceed to 
Mexico or. the United States in this connection and return to 
Cuba after discussions with "the Americans". 
4. We are making the necessary arrangements with 
Madame De Cunha to have Juana Castro Ruz proceed to Mexico as 
soon as possible in order that we may attempt a direct re­
cruitment. You will be kept advised of any future devel-0p­
ments of importance in this case.
