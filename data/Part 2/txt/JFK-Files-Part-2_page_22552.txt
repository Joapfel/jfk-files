Wiley's 1969 Federal income ta~ return reflects 
a 21 day trip to Germany, Belgium, and Luxemburg and 
claims transportation Has furnished by the U.S. Armed 
Forces. A memo of a trip io Germany 20 January to 8 
February 1969 indicates Wiley was _covering airlift 
operation Reforger I. This trip was apparently as an 
invitee of the U.S. military which supplied most of the 
travel needs. No travel voucher was submitted to CIA 
but overseas trip expenses of $502.26 are charged 
as expenses in the 1969 cover fund accounting o£fset 
against income. The itinerary shows: Brussels, Germany 
and Luxemburg. 
The 1970 Federal income tax return indicates a 
2 month trip to Europe, ~rimarily Germany, during July 
and August 1970. It says much of trip expense provided 
by the West German Government. Wiley did not make the 
usual claim for per diem expense in the Federal income 
tax return. In his cover accounting for 1970, Wiley 
shows an overseas trip expense of $664.74 to be offset 
against income. He indicates transportation from D.C. 
to Germany and return was provided by the German Air

and Zagreb. 
No foreign travel is reflected in the Federal Income 
tax return or office records for 1971. 
Wiley's 1973 Federal income tax return shows a one 
month trip to Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Wiley's 
1972 cover fund accounting reflects expenses of $497.36 
for a Vietnam trip but in his income he shows an allowance 
of $475.00 made by the National Committee for Responsible 
Patriots (NCRP), for the trip. The expense listing 
attached reflects those expenses and claims roundtrip 
airfare and some other expenses were provided by others 
(possibly air transportation expenses were provided by 
some segment of the Vietnam Government). The itinerary 
shows: Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Taipei.
