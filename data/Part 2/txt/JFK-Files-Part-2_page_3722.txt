~owing the resignation last week 
~f Finance Minister Carvalho 
Pinto. A moderate leftist, Ney 
Galvao, was appointed Pinto's 
~uccessor, but there remains a • 
ppssibility that Leonel Brizola-­
who had been actively pushed for 
tlie post by the extreme left-­
m~y eventually receive some min­
istry. There is widespread be-
l~ef in the army that War Min-
i ter Jair Ribeiro will also be 
r placed in the near future. As 
~e responsible Brazilian com­
e~tator has remarked, with Gou­
lart "every minister is an in-

. Ney Galvao's appointment 
ac/tua lly reduces the previously 
sfght prospect that Brazil's c itical financial problems would 
b handled effectively. Galvao's 
· lif ications in the economic 
fi:eld are weak at best and bis rec­
o~d as head of the Bank of Brazil 
a9es not command confidence with­
iq the business community. Be­

Goulart's aly....ao.___C1UJ._b...L...exp.e.c_t.e~ 
to toe the adminstration line 
faithfully. Moreover, Galvao's 
appointment may be a temporary 
expedient designed to allay 
fears that Brizola would succeed 
Pinto. Galvao is a personal 
friend of Brizola and there is 
speculation that Brizola will, 
in fact, eventually move into 
the Finance Ministry. 
The new finance minister 
inherits almost insurmountable 
economic and financial problems. 
Chief among these are a rampant 
inflation that may see the cost 
of living increase 80 percent 
this year, and a staggering 
foreign debt involving approxi­
mately $1 billion in payments 
due over the next two years. 
The severity ·of the eco­
nomic situation and Goulart's 
apparent intention to assume 
greater personal direction over 
financial policies increase 
the possibility of radical meas­
ures that might be detrimental 
to foreign creditors and in­
vestors. Goulart reportedly is 
considering nationalization of 
all public utilities and can­
cellation of mining concessions. 
Measures such as these could 
lead to·further deterioration 
of Brazil's economic position.
