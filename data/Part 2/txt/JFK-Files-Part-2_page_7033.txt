3. How a Request was Worked Following receipt of a 
request and HRP tasking the responsible Agency component(s) 
to conduct a search, the materials found were first reviewed 
by HRP staff members before access was provided to th~ ARRB 
staff. ARRB staff then reviewed the documents and materials 
and identified those which it believed were relevant to 
their inquiry and these materials were placed in the normal 
queue to be reviewed and processed for release. However, 
the mere identification of materials did not equate to 
automatic release. ·Rather, if particularly sensitive 
information was involved, negotiations took place and, on 
occasion, a written statement about the materials was 
provided for release vice the actual document(s). 
L./;;f. The Agency's written responses to each request -
either a letter or memoranda - included, of course, the fact 
the materials designated were to be processed for release 
according to then current guidelines. The ARRB staff then 
wrote its own version of the request, search, and response. 
Both of these are a part·of the public record on this 
project. 
>--4'- Lessons learned: A nwnber of things s~rfaced as 
HRP worked to complete these requests which required 
considerable explanation, negotiation, and resolution. 
a. First among these was the fact there existed an 
outside Board which asked for informatidn and carefully 
monitor~d the responses (a very powerful external Board with 
subpoena authority), without doubt caused documents and 
information to be found and made available that would not 
have been provided to an internal declassification project. 
b. Second, for any large project such as JFK to be 
successful, there is an absolute requirement that each 
directorate and independent office identify two responsible 
persons -- a senior management official who can ensure that 
deadlines (particularly aeadlines established by an external
