According to articles in the 7 /9 and 19/64. • issues of "The· .. 
New· York Times," the Japanese Government is not as st·rong now· as in 
preceding y'ea·rs. Pre·stige of its Premier, Hayato Ikeda, re-elected 
to a third term 7-10-64, has been.damaged by inflationary trends that. 
have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three·years. His new· 
cabinet has been called "weak" and "lightweight" due. to -h:is attempts to 
achieve balance among feuding elements in his -own Liberal· Democratic· • •• 
Party. • 
\ Japan i.s also buffeted by pressures from the USSR with which 
tit has rather extensive trade relations. On 5-14-64,· the USSR's First 
Deputy Premier, Anastas Mikoyan, made a surprise "good will" visit to 
Japan. He and members of his group met with Premier Ikeda and other 
~highly·placed Japanese officials. Real purpose behind his visit is 
·unknown.· Some claim his aim was merely an expansion ·of trade •. Others 
believe USSR felt the trip was necessary so as to ·reinforce Russia's 
--po~ition:with Japan be6ause 6f increased relations between Japan and China;. 
OBS·ERVATIONS :· 
Industrially, Japan is the leading power in Asia and it wield~ 
i considerable influence on lesser Asiatic countries. Capitulation by 
Japan to pressures of ·communist China could have significant eff-ect .. on 
such countries, possibly hastening their own recognit~on of Communist China 
and also the ultimate· admission of Communist China to UN. We should do 
what we can to make available to State Department and other interested 
agencies, any infor~ation which would enable them to take appropriate 
steps. It is, therefore, recommended we secure State clearance for the 
development of live sources in Japanese official establishments in the 
u. s. This matter will be handled by Washington Field·and New York Offices 
• whose ·agents are experienced in such matters and can be relied upon to· 
\ conduct tbemselves discreetly so as not to imperil cordial relations ~ 
\ presently ex~sting between {!•.S• and Japan. As a f~ther safeg:1ard, only 
\American citizens employed in these establishments will be considered 
, for developtnent a. s informants.·. M. /' .J.. u _ fl. ~ i lJ J l. 'YN ~ . . · · 7 ~.., • T M., rr, Ba..- 4!'!,T .· -t..-, rs~ /.j •_I~
