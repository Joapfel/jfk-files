wasn't aware of this. 
Mr. Schwarz. After that initial occasion involving 
the use of Philpott's name in order to instruc to 
work for the CIA, was anybody from the Defense Intelligence 
Agency further brought into the operation which we have been 
calling Track II? 
Mr. PHillips. My answer to that until a few minutes 
ago would have been, I don't recall that. I have seen a documan 
since then that indicates that someone else was talked to 
later. If I knew that I had forgotten it, or perhaps never 
knew it I must have known it if I saw the message.But 
until I saw this thing, to refresh my memory I would have 
said, I think that Philpott was the man. 
Mr. Schwarz. Was the man, and was. only contacted on 
that one occasion? 
Mr. Phillips. As far as I know, that one occasion. 
But I didn't necessarily know what was outside of my little 
room with windows, and so there wer~ other people doing other 
things. 
Mr. Schwarz. Let's then look at the other documents. 
Would you mark Tab Gas Exhibit 5. 
(The document referred to was 
marked Phillips Exhibit No. 5 
for identification.)
