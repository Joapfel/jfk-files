$31 million,most of which are held outside the U.S. The· companies 
do not write insurance in the United States, but rather reinsure 
with cooperating companies who then sell the risk to the CIA for 
a percentage-of the premium. The policies are written directly 
abroad. Each of the· U. S. companies pays little tax and a pro­
prietary auditing firm audits the books of MHMUTUAL. This method 
of ·self-insurance enables the Agency to funnel money where needed 
in any of its project categories. Currently, 60 percent of the 
investments are in Eurobonds, 20 percent in off-shore time deposits 
in U. • S. banks, and the balance is in common stocks, debentures 
and comme~cial paper of various types. For example, the current 
breakdown is: 
$7 million in time deposits abroad; 
$2.4 million in Common Stock (at cost); , 
$20.8 million in Eurobonds; 
$1 million Eurodollar convertible debentures; 
$.5 million in short-term commercial paper overseas; and 
$.2 million in domestic debentures. 
The performance·of the MHMUTUAL stock portfolio is noted at 
this.juncture. Comparisons of cost against market value for the 
years 1970 through 1975 are given first. Following that are the 
gains or losses on the sales of stock for the years 1963 through 
1975.
