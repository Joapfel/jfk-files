The Chairman_. You were present at that meeting? 
Mr. Bundy. I was present. My memory is entirely 
21 
a refreshed memory on this, I had no recollection of the 
!J meeting until recent months. But I ha•1e found a scratch 
ii 
pad that I apparently doodled on on that date, and it 
shows who was there, and not much else. 
Mr. Schwarz. There were some beautiful drawings. 
Mr. Bundy. There were. 
They were not very beautiful drawings. 
The Special Group Augmented met in August -- and this 
does coincide with my general recollection of the matter -­
in response to concerns wihch were first, I think, and most 
energetically pressed by Mr. McCone with respect to, what the 
hell ar~ the Russians doing in Cuba. And that was the center 
jl of that meeting, and the center of later meetings, and the cen-,1

" ter of a national security action memorandum ·of considerable

complexity which was put out toward the end of August, most

of which dealt with this question, how do we know what th~y 
J0 are going to do, what do we do if they dn it, and so forth,

It was therefore in a sense much more than an. ordina1:y
