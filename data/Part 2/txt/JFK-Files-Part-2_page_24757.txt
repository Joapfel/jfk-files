Dearborn could be trusted. Then on June 16, 1960, CIA 
Headquarters* cabled a request that Dearborn become the " . comrnuni-
cations link" between the dissidents and CIA. The cable {stateQ_/ 
that Dearborn's role had the "unofficial approval of [Assistant 
Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Roy R_:_.l Rubottom" 
(Emphasis in original.) (HQS to Station cable 6/16/60). 
Dearborn agreed. He requested, however, that the CIA 
confirm the arrangement with the dissidents as being that the 
,· 
U.S. would "clandestinely" assist the opposition to "develop 
effective force to accomplish Trujillo overthrow," but would 
not "undertake any overt action itself against Trujillo 
government while it is in full control of Dominican Republic" 
(Station to HQS cable 6/17/60). CIA Headqaurters confirmed 
Dearborn's understanding of the arrangement (HQS to Station 
cable 6/19/60). 
B. The Sniper Rifles 
During the course of a cocktail party in the Dominican 
Republic, a leading dissident made a sgecific request to Ambas­
sador Farland for a limited number of rifles with telescopic 
sights. 'l'he Ambassador promised to pass on the request (Farland 
affidavit) He apparently did so after returning to Washington 
in May 1960 (CIA memorandum for the record, 6/7/61).
