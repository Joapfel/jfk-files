Mr. Wallach. I note you·r attorney is taking notes. May 
I ask if those will be provided to the CIA? 
Mr. Debelius. If they will be provided to the CIA it 
wouldn't be by me, Mr. Wallach. Really, I am doing it here 
to organize my own thoughts. And I would be happy to destroy 
them in your presence. 
Mr. Wallach. I have absolutely no problem. I was just 
wondering if you were going under instructions. 
Mr. Debelius. Could we go off the record just a moment? 
Mr. Wallach. Surely. 
(Off the record discussion.) 
Mr. Wallach. Do you recall anybody .else that 
the Agency had contact with on a regular basis? 
Mr. Osborn. I can't recall any other, but I am sure there 
were others·. 
Mr. Wallach. Do you recall any generic types of operation 
thatl/jli$ftM1m cooperated with? 
Mr. Osborn. No. But to the best of my recollection, ther 
was very little that we w~uld ask 
ll.tfdff~Wmml'J¼$fs'1 · The same is true of 
and many other departments.
