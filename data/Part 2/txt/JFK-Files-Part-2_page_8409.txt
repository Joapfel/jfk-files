Mistresses or lovers: 
No indication Cruz has a mistress, nor that he is 
interested in other women. The same, Mercedes does 
not seem to flirt with other men. 
20. Parsonal friends: 
Cruz and his wife do not seem to have close personal 
friends. They seem to be colder, prefer to be alone, 
and spend most of their time working or running family 
errands. They do not even appear to develop close 
freindships with their fellow employees. Mercedes 
likes to gossip with the other employees, but her 
fr.endship appears to stop there. Most of their contacts 
appear to be in Cruz' line of work--press or cultural, 
and are for business purposes. •
