T P SECRET 
coilapsed, the person who was to be the partner of Hughes 
Aircraft in that parti~ular venture threatened to sue Howard 
Hughes and all of the Hughes interest for non-fulfiliment of 
contract, and I made a recommendation to that person whose 
name slips my mind, but I believe his last name was Jamie, 
J-a-m-i-e or something like that, I don't recall. But to try 
to discourage him from filing such a lawsuit I suggested that 
he and I put up $10,000 in nd check into the 
possibility of developing business there. 
I put up my ten, he never put his up, and Meier was the 
one who was involved. But when the Agency needed a cover for 
an assignment in Meier was made privy of this by the 
Agency. 
Mr. Liebengood. Just to be certain I understand, this 
was because of Meier's role in reestablishing the operation 
in Is that correct? 
Mr. Maheu. Well, of trying to save the lawsuit, yes. 
That's right. 
Mr. Liebengood. And you think the name of this would-be 
partner wa~ Jamie? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't rememher whether that was the first 
name or last name. 
Mr. Liebengood. How did whatever way do you 
spell his last name, do you recall? 
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.
