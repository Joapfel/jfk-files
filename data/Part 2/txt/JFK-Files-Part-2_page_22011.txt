Interview Summary: 
Bissell "out of the blue" asked P.D. to read 
and comment upon Zoogby's Cuban operations paper. 
P.D. told Bissell that the paper/proposals "stunk" 
( ... "much like another Bay of Pigs"). Appar­
ently, Helms also read and liked P.D.'s comments. 
After Bissell "left", Helms requested that P.D. 
come on board as his staff assistant. 
P.D. stressed that he was hot in the opera­
tional line of command -- "I provided an interface 
for intelligence information." A typical day in 
P.D. 's life: 
-- Screening cable traffic (7 - 9 a.m.), 
Primarily cables relating to positive in­
telligence, to prepare Helms for his daily 
9 a.m. hour-long meeting with DCI McCone.
