House Intelligence.Committee said they had looked at all their 
drafts, they looked at the final version, and there wasn't any 
cooking. So what 'the hel 1 are people talking about, the best 
way to insure objectivity is to bring Congress into the act. 
This is nonsense. That's the trouble with a lot of this 
stuff. P~ople think that.you have got to get the Congress to 
look at things, and therefore everybody be very careful, 
otherwise somebody is going to say, "Well, you didn't do it 
right." Well, this is nonsense. 
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think there is so much more talk about 
the Congress being involved in the process? 
MR. HALPERN: Oh, Congress has always been, always wanted to 
be, in the history of the country, ever since the Constitution 
was written they've wanted to be involved. Go back to the Jay 
Treaty, when the House of Representatives insisted on seeing 
all the documentation of the Jay Treaty. And the President 
said, "No way, the Senate gets it." And the Senate got it. 
The Senate got everything they wanted; It was months later 
before they decided what to.do with it. But you start with 
Washington. 
INTERVIEWER: And they debated that whole treaty in secret. 
MR. HALPERN: Oh yeah. That's ri•ght. But the House wanted to 
get into the act. And thank th~ Lord we had a strong President 
who said, "The Constitution is very clear. I have to work with 
the Senate on advise and consent. Not you, the House. Go 
away."
