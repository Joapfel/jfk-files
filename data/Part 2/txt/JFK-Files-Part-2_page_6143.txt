mounds of records behind, including those dealing with organized crime, which 
the HSCA had subpoenaed, but was unable to process. n86 Today these materials

III. The Assassination Records Review Board 
The findings of these investigations inspired· Oliver. Stone's 19'1 movie. n87 
Without endorsing the.movie's sensational conclusions, many members of corigress 
decided that the government's refuso.l co release .classified information about· 
che assassination promoted an unhealthy level of distrust of government. nse As 
a resulc, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records.Collection 
Act of 1992 n89 (the JFK Act or Act), which mandated the creation of a 
·tive-person Review Board. n90 The Act orders ail' federal agencies to assess 
whether they [*15] possess records relating to the assassination. nn All 
records that an agency deeffiE! as .not suitable for immediate release are subject 
to the Board's evaluation. n92 All records identified as reiating to the • • 
assassination must be opened_by October 26, 2017, with the.exception of records 
that the President certifies for continued postponement. i:193
