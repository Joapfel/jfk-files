GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness inhis investigation 
according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January 
1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached. :This •

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to 
ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in pr$son.

a copy I obtained from-OS Cable.~sk. However, the original copy was 
.routed to SRS and it is possible some one .else on the Staff is already 
handling the matter.
