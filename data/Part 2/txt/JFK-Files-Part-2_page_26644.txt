wartime, but ballistic-missile 
submarines operating from such 
bases south of the Azores, for 
example, could remain on-station 
off the US coast longer than 
could units deployed from the 
Kola area. Cruise-missile and 
attack submarines would also 
profit from mid-ocean bases, 
reducing the number of.long 
transits to and from patrol 
areas. 
The USSR recently has 
achieved several technological 
advances in submarine support. 
New and more powerful radio 
transmitters serving submarines 
on distant patrols are now in 
* * 
operation in the USSR. A navi­
gation satellite system cur­
rently being tested may permit 
Soviet submarines to determine 
their positions with greater 
accuracy even inthe most un­
favorable weather and sea con­
ditions. Hydroacoustic re-
search ships have conducted 
surveys in the past few years 
in areas of the Atlantic and 
Pacific where the Soviets might 
hope to detect Polaris subma­
rines and in the Canary Island 
Basin and Philippine Sea where 
they may intend to operate their 
own submarines. (TOPSECRET TRINE
