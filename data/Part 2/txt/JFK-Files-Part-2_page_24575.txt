attendance a larger number of officials than usually participated in Special 
• -,\ Group Augmented meetings. The Meeting was chaired by Secretary of State 
Rusk (and held in his office), and attended by a total of 15 officials, 
including the principals of the agencies taking part in Mongoose, i.e., 
Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, CIA Director McCone, and USIA Director 
Murrow. 
At the August 10 meeting, General Lansdale proposed that a 11stepped-up 
Course B" be adopted for Mongoose, (August 10 Minutes, p. __ ). This plan 
involved operations to "exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychologi-
cal, and ct:her overt pressures to overthrow the Castro-Communist regime, without 
overt employment of U.S. military." (Memorandllffl for Special Group Augmented, 
August 8, 1962, p. 1). 
However, the Special Group Augmented decided against consideration of 
the "stepped-up Course B". In the discussion of Lansdale's Course B proposal, 
() Rusk "emphasized the desirability of attempting to create a split between 
Castro and old-line Communists". (August 10 Minutes, p. 2). In addition, 
McNamara questioned whether the practice of building up agents. in Cuba would 
not lead to actions that "would hurt the U.S. in the eyes of world opinion". 
(August 10 Minutes, p. 2) (A remark which seems inconsistent with McNamara._ 
at the same Meeting raising the question of assassination in any sense·of 
advocacy). The Minutes state that McNamara's concern "led to· the suggestion 
by General Taylor that we should consider changing the overall objective
