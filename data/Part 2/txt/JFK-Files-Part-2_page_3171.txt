arrived with certain ideas which he carried 
from the Pentagon on how best to tackle the 
Cuban problem. This, however, did not con­
stitute JMATE pol.icy. I am sure you [Col. 
Jack Hawkins] -- or more particularly, mem­
bers of your staff -- will find that we had 
no ,approved philosophy pf the operation 
within the Project until well in[to] Sep­
tem.ber. The training program which Rocky 
Farnsworth conducted in Panama was directed 
solely toward training an instructor cadre 
in small unit or "guerrilla type" opera­
tions. This cadre, when it arrived in 
Guatemala, in addition to working o'n build­
ing the camp with Carl Jenkins, continued 
to train the first recruits in the same 
kind of training they had received. 
Another example of my positiveness 
that we were not, at Project level, think­
ing of the strike operation is the first 
conversation that we held in my office in 
Barton Hall when I referred to the fact 
that the PM staff had been talking about 
the development of a strike operation, but 
that I, myself, was not convinced of it at 
the time and that I preferred to put small 
teams into existipg units at the appropri­
ate time. ·As I recall, you [Col. Jack 
Hawkins] had an open mind at that point; 
although without positive study of Cuba 
you leaned ·to the concept .I outlined. It 
was at a somewhat later date, therefore 
(probably before the first of October), 
that we talked.again,and you [Col. Jack 
Hawkins] stated your conviction that Castro 
could not be overthrown without a major 
or catalytic effort being made against 
him. After deliberation, I came to the 
same conclusion, and we then began to 
think.in terms of expanding the force 
to the strength of a reinforced battalion, 
more or less.
