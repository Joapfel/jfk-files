REMEMBER IT), IT WAS DECIDED THAT C/O SHOULD VISIT WHITTEN AT HIS· 
HOME, HEAR HIM OUT AND THEN INFORM HIM THAT CONTACT SHOULD BE 
DROPPED FOR BOTH HIS AND C/O'S SECURITY UNLESS AN EMERGENCY AROSE. 
FURTHER, C/O WAS TO TRY AND PUT WHITTEN IN CONTACT WITH THE EMBASSY 
CONS.ULAR SECTION. AFTER MAKING ARRANGEMENTS, C/O VISITED WHITTEN' S 
HOME ON THE MORNING OF 28 AUGUST. DURING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL 
TWO-HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTE DISCUSSION, WHITTEN RECOUNTED ALL OF 
THE DETAILS OF HIS DOMESTIC PROBLEMS, MANY OF THEM QUITE PERSONAL 
AND INCLUDING ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTER-
ACCUSATIONS INVOLVING HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN, REMINISCED ON HIS 
PAST WORK EXPERIENCES, AND SPOKE OF HIS RESOLVE TO COMMIT SUICIDE. 
AS IT TURNS OUT, HE DROVE HIMSELF WITH.GREAT DIFFICULTY TO THE 
NETHERLANDS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WITH THE INTENT OF HAVING 
HIMSELF EUTHANATISED. HE CHANGED HIS MIND, HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING 
REALIZED THAT HE HAD, IN FACT, MADE THE TRIP BY HIMSELF; WHEN HE 
RETURNED HOME, HOWEVER, THE PROBLEMS BETWEEN HE AND HIS SPOUSE BEGAN 
IN EARNEST (SHE, APPARENTLY, DID NOT APPROVE OF THE EUTHANASIA PLAN). 
4. DURING THE DISCUSSION, IN WHICH WHITTEN BROKE DOWN IN TEARS 
SEVERAL TIMES, HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS DETERMINATION NOT TO MOVE BACK 
TO THE U.S. ACCORDING TO HIM, SHOULD HE DO SO HIS FAMILY WOULD HAVE 
HIM PLACED IN A NURSING HOME - A FATE WHICH HE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT 
WILLING TO ACCEPT; AS AN ALTERNATIVE, HIS WIFE HAS INDICATED TO HIM 
THAT HIS FAMILY MAY INSTEAD BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR A SMALL APARTMENT 
FOR HIM IN WHICH TO LIVE, BUT THAT SHE WOULD PAY ONLY OCCASIONAL 
VISITS AND WOULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM. (THE LATTER REMARKS WERE MADE 
BY HIS WIFE DURING AN UNANNOUNCED TRIP BACK TO AUSTRIA IN CA. JUNE 
96. AT THAT TIME, THE WIFE DID NOT INFORM WHITTEN OF HER PRESENCE 
IN THE COUNTRY, BUT WHITTEN LEARNED OF IT THROUGH A FAMILY FRIEND. 
AFTER A CONFRONTATION IN WHICH WHITTEN BEGGED HER TO STAY, HIS WIFE 
BROKE DOWN, TOOK SOME MOMENTOS FROM THE APARTMENT AND LEFT. ) THIS 
SECOND ARRANGEMENT WAS ALSO NOT SUITABLE TO WHITTEN. 
5. AFTER COLLECTING THE INFORMATION THAT WHITTEN HAD (WHICH 
STATION BELIEVES WILL BE OF LITTLE OR NO USEFUL VALUE), C/O 
EXPLAINED TO WHITTEN THAT FOR SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, IT WOULD BE 
BEST IF HE NO LONGER CONTACTED C/O EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF AN EM 
ERGENCY, .BUT JN~TEAD DEALT WITH EMBASSY CONSULAR SECTION. C/O SAID 
THAT HE WAS SORRY HE HAD TO DO THIS AS HE HAD ENJOYED GETTING TO 
KNOW WHITTEN, BUT THAT THE CONSULAR SECTION WAS BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. WHITTEN RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT 
C/O NEED GO NO FURTHER IN TALKING ABOUT SECURITY AS HE HIMSELF WAS A 
"STICKLER" ON THE SUBJECT DURING HIS CAREER AND COMPLETELY 
UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF C/O'S REMARKS. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, HE 
INDICATED THAT THE CONSULAR SECTION HAD ALREADY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
HIM REGARDING THE JEWELRY THEFT AT THE REQUEST OF WHITTEN'$ 
DAUGHTER. ALTHOUGH THE DEPUTY THERE HAD INFURIATED WHITTEN BY 
MAKING CERTAIN REMARKS TO HIS DAUGHTER, WHITTEN HAS APPARENTLY 
ALREADY ESTABLISHED SOME RAPPORT WITH THE CONGEN. AND HAD AN 
APPOINTMENT TO SEE HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
6. WHITTEN WAS CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT HE MAY HAVE MORE 
"CONFIDENTIAL" INFORMATION TO PASS ALONG, AND ASKED WHAT ACTIONS HE 
SHOULD TAKE IN THE EVENT HE HAS SOMETHING OF VALUE FOR STATION. AT 
SUGGESTION, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD CONTACT LOCAL RSO AS WAS
