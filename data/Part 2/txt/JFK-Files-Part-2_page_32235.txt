gathering in depth on Cuba should be identified as a"lfrimary 
objective of the national intelligence effort. 
8. Whenever possible, U.S. actions against Cuba 
should be multilateral, preferably based upon theTTreaty 
of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact) or on resolutions 
adopted by the Organization of American States. The 
newly-won hemispheric solidarity on the Cuban issue

marginal value and which might split the hemisphere. 
Overt and covert annexes of specific actions in a 
support of this policy will be prepared.

of Cubans in the U.S. and the use of such Cubans inside 
Cuba; extensive air activitj including both high and low 
level flights primarily directed toward suweillance and 
collection of intelligence, and which may also have the
