Chairman 
Select Committee on Intelligence 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
Copy for Senator Baker,/ 
We have received a letter from the Honorable George Bush, 
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, relative to the destruc ... 
tion of papers and material which he has held for sometime relative 
to our request. Our action was taken to facilitate the inquiry being 
undertaken by your predecessor committee under the chairmanship of 
Senator Frank Church. 
In view of the fact, as we assume, that all of Senator 
Church's committee records have been turned over to your permanent 
Select Committee, we would appreciate your advising us as to whether 
or not you want our original letter to stand and the papers and other 
materials to still be held. Could you give us the Judgment ot you 
and your Committee on this matter? 
With best wishes., we a.re
