While a few of these men [from the 
Domestic Operations Base in Miami] impress 
me as being good.types,. for the most.part 
I found them to be too immature and lack­
ing in experience to qualify for the job 
at hand. In any even·t, they are not in 
my judgment worth the $1,000 per month 
which we have to pay them. I would like 
most of them to be GS-4, 5, and 6 students

I also reviewed the problem in the 
light of the many gaps in policy approval 
for JMARC, all of which complicate project 
planning. By the time I arrived back at 
Headquarters, I had fairly well convinced 
myself that it is unrealistic for the

I discussed my thinking with Col. Hawkins 
at length, and found that he shared my 
view. As ~ result of thi's ctiscussion, we 
re-evaluated our capability and presented 
you [the DDP] with the recommendation that 
we limit ourselves to preparing a force 
of 600 maximum to be used in the manner 
we outlined to you on 16 November. I 
still feel this recommendation is quite 
valid given the limitation on real estate 
that we are presently working under. If 
it turns out that we can acquire policy 
appr·oval for the real es·tate in the interior,
