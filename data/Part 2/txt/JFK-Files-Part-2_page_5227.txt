Although not mentioned-as an option in_your letter, I would like to be 
pennitted to ~cview .the doQuments_ containing mY. name which you are being obliged 
to release. When I retiree( l gaye up all ~ with fomier sources. One of the·se 
_·, ·.popped up in the New-York Thnes last week. Some others·may still be ~ive, and in 
" need of protection, although as·-J recall, ·none had any useful data concerning the 
assassi!!~tion. If the sources arc to be exposed, I feel very strongly that they are 
entitled to all the protection we· oan afford them. I will be in the Washington D.C. 
area in November 1997, and wo~~d b°' willing to review these documents. 
. . 
In tenns of the provisio~s ycsu cite for exceptions in your letter, (A) I consider 
' myself a person (~eni?) ·whose id~ntity ourrent1y requires protection. 
The cover I ~ using,· provided by the State Department, is (B) an 
intelligence method whioh is CUITently ~tilizcd. 
The public d(sol~s111'C) of.my n.ame as part ~fthe assas_sination reoord (C:3) 
I • could reasonably be: expooted • to co~stitute an unwmantcd. invasion of personal 
f privacy, ancl :that invasion. is io substantial that it outweighs the public interest. l 
cannot resistdefin.ingJhc p\lblic:interest in thi~ matter as "publio morbid curiosity." . . .. . . 
The publio disclo~ure·ofmy nRJ?le·as part of the assassination record (G.4) 
wauld probably oo~p:romis~: the.-existence of an. understanding of confidentiality 
cwrently requi.tjng· ·protcotioii'· between a_ govenunen( agent "and a cooperating 
individual or foreign gt)vernmentp. an.4 public disclosure would b~ so harmful that it 
outweighs the public' int"erest. • I was COS in Bolivia when the assassination 
occurred. I wa~ in close touch with the Bolivian Government security chief at that 
time, and with the Minister pf Interior, 811d we probably interohanged data on the 
murder, although they could provide nothing useful. Also, the Station was probably 
\ . task~d to query all of our source&" on the matter, ·again with negative results. The 
revelation of my name and the_ identities of liaison contacts and unilateral sources _
