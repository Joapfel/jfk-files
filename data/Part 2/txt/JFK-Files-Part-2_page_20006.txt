lve are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much 
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace 
movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from innny of you, 
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief. 
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally, 
as i-.-e learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only 
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. ls women, we bear the major 
responsibility for the preserv~tion of life, and thus a major responsibility 
in the peace movement, 
Enclosed you w~ll find an announc~nent of the latest national women1s effort 
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds 
to send representatives to Wnshington. We hope that you will also support this 
effort, to insure representatjcn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon 
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort,

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration 
in Portland at
