FROM: ~ne~:-E~;~~-/ • 
Chief, Information Management Branch 
Office of Personn~l Security 
SUBJECT: 
i 
OSWALD, LEE HARVEY:. 
AIN: 0351164 
1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31 
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center fdr the Study 
. of Intelligence(HRG/CSI), via ~he Directorate of 
Administrationiinformation _Review Office, with researching pre­
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was_, 
generated by the John F. Kenne.9'\f .. !}..,"J:rat;;;---~-~:J._ire to review and 
declassify relevant m.=-.t.erial. The results of this review were· 
forwarded to thP, nRG/CsI·on 27 February 1997 . 
. _ 2. During t·he Informa·:ion Management Branch's 
(IMB)research in response to :he.above tasking it was noted that 
Volume V of the Oswald files ,,as not on the shelf where Volumes 
I-J:V and VI-VII were located. A search of the· entire area where 
the volumes had been maintaine'r1 failed to locate Volume V. The 
IMB Files Section was subseque~tly charged with conducting an 
all out search for the missing '•volume. The search failed to find 
Volume V . 
. 
3. In July 1997, the Os~ald files were reviewed page by 
page prior to being turned over to_HRG/CSI and another attempt 
was made to locate Volume V or ~o locate persons who might know 
what happened to it. Volume V ·w,1s not located nor were any 
persons located who were knowleQgeable of its status. 
4. During the complete r~view of the Oswald files no 
"ti.me gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall 
ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V 
had been consolidated into other ,..rolumes or that Volume V never 
existed, but that a numbering err~r resulted in what should have 
been Volume V being labeled as Vol_ume· VI. The use of Roman 
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this 
error to occur.
