• 9. The Election Prbcess 
. Q. Mr. President, in view of your 
assignment to Vice President Mondale 
r~garc!ing the election laws, could you 
1 .. give us your view, sir on the direct· 
; election 'of a President versus the Elec-
\ 
.. toral College. And also do· you think 
. ·that. the public financini:: should .be ex­
tended to Congress -as wc a as the Prcsi-
1 dency? . . • 
! A. There are three basic questions 
/_ that _come up. In the first pla,ce, I do 
1~ favo~ at ,_least ·an automatic ··vote py 
;: Presidential electors once the general 1 election is completed. 1 think the Etec-
, .. toral Colllege, for instance should· be 
):·eli-m.inated. Whether • the r~tio among 
( s,tates of votes ought to be changed 
~Im not prepa_red to comm-en_t on now. 
l ,· .. _,.,. :,., ·;,,:; -1;n;.:ai:.1ng 01 i..011i;r.:s­
; sioniil elections by publoic funds-it has 
i proved to be successful, I believe, in 
/ the ~residential election .. I strongly 
favor that, yes. And the other element 
of the overall package would be a sim­
ple way.-for American people who are 
·. citizens and 18 years old t_o register 
to vote. And I am committed to that 
proposition and the Vice President has 
graciously consented to ·take ·on this 
;overall election process responsibility. 
1Those three will. be basic elcmfilnts of 
,the proposals. ',. • • • 
1 10~ Relatio~s With Cuba 
i : Q. Mr. Prcside~t, are you, preparei;l 
; to :lift the trade embargo 'against Cuba 
. a_s one step toward no~malizing rela-
: .t1ons? - • 
: 0: A,: I think any substantial -move in 
• 'our :telationship with Cuba would havf!i 
, ;to await further discussions with them-· 
· :indirectly, and. -also some tangible evi-
:dence on our p·art that they arc willing 
. to restore basic human rights in Cuba, 
' involving the number· of prisoners who 
: ~re b'eing held, their attitude toward 
~verseas adventures such as the·_-one 
. In Ango_la, and other ma:tters. So l can't 
: say wha:t might c~e dn the future. 
:< I'm willing, though, to discuss these 
' mattei.:s with the Cuban leaders. At ~his 
:· lll!'e we have 1110 direct relationships 
· !{Ith them, politkal. But through inter~ 
inediarics comments are being ex­
changed b·ack and forth. Most of my. 
-comments are in public statements like 
this, but we do liave ·m.essages. coming 
back from people who visit Ou'ba. 
i 11. Defense ·savings Goal· 
Q. In ~~swer to ah ea,rlier ·question, 
.Mr. President, you saio. that you could-
1\'t say whether ne,:t year's· defense 
bu,dget will be lower or higher than 
lh,1s year's. But as I understood your 
b.rlier postion, y~u did want to achieve 
l five to seven billion ·doHar savings • 
regardless of the overal'i level of spend­
ing. Do y~u still hold with that figure? 
Is that st1'1l your goal and a col_llmit-
11ent? 
I: A. Yes .. The analyses that I've made 
If the defense budget so far-which 
ts you know has been limited to about· 
\ month's study just part-time-indi­
;a,te that that's a goal that will be 
reached. . • . -
\: 12. Natural Gas Deregulation 
. 14. Rise in Gasoli11e Tax 
' . Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri­
fices that you say your upcoming ener­
&Y program is going to demand; Is it 
hk~ly that on~ of those sacrifices is 
~oing to come 1n the fonn· of ,a largely 
mcreased Federal gasoline tax? • 
A. ~ don't know how to answer your -
questions about· specifics of the propos­
al. I want to make this· clear. The pur­
J?ose of -the energy .policy evolution 
1s not t.o cause sacrifice or hardship 
among ~he American people.Unless I 
can demonstrate that in balance the 
temporary sacrifices in ·a certain area 
. a-re far overcome by immediate a,nd ul• 
tima_te benefits then nobody's going to 
buy 1t. 
And I b~lieve that we've,. npw got 
suc_h a horrible conglomeratlon 1of twi:~ • 
fusmn in the energy field that inobody 
Kn') 1UC' u,h::.t~~- nn;n.n- 'trt •-he1·r~ n~xt 
So I .U1ink thatth' sa.criflc~ :v'.iii-r"b~ • 
far overcome by the benefits that the 
~ioan _ people<,..ill -be easily-able to 
discern-for themseJ·_ ,·s. . 
15. U.S. Ro! oJt Canada 
Q. You said tha1: :n spite of the fact 
that the Canadian • ,eople would have 
to determine their future for them­
selves, particularly in regard to the 
sep!l-ratis1!1 issue in Quebec· that .you 
had ' confidence that the issue would . 
be straightened out relatively peaceful-
1r, Do you really think that there is 
little concern in this country about the 
future of a unifiM Canada and is there 
,anything really:. that we can do a.bout 
it? . 
A. There's a great deai of ooncern 
in • this country about the future of 
Canada and I have complete confi­
dence, as I said ih an interview with 
the Catj_adian news media in the sound 
jµd?ment <?~ the Canadiari people. 
_ Im f.am1har-and even more familiar 
• to~ay th~n. I was two days ago after 
Pnme Minister Trudeau's visit~with 
the problems in Quebec and the inclina­
tion of some of the French Canadians 
to have an independent status from the 
rest of canadian Provdnces. 
I_ don't. know what's going to 1be the 
ultimate outcome. But I believe that· 
we are so <;:losely tied together with 
Can~da on a mutually beneficial basis, 
s~·armg • rroblems, sharing opportuni­
~1es, sharmg_ trade, sharing manufactut­
m~ comp-atues that have joint owneir-
. shlp, ou~ exchange of ·energy sources, 
our sharing of the St. Lawreoce Sea­
way, the Great Lakes as far as water 
poJlutiori is concerned, the bringing of 
. Alaskan oil and natural gas down to 
us that we have got to have a continu-
• ing relationship with Canada. 
My own personal preference would 
~e that the commonwealth stay as it 
1s and that. t~e not be a separate 
Quebec province. But that's a decision 
for the Canadians to make and I would 
certainly ·make no privat~ or pub-lie 
move to try to determine the outcome 
of that great d·ebate. 
16. Keeping Campaign Promises 
Q. Mr. President, you've had a month 
no"':' to enjoy the view: from. the Oval 
Office. Do you think you'll be able to 
· keep. fuJly all- the campaign promises 
you made? 
. , Q. Mr. President, in letters to the 
: iovemors of Oklahoma, Texas and 
' L?1:1isiarna last October, you said uncon-
!1t10naHy that you would work with 
Congress to· deregulate new -natural • • 
ias. And I wondei;ed 'if y.ou planned 
lo keep that promise, •and if so how 
A. As you know, we have issued what 
I _ belie_ve is the. complete book of i:ny 
campaign, ,promises, which is, I pre-. 
sume, bemg made available to all of 
you. My determination is to keep all 
:those promises. 
• Obviously if circunistances should 
• change I would h~ve to reserve the

peace in the Middle East. He also ha'd 
a chance to compare their positioma 
on· _issues-which ones they found tQ. 
be m harmony, which ones ther.e was

We also invited the leaders •Of, ali,

m the Middle East, all of them, before 
the end of May. The first visit of :one· 
of _those leader~ will !)e Mr. Rabin.-1J, 
believe, March 12. And he will be fol, 
lowed by_ the ·leaders from Egypt, from 
J-0rd~n and from Syria, from Saudis: 
A~ab1a.-and I look forward to ·meeting 
with them. • • 
~t ~~at noint I ·hon·e I. will have·:a; 
very: .,clear picture_, of.. wnaL -; ,,:.: l~

The same thing applies. to the situa­
tion that exists between ourselves.:anci' 
Turkey, ourselves and Greece .-our­

We can t imposE! our will ~in other 
people. But _if they honestly want to

it's go~ t~ be done primarily by those 
countries involved. .! 
We have begun again, and withi~ 
the last Week, 01.1r discussions on the 
Panama Canal Treaty. We l1ave two· 
extremely good negotiators and I·ho1w 
. that_ we will have success there, There!s. 
no way that I can say at this poi.n~ 
what degree of progress we have made 
H.!.t_just beginning. • . ~. 
So ~hrou&hout the areas of high dis~

that _I don't have time to mention we'.re . 
prob!n~. as best we can to discern som.~ 
ppss1b1hty of resolution of those ten­

":Ne are meeting today, in fact :ah 
this week with the British, to try ti;,

But I've only been in office a month 
I don't claim to know all the eas)( an;

are, not ~oing to be easy 'to solve.' But 
we.te going to do the best we can ope!!e
