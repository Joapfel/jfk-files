It is interesting to record the reaction within 
the Agency to the Free· report: 
. C/JMA:RC lame_nted .the _fact that the 
Lloyd Free_ report ev.idently has gotten 
·into the hands of the Cuban Government 
and will probably be. used with devastating 
effect at·some pe>int during the meeting 
[ the upcoming OAS Con_fererice scheduled 
for San -Jose, Costa Rica]. He told ADDP/A 
that he felt the "Department of State. would 
have to be prepared to sacrifice Mr. Free's 
report on the proverbial "alter of gold." 
The· point was made ·strongly to ADDP/A 
that-the Free report, in fact, is not at 
all valid other than for a limited 
"sample" of the City ot:,Habana. ADDP/A 
agreed, btit said he did~ot think State 
should be made aware of the fact CIA 
actually pai_d for the report. He further 
indicated that he· was still endeavoring 
to find out'how the report copy of which 
CIA riever received in full -- got out of 
control.* 25/ 
The substance of the Free Report appeared in the 
New York Times and also in a Peter Edson column which 
was reported to be syndicated in 600 newspapers. In 
' 
passing this information on to the DDP, Chief, WH/_4 
suggested that·"the survey, in the opinion of WH/4 
* Chief, WH/4 apparently misread the significance 
of the Free report: because,· as the_ .report points out, 
• the most··serious opposition was, in fact, in the 
Havana area, which.incl-uded the heaviest sampling of 
opposition sentiment.
