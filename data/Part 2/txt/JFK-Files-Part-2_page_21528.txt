Mr. Harvey. It is both. 
Mr. Schwarz. But it· does. not recite as an objective, t: . , .. -; ... . L: 
assassination. or, assassi:nation':: capability. 
Mr. Harvey. No, it does not. 
Mr. Schwarz. Instead, it cites 
Mr. Harvey. Which, I would like to point out, was a 
perfectly legitimate objective and was not in a sense, a cover 
story except that if this project had gone so far as to the 
actual recruitment of any agent for assassination or the target­
ting of any target or the mounting of any operation, it would 
have been under this as a cover. But, those assets that were 
spotted by QJWINN, for instance, under ZRRIFLE were also 
honestly considered for possible clandestine procurement 0.r·;\:-., 
So it's -- maybe I'm not making this clear, it's a cover 
in a sense, but it's not a phony cover, in other words. 
Mr. Schwarz. Dual purpose. 
Mr. Harvey. It was a dual purpose.
