This message itself was deemed too sensitive to ~e retained 
at "the station: '"this dispatch should be reduced to cryptic 
necessary notes and destroyed after the first-reading," (CIA 
Dispatch, .AUDW-147, 11/2/60.) 
QJWIN arrived in Leopoldville on November 21, 1960 (CIA Cable 
IN 49486, 11/29/60) and returned to_ Europe in late December ·1960 
(CIA Cable OUT 54710, Director to Leopoldville, 12/9/60). 
The CIA Inspector General's Report _said that_QJWIN 
had been recruited earlier by Arnold Silver 
for use in a special dperation in the Congo 
[the assassination of Patrice Lumumba] to be 
run by Justin O'Donnell. (I.G. Report, p, 38.) 
However~ both O'Donnell and Bissell te~tified that O'Donnell re­
fused to be associated with an assassination operation.* Instead, 
O'Donnell said he went ·to the Congo to attempt to snatch Lumumba 
from the protective custbdy of the U.N. guard and place him in 
the hands of the Congolese army. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 13-14, 
37.) 
According to O'Donnell, QJWIN was a man who was capable of 
undertaking an assassination mission: 
O'Ddnnell: ... I wotild iav that h~ would rtot 
Sea man of many scruples.· 
Q: So he was a man ca.pab le of doing anything? 
O'Donnell: I would think so, yes. 
~: And that would include assassination? 
O'Donnell: I would think so. 
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 35-36.)
