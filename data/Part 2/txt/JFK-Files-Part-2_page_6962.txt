of this legislation sponsored by Chairman Burton, of which I am one of the 
original co-sponsors. 
I'd be pleased to answer any questions. 
REP. HASTERT: Thank you, Chairman - or, Mr. Stokes. And I really appreciate 
the work that you've done here. I have just two brief questions. Actually, 
three. Do you believe that the Ford Review Board is up and running smoothly 
now? 
REP. STOKES: Absolutely. In spite of the delay of 18 months they have done just 
a yeoman's amount of work. It's just been almost incomparable to realize how 
much they have done. And to their credit, they feel that if given just this one 
additional year that they will complete the work. 
REP. HASTERT: And do you believe that this process is consistent with the goals 
of your original legislation in 1992? 
REP. STOKES: Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman.
