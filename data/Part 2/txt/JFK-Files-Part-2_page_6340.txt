SUBJECT: Proposed Regs by JFK Assassination Records Review Board 
Page and I are very concerned about the overly broad reach of the proposed regulations of the JFK Board. I have prepared specific 
comments that I will send by separate cover. In essence, we are concerned that the regs reach too far into Agency records and stray too 
far from the definition of a-n "assassination record" in the law. What input does CIA have into this process and what are the time 
constraints? It looks like a power grab. It seems to us that Cohen should engage immediately in his role as Chair of the Agency Release 
Panel. The full ARP might wish to address these issues at it 9 March meeting. Please advise.
