diamonds, and Al, what do. I do. Go ahead, talk tci 
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you 
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash. 
I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry 
store like you and buy them. I want diamonds. I'm 
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them. 
I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said, 
"Money, why does anybody want diamonds." I said it's 
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what 
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?" And Louis 
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said, 
this was at a cl.inner party up in their house. Hot 
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

Washington,D.C. Uncle Al.said, "I've got to give 
these diamonds back to the underworld or give them 
the cash." Isaid, "Listen, I told you tomorrow, 
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's 
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C. 
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is 
in Washington, D. C.

"Oh is he?" I said, "Yes_, 
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick 
because he was in my house with a hundred thousand
