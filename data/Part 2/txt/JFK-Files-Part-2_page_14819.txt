DEPARTMENT TASI( FORCE, BU-FFALO, NEW YORK: _ 
In October, 19 66, under the direction of the Organized, Crime 
and Racketeering Section of the Department,· a "task force" was organized 
as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to 
which were assigned representatives from various Federal inv.estigative 
agencies. 
On August 21 and 23, 19 67, the "task force" coirducted 
investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls, 
New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart, 
a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be

. utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that 
they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were 
watching: that people were inside the truck.). Surve'lllances conducted by the 
''task force, " including attorn.eys assfgned thereto, were readily discovered by 
Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the 
border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around. 
• Although Reinhart' s gambl_ing activities were, being carried on
