27 March 1963 
ECUADOR 
1. In 1962 there were an estimated 208 legal 
travelers from Ecuador to Cuba, including 50 who 
went for sports events. As of December, about 80 
members of Communist and Communist-front youth 
groups had been in Cuba since June undergoing guer­
rilla training. 
2. Travel reports showed 40 to 60 Ecuadoreans 
entering Cuba through Mexico in the first two months 
of 1963. 
3. At least 15 Ecuadoreans trained in Cuba 
are known to have engaged in paramilitary activi­
ties of a training nature following their return. 
4. Army forces in April 1962 rounded up 48 
members of URJE, a Communist-front youth group, 
at a training camp 50 miles west of Quito. Seven 
of those arrested had been trained in Cuba. None 
of the 48 was tried, and none was held for more 
than six weeks. This was the group whose leaders 
the Communists subsequently expelled from URJE 
amid published charges that they had wasted $44,000 
in Cuban funds~ 
5. Including the 48 URJE guerrillas, there 
have been an estimated 7q arrests in 1962 and 1963 
for guerrilla and terrorist activity, distribution 
of Communist propaganda, and painting of Communist 
slogans on walls. All of the propagandists were 
released after several days of detention. 
6. There have been three known terrorist at­
tempts, including the bombing of a theater and a 
radio station. Most of the participants are iden­
tified in clandestine reporting. They include 
several who have probably had training in Cuba. 
7. Ecuadoreans in positions of influence who 
have had training in Cuba include URJE leaders Mario 
Vera Arrata, Jefferson Quevedo, Enrique Medina, Car­
los Alvardo Loor, and Milton Mej1a; and Efrain Alva­
rez Fiallos, secretary-general of the Ecuadorean 
Communist Youth (JCE) and JCE leader Ketty Romoleroux.
