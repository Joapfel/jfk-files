As I mentioned very early in our session today, I am not 
aware that there was any exultation, satisfaction, or happi­
ness inside the Cuban Embassy over the assassination of the 
President. And I think, and my personal belief is, that 
everything points to Lee Harvey Oswald having done it, and 
done it alone. 
There is nothing I have ever seen or heard which would 
lead me to accept, for one moment, any complicity on the part 
of my Agency or any other agency of the United States 
government. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you, Mr. Shaw . 
I would like to add that as soon as the transcript of 
this deposition is available, we will be in touch with you 
ii so that you can have an opportunity to review it for accuracy
