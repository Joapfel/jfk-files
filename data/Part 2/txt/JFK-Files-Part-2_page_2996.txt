material or as footnotes backi~g up_ general .com­
ments. This required explicit permission from the 
DDP, and the rewriti~g or declassification of some 
material previously submitted to th~ commission. 
In August 1964 Warren Commission Assistant Counsel 
W. David Slawson requested permission to publish 
in the commission report some memorandums submitted 
to the commission by SR/CI/Research via CI Staff. 
Since some of the material submitted to the commis­
sion earlier was intended for background use only 
or contained operational information, the reports 
in question were resubmitted to the commission in 
sanitized versions modeled on the originals. The 
revisions were identified as coming from CIA and 
appe~red primarily in textual and footnote material 
on pages 258 to 280 of the commission's report.*
