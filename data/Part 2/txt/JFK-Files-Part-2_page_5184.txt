3. (U) Legal Authorities: The procedures governing the 
declassification and dissemination of foreign government 
information are set out in Executive Order 12958, as well as 
Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCIDs). Executive 
Order 12958 defines foreign government information as including 
(1) information provided by a foreign government, or any element 
thereof, with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the 
information and/or the source of the information, are to be held 
in confidence; or (2) information produced by the United States 
pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangements with a foreign 
government, or any element thereof, requiring that the 
information, the arraagements, or both, are to be held in 
confidence. Id., at §1.l(d) 
4. (U) Foreign government information is subject to a 
classification determination under E.O. 12958, section 1.5(c). 
When so classified, U.S. government agencies are obligated to 
protect that information from unauthorized disclosure. The E.O. 
requires that foreign government in.formation shall either retain 
its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification 
that shall ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to 
that requ1.red by the entity that furnished the information. Id., 
at l.7(e). Furthermore, agencies are required to safeguard 
foreign government information under standards that provide a 
degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the • 
originating government. Id., at 4.2(g). 
5. (U) Pursuant to his authority as head of the 
inteJJ_~ence community to protect all classified information from 
unau~~rized disclosure, the Director of Central Intelligence has 
issued Directives (that is, DCIDs) setting out the procedures for 
the declassification and dissemination of foreign government 
information. Intelligence obtained from another government or 
from a combined effort with another government, may not be 
released or authorized for release without its consent. DCID 5/6 
attachment§ C.3. Furthermore, the release of intelligence that 
would be contrary to agreements between the U.S. and foreign 
countries is expressly prohibited. Id., at§ C.5. 
6. (U) Finally, the very fact of intelligence cooperation 
between the U.S. and specifically named foreign countries and 
government components is classified SECRET unless a different 
classification is mutually agreed upon. DCID 1/10-1. Such 
inf~tQ:ion may be declassified only with the mutual consent of 
the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved.
