T P SECRET 65 
Director might have approved it, but it wasn't the way 
I briefed it, and it wasn't my understanding with Mr. Cotter. 
Mr. Wallach. In other words, you did give Mr. Cotter 
assurance that this was only a mail cover type of operation? 
Mr. Osborn. That was the understanding I had with Mr. 
Cotter, to the best of my recollection. 
Mr. Wallach. Have you subsequently discussed the 
West Coast operation with Mr. Cotter? 
Mr. Osborn. Yes, I have. Since I am under oath, 
I had lunch with Bill Cotter and Marv Gentile on Tuesday of­
this week, and we naturally discussed this stuff. We went 
over the fact that he recalled me, and that both of us were 
instrumental in terminating the New York project. And I have 
forgotten the exact context, but the San Francisco thing 
came up. And I told him, I didn't even know the mail was 
being opened until I talked to 
He said, you didn't? 
And I said, no. 
He said, well, it was. He said, I just found out about 
it. I presume through testimony or something. 
_But that was the essence of my discussion. 
Mr. Wallach .. Did Mr. Cotter talk to you about any 
FBI mail opening projects? 
Mr. Osborn. No, he did not. We were:in ~ public res-
taurant. We doubletalked.
