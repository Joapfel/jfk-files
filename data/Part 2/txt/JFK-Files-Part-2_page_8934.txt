in the minds 0f other KGB employees. iJ that NOSENKO 
travelled in a :rather influential cir,cle of friends in 
Moscow who were high in the Soviet Government. All these 
comments were cited as reasons for NOSENKO being an 
"important catch" for American Intelligence, but no one in 
the KGB really knows exactly how much information NOSENKO 
had concerning the KGB.

GOLITSYN (from personal acquaintance): NOSENK0 1 the son 
of the former Minister of Shipbuilding, was a KG& officer 
who had worked in the American Department and the Seventh 
Department of the Second Chief Directorate. GOLITSYN 1 while 
on his owe First Chi~f Directorate bu~iness, met NOSENKO two 
or three times in the American Embassy Section in 1953, 
and had seen hir.i occasionally at work during 1958 ·and 1959. 
When GOLITSYN asked him vhere he was ~orking in 1959 1 NOSENKO 
replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.· 
NOSENKO served in tl1e American Embassy Section from 1951 
until 1957 or 1958, and was specifically responsib_le for 
KGB coverage 0f American military peraonnel in Moscow during 
1953. For the remainder of his service in the Embassy Section 
until 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same iesponsi-

personnel or correspondents, but he was definitely in the 
American Department during the entire period. In 1957 or 
1958 NOSENKO was transferred to the Seventh Department 1 and 
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. NOSENKO did not 
work in the J\rneri.can Department of the Second Chief Directorate 
American Department at any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited 
the Embassy Section on at least three occasions from early 
1960 to early L96l, and vould have known if NOSENKO had been 
in the Section, particularly if NOSENKO had been Deputy Chief.
