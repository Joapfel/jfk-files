SELECTIVE SERVICE 
Selective Service investigations conducted by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have 
broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the 
·draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000 
pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago. 
In fiscal year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded 
as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year. 
Fo~ the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions 
were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a 
similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears 
that such a trend will continue durirtg the current fiscal 
year.· 
There follows a brief summary of an investigation 
of interest concerning a Selective Service matter. 
At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned 
Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with 
Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn, 
had refused to grant permission.· For his failing to register, 
Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968. 
Following arraignment and release on his own 
recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and 
Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the 
draft was filed in behalf of the subject. ri claims if a person 
under 21 years of age cannot vote, contro\ or dispose of 
his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate, 
then he cannot register for the draft without his parents' 
consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son 
principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his 
own conseience, bears the main responsibility and should 
be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this 
case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing to­
register for the-draft and rejected the mother's appeals. 
A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been 
scheduled for March 19, 1969.
