Determination of dangerousness of an individual 
(a) The dangerousness of a member or affiliate of a. s~bversive 
organization does not necessarily depend e~tircly upon his 
personal 0haracteristics 1 such is aggressiveness -0r·a dis­
position to violence. -Although these factors must be taken 
. into consio.eration in evaluating an. individual ts potent;i.al 
dang~rousness, o~her factors are essential in making this 
determination . .An indivic1ual 1 s dangerousness also depends 
upon the contribution he has made or is making·in the zdvance­
ment of the principles and aims of the subversive movement 
with which he is connected or his subversive potentialities 
in the event of a national emergenuy. Bear in mind that a 
subject active in a su1n••,rs:i.ve organization is not merely 
an isoh..-!;cd individual but- is a part of :?.n organization of 
which tl~e purposes are o_pposed to the best in·terests of tho 
U. S. An individualrs loyalty to :?, subversive organization 
-and the principles thereof :i.s a primary factor to ·l;ake into 
consicl.er~.tion in e.valuating his potential dangerousness; [how­
ev~r, regardless of evidence of subversive affiliation, all 
evidence developed during the course of a security in~estigation 
must be carefu.lly weighed for tb.e purpo·se of determining 
whether the subject 1 s activities de~ic~ him as a_pot~~lially 
dangerous ~ndividu~l in time of a·national emergency. Factors 
ha Ying a bearing u11on an ind-i vidua.l 's potential, da.ngerou sne ss 
are numerous and will vary in each case in degr·ee.] 
Among such factors are: 
I. Long continued membership in a subversive organization 
at tr-aining sohoo~s, II. Affiliation with or attendance 
especially leadership schools
