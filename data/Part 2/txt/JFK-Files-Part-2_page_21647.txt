Mr. Phillips. There is no indicator to say who it went 
to. 
Mr. •Schwarz. Does the"eyes only"have any significance 
to you in the third line? 
Mr. Phillips. Only in the sense that what 
was saying was, this may go over to the Defense Depart­
ment, but not through regular channels, and not to anyone else 
other than General Bennett. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did it go to General Bennett? 
Mr. Phillips. I do not know. 
Mr. Schwarz. And did· you pass it to someone? 
Mr. Phillips. If it did not go it would have been 
highly unusual for a.message to come in from overseas saying, 
give this to the head of another Agency, and for it not to 
be delivered it would have been extremely unusual. 
Mr. Schwarz. What wouldm the normal form of its 
delivery? Would there be a cover note put on it? 
Mr. Phillips. It would have probably been folded 
into an envelope and delivered by hand. Because if it is 
really an "eyes only" message of such import, if it goes 
through a communications channel, it means that they are going 
to be operators of machinery to see it, and so forth. If 
23 an American Ambassador overseas wants to get a very sensitive 
24 message u~ he has the option of sending it to us and saying, 
25 will you please hand carry this over to the Secretary of State?
