Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This informat.ion was reflected in 
the automated secu:::-i:y database.known as the Management Data 
?rogram/Personnel s~curity (MDPiPS). These files were 
originally miscellaneous files which were converted tot.he 
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conduc:ed 
of mic:::-ofiche records which were superseded by the automa~ed 
system. This hand s_ea:::-ch produced the same resul t.s as the 
automated search of MDP/PS.

been destroyed. Sijce OS files are usually set up in 
chronological.sequence, a search of files with numbers in 
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was 
undertaken. This sea:::-ch :::-evealed the approximate opening 
dates for the four of:icial HTLINGUAL files a~:
