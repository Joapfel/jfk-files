ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an s/w 
mesaage. He was generall:r attentive to the instruction given. How­
ever, 1n keeping with his te~erment, he was a litUe impatient 
during the preparation of the S/W message itself upon the cover 
letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered 
the basic steps in a satisfactory manner, particularly considering

reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message; 
then A/1 was alloved to pre?Ue the developer fro.'TI its dry pill form 
and to develop a second nraetice S/w message for himself. Folio-wing 
the period devoted to s/w development, a general review of S/W 
communications was ht:ld, the basic points apparently being well-fixed 
in J/l's mind. .
