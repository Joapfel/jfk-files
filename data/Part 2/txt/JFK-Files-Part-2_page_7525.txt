the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same bu:lding 
in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve 
it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB 
. officer wh6 taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and t~ 
West G·erman intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member 
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S. 
clandestinely for· about 10 years (speci fie dates unknown). Yuri 
was entrusted with their welfare _only, and. did not attend classes 
with the Cuban group. 
3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an 
indi~idual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description 
of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the 
name of Yuriy Ivanovich M0SKALEV, a Sov:ie t, reportedly a ·ooctor 
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international 
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier. 
Although there is no official 201 file on M0SKALEV, there is a 
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many 
of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S. 
scientists concerning ~OSKALEV's attendance and behavior at 
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater 
knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability 
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is 
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings. 
It is also noted that on occasions he reportedly was not 
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference. 
His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.
