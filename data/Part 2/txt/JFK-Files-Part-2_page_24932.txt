V. RECOHHENDATIONS 
Approved by 
.Drafting 
Subcommittee 
10/8/75 
(with possible reservation 
as to lpnguage of statute) 
During our long investigation of assassination, a number of vital issues 
came into sharp focus. 
Above all, stood the question of assassination. Our recommendations on 
other issues should await the completion of our continuing investigations and 
our final report. But we need no more information to convince us that a flat 
ban against ~ssassination should be written into law. 
We condemn assassination and·reject it as an instrument of American 
policy. Surprisingly, at present there is.no statute making it a crime to assas­
sinate a foreign official outside the United States. Hence, for the reasons

ing it a Federal crime to commit or attempt an assassination, or to conspire to 
do so. 
A. General agreement that the United States must not engage in assassina-
tion. Our view that assassination has no place in America's arsenal is shared by 
the Administration. 
President Ford, in the same statement in which he asked this Committee to 
deal with the assassination issue, stated: 
I am opposed to political assassination. This administration 
has not and will not use such means as instruments of national 
policy. Presidential ~ress Conference, Jun~ 9, 1975, Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, Vol. II, No. 24, p. 611. 
The witnesses we examined uniformly condemned assassination. They denounced 
it as immoral, described it as impractical, and reminded us that an open society, 
most of all, runs the risk of the assassination of its own leaders. As President 
Kennedy was report~d to have said: "we can't get into that kind of thing, or we 
would all be targets." (Goodwin 7 /18/75, p. 4) 
The current CIA Director and his two predecessors testified emphatically 
that assassination should be banned. Thus, Colby said:
