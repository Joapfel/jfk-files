A cable sent to Santiago, released by Karamessines, requested a 
report on how the Station planned to contact the three Chilean Generals 
--Prats, Valenzuela and Huerta--named in a cable ·of September 30. 
(Headquarters 449) The October 5 cable indicated that the report was 
needed for a discussion with Kissinger on October 6. (Santiago 556, 
5 October 1970) Karamessines presumed such.a meeting had taken place, 
although he had no specific memory of it. (Karamessines testimony, 
pp. 69-70) His calendar for October 6 indicates that he attended a 40 
Committee meeting on Chile. 
chaired the 40 Committee.

October 6 
The Station reported .that General Viaux was "ready to launch golpe 
evening 9 October, or morning 10 October." (Santiago 472, 6 October 
1970) In response, CIA Headquarters labeled the prospective coup one 
·"with scant chance of • success which will ··v-rtiate any further more seri­
ous .action." The Station was directed to try to 
11
stop ill-considered 
action at this time." (Headquarters 585., 6 October 1970) 
Kissinge~ testified he had not been informed of the Viaux plan, 
supporting-his recollection with the fact that the CIA memorandum of 
an October 10 conversation between Karamessines and Haig (see below) 
1··~· .. , 
makes no mention of any previous plots. (Kirsinger testimony, p. 24)
