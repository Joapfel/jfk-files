Emilio De Los Santos, head

JOtest over what he regarded as

G:toup. The army commander of 
ttie area in which the incident 
tdok place insists the deaths 
were the unavoidable result of . 
a \fire fight. If stories of

amon civilian and mili tar 
elements. On y the prompt ap­
pointment of Foreign Minister 
Donald Reid to the vacant post 
in the triumvirate appears to 
have helped avert a serious 
political crisis for the moment. 
The triumvirate has asked 
the cabinet--w~ich was chosen 
from and is responsible to six 
minority political parties--to 
resign to permit the appoint- • 
ment of a more independent group. 
This move has promrted strong 
protests fro~ four of the splint 
parties backing the regime, who 
stand to lose patronage; the 
outcome is unclear. • 
However, the National 
Civic Union, the only sizable 
party in the government, backs 
the cabinet reorganization. 
More important, the key leaders 
of the armed forces are provid­
ing the triumvirate with their 
support, which could prove cru­
cial in a political showdown.
