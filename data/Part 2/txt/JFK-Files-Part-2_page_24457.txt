Edwards: Well, I did not want to diag 
·Mr.McCone into this thing that in my 
opinion had petered out, and I did not 
want to involve him. (Edwards, p. 1$) 
James O'Connell, who was the case officer for the opera­
tion under Edwards, testified that h~ recalled that Edwards had 
told him during a discussion about the plots in 1965 that 
Edwards had not briefed McCone on the operation. 
As a matter of fact, I don't think he ever 
knew about it. From later conversations with 
Colonel Edwards, not recently, we talked about 
it, and he said that he wa3'" convinced that 
Mr. McCone never knew about it, it wasn't on 
his watch, so to spe~k, and he didn't want to 
get him involved. (O'Connell, pp. 37, 39) 
George McManus, Helms' Special Assistant for Cuba during 
(~) the relevant period, testified that he was not told about the 
assassination activities, and gave his opinion that if McCone 
had been asked to approve an assassination, he "would have 
reacted violently immediately''. ·k 
·kMcManus advanced two reasons for this opinion: 
(1) McCone had a great love for the President of 
the United States and he sort of looked at him 
as an older son or a biother, a very protective 
sense he had about the President, President 
Kennedy, and McCone would have immediately said 
Jesus, this is· a no win ball game. 
(2) Secondly, as an individual, he would have found 
it morally reprehensible. (McManus, p. 33)
