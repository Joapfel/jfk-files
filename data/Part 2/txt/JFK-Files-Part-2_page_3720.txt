DOMESTIC POLITICS IN CUBA 
Fidel Castro is continuing his 
effort to reduce the influence of 
the veteran Communists who were lead­
ers of the Moscow-oriented, pre-rev­
olutionary Communist party of Cuba. 
Castro's campaign against them, 
launched in a bitter attack in March 
1962, subsequently seemed to lose 
steam. Recent reports from knowl­
edgeable clandestine sources, how­
ever, indicate that the old liners 
are again on the defensive and are 
likely to suffer further in govern­
ment shake-ups .vhich may be in the 
offing. Castro nevertheless con­
tinues to move slowly in order to 
avoid undue disruption within bis 
regime. 
The only major veteran Commu­
nist figure to remain in Castro's 
good graces is Carlos Rafael Rod­
riguez, the head of the National 
Agrarian Reform Institute. Rod­
riguez' position has actually been 
strengthened in recent weeks with 
the raising of his job to cabinet 
level. He has evidently convinced 
Castro of his personal loyalty and 
of his ability as an administrator. 
It is also possible that Rodriguez 
performs a useful and trusted liai­
son role between Castro and Soviet 
leaders. He returned to Havana on 
22 December after a two-week trip 
to the USSR and several Soviet satel­
lites where, according to press ac­
counts, he was in contact with high­
ranking Communist Party officials. 
The old-line Cuban Communists 
remain strong, according to a re­
cent clandestine report, in the in­
termediate and lower echelons of 
the military and party hierarchies. 
Wherever possible, they continue 
Western Hemisphere 
their "sectarian" efforts to.secure 
positions for their comrades at the 
expense of Fidelistas. A clandes­
tine source reported hearing "ru­
mors" in high regime circles late 
last month that veteran Communists 
have banded together in clandestine 
cells to work against Castro. 
Che Guevara continues to be the 
Cuban leader most openly critical of 
the Soviet Union and the most' insist­
ent on the "necessity'' of accelerat­
ing the revolution in Latin America. 
Fidel Castro is said to agree with 
Guevara's position, but awareness of 
Cuba's own self-interest still com­
pels him to be more cautious in pur­
suing policies that could be inter­
preted as anti-Soviet. It neverthe­
less remains a key regime policy to 
encourage Communist revolution in 
Latin America. 
A clandestine source who is a 
high-level Cuban diplomat asserts 
that Cuban leaders privately recog­
nize that popular discontent with 
the regime is widespread. Be claims, 
however, that they are confident 
their unpopularity has reached its 
nadir, and that they are beginning 
to make up lost ground. They ex­
pect, for instance, that economic 
difficulties--a major source of 
discontent--will be largely over­
come within three years. The stra·t­
egy of the government, this source re­
ports, is to hold on unt1! the econ­
omy improves and until Cuban subver­
sive efforts elsewhere in Latin 
America result in the establishment 
of one or more Communist allies in 
the hemisphere. Then, the regime 
feels, it will be secure. (SECRET NO
