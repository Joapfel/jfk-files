MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 
SUBJECT: Proprietary Withdrawals and the Contingency Reserve 
• 1. I am attaching a memorandum of ~aw entitled "Proprietary 
Withdrawals and the Contingen~y Reserve . 18 This was discussed with·you 
last week . 
. 2. It is obvious that a number of policy decisions and actions wHl 
flow. from this decision. Our congressional committees need to be appro_; 
priately informed, the Comptrolle~ will need ta work out certain adjustments· 
with 0MB, _and I also believe th~re are ce:dain policy decisions that the 
Comptroller will have to work out with Finance with respect to pending 
transactions which would have placed returns from proprietaries in the 
Reserve. 'I shall send copies of. this memorandum of law to all- interested 
components and will assist them in any way they wish.
