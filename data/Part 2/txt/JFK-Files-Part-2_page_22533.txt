OTHER ACTIVITY, 1965-1974 
There are handwritten notes of conversations with 
Wiley dated 7, 14, 18, 19 and 24 May 1965. The gist is 
that Wiley was apparently planning a trip to the mid west 
and then later to Algiers in North Africa. During the 
19 May 1965 conversation between Moise Allen and Wiley, 
"Allen talked to Charles re Miss .M's (Mendoza's) comments 
that Charles had not complied with instructions re vouchers. 
He (Wiley) claimed misunderstanding and that he could not 
accurately furnish desired info on vouchers she presently 
held. Allen told Chrles to use his memory and any notes he 
had and to fill in desired info per the written instructions 
given him by Niss M. (Ethel Mendoza). He said he would da 
so. Allen then told him to explicitle follow written 
instructions from Miss M. (Ethel Mendoza) or vouchers 
could not be accepted ....... Charles was also reminded of 
reports due which he should get out prior to leaving on 
his speaking tour. He agreed." Apparently, the trip was 
to start on 23 May lasting until 1 June 1965 and the

There are notes of conversation with Wiley dated 
2 , 7 , 1 0 , 1 5 , 1 7 , 2 2 , 2 S , 2 3 June ; 2 , 6 , 9 , Ju 1 y and 2 7 
July 1965. Apparently Wiley was having trouble with 
his back at this time and could not sit down and bend 
for typing. He was given the name of Dr. David S. Baldwin, 
20 East 68th St., N.W., to contact. Regarding his travels, 
Wiley was told he would have to submit detailed reports 
of contacts to show what he is doing, etc. Apparently, 
the mid-West speaking tou~ was partially geared to gather 
funds for Algerian trip.
