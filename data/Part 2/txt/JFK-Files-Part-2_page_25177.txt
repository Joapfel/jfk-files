In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 0523),/the I.G. REPORT provides the following summary: 
"!UCII/\RDSON cabled a damage assessment. He concluded that DIHI! and the NHlJ' s are fully m1are 
that the USG encouraged the GENERALS to attempt a coup and that CIA was the instrumentality of 
this encouragement. !Te ,judged there was an even rossibility that all ma,jor programs could 
r;o forward as in the rast. He listed as a major dilemma the Stations future relationships with 
201. TUNG. He noted h:is dissatisfaction with TUNG as a GVN liaison vehicle throuJ!,h which to 
conduct PM prop;rams, but noted that the GVN had offered no alternative. Unless we. were willing 
to discontinue our INN, Laos border, and cross-border programs, we must continue to work with 
IUNG. (NOl'E: PM programs = paramilitary prog:rams J 
"The 'I'imes of Vietnam published charges that the CIA was plottinp; and financing a cour 
::mcl was givin~ asylum to the chief anti-DIT.']VJ Buddhist leader. The story was picked up and widel~·
