The following is a draft memo for Jeff. ~C!udl~is looking at it now so there may be more changes. Please let me know if there is 
anything incorrect here. I have a feeling Jeff will want a meeting with me rather than just the memo. Also, knowing him, he may want 
to deal with Tunheim on this directly since he was involved in this. I will let you know. 
1. Action: That you advise as per paragraph 7. 
2. Background: You will recall th~t you spoke with 
Chairman Tunheim of the JFK Board about the attached cable and 
the importance of protecting the phrase ~it]l_Me.xi.cans~J because 
it gives away Gia.1.sim involvement in a CW-tam operation. At. 
its 16 April meeting, at which I was present, the Board 
reconsidered its initial decision, but determined that the phrase 
could be released. 
3. It had just come to HRG's attention that this same 
cable was released ip full by the Board, with no objectibn by 
CIA, in September 199'5. CIA probably did not contest this 
release beic.r'use an excerpt from this cable, containing the phrase 
at issue, had been inadvertently released ~en prior to that. It 
is,. therefore, no longer possible for CIA o argue before the 
Board for th 7 protection of this.phrase in the current cable or 
to appeal this • release to the Wh1 te House. ...L -f~-- N',...1 , I\ __ 1 • ll Q--2

4. CIA is now in somewhat of an embarrassing position 
because it has strenuously argued that the release of this phrase 
would cause "clear and convincing damage~ to the national 
security only to find that this phrase has. been released with CIA 
acquiescence for at least seven months,with no ostensible damage. 
Conceivaoly, the Board could see this incident as a justification 
of their second-guessing our damage assessments, and could give 
us a much mor~ difficult time in the future.
