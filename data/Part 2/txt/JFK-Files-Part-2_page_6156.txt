Exhibit One is perhaps represencacive of the issues raised about the Review 
s_oard • s disclosure of infox,nancs. The Bxhibi t contains a message. sent by the FBI 
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in Houston to the SAC in Dallas and to FBI 
Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 26, 1963. four days after the murder <:>f • 
President Kennedy. n163 This document was originally reviewed by the FBI, and 
designaced for release under the terms of the ~FX Act with certain macerials 
redacted. Those redactions appear in Exhibit One and indicate whac material the 
FBI wanted to keep from the public. nl64

As Exhibit Two reveals, the Board decided that much of the redacced material 
could be released, most nocel)ly 1:he name of Mary Ann McCall, a hoecess at a 
Dallas night spot. n165 By the time che informant had interviewed McCall, Jack 
Ru.by had already killed Oswald. The Board. decided that the historicai record was 
well served by opening McCall's name, especially given her purported 
relationship wich che Dallas police and organized crime. The Board, however, 
also accepced the FBI·' s argument that the name of che person who provided the· - • • 
information al:,ouc McCall should be protected. Consequently, a document that had 
many redactions when ic was sent from the FBI to the Board went into the public 
record with only one name redacced. The Board was sacisfied that revealing the 
informant's name would harm che informant, thus outweighing the value of 
immediate disclosure. The Board used substitute language to make clear to 
students of the assassination chat the redacted portion was the name of _a 
"confidential informant" and ordered that the name be released in the year 2010.

Should ·it maccer to the Board that many of these informants, when 
interviewed after che assassination, did not provide positive information al)ouc 
Oswald or Ruby? There are countless examples of [*26) individ~als who, when 
contacted by incelligence services, indicated that they knew nothing about the 
assassinacion. The Board has taken the position chac intelligence services must 
demonstrate chat harm would come to the individual if her name wer.e released. 
Agencies muse be able to identify the individual, indicate that she is still 
alive, and establish that some harm will befall her. nl67 The threshold issue,
