Infiltration of nonsubversive groups 
a. General 
When information is received indicating that subversive group is 
seeking to systematically infiltrate and control a nonsubversive 
organization, available data should be submitted by letter with 
reco1nmendations as to initiating active investigation. Recommendation 
to undertake investigation should be supported by available background 
information concerning target organization (including name and 
locations, estimated membership, principal officers, and nature of 
activities) and resume of extent of subversive infiltration efforts 
(including identities of knm·m subversives who have joined target 
organization and positions held), provide brief statement as to 
investigation planned. If approved by FBIHQ conduct discreet 
investigation limited to determining and reporting activities 
are~related to or in furtherance of subversive infiltration. 
instructions apply to local chapters or affiliates as well as 
organization. 
b. Caption ar.d pref ace 
which 
These 
national 
Captions of communications should show that sµbversive infiltration 
of target organization is objective of investigation, not organization 
itself, e.g., "Infiltration of (Na."T!e of target organization) by (Name 
of subversive organization).n All communications prepared for • 
dissemination should carry prefatbry statement which clearly conveys 
this point, e.g., "This investigation is directed solely towards 
establishing the extent of infiltration, dominationt or control of the 
(Name of nonsubversive organization) by the ,(Name of subversive 
organization). It is not concerned with the normal activities of the 
(Name of nonsubversive organization)." In addition, preface should 
succinctly show the predication for out investigation of the·subversive 
group involved.~ 
c. Limitations on investigation 
(1) Other than with established sources, no interviews should be 
initiated with members, leaders, or officers of infiltrated 
organization without prior FBIHQ approval (except where they 
can be handled by suitable pretext). However, this does not 
preclude accepting information volunteered to FBio
