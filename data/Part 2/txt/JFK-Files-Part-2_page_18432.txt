Memorandum to Mr. J.B. Adams 
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice 
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees 
"(a) Notwithstanding any other 
other provisions of law, sums 
made available to the Agency 
by appropriation or otherwise 
may be expended for purposes 
necessary to carry out its 
functions, including --
11 (1) personal services, including 
personal services without regard 
to limitations on types of 
persons to be employed .... 11 
I 
.ipp.1>ei,~ would emphasize, however, that the counsel 
hiredArepre~ents the CIA, not individual employees, and 
that private counsel has the same problems as does their 
11in-house 11 counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual 
hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual 
employee in any situation which presents a potential 
conflict between the interests of the individual and the 
interests of the agency. 
CONCLUSION: 
We conclude that th.ere } s no authority for either 
the FBI or the Dep~ent to~ for.private co~p_!>E'3..,l 
selected 6y _g.:rnp.Io:y..e.es_c.all.eg_j;9_t~sti:l;y_befo_x_e_j:he_ SenC?-:t§; 
~elect Co..mmittee_or any_other legislative body. If an 
~employee called to testify in such aforum d"esires private 
counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes 
representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department 
impossible, the employee must decide if the possible 
consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel 
and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him. 
Furthermore, private counsel retained by an 
agency having authority to do so would be under the 
same disabilities as 11in-house 11 or Departmental counsel 
in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.
