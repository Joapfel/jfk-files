security and well-being of our Allies who have access to our 
sensitive intelligence by virtue of identity of interests or 
because of formal arrangements and pacts such as NATO. There 
are also useful confidential interservice agreements whereby 
certain foreign intelligence services conduct unilateral or

of their security is of continuing concern. In lower key, 
it is also in the interest of CIA to aid the security serv­
