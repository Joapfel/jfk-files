Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a 
memorandum identifying the file, describing the review process, and 
explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will 
then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the 
public. 
Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records 
will be subjected to the word by word review.-Records for which the staff 
has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to 
describe generally the type of records and explain the basis for finding no 
relevance. 
Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will 
review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records 
in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If 
· such records are identified, ttiey will be subjected to the same word by 
word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not 
be reviewed again. 
Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a document that genuinely have no 
identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent 
with the 1400.5. 
I recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it 
wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.
