(DEVELOPED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 20 October 1968, Lucien 
Todman, Computer Operator, Mutual Insurance Advisory Association (MIA!) , 
733 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, who resides in Apartment 4A, 1660 
Andrews Avenue, Bronx, New York 10453, was interviewed at his residence 
concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has known SUBJECT slightly over two 
years stated substantially as follows: 
Source and SUBJECT met in July 1966 when Source went to work 
at MIAA),and was introduced to SUBJECT who gave Source his orientation 
regarding operations within the data processing at MIAA. Source and SUBJECT 
became good friends and rode to and from work together since they resided in 
the same general neighborhood. SUBJECT visited Source's home socially on a 
few occasions, and they made visits to the United Nations and other cultural 
sites together. Source had not seen SUBJECT since May 1968 when HE was 
dr~ted into the United States Army. 
SUBJECT is a native of Puerto Rico, but Source assumed that HE 
moved to New York City when HE was very young inasmuch as HIS knowledge of 
HIS native island was very limited, and HE frequently queried Source, a Virgin 
Islander, concerning conditions in Puerto Rico. Source met SUBJECT'S father, 
HIS sister, and HIS brother, names unknown, on the occasion of the death of 
SUBJECT'S mother in early 1967, when Source attended the funeral. SUBJECT 
appeared to be very much attached to HIS mother and until her death most of 
HIS time was spent between work and visiting HIS mother at the hospital. 
SUBJECT never mentioned HIS father, and Source was not aware of his existence 
:µntil they met briefly at the funeral of SUBJECT'S mother. SUBJECT'S brother 
was in the military service at the time of HIS mother's death and is believed 
to have traveled from Germany for the funeral. Source believes that SUBJECT 
received a deferment from military service because of HIS mother's illness 
and the fact that HIS other brother was on active military duty. This gave Source 
the impression that SUBJECT was the family's main support. SUBJECT is an avid 
re·ader and has a keen interest in history. HE is a high school graduate 
md college at.~:rtfor a short period. Source believed that HE attended New 
York City College and took courses in history. SUBJECT is not known to have 
any organizational affiliations. HE and Source have held many discussions 
concerning local and world politics and MARTI has always staunchly defended 
the basic democratic philosophy of the United States Government. They have 
also discussed the subject of Puerto Rico's welfare, independence or state­
hood and MARTI has expressed the view that Puerto Rico's welfare and that of 
its people is best served under the island's present commonwealth status.
