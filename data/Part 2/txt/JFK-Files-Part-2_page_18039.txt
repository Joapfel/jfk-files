U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON 
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC); 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER 
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
_ On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike 
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He 
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day 
weekend and asked w~ether I would be available for 
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975-. I told him I would. 
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed 
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon, 
August 31, 1975. 
The interview with Epstein took place between 
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in 
amenitie~ and general conversation. 
Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked 
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge 
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to 
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before 
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta 
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau 
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps 
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King. 
I replied that I was aware. of certain taps placed and 
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there 
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told 
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and 
other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that 
I had not been personally involved in the King matter, 
that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and 
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information 
... which rqight answer his questions. __ -I told him that every­
thing-·tna t was done was properly record?d, that the 
records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs 
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine 
what happened.
