He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information 
which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations. He replied that 
the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would 
have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that 
despite the-fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive 
since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the 
very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in 
possession of sensitive information concerning that individual. Mr. Walll:l,ch 
pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed 
previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the 
material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau 
should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names 
are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two 
other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.
