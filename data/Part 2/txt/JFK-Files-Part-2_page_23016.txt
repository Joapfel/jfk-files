Mr. Baron. Which is an excerpt from the Inspector General' 
Report of 1967 at paqes 49 and 50, and I will ask you to read 
tho portions that I will bracket which deal with a report of 
a meeting betwceh yourself .... n~ ;1i~liam :Iarvdy involving tha 
supply of arms and equipment. 
(Pause) .; 
.. 
Mr. Halley. I have no reason to doubt this. I may have 
provided this support. I do not recall sitting in a parking lot 
observing --
Mr. Baron. For the record, we are discussing the passage 
that begins, "When the pills were given to Varona through 
Roselli, Varona requested arms and equipment needed for the 
support of his end of the operation. Roselli passed the request 
to Harvey. Harvey, with the help of [Mr. Halley], the chief 
of the JMl-lAVE Stat.ion, procured"_.,._-. 
Continuing.--And then it continues ·to say a large shopping 
list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were 
supplied in ,a parking lot of a driv~-in restaurant in a rented 
U-Haul truck. 
Would the cost of $5,000 have be~n an unusual expenditure 
at that time at JMliAVE Station for arms and equipment? 
Mr. Halley. No, $5,000 would not have been an unusual 
expenditure. 
Mr. Baron. Not unusual enouqh, in fact, for you to have 
a particular memory of th"' event?
