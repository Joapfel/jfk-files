The following two documents, which relate to the Martin ( 
Luther King, Jr. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee 
·request for documents: 
A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to 
Director, FBI, subject nor. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., SM-C (00 :Atlanta); 11and 
B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to 
Director, FBI, subject 
11
Communist Party, USA, 
Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security 
C (Stanley David Levison)." 
These two documents had been previously provided to the 
Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form. • 
Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel) 
were excised because 
11
·it could- result in identification of an 
FBI informant,
11 
and more than i2 p.ages of Item~- (a 29-page 
airtel) were excised because such portions contained information 
which 11tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing 
value. 11 A thtrd,documeJ.1.t which is needed by the Com..rnittee, and 
which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in 
excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau 
dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragr?ph of p~__g.W-._of the 
10/11/62 memorandtlftl from the SAC, Atlanta, to tX~e~,
