Memorandum to Mr c Adams 
Re: Lega~ Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees 
I sqggested to her that the Attorney General might approve th~ 
appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities 
would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for 
Intelligence Coordination in that he woulc;l be relieved of other Department 
responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations 
of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such 
special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to 
avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose 
on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege. 
Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases 
handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attori1eys 
represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive 
the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee 
become aware of information that should be communicated to another djvision 
of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other 
division. If the aiiorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the 
employee, he would not qe prohibited by the attorney-client privilege from 
making such conduct !mown to the Depa·rtment. 
I told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship 
between the special cmm.sel for furnishing advice to employees would be 
that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible 
for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice. 
She agreed. 
I suggested to Miss Vlagner that the Department special counsel 
could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances 
before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice a-s would be 
useful to employees called to testify. At the point wh?re the special counsel 
determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order 
to prote·ct his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the 
Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunibJ 
to hr'lve private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of 
Justice.
