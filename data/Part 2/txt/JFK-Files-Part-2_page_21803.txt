Mr. Sarno. No, when they were in New York, if they went 
to New York. 
Mr. Wides. Well, let's go back. 
The first question I was asking you was with regard to 
your relaying to CIA personnel the fact that someone who had 
been at in Floriaa was going elsewhere and you said that 
that happened, and then I asked you -- we wi+l come to the 
operational relationships in a moment -- how frequently that 
happened in regard to people coming to New York. For example, 
I assume that there were a fair number of Cubans generally in 
during the course of all of these years. 
Mr Sarno. No, sir, no, sir. 
Mr. Wides. Would you say several dozen or a dozen? 
Mr. Sarno. So far as I recall, there was only one that 
ever went up there, and he in turn collected two or three of 
his other friends around him who formed a little nucleus, but 
there was only one 1l~M11l1' • that went. 
Mr. Wides. What about other cities? What other cities 
20· do you _.:.ecall people went to? 
21 Mr. Sarno. In the United States?

Mr. Wides. Yes. 
Washington?· 
Mr. Sarno. No, sir. San Juan, Puerto Rico, and that's al , 
in the United States.
