MEMORANDUM FOR: JFK Assassination Records Review Boarc. 
VIA: Associate Deputy Director for Operations 
Associate Deputy Director for. Operations/Human 
Resources and Programs 
FROM: Eric L. Qualkenbush 
Chief, Office of Central Cover 
SUBJECT: Proposed CIA Name Release 
1. The Agency scrongly objects to the release of names of 
individuals p~esently under cover, whether active employees or 
separated employees .. As described below, this action would 
breach Agency commitments to these individuals who agreed to work 
under cover in addition to breaching our obligations:tb the cover 
providers. 
2. Employees sign a secrecy agreement (Attacnment A) upon 
entering on duty with the Agency. This agreement pledges.the 
employee's secrecy to information which is classified and has not 
been publicly acknowledged by the Agency and requires the 
employee to protect such information from unauthorized 
disclosure. This secrecy agreement, as long as it remains in 
force by mutual agreement, obliges CIA to prot~ct the identities 
of Agency employees, our c<?ver providers and covert activities. 
3. Because this secrecy agreement creates a moral as well 
·as legal bond between the Agency and the employee, it is Agency 
policy to protect the names of former employees who have 
separated under co'ver unless the Agency. and the employee mutually 
agree to remove the cover. Identifying as CIA those employees 
who are mandated by the Agency to use a cover story, i.e., 
Department of State or the "ABC" Corporation, for their entire 
Agency career as well as into their years after separation from 
the Agency, jeopardizes: 
• the personal safety of former employees;
