line was questioned by ARRB members at the 18 May meeting 
with CIA. The DO .representatives pr~sent ~ & McNair) 
deferred to the Office of Communications. • • 
Per 6 June 1995 discussion with(Don:·Ha,tch), DA/IRO, "the slug 
line is strictly an internal distribution line", and the 
re.lease of crypts or other designators in the slug line is 
not a communications issue; slug crypts. are not "comma

otherwise releasable crypts in the slug line of CIA cables. 
The DA response was provide to,,J. Gunn, ARRB staff, and Bill 
McNair, DO/IRO, via phone on 6 June 1995.
