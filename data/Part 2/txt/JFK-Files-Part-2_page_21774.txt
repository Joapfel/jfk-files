Mr. Sarno. 
Mr. Wides. And then Mr. Esterline replaced Mr. 
or was there someone between? 
Mr. Sarno. Mr. Esterline did not replace Mr. 
Mr. Wides. We understand that the station was operating 
very recently. 
Mr. Sarno. Well, I'm not saying~- you sae, the station 
you spoke to before, you spoke of, went out of business in 
June of 1960 when Mr. left. 
Mr. Wides. I see. 
Now, what was the relationship between yourself and the 
station? Administratively, and in terms of reporting, when 
you first went down there. 
Mr. Sarno. When I first went down there, I was outside. 
I believe it was concerning clearances to get me into the 
station, because I had never been working in a station before, 
so there were special clearances~- So at that time, those two 
months you're speaking of, I attended a course and I may have 
been sent out once or twice to interview a Cuban refugee or 
-
one of our agents who had left Cuba. 
Mr. Wides. And them you set up the program? Did 
you start that project; or was that started when you came in? 
Mr. Sarno. It had been started, the nucleus had been 
formed at that time.
