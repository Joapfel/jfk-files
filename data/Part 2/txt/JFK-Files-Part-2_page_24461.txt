I am definitely not saying that there was any 
effort to hide or conceal any information from 
the Director. There was not.. This was a dis­
cussion as to whether or not it was even neces­
sary or appropriate at this point to take details 
of this particular operation in an unassessed 
form to the then-Director at that time. (Harvey, 
6/25/75, p. 69) 
Harvey stated that he did not have any reason to believe 
that the assassination activities would have been "disapproved 
by the Director" had he been advised of the project (Harvey, 
6/25/75, p. 69) and stated that he hcf"d thought the plots "were 
completely authorized at every appropriate level within and 
beyond the Agency". (Harvey, 7/11/75, p. 66) When asked why 
McCone had not' been given an opportunity to consider the plot, 
Harvey replied: 
One of the things that I don't know from 
my own . . ; knowledge . . . is who was briefed 
in exactly what terms at the time of the so­
called Las Vegas flop that involved attempts to 
place a technical surveillance ... in Dan 
Rowan's hotel room. (Harvey, 7 /ll / 7 5, p. 46)
