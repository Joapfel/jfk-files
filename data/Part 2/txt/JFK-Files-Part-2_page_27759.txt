Dear Mr. Chairman: 
The Plaza Apt. 
18th & Parkway 
Phila., Pa. 19103 
May 25, 1977 
I am writing in order to clarify the present 
situation regarding the receipt of back pay, which in my case 
had accrued from January 1, 1977 until April 11, 1977. 
On that date in April, I visited your office 
to inform you that my husband had received the Republican 
Party endorsement in Philadelphia's race for District Attorney, 
and that I would be returning to Philadelphia to join him in 
his effort to win that·election. However, during that same 
conversation, I expressed concerns of the timing of my depart­
ure, for fear that if I left my position as Staff Counsel prior 
to the Committee receiving its funding, I might not receive 
my back pay. 
In response to my concerns, you offered me 
1 " • " your persona moral commitment that I could leave and your 
full assurance that the 35% which had been deducted from my 
salary for more than three months, would definitely b~ forward­
ed to me upon the Committee receiving its funding from the 
house. 
It ha~ now come to my attention through . 
Bob Lehner and Tom Howarth that I will not be receiving more 
than $800.00 of those monies owed me. 
While I would never consider asking for any­
thing to which I am not entitled, I respectfully submit that 
I ao deserve to receive that for which I worked during that 
3-1/2 mon-th period. 
I remain confident that this matter will be 
reconciled in accordance with our previous conversation. If 
there are any problems in this regard, please do not hesitate 
to notify me. 
I extend my best wishes and hope that all is 
going well with the Committee. 
Sincerely, 
~W-~~
