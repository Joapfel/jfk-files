his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA 
monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part

C. CIA officials 
There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical 
records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not 
contain any operational details. 
5. CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the 
case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, and a 
polygraph, none of which has a11y identifiable bearing on the Oswald story 
of the JFK assassination. 
As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is 
a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged 
connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads. 
Not all leads are successful. 
6. A CIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of 
the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam. 
There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the 
assassination. 
7. CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to 
Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer 
was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the wor1d. With 
the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no 
other documents that illuminate the assassination. 
D. Summary of problems 
First, establishing criteria for relevance 
Second, handling different types of records 
ex. 1 : entire file has no identifiable relevance 
ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not 
ex. 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not
