Special section 
Retain cards on individuals in following categories in special 
section for raasons stated. Maintain special section in sub­
sections as follows: 
(a) Espionage subjects 
Wb.en apprehension of subject will destroy chances of pene­
tratipn and control of operating espionage parallel or de­
stroy cha.noes of penetration a.nd control of "sleeper" 
parallel 
(b") U. S. Go"vernment employees 
So their identities can be readily determined and consider­
ation given to each before apprehension is ordered 
(c} Atomic energy program employees 
Because their app:r.-ehension must be cleared with Atomic 
Energy Commission representatives to avoid interference 
with atomic energy work 
(d) Foreign government employees 
So consideration ma.y be given to each on basis of relations 
then existing between U.S. Government and country involv~d 
(e) United Nations Secretaria~ and other international organ­
ization employees 
Because State Department must be notified after such appre­
hensions take place. This category includes U.S. citizens 
and immigrants or stateless persons not holding diplomatic 
visas and not having protection of International Organiza­
tion Immunities Act. 
(f) Pro-Tito individuals . 
Because such individuals, although pro-Marxist-Leninist, 
adhere to Tito form of communism·and it is not possible to 
predict whether Tito would become aligned with Russia in 
event of open hostilities or would align himself on side 
of U.S. This does not include members of communist groups 
who from time to time make statements in support of Tito,. 
but only individuals., particularly those of Yugoslav birth 
or descent, whose support of Tito is clear and uu<>quivo.cal 
regardless of Yugoslavia's foreign policies. • 
(g) Cuban 
So that, in event of emergency involving Cuba and U.S., 
special handling may be afforded those subjects on index 
solely on basis of pro-Castro affiliations, activities, or 
sympathies. (Security index cards. denoting such contain 
code "CUB" on line 1.) 
FD-122 recommending individuals in one of above categories should in­
clude words "Special Section" typed in upper right portion. Type prop­
er category in space after "Miscellaneous (Specify)." 
Cards for special section bear appropriate code letters in upper right 
portion designating proper subsection. When cards of subjects in 
• these cate-gories are received from flureati~ check for accuracy, place 
required additional data on two, and file alphabetically in appropriate 
subsection of special section. File third card in alphabetical section. 
Never file special section cards in geographical section. 
When subject no longer comes within one of categories of snecial sec­
tion., submit FD-122 with words "Remove from Special Section" typed 
in space provided after "Miscellaneous (Specify)." If card should be 
placed in unavailable section, add "Place in Unavailable Section" in . 
this space. When new cards are received from Bureau, destroy old. card-s. 
Special section card shall indicate priority level ·:ror appr~hension, 
although it is not contemplated that subjects in this section will. be 
apprehended under mass apprehension program~ Cases will be given· 
individual attention and subjects will not ·be apprehended in absence 
of specific'Bureau instructions.
