Safe Houses for use by defectors and the wiring of operations assets• apart­
ments or othe~ premises_where conversations with assetslwould be forth­
coming. For instance, 1n 1962 the apartment of a defector (Goli tzen) was 
wired. It was believed that Golitzen-had become unhappy with CIA treatment 
and was considering leaving the country. A telephone tap was placed on his 
phone to attempt to verify this. Brewer believes that these cases involved 
positive foreign intelligence gathering as opposed to b~ing security cases. 
From the names of the individuals whose conversations w~re to be recorded, 
Brewer presumes that most of these technical operations were directed against 
foreigners. 
Brewer is aware of a few technical operations relating to_security. One in­
volved the bugging of the premises of a former employee! (ln.$1'(@lt'lk11?,e)J'in 
about 19 64 because of his questionable associates. Another, in 1963, involved 
a telephone tap on a newsman (although Brewer was unaware at the time .the ta.p 
was placed that it was being directed against a newsman). (t/4'i) 
The Technical Division of the Office of Security may hate been involved in 
I 
some technical operations in the United States during the 1960 1 s and earlier .. 
However, their primary responsibility was counter-audiolwork overseas. Brewer 
does not believe that they would have been involved in significant amounts of

Surveillance Operations ' 
Prior to 1968, the Washington Field Office was performi:pg some unsophisticated 
surveillance. This generally related to surveillance of defectors and training 
operations directed against perspective overseas CIA ag~nts. The purpose of 
the training was to assist WFO in its surveillance techtiiques and to determine 
, I 
how well the perspective overseas agents could make contacts and "drops" without 
being detected. The Field Office had little equipment to undertake sophisticated 
surveillance at that time. (JJJv -J.B) I 
In 1968, with the creation of the Surveillance and Technical Unit, a much more 
concentrated effort was made in the, area of surveillanc~. ( 11.;_ -1)

Brewer remembers that at some point in time two sets of alias documents 
by Technical Services were given to the Metropolitan Pofice Department.
