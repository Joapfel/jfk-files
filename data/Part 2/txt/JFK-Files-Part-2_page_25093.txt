CONSIDERATIONS OF A PROPOSAL TO ATTACK 
COVERTLY THE CUB.C.N SUG.l\R INDUSTRY 
1. The ultimate success of the proposed program Nould 
depend, in part, upon the effectiveness of the economic 
controls for the stabilization of world sugar prices. 
It would serve no purpose to reduce Cuba 1 s total annual 
production of sugar if a subsequent rise in the price of 
sugar could net the Castro regime the same amount of 
convertible currency as it had before the program was 
undertaken. The argu--nents and rationale in favor of the 
economic proposals in the study appear to have validity. 
However, world economics is a most complex subject and 
involves many variable factors. The important points on 
economic controls should be coordinated with appropriate

agencies in the goverrL:1ent having responsibility for such 13 
matters. 14 
2. Assuming that success of the actions of the outline 15 
program can be achieved, it must be acknowledged that this 16 
would net assure the downfall of the Castro Government, or 17 
that if it did fall} a government friendly to the United 18 
States 1'1ould be installed. Russia has too much at stakey 
polit:I.c2lly, to all□ i•l an overthrow of a communist regime

for econocic reasons alone. Success of the proposed actions 21 
would, however, create serious difficulties for the Castro 22 
Goverr . .rnent and would be an additional means of exerting 23 
pressure against that gover~ment. 24
