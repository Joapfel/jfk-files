Attachment V 
Specific Requests From the Board 
Summary. The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act 
of 1992 mandates a number of specific actions on behalf of 
all government departments and agencies. One of these is 
to: 
" ... make available to the Review Board any 
additional information and records that 
the Review Board has reason to be-1 ieve it 
requires for conducting a review under 
this Act. n (Sec. 5 ( c) 2 H.) 
In the exercise of this authority under the Act, the Board 
made fifty-three specific requests for additional records 
and information in the form of sixteen (16) requests 
designated as "formaln and thirty-seven (37) designated as 
"informal." On each request, the CIA worked closely with 
the Board and Board staff to provide the information and/or 
documents requested and a written response which records 
such actions. • 
Discussion. As a part of this·Final Declaration, the 
CIA'has attached at Tab 1 a list of the fifty-three requests 
by number and a short description of the subject of each. 
At the Board's request this attachment includes at Tap 2 the 
specific response to the request numbered CIA-16 (Oswald 
Pre-Assassination File) 
Beyond the fifty-three requests, the Board raised two 
additional matters which tend to fall within the category of 
special requests: 
1) A request that the Agency review and declassify the 
Board's interviews of former CIA officer and Mexico City 
station employee, Anne Goodpasture; the Agency's response to 
that request is complete. 
2) A request for Board staff access to sealed 
Rockefeller Commission records held by the Library of 
Congress; these records were given to the Library by 
Rockefeller via a deed of gift which requires a letter from 
the DCI before access can be granted. This letter will be 
completed by 9 September 1998.
