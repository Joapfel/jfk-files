Q Now, the facilities that we have been talking about, 
training facilities,. were manned, then, by the Special 
Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special 
Operati6ns Group, is that correct? 
.\ :vell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably 
some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic 
Training Station is under the Office of Training and but I 
would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would 
' probably staff the training facility with their people who hav~ 
the expertise in paramilitary operations. 
Q ;;ow, were the people that were being trained at 
these facilities basically Cuban refugees? 
A Yes. 
Q And at the outset~ take it not many of those people 
were ~:vrterican citizens? 
A 
Q 
No.

I 1-1ould assume a great many have. 
By.this time. 
By this time,_yes.
