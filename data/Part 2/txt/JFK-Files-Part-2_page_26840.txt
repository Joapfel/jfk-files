ments on thein if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently 
because the common interests, -- we have a coITu~on interest in 
what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particulaJ 
operation going that thev wanted to cover exactlv what the Cubajs 
- I 
were doing, then we would task our people with that. 
For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into 
Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then 
there was absolute silence. So nobodv knew where the thing was. 
But we knew c1rr•ts were being loaded and we finally located the 
i boat in an African port, I mean the inte.rcept operators did, wh n 
.,ii:Jcame back on· the•· air. And this is the type of thing. As. 
a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200 
Cuban· troops.
