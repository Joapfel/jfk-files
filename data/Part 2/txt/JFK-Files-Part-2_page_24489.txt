c. THE QUESTION OF AUTI-IORIZATION DURING THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION 
The evidence on the issue of whether or not assassination plots were 
authorized during the Kennedy Administration is divided herein into two 
broad sections. The first primarily relates to the assassination operation 
involving underworld figures and occurring prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion 
of April, 1961. The second section deals with the Post-Bay of Pigs period, 
including the Roselli operation in the spring of 1962, Operation Mongoose, the 
laboratory schemes in early 1963, and the .IIJ.VLASH plot in the fall of 1963.

President about the assassination efforts or any of the other non-CIA persons with 
whom he was working on covert Cuban operations. The Kennedy Administration 
officials all testified that they did not kno,v about or authorize the plots. 
Furthennore, they said they did not believe the President did or would authorize 
an assassination plot. 
There were for this period no significant contempo~aneous documents.

When John F. Kennedy became President in January, 1961, Richard Bissell 
was still Deputy Director for Plans and the principal agency official respon­
sible for the ongoing efforts against the Castro regime, including both the 
Bay of Pigs operation and the assassination plots. Bissell is the only sur-
