Senator Hart of Colorado.. Assume something about, Mr. 
Angleton mentioned earlier, about the tendency to sweep 
penetrations under the rug in this country. 
!las there been a pattern in the past that still prevails 
of reluctance on the part of professional intelligence 
officials as well as administration officials to admit that 
we are susceptible to that? 
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think there is no question that 
t;Jlere has been a tremendous dishonesty in facing up to hard 
facts an intelligence. 
I'll take the Yorn Kippur war as an example. As you know, 
it was a complete failure in terms of prediction. l\s I main­
tained in my testimony, if you cannot make a proper estimate 
in a primitive area, then God help you when you come into the 
Bloc area, and I still hold by that conviction. 
But in that case, a few days prior to the Yorn Kippur war, 
the FBI disseminated a report to the President, the Secretary 
of State, Defense and the Director of CIA which purported to 
~ea discussion between Gromyko and a very senior source 
to the effect that they had given up on the l\rabs, that the:: 
would no longer support the l\ra~s, they would no longer give 
them arms, that they.were going to recognize Israel, and in 
·fact they had the draft notes ready for the recognition of 
Isruel.
