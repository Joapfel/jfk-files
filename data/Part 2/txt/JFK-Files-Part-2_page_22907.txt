Senator 
Senator Baker. It won't take but a brief moment. 
I think I owe the Committee ~,,·. a report. on the statement 
that Imada to the Press a few moments ago. I did not intend 
to make a statement, but that it becomes impossible to avoid 
when you step outside in these circumstances. 
The Chairman. It is a good thing for you that Senator 
Morgan is not present. 
Senator Daker. l\.s some of you may know, the news last 
night and again this morning carried a story to the effect that 
a _Colonel, a retired Colonel in the Air Force by the name of 
Fletcher Prowdy, has alleged by Alexander Butterfield was an 
associatd or an employee or a plant of something of the sort of 
the CIA when he was at the White Hou~e. 
I was askdd if I had any comment on that. I was asked if 
I was surprised by that, .and my reply was I had ·heard that 
story before~ I had never commented on it because I had no 
proof of it. And it's really so. As you know, in this town 
if you don't havd confirmation of it you get into deep 
trouble. 
Second, that I think it is worthy of looking into, and I 
said I thought +:he P_rowdy • statement added a new dimension to 
the rumors and I thought _that it did warrant further investiqa-: 
tion, that I would recommend that to this Committee at the· 
appropriate time.
