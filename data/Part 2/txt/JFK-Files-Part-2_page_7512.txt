Re 'International Conference on Diagnosis 
and Treatment of Radioactive Poisoning, 
Vienna, Aust. 15-18 Oct 62. "Most 
interesting aspect of meeting was conduct 
ad contributions of Prof. MOSKALEV of 
USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was 
listed as "Uptake and Retention of 
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was 
presented. When he spoke he changed the 
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake 
and Retention of Radioisotopes." His 
paper pres~nted nothing new and can be 
described as elementary. He apparently 
spoke no English.

above conference. Dr. D. J. SEMENOV and
