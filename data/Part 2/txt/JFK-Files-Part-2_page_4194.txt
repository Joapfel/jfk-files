MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
EYES ONLY--NO DISTRIBUTION 
2 December 1963 
SUBJECT: Discussion with the President, 30 November 1963 
Throughout the conversation the President mentioned a 
number of very personal problems and asked my help and also 
asked that Bundy and I act as a team in trying to help him solve 
some of his problems. 
1. He indicated that there must be some Cabinet changes. 
By inference he made reference to the Attorney General, but not by 
direct statement. Apparently he is waiting for the Attorney General 
to decide what role, if any, he wishes to play in the Johnson Adminis­
tration.

2. U,Ie stated that Secretary Celebrezze is very anxious for 
a judgeship and that he, Johnson, was extremely favorably impressed 
with Sargent Shriver and thought he would be an excellent Secretary 
of H. E.W. This was enthusiastically endorsed by both Bundy and 
myself;] • 
3. He raised the question of whether Mrs. Kennedy might 
be a very able ambassador. 
r-.. 9&' 4. LHe was deeply critical of the handling of Ayub. He questioned 
whether Ball was the proper man to have gone forward to negotiate 
with Ayub. He felt that we needed a new ambassador and he asked for 
recommendations, the name of an ambassador who could handle that 
Embassy, and more particularly handle Ayub. At this point he asked 
that Bundy and I work together in searching out names of individuals 
who might be helpful in a number of critical areas. I protested his 
criticism of Ball, stating that I felt that Ball had done a very good job 
in his mission to Pakistan. The President expressed the highest regard 
for Ayub;J
