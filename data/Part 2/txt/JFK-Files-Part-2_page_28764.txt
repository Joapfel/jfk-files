MEMORANDUM 
CHAIRMAN STOKES 
JUNE 14, 1977 
PAGE 2 
For the record, Acting Chief Counsel Al Lewis 
was paid for no accumulated leave. After Mr. Lewis left 
the Comrnittee-;-he was kept on the payroll long enough to 
recover his back salary which I understand was the 
Committee's request. {Mrs. Thornell had already recovered 
her back salary.) 
As to Mrs. Thornell's break in service, I· 
have been told by the Finance Office that such a break 
has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of her benefits.
