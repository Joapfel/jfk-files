At a Presidential rreetjng on Vietnam with Carter aDd Colby in attendance, the 
following t'1<?f?f9 by Colby i~ prov~~ed of th: rreeting of Septerrib:r 10, 1963,- _ 
General G:!:'s.;·,:1:'\v:k reported his finm11gs in Vietnam. His conclusions were tnat the 
war was going ahead at an impressive pace and that the Vietcong war could be won 
if current U.S. military and socological programs are continued. Mendenhall, the 
.;;tate representative who accompanied c0bhfk, expressed the view that there was 
corrplete breakdown of the Siagon civilian governrrent 1n the security situations in 
the provinces had deteriorated. T'ne President asked where the two gentlerren had been 
insame country. Rusk suggested that the focus be on what happened in July and August 
that reversed the optimistic judgments in May and June. Mr. McCone talked from a 
personal telegram which he had r~ceived Richardson recor.nen _ainst any cut in aid.

OCCUHHENCE: 
On 10 September 1963 in a cable from the CJ.A station in Siagon (SAIG0760) to 
Hash1ngton, the fo1lov.ring quotation appears: "Am inclined to feel general officers 
will seek evolutionary accomodation with Diem, (if he permits them to do so) 
w1less overall situation clearly deteriorates, there • 
is breakdown of civil order or of governrrental machinery,or unJess war effort 
begins to i:;o backward seriously (despite daJnagcs suffered since 8 May and 21 August 
am incljned to believe we should be able to resume successful prosecution of war 
in mil~_tary and civil scctlons) do not align myself wlth the view that USG should 
suspend aid"
