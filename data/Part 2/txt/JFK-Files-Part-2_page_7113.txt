19. Uruguay 
We have no evidence of Cuban support for revo­
lutionary activity directed at subverting the 
Uruguayan government. Uruguay's importance to 
Havana lies in its value as a place where Cubans 
and Cuban agents are relatively free to carry on 
subversive contacts with dissidents from neighbor­
ing countries, ·particularly Argentines, Paraguayans, 
and Brazilians. The CubaJl.,,,emp~~a.l.q.,.1{ont..elci..de.o

20. Venezuela 
The current level of Cuban activity in Vene­
zuela is considered fairly low. International 
reprecussions stemming fron the unprecedented dis­
covery of the huge Cuban arms cache in Venezuela 
on 1 November 1963, the failure of the terrorist 
campaign to disrupt the December national elections, 
and the presently increased capabilities of the 
Venezuelan military and security forces will prob­
ably dampen Cuban activities in Venezuela in the 
short run. There is no reason to believe, however, 
that these setbacks will alter Venezuela's high 
priority on Cuba's target list for subversion. 
Cuban support for the militantly pro-Castro Armed 
Forces of National Liberation (FALN) doubtlessly 
will continue, and may even increase. 
The FALN gives signs of stepping up its activi­
ties, but on a lesser scale than at the end of 1963.
