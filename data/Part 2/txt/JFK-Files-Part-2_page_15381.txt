.1."'?or e.xample, the(!:_nagram Program)produces voluminous _{ntell igence clata 
on· these officials and establishments. [lnder the Intensi.ficat'ion • • 
program, q,s long ago as 6-9-!/3, SAC Letter 53-41 instructed ·t?ie field 
i:,o scrutinize carefully an_i; associations and contactsj}etween Souie.t 
personnel. and diplomatic representative:; of other countries where there 
are i~dic~tions that a person is.bi~ig singled'out for specific, 
at-tention. Jl case o.t this nature was developed when a Soviet cultural 
at tac he in 1953 at ter1.pted t-o develop as agents for th.e ,S'o v "i ets two 
Iranian officials~ one of whom we subsequently turned into a Bur-eau 
double agent. (65-6J11J-3). Urider the program involving name ch.eeks by 
the Bureau -and other· in tel 1 igen,ce agencies on al 1 foreign· government 
officiqls enterz"ng the U. S.~ we have the benefit of derogatory 
information on friendly foreign officials at the time they· enter the 
U. S. This constitutes a type· of· cpverage handled, not as ci part of 
• cajJt toned prqgram, but as a separate· program in itself. 
Conclusions. ------ ,, • 
Our program conceriied with int el 1 igence coverage of .friend] y 
foreign countries is operating effectively and efficiently •. On a 
continuing bas is, it produces in.format ion of value to our· investigative 
requirements, to our intelligence requirements, and for budget purposes. 
For the· moBt part, ·the program consists of a coordination of accepted 
. in,vestigat:ive and intelligence- procedures for the purpose· of proper 
direction, redirection when indi9ated, and administrative controls. 
It iias not required any over.;.all increase in manpower. From our 
current analysis, no changes are inq,i,cated at this time.~ 
_ • An in.formative memorandit1n has been prepared .tor supervisors 
in the l(ation,al ities Intelligence Section, where all coverage of 
frie,ndl y foreign nations is handled, in order that they may be auxire 
of the·· continuing need .tor coordination of this program and alert :to' 
any, redirection which might increase its efficiency or improve our 
coverage.
