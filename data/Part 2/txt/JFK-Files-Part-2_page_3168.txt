The following major questions must now 
be resolved by the Special Group or re·ferred 
to the President for·decision before pro­
ceeding further to implement the paramili­
tary aspect of this program as described 
above: 
a. Does either the Department of 
state or the Department of Defense view 
the proposed paramilitary concept as 
not in consonance with policy or for 
any other reason open to question? If 
so, why and what alternatives are pro­
posed; what course of action is ap­
proved? 
b. If there is agreement as to the 
paramilitary concept,. then: is there 
ag·reement that training shall continue 
in Guatemala?

disapproved~ will bob air-lift the 
present trainees at once from ·Guatemala
