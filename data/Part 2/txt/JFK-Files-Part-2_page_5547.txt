Note To: DO 
From: Barry Harrelson 
JFK Project Officer 
Historical Review Group 
6 October 1997 
Subject: Nosenko records in JFK Collection 
The ARRB (JFK Board) staff has agreed to accept CIA's 
designation of 25 folders of the Nosenko material in the JFK 
sequestered collection as "not believed to be relevant" 
(NBR). The staff plans to present their proposal to the JFK 
Board at the 14 October meeting. The Board requires a 
description of all NBRs to be made available to the public. 
Please review the attached draft prepared by ARRB staff 
member, Michelle Combs, for classification and public 
release. The AR~B staff needs a response by COB Thursday if 
possible. HRG/DO JFK reviewers here have no problem with 
the draft and recommend release. If you have any questions, 
call me on 31825. Thanks.
