tried to reac~ Sei:ator Ervin, .. S.'9_ old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade: the 
Senator from allowing this_ int,e!!1~~ to go forward. He did not get in touch with 
Ervin directlybut:_talked,to·a. sta~f'_member in Ervin's office., whom he vou.ld"oot

had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the 
Friar's Club case., a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman, 
Benjamin Teitlebaum., and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun bad no involve­
ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

With regard·to Bob Maheu., he met Maheu for_ .the first time in the mid-50's 
in either Washington or California through_a mutual. .. a.cquaintance., Herman Spitzel. 
When questions were asked. aa ·to what his sub-;equent involvement wi t.h Maheu vs.a, 
Roselli's attorney instructed him not to-answer any questiona·ou_the·ground ot,

• ·Roselli did however indicate how he and· Maheu had ··ma.de arrangements for 
Hughes to live at thE;t Desert Inn 'When Hughea first ·arrived there in late 1966. He 
said that he had received a call from Maheu, who.needed to make arrangements for 
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu., no one wanted to give 
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of' Maheu left his residence in Ios Angeles 
and went up to I.as Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who ovned 13~ ?f __ 
the Desert Inn., to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take tw·of the pe~thouses· 
at the Desert Inn·. At the time Maheu 'Was in charge of security and re~ponsible for 
seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in I.as Vegas. Kolod acquiesced a~ told·· 
Roselll that the top floor of' the Desert Inn would be ·available at the going rate, 
but that they vould have to leave the hotel by_ Nev Years. When the Nev Years date 
was approaching., Maheu called and said that· they h~_ received notice t'rom Ko~ ~nd 
• were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to all~~-t?em .• 
to stay. _At_ the same time J}e ·told Maheu that Hughes should bu,y the }Jot,!!.~ .. a~, !~~id
