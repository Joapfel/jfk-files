Section 87D 5b of this manual instructs that if it is determined 
a security subject is a nember of the armed servioes the investi­
gation must at that point be di~oontinued ~moediately an~ reported 
to the Bureau. The basis for such instructio~ lies in the fact 
that t~e subject is no longer withi~ our inveo~igative juris­
diction. In addition, dissemination of pertinent reports nrust 
be 0ade locally in the iield to the appropriate intc~ligenoe 
agency. 
Our responsibility with regard to mili t-~.ry porsormc.l· is ·not con.:.. 
fined to those who have been the subjects of secu.i·ity investi­
gations. It extends to a~y subversive derogatory data developed 
against a member of the armed services during any of our investi­
gations of either individuals or organizations. For instance, 
.if i '!; is determined that a member of the armed forces has been 
in contact with a security subject or with any individu~l or group 
raising security implications, the appropriate intelligence 
service should be inu11ediate1y· advised locally. This· should be 
done even though the security aipects of the contact have not been 
~esolved, so that ~he military se~vices may bi in a position to dis­
charge their.responsibilities o It must be pointed· out to them 
specifically in such instances that the data are unverified 3 
and pertinent developments must be transmitted to them thereafter 
immediately upon receiptc 
Section 87D 6b (1) (h) provides that during the·course of security 
investigations it must be determined whether t:tie subjects· } .. ave· 
any close relatives in tte armed forces. Our responsibilities 
require that such assrciations be called to the attenti.on of the 
appropriate military intelligence s~rvices, together with per­
tinent data, including reports, -on the security subjects :l.nv-ol-vedo 
The evaluation of these associati~hs lies entirely within the 
pr9vihce of the intelligence seryices, but fo~·the reasons stated 
previously herein it is incumbent upon the Bureau to dissemtnate 
this information immediately upon receipt. 
Any subveiosive contacts or in:j:ormation developed concerning 
military personn.el must· be set out in a letter to th·e Bureau., 
together with a siatement as to the local dissemination made in 
th& fieldo Such letter should be accompanied hy a[letterhe,d] 
~emorandum setting out wi~h particuiarity the"subver$ive data 
in.a form entirely suttable for dissemination. • •
