Mr. Kirbow. now long is a man like that good for, Mr. 
Angleton? I mean, by this time, or a decade from now, a lot 
of that information is of no longer any value to you. 
~!r. J\ngl~'.:uu ... u, i.hi.4L't. not .;0. It is a fact that the 
man has a computer mind. In oth~r words, if you took all of 
his interrogation reports, they ran to some 20 filing cabinets. 
You try to have anyone retain in their mind, to apply that 
same data against a new problem that comes up, it requires an 
individual who lived that to be able to look at a case that 
has arisen, and he knows the case officer on the Soviet side, 
and he can give an analysis that this fellow was on the Scandi­
navian desk and that he was promoted to this, and that his 
background is ciphers. Ile had not told you that he. was ciphers 
before because it wasn't relevant. So it's a new, added 
factor. 
And then you find that·. someone. is ,known 
as a code clerk, and therefore the pieces begin to fit 
together, that the man who was sent to the field by the Soviets 
to handle some unknown American is a cipher expert, and there fo t·,i 
you look amonq who arc the code clerks. 
Mr. diGenova. I'd like to 
Mr. Miller. Could I interrupt.just a moment? 
You spoke in this instance of 20 file ca~incts from the 
interrogation of one defector. 
Mr. Angleton. Yes.
