Richard Bissell recalled nothing of the \HROUGE approach to 
QJWIN (Bissell, 9/11/75, p. 71). Bronson Tweedy did recall that 
WIROGUE was "dispatched on a general purpose mission" to the Congo

"absolutely not" have been used on an assassination mission against 
/~ Lumurnba because "he was basically dispatched, assessed and dealt 
with by the balance of the Division" rather than by the. two people

p. 102.) In contrast, he limited distribution of the cable about
