The Honorable Dan Burton 
I understand the importance that the Congress and the 
President have placed on disclosing to the American people 
all· available information about the assassination. To this 
end, we have released more than 200,000 pages of material 
and are working diligently to complete our revi.ew of the 
remaining records. 
If you or your staff require any further information or 
would like a briefing on our declassification program, please 
have yo~r staff contact· Mr. Jim Meehan, Office of Congressional 
Affairs, at (703) 482-8796. 
Sincerely, 
David W. Carey
