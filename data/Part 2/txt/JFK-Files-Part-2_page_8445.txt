1. Subject book was published in 1974 with 168 
deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court 
trial and decision.· The lawyer for the authors has, 
in effect, requested that a review be made of the 
168 deleted•items·to determine which can now be 
declassified and removed from the court's injunction, 
particularly in view of the official disclosures 
since the publication of the book. The Department of 
Justice has advised that such a review is in order. 
2. Since. the courts decided the 168 deleted 
items were properly classifiable and classified in 
accordance with the- appropriate Executive Order in 
effect· at the time of the initial classification, 
including Executive Order 11652,. the review at this 
time must include two points: 
(a) Is the item still classified under 
Executive Order 11652, 
(b) Has the item been· placed in the public 
domain by official disclosure by the United 
States, such as by an official in the Executive 
Branch authorized to declassify the item, or by 
a report of a Congressional committee, or by 
the courts. 
3. Each addressee is requested to appoint a 
focal point officer to review each component's 
respective items which are held by this office.
