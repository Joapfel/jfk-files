Re~-..... Assassinalion of lhc President 
I told Ford in strict confidence that the Director concurred with his 
viewpoint. I mentioned that our investigation thus far had conclusively shown that 
,Oswald operated by himself and that Ruby additioi12.lly was a loner. However, FBI 
....,. 1invcstigation was stiU pendin;; on a large number of rumors, speculation and gossip 
',and it, therefore_. ~vould be quite unfair for the Commission to t::1ke a stand prior to 
jlll the evidence being- turned in. Ford stated this was his point entirely and that 
although he was a minority of one he intended to slick to ill::i point. ! 
Ford told me th2i.t ,John r-.IcCone~ Dil'cctor of CIA, had~ approximately 
,:me week a~o, ~0~1e up to his office and told him that CIA. had uncovered some 
"startling information" in the Oswald case.. IvicCone proceeded to tell Ford that a 
source of CL\'s in r.I2xico had seen money exchan!.!'o ha.nds between Oswald and an 
Jnkno\vn Cuban Ncgr·)o Ford stated this excited him ~re:idy inasmuch as it definitely 
:ended to show there was an .int ern;itional connection involved in the assassination t f

.: Ford indicated he would keep me tll9rou~hly a~ivised as t) the activities of 
.i1c Corn mission. He stated this would h:ive to be on a confidential basis, ~10wever, he 
hought it should be clone. He also asked if he could call me from time to time and 
·1'1 traightcn out q~wstions in his mind concernin~ our investigalioa. I told him by all 
1 :icans he should do this. He reiterated that our rclalionship would, of course, remain 
1 .onfidcntial.
