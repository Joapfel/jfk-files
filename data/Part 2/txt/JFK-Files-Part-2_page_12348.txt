10. Transfer- of informants to other are~.s 
a. Keep alert to possibility of: transferring informants to. areas needing 
coverage through change in residence or ~mployment. 
b. Keep in mind overall coverage of- organizations. If informant becomes 
prominent and may be able to expand his field of activity beyond your_ 
field division, encourage him to do so in order to proyide wider cov­
erage for Bureau's work. 
Il. Action by informant when uncovered 
a. 'If informant is uncovered by subversive elements, instruct him to de­
fend himself vigorously and demand proof of his inforI!1ant activ'ity. 
b. Suspicio~ in many cases is directed to an inforw~nt without facts to 
back it up and by bluffing informant may confuse-issue to point where 
his services may not be lost. • 
c. In some cases· it may be -necessary for informant to acquiesce· to 
charges of deviation from strict discipline 9f organization inv.olved, 
and t4us cast off suspicion. • 
12. Requests of informant to help defend ot~ers 
a. If requested· by Communist Party, or other_ intereste·d parties to assist. 
in preparation of defense in subversiye-type cases or handle assign~ 
ment where such information "is readily available, informant. should" 
tactfully decline. • 
b. Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent and 
made matter of record. 
c. If informant cann·ot avoid becoming involved, instruct him not to repor:t 
any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy. 
d. Promptly report any such incident to Bureau. 
13. Preparation for testifying 
Contacting Agent must condition informant to fact that someday knowledge 
he possesses may be needed as evidence in court. Psycholo~ically prepare 
informant for fact that he may at future date be called upon to testify to 
information he has furnished on security matters; Proper indoctrination 
of informant is essential as Bur.eau must provide witnesse·s whenever 
Department initiates prosecutions in security cases. 
INFORYJANTS' INFqRMATION 
1. General instructions re oral and written information 
a. These instructions apply to security informants, potential security 
informants, panel sources, security confidential sources, and 
security sources of information. 
b. Specific instructions must be given to informants concerning prepara­
tion of statements containing their information. 
c. They should be submitted as quickly as possible afte·r meeting or 
activity. 
d. Written statements should be submitted when possible. -In espionage 
and foreign nationality matters written statements are usually_ 
necessary only in those instances involving possible future prosecu­
tion. (In the majority of cases dip"!-omats or officials who are not 
subject to prosecution are involved.) 
e. Carefully scrutinize e~ch, bearing in mind that if informant is called 
upon to testify at a later date his statements will very ·iikely be· 
introduced in court. 
f. All information furnished by. informants must be promptly revi~wed, 
recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, an~ all necessary action 
taken. Form FD-306 may be used in lieu of channelizing memorandum if 
desired. If so, prepare copies of FD-306 as needed for channelizing 
and staple one copy to each copy of informant's statement being 
channelized. Channelization should be noted on original FD-306 and 
on all copies. When informant's statement contains refe~ences to 
large number of individuJ3,ls and/or orga·nizations, and e·xceeds two . 
pages, consider channelizing to substantive case file only those_por-­
tions of statement which apply to particular individual or organiza­
tion. Of course, entire statement should be filed in i.nformant I s sub­
file. This procedure should be employed unless ~ogical reason 
dictates otherwise. •
