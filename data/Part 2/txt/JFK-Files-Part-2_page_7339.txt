SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select 
Committee and Their Staffs While 
Traveling Abroad 
There have been already and there will continue to 
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who 
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our 
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines 
to avqid serious security problems from arising. The 
following specific guidelines are considered important: 
Members of the SSC and members of its staff 
should not publicly ap£ear to be abroad for 
purposes of investigating CIA installations. 
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under 
• some form of cover, have and need varying 
degrees of protection from exposure. At 
one extreme are Stations behind the iron 
curtain or in other particularly .sensitive 
areas which need maximum protection. At 
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy 
close liaison with the host government and 
are thus less sensitive. In the first case, 
Stations existing under strict cover conditions 
in sensitive environment.s, the very presence of 
SSC members could be highly provocative by 
flaunting. the fact of CIA' s presence. But 
even in countries in which we enjoy a good 
liaison with the host country's security 
service, there remains a need to be discreet. 
Many countries whose services want to be 
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or 
parliamentary exposure of the relationship. 
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC 
investigation abroad would in almost all 
cases be distasteful! to a host government.
