~1011.dav or. Tuesday, even. hi •.1 !,".Jpe is· tha ~ 01ir inq the course 
\ 
of· the !\ext week the Ful 1 (~omrni ttee will" finish that. 
In the meantime; of course, we can sti 11 be working' on'.·:: 
these reports looking towa!~d ·. honefully, if we could have those 
hv the en<l of next week, • too, then the F'ull Committee would 
be in a position of at lCH:l:·:t having the material available -to· .

we needed~ few more davs t~ refine the rep0rts themselves. 
That's about as much as we can hooe £6r. •

o:one through it. 
So therefore I think the end of next week is probabl~ 
not realistic of having it in shape fo't'.' the Full Committee to 
bless it. • 
on the • other hcrnd, I th ihk that before the end of the 
month it ~ould be pos~ible to h~~e a oroduct. uriless w~ ruh
