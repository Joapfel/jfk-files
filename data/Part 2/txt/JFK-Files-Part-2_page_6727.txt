SUBJECT: ( s) Protection of (IJDECANTER Cryptonym

11. ( S) In sum, question 4 -- bona fides is the CI key. 
The CIA to date has released all of the substantive information 
relating to _IJDECANTER in this particular document. But we must 1

'. 
protect his cryptonym here, in this particular document, if we 1 
are to preclude a substantial CI benefit to the Russian Federal J 
Security Service when they assess this new information in light Ji

12. (S) While the foregoing showing of intelligence damage 
is the most critical and legally compelling issue, there are 
three additional points of relevance vis-a-vis harm: 
• First, is foreign relations. : In our judgment, the 
Russians a-re- fully expect that, after Aldrich Ames, the -
/ United States is considering ave~ues of reprisal. This 
1/ specific release might well be viewed as a public move 
( l to e~barrass them and it would serve only to_ exacerbate_ 
•. - tensions.- -· 
• Second, is another potential intelligence benefit to 
( 
/ 
the Russian service. rTh1s- -specffic release could ~.
