The Soviet naval contingent in Cuba also operates 12 KOMAR-type high­
speed patrol era.ft as part of the Cuban coastal defenses. These boats are 
each equipped with a pair of cruise-type missiles. The missiles are estimated 
to have a range of 10 to 15 miles. These boats are under Soviet control, but 
Cubans are believed to have been observed aboard them. The KOMARS are appar­
ently the only Soviet naval craft introduced into Cuba as part of their expe­
dition. 
The Soviet Aney element of the Soviet expedition in Cuba is armed with 
almost all of the weapons found in large Soviet troop formations. Many of 
these weapons, of the type characteristic of elements of mechanized and motor­
ized divisions, reinforced by artillery and other units, are known to be in 
surprisingly large numbers. As mentioned before, the amounts, if any, handed 
to the Cuba.Ils from the many hundreds of heavy weapons brought in by the ships 
of the Soviet expedition, are not fully known. These weapons include heavy 
tanks and medium tanks, to a total in Cuba, both in Soviet and Cuban hands, of 
almost 400. There are several score self-propelled assault guns; over 200 
57mm anti-tank guns; over 500 light, medium and heavy mortars; over 600 field 
artillery pieces; around 400 antiaircraft guns, both 300 mm and 57 mm; almost 
100 armored personnel carriers, a number of the truck-mounted multiple laun­
chers for the 130 mm rocket, all brought in over and above the numbers already 
in Cuban hands. In addition, of course, quantities of various types of motor 
vehicles, radio equipment and engineer equipment were also brought in. 
To the above must be added two very modern Soviet Army tactical missiles 
The first is the SNAPPER, a wire guided anti-tank missile similar to our SS-10 
and SS-11. The second is the FROG, a rocket with a range of about 25 miles,
