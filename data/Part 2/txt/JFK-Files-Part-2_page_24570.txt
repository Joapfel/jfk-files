F. The August 10, 1962 Meeting 
I 
1 
As indicated above (seep. __ ), the question of a Castro assassination 
was raised at a meeting of the Special Group Augmented on August 10, 1962. 
• ' 
Thereafter, on August 13, 1962, Lansdale directed Harvey to include in a 
proposed plan for Phase II of Mongoose a pl:=1n for the "liquidation of leaders" 
as an option. We tool~ considerable testimony and examined the documents 
relating to the A~gust 10 meeting, the nature of the discussion of a Castro 
assassination, and Lansdale.' s subsequent request for a contingency plari. 
At the outset, it .should be noted that the documents and testimony 
Y,)v 
showed that discussion of 11 Castro assassination at the Agust 10, 1962 meeting 
had no connection to the assassination activity-undertaken by Harvey and 
Roselli, or any other Castro assassination plans or efforts. As the CIA 
Inspector General found: 
"The subject (of a Castro assassination) was raised 
at a meeting at State on 10 August 1962, but it is 
unrelated to any actual attempts at assassination. 
It did result in a MONGOOSE action memorandum by 
Lansdale assigning to CIA ac~ion for planning 
liquidation of leaders. (IG, p. 118). 
The finding of the Inspector General is supported both by the chrono­
logy of the Castro assassinatibn efforts and the testimony of Harvey. The 
chronology shows that it was three months prior to the August 10, 1962 meet­
ing that Harvey gave Raselli the poison pills for use against Castro, and 
that shortly thereafter (and well before August 10, 1962) Harvey was informed 
that the pills were inside Cuba. (seep. above). Moreover, after the 
August 10, 1962 meeting there was no Castro assassination activity during 
the remainder of 1962. (seep. above). 
In addition., Harvey (who attended the August 10, 1962 meeting. and
