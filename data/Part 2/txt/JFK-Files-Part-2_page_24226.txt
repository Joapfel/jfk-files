with the CIA in setting up proprietaries: 
Proprietaries have been and will continue to be an 
important tool to achieve selected operational 
objectives. Their use, however, has been drasti­
cally cut back, more because of changes in the 
international scene and in operational priorities 
than as a result of embarrassing exposures. 
Of course, as has been the case with nearly al_l other proprietaries, 
not everyone within the Agency has been satisfied with the mechanism. 
Indeed, there has been constant review, criticism and internal 
restraint due to a certain fear and suspicion of entities such as

Support Division wrote to the Deputy Dir~ctor of Security (Investi­
gations and Operational Support) concerning MHBOUND's policy and 
procedures. In terms of operational objectives he noted that they 
·had "created an operational support entity of dubious capability 
and with ill-defined objectives or purpose." He suggested that 
they "look this ugly duckling in the face" and see if it could be 
terminated ~racefully or "see if we can nurture it into a productive 
and responsive bird of acceptable countenance."* 
He ''received the definite impression that there may be some 
grey area with regard to the internal channels of command and admini­

entity to provide adequate cover. for itself in order to more 
adequately fulfill its role. In one instance, the physical 
backstopping of MHBOUND was inadequate. After this was rectified, 
one official noted: 
It is felt that this step has strengthened the 
Anderson Enterprises' cover, both in Boston and 
Washington so that now the company could withstand 
any inquiries. except that of an official govern­
ment investigation:
