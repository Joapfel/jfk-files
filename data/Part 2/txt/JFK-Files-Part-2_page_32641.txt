given to 50 Argentine extremists in Cuba. from July 
to December 1962. Instruction included such sub­
jects as weapons and explosives, ballistics, com­

strategy and tactics, map reiding, and closed and 
open order drill.· The trainees practiced with 
Mauser and darand rifles, Thompson submachi~~guns, 
Brownings, bazookas, Bl-millimeter mortars, and a 
57-millimeter recoilless cannon. Part of the group 
reached Cuba by way of Chile. Some of the men were 
given two passports, one Cubari and one Ecuadorean, 
and returned to Argentina by way of Prague. 
Buenos Aires police in July 1962 announced that 
they had raided a warehouse which had served as head­
quarters for terrorists working with both the Peron­
ists and Communists. According to the police, the 
gang was engaged in smuggling Cuban propaganda into 
Argentina and distributing it; facilitating t~avel 
of Argentines to Cuba for guerrilla training; and 
had carried out about 30 robberies to obtain funds, 
weapons, and explosives.
