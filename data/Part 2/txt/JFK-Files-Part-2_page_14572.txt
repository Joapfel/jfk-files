R ej'e re n c e is made to inj•ormation recently j•urni,shed to_ A.. 
the Bureau by a highly sensitive source being handled·by the );,: µYv--.:. 
Washington Fi,eld ·Oj'j'ice {WFO) indicating that Soviet and sati,11 ite 
intelligence representatives have a keen interest in assistance being

India, Indpnes ia, and United Arab Republ tc who apparently IJ;ave been

The foregoing again confirms that the Soviets and the :~. 
satellites real i2e that representatives oj" noncommunist • diplomatic, ·,._r:~)'rF

establishments can be oj• tremendous value to them. Naturally, a t • • ·•,., 
representative oj• the Indian Embassy has access 710,._ .. U. S. institutions 
and areas not usually accessibll to the Sovtets and satellites. 
Furthermore, a representative oj' such an emba·ssy can m.i.1: in circles 
and have access to Americans and others without being placed under 
any particular suspicions. Ij' such an individual is recruited by 
the Soviets, he can operate with an excellent cover~;:. We previously 
have see~ instances where the Sovie ts have tak·en an interest in 
1'epresentatiues oj• Latin, American coun·tries apparen·tly j'or the purpose 
oj' recruiting them as agents. 
_ It is suggested that we might desire to re-examine our /) 
position with regard to the extent and nature oj• Soviet and satell,i;Jf,e 
util i2ation of the personnel oj' other diplomatic establishments. j11')j
