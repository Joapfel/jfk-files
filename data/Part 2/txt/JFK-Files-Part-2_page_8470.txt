1. Items 107, 128, 129, and 279 on pages 123, 132, 
133, and 403 respectively -- FAIRWAYS CORPORATION. 
Classified SECRET; desciib:e: intelligence sources and 
methods by identifying an operational support facility 
located in the U.S. [S~ttion 5(B)(2)] According to 
CCS files, in April 1975 the DCI was asked by an NBC 
t~porter about CIA sponsorship of Fairways Corporation 
in connection with a planried TV documentary on Agency, 
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but 
there are indications that the DCI may have responded 
to the question in a manner which could have been con­
strued as admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. 
However, CCS files contain other evidence that CIA . 
sponsorship of Fairways was considered still classified 
as recently as December 1976. NOTE: The DDA/Air 
Advisor confirms the need for continued classi£ication 
and will comment sep·ara tely.
