In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the 
narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both 
cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics 
informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Government 
sources believe that he may have been killed to_prevent him from 
testifying. Because· of his fugitive status, both ,indictments 
against Sacco were dropped. 
. . 
After Sacco's ·flight from his home in 19.23.-he:spent some 
• . . • : - . 
time in Nev.York and Chicago~ and finally made his appearance in 
Los· Angeles 1n'· 1924 under the fictitious name "Jolm Roselli." . ' -~. • 
Sources indicate tha_t. Sacco engaged in bootlegging_ and hijacking 
' • • • ' . 
during this period and police records show he was frequently • 
arrested.on such charges as carrying concealed weapons, and sus­
picion of robbery. 
After 1930, Sacco became associated with .the Al Capone 
gang in_Chicago and was also closely associated with organized 
crime in Los ~geles. Reliabl& sources relate that he was an 
executioner-for the criminal organizations in both cities. In 
1936, by demands and. threats,. Sacco forced·his ·way into part 
ownership of ··"Ratiomride News Service," a horseracing information·· 
' service,used by bookmakers across the country~ 
• After prohibition was repealed, Sacco left the bootl~gging 
business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios. 
As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Ja~k Dragna, 
Sacco soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for 
the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was indicted on a charge of 
conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers 
and a labor union. Also indicted were union cfficials Browne 
and Bioff, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La 
Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna, 
Paul ~eLucia (aka Paul "the waiter" Ricia), Phil D1Andrea, 
Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles "Cherry Nose"
