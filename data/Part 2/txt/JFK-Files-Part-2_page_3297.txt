On 15 July 1960, the Cuban Government un­
covered a plot to kill Prime Minister Fidel 
Castro Ruz on 26 July 1960 during his visit 
to Mina del Frio, an army camp in the Sierra 
Maestra mountains, between Bayamo and Manza­
nilla in Oriente Province. Three captains 
-arid approximately 100 soldiers had been_ar­
rested and more arrests ·are expected. 10/ 
In addition to Richard Bissell and Dick Drain, Jake 
Esterline the Chief of Project JMATE was also very emphatic 
in denying that assassination of Castro or the Cuban lead­
ers was a part of th~ JMATE Program. In response to a 
question of whether various of the special arms that were 
...... 
being forwarded to the PM training sites were intended for 
use against the Cuban leadership, Esterline responded: 
No, I think it [silenced weapons in par­
ticular] is for hit and run operations, where 
they could do their maximum damage and get 
out without necessarily alerting people ... 
I know of no -- within JMARC as I knew it --
I know of no attempt, no plans that were made 
to assassinate. • As a· matter of fact,· the 
constant battle with Cubans during those 
years'was to tell them that we weren't 
going to get involved in·any assassination, 
that if .there was going to be an overthrow, 
it was going to be, obviously, a ~loody op­
eration; but no Cubans were ,going to be. 
sent in there, to "make an assassination attempt." 
It was going to be a ground-roots revolution.* 11/ 
Some contradictory evidence, however, indicates 
that WH/4, if not principally responsible, was certainly 
* It is known that at least one assassination plot 
against Castro and his advisers -- an attack by four men 
using US rifle-grenades-~ was proposed by anti-Castro 
Cubans to COS Havana-, but the COS gave the originator of 
the plan "no encouragement whatsoever." lla/
