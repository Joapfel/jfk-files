the ~iscus~ion of:U.S. policy toward the Congo. In the cbur~e of 
his rem~rks, Dillon maintained that the presence of United Nations 
troops in ,the Congo was necessary to prevent Soviet intervention at 
Lumumba' s request: 
If ... Lumumba carried out his threat to force the UN 
out, he might then offe,r tci accept help from anyone. 
The elimination of the UN would be a disaster which, 
Secretary Dillon stated, we should do everything we 
could to prevent. . If the UN were forced out, we might. 
he faced by a·situation where the Soviets intervened by 
invitation of the Congo. (NSC Minutes, 8/18/60) 
The discussion then continued to raise the spectre of an alliance be­
tween Lurnumba and the Soviet Union: 
Secretary Dillon said that he [Lurnumba] was working to 
serve the purposes of the Soviets and Mr. Dulles pointed 
out that Lumutnba was in Soviet pay. (NSC Minutes, 8/ 18/ 
60) 
In this context, the following exchange between President Eisenhower 
and Secretary Dillon was recorded: 
The President said that the possibility that the UN would 
be forced out was simply inconceivable. We should keep 
the UN in the Congo even if we had to ask for European 
troops to_ do it. • We should do so even if such action was 
used by the·Soviets as the basis for starting a fight. 
Mr. Dillon indicated that this was State's feeling.but 
that the Secretary General, and Mr. Lodge doubted whether, 
if the Congo put up really determined opposition to the 
UN, the UN could stay in. In response, the President 
stated that Mr. Lodge was wrong to this extent·-- we were 
talking of one man forcing us out of the Congo; of Lumum­
ba supported by the Soviets._ There was no indication, the 
served as Acting Secretary o.f State ~nd either attended or was 
kept informed about NSC and Special Group meetings. Dillon 
late_r served as Secretary of the Treasury under President Kennedy.
