HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
During various contacts with William Miller, Staff Director of 
the S~nate Select Committee, and Congressman Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich. ) , 
Cliairman of the House Select Committee, the question has come up regarding 
the need for a check of the private offices of individual Committee Members to 
assure the absence of c!:n.y electronic listening devices. The Committee 
personnel have been told that we consider this absolutely essential and they 
agreed. 
In exploring this matter, it was determined that the Capitol 
Police Department recently has established a special unit to handle all types 
of security problems within the Capitol Hill complex, including checks for 
electronic listenin devices. Personnel of this unit have received extensive 
1
v) 
training, ome from CIA. The operations of the unit are controUed. through "-

This matter has been discussed with Robert Hough, Deputy / "{ 
Sergeap.t at Arms of the Senate, and with Kenneth Harding, Sergeant at Arms ~ 
of the House. Hough advised that the special unit already has conducted com-
plete security surveys of the new office space of the Senate Select Committee ~: 
and c~rtainly will perform any--other checks of this type needed by the Committee ~ 
or its individual Members. He said, in fact, that since they now have this :;~ 
capability they w:oµld oppose any outside agency coming on to the ,J;ijJJ...to Fraform ::'1
