ZR/RIFLE. Harvey testified that QJ/WIN's function after th~ advent 
of Project ZR/RIFLE in 1961 was restricted to the "spotting" of. 
potential asset_s for "multi-pur·pose" covert use. 
However, in the Fall of 1960--before Harvey was 
assigned to create Project ZR/RIFLE by Richard Bissell--agert 
QJ/WIN had been dispatched to the Congo by Arnold Silver, his 
supervising CIA case officer in Europe. William Harvey, as: the 
Chief of the CIA Foreign Intelligence staff on which Silver worked, 
had _ordered QJ/WIN' s mission to the Congo (CIA Dispatch AUDW-11,7, 
11/2/60) and arranged the financial accounting for _the mission 
afterward (Memorandum to Finance Division from William K. Harvey, 
1/11/61). [QJ/WIN's_activities in the Congo are treated in detail 
in the ·discussion of the Lurnumba case; see Section , supra~] 
There are two factors which may rais~ a question a~ 
to whether QJ/WIN was being used in an ad hoc capacity to develop; 
an assassination capability before ZR/RIFLE was formally initiated. 
First, there is a similarity in the cast of characters: Har~ey, 
QJ/WIN, Silver, and Gottlieb were connected with the Lumumba matter 
• and reappear in _connection with the sul:,sequent development of 
ZR/RIFLE. Second, Bissell informed Harvey that the development of 
an assassination capability had already been_ discussed with Silver 
and Gottlieb before Harvey's assignment to ZR/RIFLE (Harvey, 6/251/75, 
p. 52; I.G. Report, pp. 37-38): 
.Nevertheless, there does not appear to be any firm 
evidence·of ~ connection·bet~een QJ/WIN and the plot to assassinate 
Lumumba.
