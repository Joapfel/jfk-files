.. ___ testimony about his CIA activities • ;· -,~•: 
Summary: 
.. 
John Rosselli and his attorney, Tom Wadden, object to 
testifying about. Rosselli 's involvement with Robert Maheu in a :; -­
CIA-financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's ~< ' 
The objection is based upon national security grounds as well as 
an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to 
our inquiry under S. Res. 60. 
Testimony of Mr. Rosselli about this matter is relevant 
and necessary to C?~r ·investigation for a variety of reasons.

CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel 
eas·tro·. ·Among the participants in this plot were Robert l\?Iaheu and 
John Rossell~~ ~ah!3u had a· public relations business at the time, -
and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime 
figures {e.g. Sam Gian~na) who had lost substantial gambling 
investments _when Castro came to power. Apparently, the plot 
continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs 
invasion. but it failed in attaining its. objective of killing Castro. 
Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis-
tence of the plot at that time. • · • 
Justice Department officials stumbled across this infor­
mation about the plot as a result of their investig'ation into an 
illegal wiretap by Sam Giancana in the early l960's.
