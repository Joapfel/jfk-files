3. Requests For and Pouching of the Machine Guns 
a. Owen Requests Machine Guns for Use 
in Assassination 
The Station Chief suggested that Headquarters coniider 
pouching an M3 machine gun on ·February 10, 1961 (Owen, pp. 63, 64; 
Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61). The request was raised again 
in March but no action was taken. On March 20, 1961, Owen cabled 
a dissident request for_five M3 or comparable machine guns 
specifying their wish that the arms be sent via the diplomatic 
pouch or similar means. The dissidents were said to feel that 
delivery by air drop or transfer at sea would overly-tax their 
resources. (Station to HQS cable, 3/~0/61) 
The machine guns sought by the dissidents were clearly 
identified, in Owen's cable, as being sought for use in connec­

In essence, CIA's response was that the timing for an 
assassination was wrong. Owen was told that precipitious or 
uncoordinated action could lead to the emergence 6f a leftist, 
Castro-type regime and the "mere disposal of Trujillo may create 
more problftms than solutions." It was Headquarters' position 
that: 
" ... we should attempt to avoid precipitous action 
by the internal dissidents until opposition group_ 
and HQS are better prepared to support /assassinationl1', 
effect a change in the regime, and cope-with the arter­
math." (HQS to Station cable, 3/24/61)
