A State Department representative on 8-'l-58 while discussing 
Deputy Under Secretary of State Robert }furphy' s recent trip to the 
]fiddle East, advised that Sudan, like Ethiopia and other countries in 
that area, is fear Jul of Egyptian subversive tactics o He no.ted that 
while Sudan and Ethiopia are basically friendly to the Uo s. and the 
West, the Egyptians have been corrupting a number of o_fficials of these 
countries by bribes o (J,Jemo randum Roach to Be lm.on t 8-8~58, re flRobert

Information published by CIA on 8-11-58 reflects that reliabl~: 
sources are pessimistic over the outlook for Vie continued stability ~ 
of Iran, and there is an undercurrent of rumors concerning changes § 
in government and military hierarchy with reference to the desirability 
of a coup. CIA also published data on 8-9-58 indicating that the 
Saudi Arabian Government may make an accomm6dritioowith Nasser of the 
United Arab RepubL:ir6 (Egypt and Syria) consisting of some type of 
association with the United Arab States (Egypt, Syria, and Yemen) 
or a revival of the Egyptian-Syrian-Saudi Arabian military alliance.
