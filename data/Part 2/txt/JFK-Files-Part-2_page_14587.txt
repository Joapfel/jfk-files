countries drifting toUXJ,rd Soviet bloc and on "trouble spot" countries 
where revolutionary or other activity has widespread international 
implications ( such as Middle East crisis, Cuban revolution,. Panamanian 
invasion, etc.). Program has paid off in sound benefits. 
Recognizing delicacy of contacting and developing such 
sources and close interrelationship with problems of international 
relations and developments we consult· State Department regularly 
on our objectives and intentions. For example, when we feel a 
particular country is logical target for development of sources in 
their establisronents in U.S. we clear with State to be certain they 
agree and to insure that we are not running into risky foreign policy 
situation. If they agree to country as target we then clear with 
State on each investigation of potential source relating to that 
country. Providing investigation favorable we then go back again 
to obtain clearance from State for interview with potential source. 
These i~itial interviews are conducted under pretext with idea of J>""'~\ .. 
assessing their attitude, stability, cooperativeness, etc. He the:n • T 
decide uiiether to go back and actually solicit. cooperation in ['-ff\ 
furnishing data. \ .. /-'f 
We are running into problem here in that after State has \ 
cleared country as target and has cleared individual investigations . 
!
they are too often declining clearance for interviews on basis 
potential results not commensurate with risk involved. This failure 
to clear final step after passing on risk aspect twice before 
results in u:asteful expenditure of investigative time and these 
turndouns at this point are bound to· have initiative-destroying 
effect on field offices. 
We have been dealing with Bureau of Security and Consular 
Affairs in State which lacks real authority in this regard and must go 
back to geographical desks which are super-cautious, have. 7:0 rea~ •
