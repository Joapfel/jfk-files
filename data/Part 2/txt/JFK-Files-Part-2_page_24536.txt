As Sorensen (a member of the Executive·Committee established to deal with 
the Missile Crisis) testified, even though Cuba was the "No. 1 priority" dur­

*** There are references in the Special Group A~gmented records to attacks 
on Soviet personnel in Cuba. The record of the SGA meeting on September 9, 1962, states: 
"It was sugr;ested that the matter of attacking and 
harassing of Soviet personnel within Cuba should be 
considered." ( SGA Minutes, 9/9/62, p. ) . 
Earlier, on· Aur_!:ust 31, 1962, Lansdale had included. a task "to provoke 
incidents between Cubans and Bloc_personnel·to exacerbate tensions," 
• in a proposed projection of actions for Phase II of Mongoose. (Memo­
·randwn to SGA, 8/31/62, from Lansdale, Action No. 47). The Special Group 
thereafter decided, as a means of "emphasizing such activity" to r;eplace 
that task with one to "cause'actions by Cubans against Bi"oc personnel," 
and to note that "consideration will be given to provokinG and conducting 
physical attacks on Bloc personnel." (Memorandum to Taylor, Rusk, and 
MacNamara, 9/12/62, from Lansdale, pp. l,-2).
