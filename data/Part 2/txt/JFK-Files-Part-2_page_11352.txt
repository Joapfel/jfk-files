Determination of dangerousness of an individual 
(a) The dangerbusness of a member or affiliate of a subversive 
organization does not necessarily depend entirely upon his 
personal characteristics, such as aggressiveness or a dis­
position to violence. Although these factors must be taken 
.into consideration in evaluating an individualts potential 
dangerousness, other factors are essential in making this 
determination. An individual's dangerousness also depends 
upon the contribution he has made or is making in the advance­
ment of the principles and aims of the subversive movement 
with which he is connected or his subversive potentialities 
in the event of a national emergency. Bear in mind that a 
subject active in a subversive organization is not merely 
an isolated individual but is a: pa.rt of an org'anizatiim of 
which the purposes are opposed to the best interests of the 
U. S . .An individual's loyalty to a subversive organization 
•and the principles thereof is a primary factor to take into 
consideration in evaluating his potential dangerousness;[how-
ever., regardless of evidence of su-bversive affiliation, all 
evidence developed during the course of a security investigation 
must be carefully weighed for the purpose of determining •• :; 
whether· the SU bj e Ct I s· acti vi ties depict him a. s a po ten:tially "' 
dangerous individual" in time of a nation-al. emergency. l!>c:itors ;;
