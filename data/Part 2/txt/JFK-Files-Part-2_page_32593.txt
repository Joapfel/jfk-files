Ecuador 
SECRET 
- 2 -
The CIA Station in Quito reports that the military 
junta, which assumed power in Ecuador on 11 July, can 
be expected to follow the guidance of the Embassy and 
the Station in controlling travel to and from Cuba and 
the Soviet bloc. The activities of Cub:1n subversives 
in Ecuador, at least for the present, have been gr.eatly 
inhibited by the mas::; arrests of Communists and pro­
Cubans and by the out lawing of the Com.mun:tst Party by 
the junta. 
It ir, r0.rorted that the Honduran Communist Party 
has issue<l ot.' 1.brs to its members not to atter:i.pt to 
travel to Cuba at the present time. This action is 
apparently the result of the increasing vigi1.ar..ce of 
the Honduran goverrnne~t and the greater implemer.tation 
of stricter travel controls. 
2. Movement of Cuban Propaganda 
Guatemala 
According to an unconfirmed report received in July, 
a Bureau of Information of the Communist Party of 
Guatemala is being formed in collaboration with Prensa 
La..J;i~~ and is to be managed clandestinely. It expects 
to receive news by shortwave radio from Cuba and print 
bulletins for distribution by radio stations. This may 
indicate a pattern by which Prensa Latina will attempt 
to distribute on a more clandestine basis in other areas 
in Latin America. 
Honduras 
It was reliably reported that in mid-July 1963, a 
small coastal freighter landed 14 large boxes of Communist 
propaganda on the northern coast of Honduras, the boxes 
having been transferred at sea from a larger vessel. The 
report has not been confirmed.
