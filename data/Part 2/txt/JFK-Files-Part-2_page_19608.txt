ourselves not only as your supporters, but as sisters in a 
revolutionary struggle for the liberation of all people. 
"We are becoming women of the revolution, working 
in our own way to stop the bombs from dropping in your land, 
at the same time that we work to build day care centers, health 
clinics, and a whole culture that will come from and respond 
to the needs of all the people, not just the rich and the 
powerful. The enormous anger and energy of sisters together 
is a force that confuses and terrifies the rulers of Amerika. 
"It's so incredibly hard for us to write what 
we're feeling, to·express to you and our Vietnamese sisters 
and brothers the depth and strength of our love and solidarity. 
"Tidings of revolutionary joy from sisters inside 
Amerika,
