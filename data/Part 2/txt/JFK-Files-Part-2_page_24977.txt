Memo for the Files 
Page Two September 5, 1975 
statement in reference to Lumumba. Based on Mr. 
Baron's representation that I am not listed (either 
by name or position) among the participants in the 
memorandum of record, I am convinced that I heard 
the President's statement at a different meeting. 
5. After hearing Mr. Baron read portions of the minutes 
of the NSC meeting of September 21, 1961 to me, I 
do have a recollection of some of the subject matter 
that was discussed at th~t meeting. This would not 
be unusual, however, because as a member of the NSC 
Planning Board I received a debriefing on the sub­
ject matter of each NSC meeting. I do not, however, 
have a recollection of the statement by Mr. Dulles 
as related in the minutes of the meeting: "Lumumba 
was not yet disposed of and remained a grave danger 
as long as he was not disposed of."
