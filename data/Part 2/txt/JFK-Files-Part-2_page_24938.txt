Of course, whatever the extent of the President's own constitutional 
powers;" it is a fundamental principle of our constitutional· system that these 
powers are checked and limited by the Congress, including the Cong~ess' power 
of impeachment. As a necessary corollary, any action taken by a President pur­
suant to his limited inherent powers and in apparent confli~t with the l~w 
must be disclosed to the Congress. Only then may the Congress judge whether the ac­
tion truly represented, ·in Lincoln's phrase, an "indispensable necessity'; to 
the life of the Nation. 
As Lincoln explained in submitti~g his extraordinary actions to the Congress 
for ratification: "In full view of his great responsibility he has, so far, 
done what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according to your own judgment, 
perform yours.
