SUB.JECT: DCS Domestic Activity 
'l'o the best of my knowledge, DCS has not eng.'.i;ed in any 
activity outside the CIA charter or that could be construed as 
illegal. So~c of the functions that we perform under HR l-13f 
(i) of providing operational supp<?1·t within the US to aJ l 
elements of CIA and t0 the USIJ3-:r:.cnbcr agencies, however, arc 
perhaps borderline or could be construed as illegal if mis-
interpreted. For example: 
1. ~rovide personaiity and assessment data on certain 
iorei~n students and visiting foreign scientists and 
officials. 
2. Identify foreign stuclents in the US through collection 
of foreign student lists from certain universities. 
3. Provide personality and assessment data on US citizens 
to determine their sui tabili. ty and willingness to 
coo"pcra te with tho Agency. 
4. Introduce cooperative us businessmen and academicians 
to A(~ency personnel who arc in alias but using CIA 
credentials. 
- 5. Collect information on possible foreign involvement. 
or penetration of US dissident groups, but only in a 
passive manner and only when the source has refused 
to pass the information directly to the FBI. 
6. Collect information on the narcotics trade, but again 
only in a passive manner when the source has refused to 
pass the information directly ·to I3XDD or the FBI.
