. McCord met next with Wiley in Washington, D. C., for 
two days, ending on 1 December 1955. By that time, Wiley 
had indexed 150,000 names 0£ the Daily ~orker covering 
January 1934 through June 1936. iviley stated that the 
FBI in New York City and the American Legion were already 
making "extensive use" of the index cards. Wiley stated 
that one of his purposes being in lashingtcn was to secure 
financing for the index continuation. He stated that his 
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism 
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and 
if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he ~ould 
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves­
tigating Corrunittees. Wiley stated that the FBI has indi­
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing 
but that in his discussion Hith t',[r. DeLoach (Ca·rtha DeLoach, 
an FBI senior official), no indication· of forthcor.1.ing finan­
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated. 
In recording this contact with Wiley, McCord opinetl:

to CIA, particularly since the Com~unist 
Party membership and activities during the 
1934-40 period were for the most part very 
open and extensively advertised in the Daily 
Worker. An example of how open their act1v1-
ties were is indicated in the fact that 
Elizabeth Bentley's name was mentioned in 
a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time 
prior to her going underground and acquiring 
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission. 
If the Daily Worker thus bears a record of 
(Communist) Party activities of an indi­
vidual such as Bentley, who later became 
so prominent in RIS activities in the 
United States, then the possibility always 
exists that the names of persons later con­
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services) 
and other governmental activity may also be 
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues, 
which have heretofore never been indexed by 
any government agency .
