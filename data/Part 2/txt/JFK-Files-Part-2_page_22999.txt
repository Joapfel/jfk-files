(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. Baron. To continue with this, I understand that 
safety regulations would have been complied with, but ··.was there 
some sort of immunity from inspection, say inspection for 
carrying armaments aboard a vessel that tha CIA had arranged 
\ 
with maritime authorities, or loc~l law enforcement authorities? 
Mr. Halley. When we had operations going, these were 
coordinated with the Coast Guard in terms of their knowing that, 
you know, at a particular date, time group, that there would be

11 this was coordinated with the Coast Guard.

Mr. Daron. Would you return to the second part of that 
large question? Without reference to vessels, were CIA 
employees or agents on the streets of cities in Southern

Let me ask to dispel one myth that I think has developed 
which is reflected in your question. We were meticulous to 
insure that no weapons were issued to anyhody until the men 
w~re on the vessel outside of the immediate waters of south 
Florida, and we were meticulous to insure that when they came 
back from a mission that they were met at sea and all the 
w~apons were taken away from the~. 
So, when you talk about a group moving around in Florida,
