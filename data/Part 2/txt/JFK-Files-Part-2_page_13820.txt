NOTE: -
The Schafers, as paid informants, furnished 
intormati.on from October, 1969,. until March, 1975, to the 
Bureau. Information in this LHM was contained in 
New Orleans teletype to the Director, dated June 11, 1975. 
Several personal statements made by the Scha~ers, such as 
,;bearded hippy« in reference to one of Epsti;)in 's colleagues, 
were not included in the LtIM as this type of information 
is not fully germane and our reporting of it might be 
inferred as our being prejudicial.
