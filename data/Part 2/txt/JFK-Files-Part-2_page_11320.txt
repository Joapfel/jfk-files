B"lD 
For instructions pertaining to di~semination to Secret Servi~e 
in other than security index cases, refer to sectio~ 83K, 
volume III, of this manual. 
Copies of letterhead memoranda prepared in ::iecurity index cases 
should be retained in the individual case files only. 
Upon transfer of office of origin in one of .these cases, the 
[old]offico of origin is to furnish Secret Service locally with 
[the subject 1 s new residence and business ~ddress]znd advise the 
Bure.i,u that :::uch has been done by the submi::;sion of ·two copies 
of the letterhead memorandum disseminated locally. [The new 
office of -01·igin need take- no action regarding disi~emination to 
Secret Service until such time as further changes occur with 
respect to the _subject's status,] 
(10} Dissemination at the Bureau 
There are some situations in whi·ch dissemination is made at the 
Bureau instead of in the field. In the majority of instances, 
informatio~ received by the FBI should properly be furnished 
immediately to some other agency v1ithin th·e executive branch of 
the Government no that the responsibilities of the other agenc·y 
might ·be fulfilled properly. ·care must be taken, however, not 
to disseminate information to any field branch o·f ·another· •• 
Government agency whe~e such a procedure is deemed i.nP.,dvisable 
because of the inadequacy of security measures _in that branch. 
In these iustances the data should be brought to the i1mnt=:diate 
attention of the Bureau for disseminati-0n at the SOG. An 
example of the latter is, of course, the Atomic Energy• Commission, 
. W-hich receives re-ports o~ly through the Bureau, as noted in 
section 87D 7 c ( 3) of this manual. Information rel a ting to 
foreign travel plans of security subj.eats is disseminated -
to interested agencies, including the State Department, only 
at the SOG, as set out in 87D 6b (4). Dissemination is also 
made at the SOG to the State Department, :unless i -j; appears 
undesirable, in those cases in which subjects have been 
'i.ndictecl for violations grounded on subversive activ-itie·s . 
. Dissemination in these cases is made to preclude thes~ s~bje6ts 
from utilizing the fact they obtained. a p:1ssport to refute • 
_allegations of subversive connections, The State Department, 
therefore, will be ,n possession of data concerning a defendant 
should he attempt to utilize this tactic in such an action. 
Data developed concerning individuals who are not within the B~_reau':;

The Delimitations Agreement between the FBI and the armed forces 
inteJ.ligence agencies .states that the ·responsibility assumed ·by 
one organization in a given field carries with it tha obligation 
to exchange freely and directly with -other. sulincribing or·ganizations 
all information of mutual interest. -
