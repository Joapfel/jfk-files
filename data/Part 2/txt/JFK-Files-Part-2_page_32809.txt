than risk direct confrontation with the United States. In 
the long run, such action is more dangerous and difficult 
to combat, and in the short run is less likely to provoke 
immediate and effective United States retaliation. Such 
actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-
tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration 
for the 11inevitable 11 Latin American revolution .. Whereas an 
inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a 
few sentries might require strong countermeasures, the 
training of a greater number of Latin American errillas 
than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1 2, probably 
would not. Nor is it likely that the return of those trainees 
to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla 
training bases, recruitment of additional personnel, and 
engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately 
provocative as interference with the water supply at Guantanamo .. 
Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who 
commute would deprive Castro of a source of foreign exchange. 
While such items as, 11the harassment of air traffic into and out 
of Guantanamo, r; or i•the harassment of US aircraft operating in 
the vicinity of or overflying Cuba,' might be .added to the list, 
it is considered that specific provocative actions are less 
likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support 
to subversive forces in Latin America$ Such action not only 
is in keeping with the declared communist intention to support 
,;national liberation movements of oppressed peoplesii but may 
be done by means which avoid an invitation to overt US military 
countermeasures which would endanger the Castro regime~ Thus, 
they are considered as of that level of intensity which places 
them in the most likely category as well as being in the 
category of most dangerous to the long range interests of the 
United States.
