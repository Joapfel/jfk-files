and hope the Board members do not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide 
them with any signed seJrecy agreements). In essence we bluff the Board. (**A variation of this 
approach would be to haye the Board execute an SCI debriefing statement, which includes a 
prepublication clause, although it is limited to SCI material**)

i 4. Have the Board members sign secrecy agreements on the way out. This option would 
be difficult to implement ~s there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist 
no sanctions for not signing), and it would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would 
I . 
provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to the Board members, and therefore would not contain the 
legal consideration neces~ary to establish a binding contract). We would have to hope that the 
question of enforceabili1 issue is not raised - essentially, amounting to another bluff. 
5. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpr~ted by the Department of Justice 
in the mid-1980's, that ~ppears to permit the Agency to write a regulation that requires 
prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel given access to CIA 
information, to allow the I DCI to _protect intelligence sources and methods. The regulation would be 
signed by the DCI, and t'en the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and o~ligations 
under the regulation. 1
