Allen Smiley - gambler, bookmaker, racketeer; 
Tony Accardo .. ·-ranking Cosa Nostra figure; 
Momo Adams ... ranking Cosa Nostra _figure; and 
Frank Costello .. ranking Cosa Nostra figure. 
Numerous prospective witnesses in the course of investiga­
tions concerning Sacco's criminal activities_:have eJq>ressed or 
displayed fear at the prospect of being called to.testify 
against. him, and a number of witnesses have reftised to testify. 
In the Friars Club trial, it was apparent that a_number of 
witn~sses deliberately perjured them.selves in order to exonerate 
Sacco, including Friedman,.Vinnie·Donato, Lee Deer, and Nat Ross. 
Defendant Sacco was convicted in the Friars Club case in 
December·l968 of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering 
enterprise and interstate_ transportation of fraudulently obtained - - - . -- . -· . 
securities.· He was also convicted of making a false statement in 
his income tax return. Sac~o has had a long practice of.concealing. 1. 
the source and nature of. bis income. He was sentenced to five years I ' 
in prison •. 
In view of Sacco 1 s_extensive .. crimi.na1re~ord extending back· 
more than,-:40 years, as well as his membership and participation 
in the organized criminal syndicate known as Cosa ~ostra, we 
strongly urge that defendant Sacco~s sentence not be ·reduced for 
any reason whatsoever. He is a genuine menace to society and, 
in particular, to those witnesses who have testified against him.
