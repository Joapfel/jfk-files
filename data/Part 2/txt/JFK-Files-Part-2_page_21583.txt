TOP SECRET 63 
In other words, I am sure they didn't go to Mr. Cotter 
every time they wanted something on a day-to-day relationship. 
Mr. Wallach. I have just given Mr. Osborn a copy of 
a memorandum dated December 24, 1974, which is in fact after 
the time he left on sick leave; and·there is no reason to 
believe that he was seen it. I would just like him to re­
view it and possibly refresh his recollection. 
Off the record. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. WAllach. Back on the record. 
_;:='. 
~-
I think I misspoke when I gave Mr. Osborn a memo. It 
is a three-page undated memo captioned "Project West Pointer." 
I believe it was recently prepared. 
But in any event I would like to call your attention 
to the last paragraph on the third page which states: 
"The main difference between ~Wll@lml&~and West Pointer 
is that the file shows specific reference to a statement by 
the Postal authorities that mail not to go out of Post Office 
control. While mail was opened and photographed by Agency 
personnel in New York City·under~B:~N~, and not specific 
post office approval was given, neither is there written order 
not to do so. In West Pointer the opening of mail was 
contrary to specific orders that mail was not to out of post 
office control." 
Mr. Osborn. There you are.
