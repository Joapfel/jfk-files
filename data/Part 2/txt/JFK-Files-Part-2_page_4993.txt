SENS IND: INTEL 
GROUP, AND THE FORMER HUSBAND OF A GROUP MEMBER, OF BEING CUBAN 
SECURITY SOURCES OR PENETRATIONS. THE LEADERS OF THE DISSIDENT 
GROUP DID NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE 
CONNECTED TO CUBAN SECURITY, BUT INCIDENTS IN WHICH EACH OF THESE 
INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED LED THE LEADERSHIP TO BECOME SUSPICIOUS 
OF THEM. 
TEXT: 1. AS OF MID AUGUST 1995, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CUBAN 
DISSIDENT GROUP, CUBAN CIVIC CURRENT (CORRIENTE CIVICA CUBANA -
CCC), WAS CERTAIN THAT THE CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISSIDENT 
MOVEMENTS HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF CUBAN SECURITY, PRIMARILY 
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MININT), AND THEY BELIEVED THAT MININT 
WAS TRYING TO PENETRATE DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS. CCC MEMBERS 
CONCERNED OVER THE GROUP'S SECURITY TAGGED FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO 
EXHIBITED BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITIES IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS OR DISSIDENT 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 
MININT. THE INDIVIDUALS WERE JORGE ((GONZALES)), VLADIMIRO 
((ROCA)) ATUNEZ, GUILLERMO ((FERNANDEZ)) DONATES, AND RAFAEL 
( (ALCIDES)) . 
2. THE CCC LEADERSHIP WAS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN THAT JORGE 
GONZALEZ, OF THE CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT (MOVIMIENTO 
CRISTIANO LIBERACION), HEADED BY OSVALDO ((PAYA)) SARDINAS, WAS A 
CUBAN SECURITY PENETRATION. DIRECTORS OF THE CCC NOTED THAT HIS 
QUESTIONS WERE USUALLY SO PENETRATING AS TO SUGGEST INSIDE 
KNOWLEDGE. A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE CCC WAS DIRECTED AGAINST 
GONZALEZ, PROVIDING HIM WITH MOSTLY BOGUS INFORMATION KNOWN ONLY 
TO THE CCC MEMBER AND THE CCC LEADERSHIP. RECORDS OF THE DATE THE 
INFORMATION WAS PASSED WERE KEPT BY THE CCC. THE INFORMATION 
LATER SURFACED THROUGH MININT DURING THE COURSE OF MININT 
INTERVIEWS OF DETAINED CCC LEADERS. THE CCC LEADERSHIP BELIEVED 
THAT GONZALEZ MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN VENEZUELA AS OF MID AUGUST 1995. 
3. VLADIMIRO ROCA OF THE CUBAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST 
CURRENT (CORRIENTE SOCIALISTA DEMOCRATICA CUBANA), WHO IS ONE OF 
THE CLOSEST ASSOCIATES OF ELIZARDO ((SANCHEZ)) SANTACRUZ OF THE 
CUBAN COMMISSION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
(COMISION CUBANA DE DERECHOS HUMANOS Y RECONCILIACION NACIONAL), 
CAME UNDER CCC SUSPICION AFTER AN INCIDENT IN 1992. IN THAT YEAR, 
SHORTLY AFTER THE LETTER BY CUBAN PROFESSIONALS TO THE IBERIAN 
AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS PRESENTED, CCC CHIEF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 
VLADIMIR ((MARTINEZ-AMORES)) ALVAREZ WAS VISITED AT HIS HOME BY 
TWO MININT OFFICERS. THE TWO OFFICERS WERE NAMED "MARCIAL" AND 
"DANIEL." THE SENIOR OF THE TWO, DANIEL, REMARKED THAT ELIZARDO 
SANCHEZ WAS A U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENT. IN DUE COURSE THIS 
INFORMATION WAS PASSED BY MARTINEZ-AMORES TO SANCHEZ IN THE 
PRESENCE OF VLADIMIRO ROCA. AROUND DECEMBER 1992, DURING AN 
"INTERVIEW" BY MININT OF A CCC MEMBER, MARCIAL MADE A STATEMENT 
THAT INDICATED THAT HE KNEW THAT HIS INITIAL REMARKS TO 
MARTINEZ-AMORES ABOUT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN PASSED TO SANCHEZ .• WHEN IT 
WAS REPORTED TO SANCHEZ THAT MININT HAD MADE THIS STATEMENT, HE 
ATTRIBUTED IT TO TECHNICAL COVERAGE IN HIS HOME ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
LP OPPOSITE HIS HOME. THE CCC WAS NOT CONVINCED BY THIS 
EXPLANATION AND THEREAFTER KEPT ROCA AT A DISTANCE, AS THEY 
ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ROCA WHO HAD PASSED THE INFORMATION TO THE 
SECRET
