2. On the morning of the 19th of July the under­
signed called Mr. Bundy and confirmed this fact and 
said that a field message now indicated the possibility 
of an internal sabotage operation to take place on the 
26th. Mr. Bundy said that such an operation would be 
perfectly acceptable and that the only bar was on 
"across water" operations. Mr. Bundy also added that 
Higher Authority asked him to convey to us the fact that 
Higher Authority, in reaching the decision to postpone, 
was well aware of the morale problem that might result 
among the Agency case officers and therefore had con­
siderable difficulty in reaching the decision. Mr. Bundy 
authorized the undersigned to quote Higher Authority 
accordingly to any staff personnel concerned and to add 
that Higher Authority retains his enthusiasm and interest 
in the program.
