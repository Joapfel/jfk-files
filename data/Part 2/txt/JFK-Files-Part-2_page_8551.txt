Item No. 107, 128, 129, 279 MSS pp. 123, 132, 133, 403 
(S) CCS states that all four items which refer to 
Fairways Coiporation as a CIA-owned ~roprietary company 
are still classified since they describe intel_ligerice 
sources and methods by identifying an operational supp6rt 
facility.located in the U.S. and are therefo~e exempt from 
declassification under Section 5 (B) {2) of the General 
Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652. 
(S) According to CCS file~-, in April 1975 Director 
Colby.was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship 
of Fairwiys Corporation in connection with a planned TV 
documentary on Agency proprietaries. CCS files a·re unclear 
on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby 
may have resp6rided to the question in a manner which 
could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of 
Fairways. In any case, CCS files contain other evidence 
that the matter was considered to be still classified as 
recently as Dece~ber 1976, when Director Bush wrote to 
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways gnd asked that the 
subject be withheld from public disclosure.
