JFK • Central Cover appeal 
The General Counsel and I met with the JFK Review Board on Friday and discussed, among lither things, how to deal with the potential 
pubiic release of the identities of former employees retired under cover. The Board clearly wants to do the right thing here, but they feel. 
they are not getting enough information to make that decisic;m. 
Jeremy Gunn (JFK Board's General Counsel) will soon provided me with some .of the Board's suggestions on how to deal with this which I . 
will pass on to you Ohcluding how to deal with Whitten). • I would atthe very least like to be able suggest that we attempt contact again 
(either through CIA or the Boardl with those retirees who have not yet responded to our letter. Of course; ariy suggestions you have at 
this point Will be extremely helpful. My sense is that this issue of protecting retirees is something everyone at CIA will want to appeal 
just on the principal of it, but that we should do everything possible to avoid an appeal. [Until we work out an agreement with the Board, 
you should continue to prepare that appeal you are drafting) 
In the meantime, can you please provided me the following figures: 
1. The # of people we sent letters to regarding the potential Board releases. (isn't it 150?) and the following breakdown if 
available:, 
• # living abroad 
• # of those retired under cover vs. those whose cover has been rolled back or lifted 
• # of those who still work for us in covert/overt capacity 
2. The # of responses we received to date. 
3. The # of responses to date requesting that we don't release. 
4. The # of responses to date saying that they didn't care. 
I realize you are all out of the office these days, but I would appreciate getting thi_s as soon as you can. Thanks.
