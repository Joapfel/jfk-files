In a CIA cable to Saigon of October 9, 1963, marked eyes only for Ambassador (DIR74228) 
which was originaed by WILLIAM COLBY thefollowing appears:" .•• while we do not wish 
to stimulate coup, we also do not wish to leave theimpression that U.S. would thwart 
a change of government or deny economic or military assistance to a new regirre and if 
it appeared capable of increasing effectiveness of military effort, insuring popular 
support to win war and improving working relationships with U.S." The cable urges 
that the contact with MINH press for "detail information clearly indicating that 
MINI-l's plans offer a high prospect of success." The text states that these "additional 
general thoughts" have been discussed with the President and that the cable had been 
cleared with high officials at White House, State and Iefense,"
