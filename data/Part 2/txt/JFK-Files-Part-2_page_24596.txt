In addition, the ONE Paper warned that the United States 
would most ·likely be blamed if Castro should die by another's 
• hand. "If·Castro were to die by other than natural causes the 
U.S. would be widely charged with complicity, even though it 
is widely known that Castro has many enemies". (Bundy Ex. 6-I, 
p. 4.) 
The ONE Paper also identified a number of possible U.S. 
actions in the event of Castro's death, ranging along a spec­
trum that included no U.S., initiatives, action to support a 
p,overnment in exile,• quarantine and blockade, and outright 
invasion. (Bundy Ex. 6-I, pp. 7-12.) 
On May 28, 1963, the Standin~ Group discussed the ONE Paper. 
( ·-\ 
' l The Standing Group found that "all of the courses of action 
fopen to the U.S. should Castro die] were singularly unpromising". 
(Summary Record of NSC Standing Group Meeting No. 7/63, May 28, 
1963' p. 1). 
Bundy agreed that the Standing Group "certainly posed the 
question" in the Spring of 1963 as to what. would happen if Castro 
died or were killed. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 130.) But he testified 
that he had no recollection of a Castro assassination being on 
the minds of Standing Group members when they discussed this 
contingency. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 14.)~/ 
,': I As indicated above p. ) , Bundy did recall that over .the 
period 1961 and 1963 "the subject of a Castro assa~sinat~on was ... 
mentioned from time to time bv different individuals", but said that 
he was not aware of "much discussion in the Spring of 1963 .on,,., that 
subject". (Bundy, 7/lJ_/75, p. 140~.~h:::(.-, .- , ···;·· .,-~~.,!'.c··\r
