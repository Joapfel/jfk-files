tion "as part of a coup rhat included Valenzuela." (Station 529, 13 October) 
At about this time the Station began to receive encouragement from its 
other contacts. On October 14, ten days before the Chilean Congress was 
to vote, the Task Force Log concluded: 
Now we are beginning to see signs of increasing 
coup activity from other military quarters, 
specifically, an Army General (name deleted), 
Admiral Tirado, the forces in Concepcion and 
Valdivis and perhaps even Frei and Ossa. 
(Task Force Log, 14 October) 
C. October 15 Decision 
To summarize, by October 15, General Viaux had advertised to his con­
tact a desire to proceed with a coup, had indicated he would deal with 
the Schneider obstacle by kidnapping him, had met at least once with Gen­
erals Huerta and Valenzuela and had once postponed his coup plans.* 
On October 15 Thomas Karamessines met Henry Kissinger and Alexander 
Haig at the White House to discuss the situation in Chile. According 
to the Agency's record of this meeting, Karamessines·"provided a run-
down on Viaux, the Canales meeting with Tirado, and, in some detail, 
the general situation in Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint." 
(Memorandum of Conversation/Kissinger, Karamessines, and Haig, 15 October 
1970) A decision was made at the meeting "to de-fuse the Viaux coup plot, 
at least temporarily:" 
-
* The reason for Viaux postponing his coup plans was the subject of a cable i, 
from Santiago to Headquarters: f 
We discount Viaux's statement that he had called off his coup at­
tempt because of False Flag Officer's impending visit. Other re­
porting indicated Viaux probably not able or intending move this 
weekend. (Santiago 499, 10 October) 
There is also reason to believe that General Valenzuela was instrumental 
in persuading Viaux to postpone. According to the Chile Task Force Log~ 
Station reported that on 12 October General Valenzuela met 
with General Viaux and attempted to persuade him not to at-
tempt a coup." (Chile Task Force Log, 14 October)
