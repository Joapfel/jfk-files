Mr. Smothers. Okay. 
Just one final series of questions. 
If we might, Mr. Bundy, go back to our conversations 
regarding your request to see documents prior to your testimony 
before the Rockefeller Commission, when you talked to Mr; 
Kissinger, precisely what did you request of him? 
i Mr. Bundy. I said to him -- and again I cannot be precise 
1-
and I thought that there were going to be questions with respec1 
I 
to which it would be much easier for me to giv~ helpful :and mord 
! 
accurate answers if I could have access to appropriate document~ 
since I have taken no documents of that character, no official 
documents of that character, from the lihite House. l\.nct he saict 
h~ entirely agreed and he made the appropriate arrangements. 
Mr. Smothers. Did you ask for a timeframe for these 
documents? 
Mr. Bundy. I don't recall that I did, but when I came to 
look more closely at what I needed to see, as I told you 
earlier, it related specifically to the period around August 
1962. 
Mr. Smothers. Did the Nhite House make the SP.lection of 
documents for you? 
Mr. Bundy. No. The White !louse handed me a file of 
documents which covered the pdriod. 
Mr. Smothers. They handed you a file of documents coverina 
roughly the August 1962 period?
