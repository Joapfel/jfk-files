Circa 2 June 1967, Wiley prepared a report;khich he 
captioned, "Basic Theme of Letter to Ex -Presidents 11 out-

his own initiative he prepared two letters, 
one to General Eisenhower and one to former 
President Harry S. Truman, which I have 
attached for your information. He re­
quested that through our liaison with 
General Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman 
we approach them and solicit their sup-
port in his behalf.
