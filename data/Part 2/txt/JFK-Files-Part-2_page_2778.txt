his conv~taff ·in July of this year, has been 
connected with the Latin· erican scene since he joined the 
Agency in 1951. Even before that time he had livod in some

2. In handling many tasks at var~ou lev ls of responsibility 
and different locations, one facet of erformance

his imagination toward rsalistic and useful operations. To be 
specific: on occasion of the discovery of a Cuban arms cache 
in November 1963, of the January 1964 riots in Panama, of the 
April 1965 revolution in the Dominican Republic, and of many 
ot~c nd situations which h~ve developed in the WH 
ar illllllediately took the initiative within and outside 
the Divis on for .tbe initiation and coordination of covert action 
efforts to support U.S. (and Agency) objectives. In his last 
assignment prior to assuming his duties under nonofficial cover, 
hls constructive analyses of this Division's covert action 
activities and conclusions therefrom have made a signif~v_!~ 
impact on the formulation of our operational posture.~ 
task in his current assignment will be to find and develop 
channels to Latin American Christian Democratic individuals and 
groups which will require maturity and Judgment, tact and opera­
tional know-how, creativeness and flexibility. His current 
assignment is and some others in the past were~el of a
