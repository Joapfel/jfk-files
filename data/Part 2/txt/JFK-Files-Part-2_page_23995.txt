"any further action on the subject would henceforth be the responsibility 
of the CIA and that DIA would perform normal support functions." (Roth, 
p' 8) * 
Both Bennett and Philpott testified that the activities described 
by Roth were routine DIA activities. However, Colonel Roth testified: 
I believe my impression at the t~me, or my recollection, i_s 
that I was informed that there was concern at the highest 
U.S. Governmental level over the·possible election of Allende, 
that DIA then had a priority responsibility of corning up with 
the identities of key Chilean personalities that would be help­
ful, 'an.d so forth. I have nothing specific as to the nature 'o'f 
the instructions or the channels through which they came . 
. Q. It was your sense at the time that you were working on a 
project that if it had not been initiated by, at least had 
the attention of or concern of, the highest level? 
* Roth's chronology also indicates .that Philpott had asked that Broe 
be· queried -on two or th tee .occasions regarding a report from Wimert 
• and that Philpott instructed that ·01,ly he (Philpott) would communi.­
cate with Cush.man if the need arose. (Roth, p .. 11) Roth also .testi:,:, 
fied that Philpott advised him that communications with Wimert would 
be by CIA channels. • (Ro th, p. 41)
