vanguard of the revolution on a world-tdde level because t.h0

to a greater level and, tharefore, we are the gr~:,:.ri:est 
Marxist-Lenini.sts that e-!er lived'" and ,-:e say this not to 
be arrogant b:::Gause some times I ·w·ish that sc!ueon.e else=!

revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection 
between the B:i!P und the League of Revolutionary Blc:.c}.: T·~orl,:ers
