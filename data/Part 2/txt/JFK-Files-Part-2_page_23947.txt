{Bissell, 
Concerning the briefing paper, Bissell testified that: 
" ... it is perfectly clear that I was _aware at the 
time of the memoranchrr,1 to Mr. Bundy that these 
dissident groups were, and had for a long time, 
been hoping they could accomplish the assassination 
of Tiujillo. As a matter of fact, the requests since 
some seven or eigi1t months earlier ,,as a perfectly 
clear indicatio11 of that, so that fact wa~ not new 
knowledge." (Bissell 7/22, p.102) 
When asked why the memorandum di_d not include the fact that 
the dissidents intended the assassination of Trujillo, Bissell 
repliecl: 
''I cannot tell you, Mr. Chairman. I do not 
remember what considerations moved 1ne. I clon't 
know whether it was because this was common 
J;nowleclge ancl it seemecl to me unnecessary to 
include it, or as you are implying, there was 
an element of concealment here. I would be very 
surprised if it were the latter, in this case.'' 
(Bissell, 7/22, p.101) 
In response to questions concernirig the lack of information 
in the February 17, 1961 briefing paper concerning the uses to 
which the requested arms might likely be put by the dissidents, 
Bissell stated: 
" . I would say that the Agency's failure, 
if there be a failure here was [not] (sic) to ·state 
in writing that the plans of the dissidents 
__ ,would include assassination at tempts." 
(Bissell, 7/22, p.99) 
Bissell's briefing paper for Bundy concluded with the 
assessment that a violent clash might soon occur bet~een Trgjillo
