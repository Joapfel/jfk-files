Given Wichtrich's high profile, the release of his name 
could impact both past and future intelligence operations 
and directly affect Mr. Wichtrich and his family. His son 
had contact with the Panama City Station·in 1979; we are 
trying to determine the extent of that relationship. In this 
case, the Agency believes that the potential for harm 
clearly,outweighs the contribution the release of 
Wichtrich's name would make to the JFK assassination story.
