Tllls report stated that public assistance srunts in 
Washington, with stando.z- s based on 1959 prices t::md 
12.% ratable reductions, "t.' ·e 40% below the r.iinimum 
standards for health and decency. Speaking of child 
welfare needs, the report sa1d; 11There is nn excessive 
and increasing rate of referral of children to the 
Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency. 
There is an excessive and increasing trend for children 
to be removed from their natural families and cared 
for ~lsewhere." 
WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS? 
The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967 
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1tts 
pricing standord's up to 1967 levels. 
New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances 
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased 
an average of 10-J/4%~Jn King County the total increase was 16%. 
Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964, 
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%e Grants are stil 
17% less than acceptable levels. 
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of 
two n.dults, a boy 13, and a ,girl 8, is ~~285.80 a 
month--$J,429 a year. But recent changes in the 
Federal Social Security Law co.st a shadow on even 
this figure. The local welfare officials will not

REDUCTIONS ARE AL':/AYS A POSSIBILI'l'Y. 
There 1s rnuch talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to 
work. Yet who will tnke co.re of the children? Child care costs from 
$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattleo
