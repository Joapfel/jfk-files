most cases a substitution for the true name be used. In 
prior releases of these same documents, the Review Board 
agreed to redact the true name and substitute "source." If 
the Review Board is concerned about tracking particular 
sources throughout the records, a particular identifying 
substitution can be used for an individual source throughoµt 
(for example, "Mexican source 1"). 
18. (S) Among the names that are currently being 
considered for release by the Review Board, the following 
are some that the CIA proposes be treated in this manner: 
• True name of LIRING/3, an encr

Board has already been informed, the CIA does not 
have the authority to release. 
19. (S) Another type of name that similarly should be 
protected fronf release is the new identity provided to a 
defector .. Although defectors do not face some of the 
dangers that "assets" overseas face, they are still given 
new identities for their protection because there is some 
ris~ to their personal safety even in the U.S. For example, 
in this collection the identity of Golitsyn appears in 
documents being reviewed this month.
