At approximately 9:00 a. m. on May 21, 1975, retired 
Special A_g_~gt_ ~_!,an G. SentinelJ9_ appeared in my office prior to 
his 4Jpointment .to receive _a subpQena and to testify at 9 :30 a. m. on 5 • 1 7 5 
at Washington, D. C., before the Senate Select Committee. I told 
Mr. Sentinella that it would not be possible for me to furnish him personal 
counsel prior to or during his testimony, however I felt it was appropriate 
for me to furnish him certain information. I told Mr. Sentinella that he 
was entitled to be represented by a personal counsel of his own choice 
at any time and that if he chose to secure the services of a private attorney 
he was at liberty to do so. 
I also told Mr. Sentinella that under the rules of the Senate 
Select Committee (Rule 6. 4), a witness may be accompanied by counsel 
during testimony and a witness who is unable to obtain counsel may 
inform the Committee of that fact and the Committee is obliged to endeavor 
to obtain voluntary counsel for the witness. I told him that the rules 
further provide that the failure to obtain counsel would not excuse him from 
appearing and testifying. 
I asked Mr. Sentinella whether he had been given any advice 
by the Committee concerning his right to counsel and whether he had received 
a copy of the Committee's rules as required by regulations in the rules 
(Rule 6.1). Mr. Sentinella said that he had not been so advised and he had 
not been given a copy of the rules by any representative of the Committee. 
I told Mr. Sentinella that as to matters other than the presence 
of personal counsel, no understanding had been reached with the Committee:
