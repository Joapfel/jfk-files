gaction project, wl10 had sent the ·cables testified that 
he had "heard" that Dulles had countermanded Barnes' plan and 
had indicated that "assassination was not to be considered." 
(Duty Officer, p. 29).* The officer added, however, that he 
had no.personal knowledge of the reason for calling off the plan, 
or even if Dulles had been the one who called it off, he further 
testified that 
"assassination had not been part of the Cuba 
cov~rt action project in 1960 and that Dulles' 
action in this incident conform,ed with CIA

~·. The countermanding cable to the Havana station, which was 
"Operational Immediate," was sent the morning after the cable 
of the previous night. The officer who sent that cable testified: 
11 
••• I saw the cable and was told that, t.o the 
·best of. my ki1owledge, my memory is· that the 
Director [Dulles], not the Deputy Director 
[Bissell] ... had countermanded the cable and 
had directed that -- had indicated that ... 
assassination was not to be considered." 
(Duty Officer, p. 29). 
The officer stated that he did not talk to either Dulles or 
Bissell about the countermanding cable, but that he did see the 
cable and in all likelihood heard of the reasori for Dulles' re­
action in discussions the same morning with his superior, the 
Chief of the C_uba project. (Duty- Officer, pp. 30-32). 
** The officer testified: 
" ... we were schooled that although other countries 
[used assassination] we do not, and I had always 
understood this as a basic rule," (Duty Officer, p 14). 
"Question: So was it your understanding after this 
cqble, and in view of your knowledge of tJ1e Aee,ncy _..., .. 
general practice with respect to assassination in which 
you had been schooled that it was not done, that assass­
ination was not part of the Cuba Project, as far as you 
knew?''
