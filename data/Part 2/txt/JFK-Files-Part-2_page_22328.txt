Covert Investigatio:r:s by Field Agents 
Such. investigations were conducted much less frequently than overt investiga­
tions of applicants for employment. Several unofficial covers were used by 
investigators to prevent the person being investigated from being exposed as 
a CIA contact. 
TecJnical Operations 
! 
Technical operations consisted of the planting of electronic listening devices 
(King) and the telephone taps (Queen). No technical devices were planted by 
the Washington Field Office after the formation in 1968 of the "Surveillance 
and Tcchnic;:il Unit. n However, Mr. Brewer has pl2·,1tcd technical devices prior 
to 1968: 
1. In about 1966 Mr. Bre1•:cr planted a listcninf, device in an apc-:.rtoent 
at the S2.voy Apartments in Washington, D. C. (a CIA Safe House). This 
device was later removed and Brewer was tcld it was never used. 
2. About 8 years ago Mr. Brewer placed several bugs in a Washington Safe 
House. He believes they have never been removed. They have never been 
used to his knowledge. 
3. About 10 years ago Mr. Brewer was called back from vacation to bug a , 
cadillac to be used by tw~ Chinese generals. 
4. " At one time Mr. Brewer bugged hotel rooms in the Washington area where 
unwitting U-2 pilot applicants were being interviewed. 
5. : In 1963 Mr. Brewer placed telephone taps on phones in a home in 
Washington (MOCKINGBIRD case). At the time he did not know he was 
tapping a news columnist's phone, but he later learned that that had 
been the case. 
6. Four houses in Miami were bugged by Mr. Bre1~er shortly after the Ba}'.. ~of 
Pigs incident.
