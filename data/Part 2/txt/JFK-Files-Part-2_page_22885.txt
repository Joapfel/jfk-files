assassinate 
Mr. Bundy. I have no expianatio~'\:>f that. 
Senator Mondale. Part of our attempt to solve this riddle 
of what would appear to be a ·record at the highest level, _which 
is at least not directly an order of an assassination plot or 
attempt, and square it with the fact 'that attempts were made, is 
to seek to understand the personalities and motivations and 
methods of operation of people further down the chain of 
command. 
We have heard quite a few evaluations 1 61':. Mr. Harvey as 
a free-wheeling, James Bond kind of operator, and it has been 
sugg~sted through some disquiet and apprehension at hiqher 
levels about the nature of his conduct. And I would -- I don'J 
! 
know. I am beginning to have doubts about Mr. Helms whom I 
have always admired. There is, for example, a memorandum that 
is in the record•to Mr. Rusk in response to a memo which the 
Secretary wrote Mr. Helms following an article appearing in 
l 
I 
I 
I 
some Cuban newspaper charging that the Mafia had been hired a~d 
i 
used by the CIA to assassinate Castro, in which llelms specifi­
cally and categorically denies flat out that any such relation­
ship existed when in fact it did and when in fact Mr. !l~lms was 
part of it. 
Now, how do we sort this out? Is Mr. Helms someone who 
might .have, on his own, gone beyond the authority conferred 
upon him by persons higher up?
