Hr. Baron~ Would the PresidPnt? 
Mr. Tweocly. Yea, but he would probably have to come 
to the Agency to find out how to do it. I imagine the Presi­
dent could send a,personnl representative, I am dAJUn euro he 
would:.have no way of knowing how to send a cable out there. 
He would rnoke a muck ot it if he did. 
Kr. Baron. Did you leorn at any point that lethal blo-
logical aubetancea were actually in the custody of tho Chie! 
of Station in Congo? 
11r. Tweedy. Thie was mentioned when I talked to you and 
Mr. Wides and my answer was that I don't recall it, but that 
it was per!octly possible for them to be ocnt there. 
Mr. Daron. How would they have been eent? 
Mr. Tweedy . They could have been sent one or two ways, 
they would have been sent through the pouch with the whole 
thing wrapped in ard addressed in such manner that it would be 
opened only by the Chief of Station or somebody coming out 
by hand of officer or hand of somebody either way it could be 
done. 
Mr. Daron. Do you have ~ny knowledg~ of a meesanger 
from CIA hendquartere having tO go to the Conqo to provide 
the Chief of Station in the Congo with instructions to ca~ry 
out the assassination of Lumumba, if possible, and also pro­
vide him with tho tools to carry out such an assassination, 
namely, poison.sand medicdl equipment for administering them?
