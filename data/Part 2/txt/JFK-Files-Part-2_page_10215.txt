to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his gi-rlfricnd have made 
any further approaches to Security's informant rec-ly, althou~h he • • 
• continues to see the.dally. Thus, there is sli~~eason to bel~e\·e 
that further waiting will produce a. break in the case. . 
10. There are two c.ourses open to the Office of Se¢urity now. 
It c~n attempt to have the Agency em?to~;ee s k:10\vn to be. in contact 
with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might 
. alcr~ the Cuban to our pen~tration of the operation, ·particularly 
since a piausiblc reason for •tr~aster \vould be difficult to develop 
for some o! the _pers,ons involved. Alternatively, Security could 
move overtly and charge the Agency employees with viola_tion of the 
securit~· reg4,latiorl requiring reporting of contacts with foreign 
·nationals. This would, oi course, terminate the Office of Security'_s 
operation. 
11. One of these courses of action should be chos·en promptly. 
The possibility that the employee in s_~Division may be passing 
informati~n oxi.,tu ... 's Soviet operation_:]is too great to warrant further 
delay in moving against her._- Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban 
has current productive penetrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage 
to the Agency seems clearly to oufweigh any. possible gains from 
continuing this CI effort.
