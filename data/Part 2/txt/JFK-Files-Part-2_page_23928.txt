He communicated this opinion to both the State Department and 
the CIA. In July 1960, he advised ~ssistant Secretary ~ubottom

" ... in nc way ready to carry on any type of revolutionary 
activity in the foreseeable future except the 
assassination of their principal en~my." 
(Dearborn to Rubottam letter, 7/14/60) 
It is uncertain what portion of the information provided 
by Dearborn to State was passed above the Assistant Secretary 
level. Through August of 1960, only Assistant Secretary Rubottom, 
his Deputy, Lester Mallory, and Staff Assistant Frank Devine, 
were, within the Latin American Division of the Department, 
aware of Dearborn's "current projects." (Devine to Dearborn 
* letter, 8/15/60) 
By September 1960, Thom.as Mann· had replaced Roy Rubottom 
as Assistant Secretary for :i;nter-Araerican Affairs, and Frank 
Devine had become a Special Assistant to Mr. Mann. While 
serving as Specia-1 Assistant to the·-Assistant Secrefary, Devine 
reportedly spent ninety percent of his time coordinating State 
activities in Latin l\merica. It was in this capacity that 
·oev_ine maintained almost daily communication with Ned Holman 
and othei'officials of the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division 
(Devine, p. 7)

raised concern with the Department and he ~as advised that eertain 
specific information should more appropriately come through "tne 
other channel" (presumably, CIA cormnunications) .• Dearborn was 
advised that his cables to State were distributed to at least 19 
different recipient offices. (Id.)
