~. REPORT Of flNDINO5 
ROTC ASC at Fort Riley, Kansas. In July 1981, while Source was assigned as an 
Individual Tactical Training (ITT) instructor at Fort Riley, Kansas, he re­
ceived performance evaluations from SUBJECT'S peers and cadre personnel de­
scribing SUBJECT as immature and unable to interact with HIS peers. As a result 
of these reports, SUBJECT was required to appear before an administrative review 
board. The review board was to decide if SUBJECT was to be. given credit for 
completing ASC. Source, acting as defense representative for SUBJECT, sub­
mitted testimony to the board that SUBJECT should be granted credit for ASC. 
Source could not recall any specific statements other than saying SUBJECT was 
immature but should be given the benefit of the doubt and be granted credit 
for completing ASC. The board ruled that SUBJECT would be given credit for ASC. 
Upon completion of ASC, SUBJECT was to report· for Ann_uai. Training (AT) with 
C Battery, 128th Field Artillery Battalion, MNG, Marshall, Missouri. When 
SUBJECT returned to KMSC approximately 15 September 1981, HE told Source that 
HE had failed to attend HIS AT, (NFI). SUBJECT fJll't,her ... stated HE had attended 
airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia, from,August 1.981 to September 1981, 
(NFI). In September 1981, SUBJECT'S financial trouble led to HIS disenrollment 
from KMSC, which subse~uently led to SUBJECT being disenrolled from the ROTC 
program, (NFI). , 
In approximately February 1981, Source was informed by Thomas McCarthy, 
Professor, ~MSC, that SUBJECT and McCarthy debated the benefits of National 
Socialism (Nazism) during McCarthy's American Government class. SUBJECT'S 
support for Nazism enraged the other students and further widened the ga:p with 
SUBJECT'S peers, (NFI). Source believed SUBJECT to be loyal to the United 
States, but, because of HIS beliefs on Nazism and Communism, HE was branded 
"Anti-US" by HIS peers. Source, personally could not recall any occasions in 
which SUBJECT specifically denounced the United States Government. In approx­
imately May 1981, Booker T. Washington, SUBJECT'S former-Cadet Commanding 
Officer, A Company, KMSC, told Source that he was having.trouble with SUBJECT. 
Washington related that because of SUBJECT'S beliefs in Nazism, and HIS 
"superior" attitude over HIS peers, HE was alienating HIS peers against HIM~ 
Washington related further that SUBJECT had gone AWOL overnight in approx­
imately April 1981 to attend a debate between the Grand Wizard_ of the Ku Klux 
Klan (KKK) and a representative of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP). The debate was held in Columbia, Missouri. 
Washington also advised Source that SUBJEC~!had National Socialist reading mate­
rial in HIS barracks room, (NFI). Source did not know Washington's present 
address, only that Washington may be in the Berkley or Oakland, California 
area, (NFI). 
Source believed SUBJECT was mentally stable, but emotionally immature.
