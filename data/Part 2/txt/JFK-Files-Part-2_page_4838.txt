check with the office and see if they have it.

INTERVIEWER: I saw some mention in one of the Congressional 
documents. Dave Phillips in testimony, maybe for government 
operations. 
MR. HALPERN: Well. it may have been. But again, Dave wasn't 
running the questionnaire. That was an individual member's 
effort and using AFIO as a means of getting it out to the 
membership in kind of one fell swoop. He didn't have any way 
of getting -- I don't know what the membership was, maybe a 
thousand or fifteen-hundred something like that -- he wouldn't 
have any way of reaching that many people as a private 
individual. So we sent out the questionnaire that he 
prepared. And as a matter of fact I don't think I even 
responded to it because I thought some of the questions were 
silly. And I didn't see any potnt in answering silly 
questions. 
INTERVIEWER: You didn't save it? 
M.R. HALPERN: No, I didn't. I'm sorry. 
INTERVIEWER: I'm just curious because from the testimony there 
are some percentages. 
MR. HALPERN: Dave may have. You might ask Dave. Dave may 
have saved it. I don't know if the office itself saved it. 
They weren't very history-minded in the office.
