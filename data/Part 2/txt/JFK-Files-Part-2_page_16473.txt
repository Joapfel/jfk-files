vided, confu-sea~-·fightin~ among our s•ei,;es, we a re still 
in the elementary stage of throwing rocks, sticks, empty 
wine bottles and beer cans at racist cops who lie in wait 
for a chance to murder unarmed Black people. The racist 
cops have wo~ked out a system -for suppressing_ these spon"". 
~ - . ~ . ' '· . • 
taneous rebellions that··narc up from the anger, frustra-
tion, and despe.rati_on of the ma:sses of Black people. \Ve 
can no longer af.ford the dubious l4Xury of the terrible 
casualties wantonly 1ni1icted upon us by the cops during 
these spontaneous rebellions. 
Black people must now move, from the grassroots up 
through the per Limed· circles of the .plack bourgeoisie, to 
seize by any rru::ans necessary a pr-oportio:nate -~hare of the 
power vested and collected in the structure of America. 
We must organize and unite to combat by long r~sistance 
the brutal force used agains~ us daily. - ·The power struc.: 
ture depends upon the use of force within retaliation. This • 
is why they have made it a felony to teach guerilla wartare. 
This is why they want the people u-n~med.

The racist d~g oppressor .fears the armed people; they 
fear most of all Bi.ac~ people arrned with weapon~ and the f . . ·' . . . 
ideology of the Black Panther Party For Self Defense. An · 
unarmed peo'tHe are slaves or are subject to slavery at any 
given moment. fr a· governn1ent is .not afraid of the people 
it ~ill arm the people from foreign: ~ggressi<;>n: Black 
people are held captive ·in the 1nidst .of their oppressors. 
There is a world of difference between thirty niillion un­
armed, submissive Black people and thirty 1nillion Black 
people armed with frecdon1 and dcfe·nse guns and tl1e stra­
tegic methods of liberation. 
When a mechanic wants to fix a broken-~own car en­
gine, he must have the necessary tqols to do the job. 
When the people move for liberation, they n1ust have the 
, basic tool of liberation: the gun. Only with the power of 
the gun can tl)e Black masses halt the terror and brutality 
perpetuated against them by.the armed racist power ,itruc­
ture; and in one s.ens e only by the powc r of the gun can the 
whole world be trans formed into the ea. rthly pa rad is e.
