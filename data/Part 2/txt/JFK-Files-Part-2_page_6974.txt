Here lies, I submit, the long-term importance of tp.e work being carried out by 
the AARB. The meaning of the raw data being unearthed by the review board will 
probably not be appreciated any time soon by the generations sentient when 
President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, but if these generations cannot come 
to terms with history as it happened in their lifetimes, then at the very least, 
they have an obligation to hand over, insofar as possible, a complete and 
thorough documentary record. Citizens will need that record to rebut the Otto 
Eisenschimls of the next century, not that there is any dearth of them now. 
I strongly support without qualification extension of the review board for 
another year and full funding of its operations. Bringing its work to an abrupt 
end would not only diminish the investment of time and resources already made; 
in all likelihood, it would throw the whole initiative into chaos. Not least of 
all, gutting the effort now would surely create ineradicable suspicion about the 
federal government's intentions in the first place. I'd like to spend the 
balance of my time describing the three areas where I thank the review board
