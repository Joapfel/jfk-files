In addition to considerations, there were several 
practical reasons advanced for not assassinating foreign 
leaders. These reasons are discussed in the section of 
this report recommending a statute making assassination 
a crime. 
a. Distinction Between Targeted Assassinations 
Instigated by the United States and Support 
for Dissidents Seeking to Overthrow Local 
Governments 
Two of the five principal cases investigated 
by the Committee involved plots to kill foreign leaders 
(Lumumba and Castro) that were instigated by American 
officials. Three of the cases (Trujillo, Diem, Schneider) 
involved killings in the course of coup attempts by local 
dissidents. These latter cases differed in the degree to 
which assassination was contemplated by· the leaders of .the 
coups and the degree to which United States officials 
motivated the coups. 
The. Committee concludes that targeted· assassinations 
instigated by the United States must be prohibited.
