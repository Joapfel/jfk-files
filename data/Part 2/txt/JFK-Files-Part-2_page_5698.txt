SUBJECT: (S) Required Protection of Warrenton Training Center 
as CIA Facility 
Agency's primary Emergency Communications Center. Given the 
amount of time, money and resources which will be expended to 
insure that the·facility is maintained in such a way that it will 
be prepared for any emergency situation, it would certainly be in 
the best interests of the US Government not to permit any 
official affiliation, no matter how minor, of WTC and the CIA. 
7. (S) The preceding descriptions of ongoing and planned 
activities at WTC presents, I believe,. an intuitive sense of the 
damage to national security which would follow from a linking of 
WTC with CIA. In sum, the conduct of covert.communications and 
support activities as well as the presence of officers who will 
soon be serving overseas under cover in highly sensitive 
positions can not take place at a facility linked to CIA. But 
there are some very specific damage issues that I wish to 
highlight and they include: 
• (S) Serious and Immediate Impairment to Physical and 
Personnel Security: Our Department of the Army cover­
allows us to maintain a relatively low profile in the 
Warrenton community and a very low profile outside.of the 
immediate area. If WTC became recognized as a CIA 
facility, the increased visibility and scrutiny would 
place·employees~ ·facilities, arid daily opera~ions at 
greater risk. In sum, WTC would become an easy "target 
of opportu!lity" for the media, foreign counter­
intelligence agents, terrorist and militia activities, 
demonstrators, and emotionally unstable-individuals. 
Facts, examples, and specific concerns include: 
• WTC, like most domestic CIA sites, is a very 
lightly guarded facility in terms of personnel 
guards and physical fencing. It survives and
