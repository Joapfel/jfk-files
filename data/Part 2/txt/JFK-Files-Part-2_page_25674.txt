some "high rollers" in would, be 
more profitable - it was Rosselli 
who patched things up. 
Hughes eventually bought the 
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier. 
What Rosselli told the federal 
grand jury about the Frontier. in 
1971 is unknown; Rosselli didn't 
testify later at the trial at which =. 
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol­
izzi and the Em prise. Corp., among : 
• others, were convicted. 
ZERILLI and· Polizzi are· still in 
jail. In 1973, the .House of Repre­
sentatives Select Committee on 
Crime probed the influence of or­
ganized crime in sports - and one 
area they looked at was· Emprise 
and the Frontier Hotel case. 
At the time of the conviction, the 
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz­
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately; 
because monitored, wiretapped 
conversations showed that the two 
had talked about "murder, the kill-
. ing of certain individuals." 
An intimate associate of Rosselli, 
however, discounts the possibility 
that Rosselli's grand jury appear~ 
ance could have led to his death. 
"They know Johnny didn't talk to 
the grand jury," the associate said. 
JOE BREEN said ·Rosselli hadn't 
been to Las Vegas for nine years, 
that "he's never even seen the gift 
shop." 
Since his prison release and 
move to Plantation, Ross.el Ii wasn't 
trying to regain power; according 
to his friends. "He had no muscle," 
said an assoeiate."I can't believe 
Rosselli was getting back into' mob 
stuff." •

But at the same time, 'many of 
the associates were surpised to 
learn about Rosselli's recent visits 
with alleged organized c:rime fig­
ures on the West Coast. 
Several associates speculate that 
Rosselli, wanted to get involved in 
. casino gambling, preferably in the 
Middle East, and was looking for 
someone with money to back him .. 
"MY IMPRESSION was that he 
was broke," Morgan said. "He told 
me last year, 'I'm. in. bad .. financial. 
straits.' " • •• • 
' Scheer said Rosselli's income in­
cluded about $60,000 from the gift 
. shop and about $3,500 in social se­
curity. most of which went for 
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
-~rnment fines. __

One friend said! that· just before 
Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac­
cepted Giancana's offer of monev. 
The friend was to act as ,the inter­

A California woman who had 
known Rosselli fot about 40 years

around him for 30 minutes vou'd 
like him because he would regard 
you as a human being." 
"If you had a heldache he would • 
either get you an I aspirin or send 
someone to get one. I said some­
thing significant there - he would 
get it or he would send someone -
• he wasn't a pansy, 1but he wasn't a 
tough guy either."
