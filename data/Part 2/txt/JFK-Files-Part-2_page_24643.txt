By this_point, Hedgman had conducted his "exploratory con-
-:,.t· 
versation 11 with the ~gent who was his best candidate for gaining 
access to L"umumba .(HE;\dgman, 8/21/75, p. 60}. Hedgman testified 
I 
that the subject he "explored" was the agent's ability to find a 
means to inject poison into Lumumba 's food or toothpaste. (Hedgman, • 
8/21/75, p. 60): 
I beli'eve that I queried the a8ent who had 
access to Lumumba, . and his entourage,• in 
detail about just what that access, what 
access he ~ctually had, as opposed to speak~ 
ing to people. In other words, .did he have 
access to the bathroom, did he have access 
to the kitchen, things of that sort. 
I have a recollection of having queried him . 
on that without specifying why I wanted to 
know this. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 48.) 
On October 7, the Chief of Station reported to headquarters 
. on this meeting:

[AGENT] SUGGESTED SOLUTION REC011MENDED BY 
HQS. ALTHOUGH DID NOT PICK UP BALL, BELIEVE 
HE PREPARED TAKE ANY ROLE NECESSARY WITHIN 
LIMITS.SECURITY ACCOMPLISH OBJECTIVE. 
Hedgm:an testified that his exploratory· steps left him with 
doubts about the wisdom or practicality of the assassination plot: 
[C]ertainly I looked on it as a pretty wild 
scheme professionally. I did not think that 
it ... was.practical professionally. 
Certainly ... to keep the U.S. out of it .... 
I explored it, but I doubt that I ever really 
expected to carry it out. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 111.)
