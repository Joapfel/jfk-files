Q I see. So some of these boats and personnel were 
actually stationed full-time in the Keys. 
A Oh, yes. Oh, sure. 
Q Were there any operations run out of the United 
States which involved destruction of crops or poisoning of 
sugar or anything of that sort? 
A What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the 
Puerto Rican thing? 
A Well, that is one of the things I had in mind. 
Would you describe. that for me? 
A Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of 
opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar 
to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to 
it but I know that it got a hale below the waterline, or 
something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs. 
In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the 
drydock or wherever it was, thay.had ta remove the sugar and 
put it in tha.war.ehouse and at that time I guess somebody came 
up with a plan to try to widen the rift betw~en -- there was 
a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to 
put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it 
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the 
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it 
leaked_, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar 
firm buy it back from. the Sovie ts.
