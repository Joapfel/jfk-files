Mr. Bundy. That is right.

Mr. Bundy. Well, it was the successor to the MONGOOSE

MONGOOSE, and the review of secret operations then came back 
under the complete control of the Special Group, by now, I 
think, called the 303 Committee, which was a lineal successor 
of 5412.

Mr. Dundy. Is that what it is? 
Mr. Schwarz. Does it do that, Mr. Kelley, because Chase 
J_ memorandum starts by saying, here is a summary of Paul _Sakwa' s 
Mr. Kelley. I think that is an error in Mr. Chase's memo, 
because it is clear that what is being summarized here is i1r.
