Niarchos' ship captains named Katopodes brought a libel action 
I believe it was, against Onassis for some letter he had writte 
about some activities of Katapodes, I can't remember the 
details now. 
We didn't know where this was leading. So this was in 
the Supreme Court of New York State, and so I went to a fellow 
I knew in the U.S. Attorney's office and asked him if he 
could keep track of how this suite was developing to see if 
it was leading into some of the connections we had, par­
ticularly with Niarchos. 
And he got some of the pleadings and some of the pre­
trial evidence --
Mr. Wides. But you don't recall any contacts between 
the Agency and the Justice Department resulting in Mr. Yeagley 
going up to try and halt some aspects of the grand jury 
proceedings in New York growing out --
Mr. Houston. ~It strikes no valve. 
Mr. Wides. Let me ask just one more question in this 
19 area and then we will move on to the document I asked you to 
20· look at before we started.

Mr. Maxwell. 
Mr. Wides 
I have just one other question.
