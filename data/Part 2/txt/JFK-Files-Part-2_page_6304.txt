Process: First, process - the components own the information and the IRO is the gate­
keeper who controls what will be done, what will be searched, and what will be released. 
This makes coordination complex, but the larger issue is that the IR0 usually does not 
have either the clout or the resources to do the job and we find cases bottle-necked. 
Policies: What also make~ coordination difficult, is an institutional bias to withhold 
until forced to release. Thus, we adopt silly positions. When pressed, we often concede 
in the end; but we lose credibility in the process. 
There is no stomach, and perhaps no time to: 
~ Question the questionable, 
~ Revalidate the counter intuitive, 
~ or even overturn the nonsensical.
