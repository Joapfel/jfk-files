While this Committe~ has not been able to find 
any direct corroboration of Anna Tarasoff's claim, 
the circumstantial corroboration is s~ch that the 
possibility that ·there was an additional transcript 
cbn~erning Uswald that was available to the_ Mexico 
City Station i_n late 1963.cannot be dismissed. In 
all likelihood, the Azcue call to the Soviet Consulate 
concerning Oswald was ·probabl_y made on telephones 
not subject to CIA surveillance and, hence, .wo~ld 
not have been available tc the CIA's Mexico City 
Station.

that a photograph of· Lee llarvey Oswald was not 
·. .
