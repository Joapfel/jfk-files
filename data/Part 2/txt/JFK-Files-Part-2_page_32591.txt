Agency's radio and press output.

and press coverage included Castro's July 26 speech urging 
revolutions in Latin America, the discovery of terrorist 
weapons factories in Guayaquil, the Ecuadorean Vice 
Presidentvs accusation of Cuban responsibility for terrorism, 
the Cuban use of Grand Cayman as a way station for subversive 
elements from Cuba, the expulsion from the University of a 
Bolivian youth leader for receiving funds from Cuba, 
Castro-trained guerrillas in Honduras, and Bolivian protests 
against meddling by the Cuban Embassy in the miner's strike. 
A Voice of American roving reporter in Latin Am0.rica 
provided several reports on the subversion picture in coun­
tries he visited. 
c. In support of the Agencyvs effort on Cuban-based 
subversion, the publicaticns center in Mexico began work on 
three pamphlets during the period based on Castro's report 
of his visit to the Soviet Union (showing that he contradicted 
himself in some of his extravagant claims of Soviet progress), 
the losses suffered by Cuban labor under Castro, and the 
fate of political prisoners in Cuba. When completed, these 
pamphlets will be reproduced and distributed in quantity 
throughout the area.
