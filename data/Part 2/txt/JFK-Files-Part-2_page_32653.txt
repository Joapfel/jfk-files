LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 
U. S, Senate, 
Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, 
Committee on Armed Services, 
Honorable Richard B. Russell, 
Chairman, Committee on Armed Services 
t.T. S. Senate 
My Dear Mr. Chairman: 
May , 1963. 
There is transmitted herewith an interim report by the 
Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, appointed under Senate 
Resolution 75 of the 88th Congress, on the Cuban Military Buildup. 
In its inquiry to this time the Subcommittee has received 
testimony in executive session from the Director of Central Intelligence, 
the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Chiefs of the 
Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence sections. The interim report 
transmitted herewith is addressed primarily to a review of military 
developments and intelligence activities and operations in connection 
with Cuba from early 1962 to the present insofar as the facts have 
been developed and are now known to the Subcommittee. 
The Subcommittee intends to pursue further its inquiry 
into the Cuban situation and it is anticipated that one or more 
subsequent reports on this subject will be issued in the future. 
It is necessary that this interim report to the full 
Committee on Armed Services be classified "Secret." However, the 
Subcommittee is submitting the report for review for security 
purposes and will have the report printed and released to the 
public when it has been so reviewed and the necessary security 
matters have been deleted. 
Respectfully, 
NW .5095.5 Docld.: 32424109 Page 34 
JOHN STENNIS, 
Chairman, Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee.
