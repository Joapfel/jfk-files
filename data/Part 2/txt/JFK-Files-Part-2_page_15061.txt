VIRGINIA STANFILL SAVELL 
She was employed by former United States Senator 
Thomas H. Kuchel of California in his Los Angeles, California, 
office from August, 1961, to September, 1968. She is pres­
ently an assistant to Herbert G. Klein at the White House. 
In September, 1966, at the·request of 
Senator Kuchel, a very discreet inquiry was conducted 
into an allegation Senator Kuchel had received that • 
Mrs. Savell was possibly operating a bookie joint out 
of the Senator's Los Angeles, California, office. The 
inquiry developed no information to substantiate the 
allegation. The investigation did develop information 
that Mrs. Savell reportedly was an alcoholic. 
The current investigation to date has ascertained 
that the South Pasadena, California, Police Department· 
records indicate Mrs. Savell attempted suicide on July 23, 
1967. She reportedly took an overdose of sleeping capsules.
