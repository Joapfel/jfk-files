aeaommend1 Delete items (d) and (e). Subpart Ca) should be 
confined to documents created by agencies (vice used) during 
their declassification review. 
The inclusion of generic categories of information, i.e., those 
created independent of the assassination inveetigation(s) and 
review effort, appears to be a calculated effort to gain access 
to significant areas of information that are protected by other 
laws (i.e., circumvention of the FOIA.) 
If provisions (d) and Ce) are not deleted and a and b 
not limited to materials created by or created solely for use in 
the assassination review, an additional section should be added 
that applies to section 1400.2 in its entirety. This should 
state that information created independent of the assassination 
review will be released unless protected by other laws, Executive 
Orders, and/or regulations.

1400. l (a) 
Raeommend: Insert the word nreasonably 11 between °may have 
[reasonably] led to the assassination ... " 
The mere allegation that foreign events or 
international developments may have led co the 
assassination at this point in time (after all 
the investigations) should not bring records 
not related to the assassination on their face 
within the scope of this act. There should be 
an objective standard, i.e., reasonable person 
threshold. Otherwise agencies could be 
subjected to massive records searches on 
little more than whim. The JFK assassination is 
the epitome of conspiracy theories. Without a 
threshold standard, the door would be opened to 
additional searches (without merit), the 
potential costs of which could be significant.
