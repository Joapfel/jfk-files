Donald Deneslya Interview 
. Page 4. 
In November 1962 Donald received a strange request 
from Golitsin. Rudolf Nureyev was appearing in Chicago, Il­
linois and there was an ad in the paper that tickets were 
available at a certain bookstore. He wanted Deneslya to 
contact the store and find out where Nureyev was staying. 
Deneslya had heard that the KGB was planning to kidnap or 
kill Nureyev._ 
Derieslya told the writer that a Charles Bohr, a 
CIA doctor, was the case ~f:ficer on Golitsin; Bohr was a 
psychiatrist. Deneslya said that he never heard anyone 
even remotely suggest that Golitsin was "paranoid" until 
he heard about the testimony of ex-CIA officer Johri Hart 
before HSCA. It was his feeling that in 1963 the Agency 
had great respect :for Golitsin because o:f the.information 
wh.ich he was providing. There were times wheri they would 
. get exaspera.ted with him because he would sometimes go over 
the heads. of the people he was dealing with i:f he didn't 
th.ink th.e:y were reacting to his information. Golitsin was 
apprehensive about Soviet world intentions and made no bones 
about i.t. He knew how· widely the Soviets had penetrated 
other intelli9ence agencies. He told us about Fel:fe (ph.) 
and Klemens who had penetrated the Gehlen Organization of 
West Germa.n Intelligence which was the sarne as penetrating 
the CI:A because the Gehlen group was an eX:terision. of CIA.
