\~~ '-\;_'\ CIA :ff~;:s to Promote a Coup 
A. The Chilean Conspirators 
Anti-Allende coup plotting in Chile centered around several key 
individuals. One of these was retired General Roberto Viaux, the General 
* who had led the "Tacnazo" insurrection a year before. Following the 
11
Tacnazo
11 
revolt, an'd his dismissal from the Army, Viaux retained the 
support of many non-commissioned and junior officers as well as being 
the recognized leader of several right-wing civilian groups. (CIA 
Briefing Paper, "Special Mandate from the President on Chile," July 
15, 1975) 
Another individual around which plottin!!,.centered was General Camilo 
fMi,.o~cqS)(CIA Report on Chilean Task Force Activities, November 18, 
1970) All of these officers, with the possible exception(f 
** were in contact with Viaux as well. 
*This revolt was engineered by Viaux ostensibly for the purposes of drama­
tizing the military's demand for higher pay, but was widely interpreted as 
an abortive coup. 
**The record of meetings between Viaux and the active duty military 
is incomplete. The record does show, however, that Viaux met with 
around October 7. (Chile Task Force Log, October 7). On Oc er 12 
1aux met with General Valenzuela ( hile Task Force Log, 14 October)J One 
cable from Santiago indicates that may have been a member 
of Viaux's inner ci e of conspirators() (Station 545, 16 October 1970). 
At the very least, as in contact with Viaux. 
Although a distinction can be made between the'·.Vl:aux and Valenzuela groups, 
'' . ' 
as CIA witnesses did throughout their .testimony before the Committee, the 
principal distinction between the two was that the "tatter was led by active duty 
military officers. The two groups were in contact with each other. The 
record also indicates that they worked together in at least two of the three 
Schneider kidnap attempts.
