INTERIM. REPORT ON CUBAN MILITARY :BUILDUP 
I . INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
The dramatic events which.occurred last October with respect to Cuba are 
now history. Following photographic confirmation of the fact that strategic 
and offensive weapons bad, in fact, been introduced into Cuba and President 
Kennedy's confrontation with Premier Khrushchev, such strategic and offensive 
weapons were ostensibly withdrawn. 
However, the public concern and debate about the Cuban situation has not 
subsided. There have been and are insistent reports that the Soviets still 
maintain strategic missiles in Cuba which are concealed in caves and other 
underground facilities and that Soviet troops are based in the island in 
numbers far in excess of those accepted by our intelligence community. Reports 
also abound with respect to the use of Cuba as a base for subversive, agita­
tional and revolutionary activities directed at other La.tin American countries. 
The prevalence of these reports and allegations prompted the Preparedness 
Investigating Subcommittee to launch an investiga.tion into the entire subject 
matter in an effort to determine the facts. Although the investigation still 
continues, the Subcommittee deems it appropriate to issue an interim report at 
this time. This report will be limited to a review of military developments 
and intelligence activities and operations in connection with Cuba from early 
1962 to the current.time insofar as the facts are now known to us. A discus­
sion of the use of Cuba as a base for subversive activities will be included 
in a subsequent report. 
Broadly speaking, the term "intelligence community" includes the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the intelligence sections 
of the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of 
State, the National Security Agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the
