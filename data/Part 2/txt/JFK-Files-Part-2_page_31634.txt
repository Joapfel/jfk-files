You may soon be sent to Vietnam. You have heard about the war in the news; your 
officers will give you pep talks about it. I3ut you probably feel as confused and uncertain 
about it as most Americans do. Many people will tell you to just follow orders and leave 
tile think.in~ to others. But you have the right to know as much about this war a:: anyone 
clsC'. After all, it's you---not your congres sman---who might get killed. 
· WHY ARE \VE. FIGHTING IN VIETNAM ? 
We are supposed to be fighting to protect democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own 
government admits that South Vietnam is a dictatorship. General Ky,. the latest militar-y 
dictator~ is as bad as they come. • - Insert here quote about Ky admiring Hitler etc. - • 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•• General Ky doesn't mean much to us; we're not even sure how to pronounce his name . 
. • 'Jut the South Vietnamese have lived under him and men like him for ten years. As far 
as they are concerned, we are fighting on the side of Hitler ism; and they hope we lose. 
WHO IS THE ENEMY ? 
U.S. military spokesmen have often said that their greatest problem is finding the· 
enemy. "The enemy" they say, "is everywhere." The old woman feeding her chickens • 
may have a stock of ha.nd grenades in her hut. The little boy who trails after the America 
• soldiers during the day slips out to give information to the guerillas at night. The 
washerwoman at the American air base brings a bomb to .work one day. "It is impossible 
says the milita~:7. "to tell who is the Viet Cong and who is the people." • 
• And so, because the whole Vietnamese people seems to be the enemy, the military 
is taking no chances. They use tear gas---a weapon only used against civilian populationt 
• never against soldiers. They order American troops to fire at women and children--­
because women and children, after all, are firing at American troops. American fighter 
planes destroy civilian villages with napalm; American B52s are flattening whole regions. 
That is why the war in Vietnam is so often called a ''dirty war.'' 
• When the South Vietnamese people see you in your foreign unifor_~, they will think of 
you as their enemy. You are the ones bombing their towns. They don't know whether 
yor're a.draftee or .a volunteer, whether you're for the war or against it; but they're not 
taking any chances either. ' 
FREE ELECTIONS . 
The Vietnamese would dearly like to vote the foreigners out of their country, but 
they have never had the chance. According to the Geneva Agreement •lf 1954, there were 
supposed to be elections throughout Vietnam in 1956, Dul the U.S. government was 
afraid that our man in Vietnam, Pre rnier Diem, would lose. In fact, President F.iscn!!i>Wl 
himself admitted ·that ''Ho Chi Minh .... 80%" (F.isenhower quote). So we peciclcd not to 
allown any elecU_on there until _we wer~ sure we could -~~n. _ Diem set up a p~litical p_olicc
