EXECUTIVE ASSIGNIVIENT SYSTEM 
Executive Order 11315 established an Executive 
Assignment System for filling positions in Grades· 16, 17, and 
. 18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded. 
The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super­
grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of 
employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through 
l8 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill 
vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this 
inventory all such employees, including those in th~ FBI. This 
would make our executives available for consideration by other 
. agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider 
employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The 
Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21, 
1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request­
ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as 
retention by ihe FBI of its executives is considered essential. We 
have been following with the Departrnent but the matter h~s not yet 
been acted upon by the Attorney General.
