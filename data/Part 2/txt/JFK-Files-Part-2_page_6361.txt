Issues: 
Non-related (36,000+ pages) and OP (10,000 pages) material 
in microfilm collection 
The "segregated" records statement negates our claim that 
material in the Microfilm is "non-related". We can point 
out that the HSCA requested, but did not review a lot of 
these records and that access was given to complete files 
even thought the request dealt with specific events or 
timeframes. However, given their objective of going 
"beyond" previous investigations, I not sure this would have 
any impact. 
A different approach would be to deny or ~ostpone personnel 
type files including 201s that are not related to the 
assassination (guidelines to be established in consultation 
~ith the Board) as unwarranted invasion of privacy and/or 
protection of sources. Approximately 25,000 pages of the 
Non-related II19-terial are from 201 files; the remaining 
10,000+ pages are from organization and project files.
