1. In 1960, I was employed by the CIA and one of my 
responsibilities in the course of my employment was to serve as

training that WIROGUE received in preparation for his assignment

3. WIROGUE was not trained in medical immunization in 
my presence. I am not aware that he was provided with any such 
training. 
4. I have no knowledge of any CIA plot to assassinate 
Patrice Lumumba. I have no knowledge that WIROGUE·was ever 
connected to a plot to assassinate Lurnurnba, nor have I heard 
any hint or suggestion of such a connection.

is registered at the CIA along with my true identity. My true 
signature is affixed to this affidavit. The Senate Select
