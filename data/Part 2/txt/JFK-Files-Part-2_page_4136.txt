SUBJECT: Meeting of the Special Group (5412) - 8 August 1963 
Present were: McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric, Alexis Johnson, 
General Carter and Paul Eckel 
9~ 
1. Reconnaissance Requirements for Current Contin ency in 
the Far East 
The requirements for overflights were approved subject 
to the following: 
For the Sino-Indian border when a base becomes 
available. Bundy wanted to know if we were ready for a high-level 
approach to Nehru. I asked him to hold off until we had taken a better 
reading and our team had returned. As to the Mainland of China, 
to include Manchuria, Bundy did not want to go near the Soviet border 
and felt that 10 or 15 miles was entirely too close. He had no objec -
tion to anywhere over the Mainland of China providing we kept well 
clear of the Soviet border. I told him that if we did this we would 
not be meeting the requirement to keep track of anything occurring on 
the Sino -Soviet conflict along the border and the general consensus 
was that we could do without this type of reconnaissance rather than 
run the risk of an incident. The Group established a "bank of two" 
missions for operations against Laos, north of the 17th parallel, and 
against North Vietnam. There appeared to be no problem about 
replenishing the bank when it was drawn down. The mission against 
Laos south of the 17th parallel was approved. The mission for cover­
ing North Korea was approved as a high priority requirement subject 
only to the return of Secretary Rus1iJ 
2. Cuban Operations of August 
Mr. FitzGerald briefed the Special Group along the lines 
of his briefing notes {SAS 63-481 of 7 August). Everything was 
approved except that State had an opportunity to reclama the sabotage 
operations if they felt the need--Johnson said he would know definitely 
by Sunday {presumably thinking that Rusk may have had some private 
conversations with Khrushchev that could indicate the need for soft 
pedaling actions in Cuba).
