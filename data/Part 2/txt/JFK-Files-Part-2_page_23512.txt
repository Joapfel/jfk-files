1. Action. None·. • This memorandum is for your information . 
. 2. Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962, 
concerning the men1orandum of that date from General Laasdale. 
Attached is a copy of this me~orandum, excised from ,vhich are 
four words in the second_ line of the penuJtimate paragraph on 
page I. These four words were "includin~_ liquidation. of _leaders. 11 
3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro, 
was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the meeting of the 
Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rusk's 01fice on 10 August. 
It was the _obvious consensus at that meeting. in answer to a 
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow·, that this is not a subject which 
has been made a matter of official record. Itook careful notes on 
the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group 
(Augmented) is not exf>ecting any written comments or study on 
this point. 
4. Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called 
Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand 
the in~drnis s ibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in 
wr.iting in such a document. I advised F_rank Hand that, as far 
as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to 
this and would participate in no open mc.eting discussing it. 
I strongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise 
the phrase in question from all cop_ie s of this -~ernorandum, in-. 
eluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA. Shortly 
thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the message that 
he agreed and that he had done so.
