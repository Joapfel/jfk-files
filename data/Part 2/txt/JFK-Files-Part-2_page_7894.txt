)..:<: be ca1led :mind-bending reminds :rae that. my requests se~ to me-to .cov-er- tl~s and that you • • 
have not notified t1e of thi3 release. I do t-1.;?..-r1t these. If you interi1ret DY prior requests 
. as not covering _them then consid.er .. this a ne:; request. t!Y •recollection is that my initial 
-;. • .:> requests cover anything a".i.d verfihing directly or indiractly related to this subj :?ct. That 
you have interpreted my requests as :i: have is evidence from prior corraspon.dence noti-- _ .

-i_:,~_,:" 
~+. ~ U.i~r the Act th;re' is authorl tyfor the re:nission. of all costs end. foes. I believe 
~~: -I meet ·the requirements for _this· remission and I make the request :forr...a.l.ly.; Ny work _ 
~\;is restrictad e:::clusiv'ely· to wr.at is now regarded :as iuportant historical cases,.· In -o:::ie . 
~•~1'-°bn :which I){ ha.~a paid the _CL\. large SUiilS iii thout COJ!lplience, the King assassination, -the • _ 
_ .. : :t previous Atto:::ney General so held.,· formally, confir=ied by a federal judge. I have already -
~\t'.' ~rran.ged to give ell my recofds, not just these, to 'a university system. ± believe at an. 
j";-Z: ·earlier date I reserved _,the right to recover these. fees. I have delayed a· formal appealp 
"1' !)8!lding a dete:ro:ination of a judge .that there be a ruling by the Department, of Justice -~ 
~ wit~ regard to me and on this •. The Departn:.ent provided ~ be.rgain-base.ment :response, a. • 
t.,· 6~ r0Dission that I have· appealed _and will if nscessary litigate. I hope the CIA will 
Zt( act favorably on this. • • 
. /~- •• _,. • lortg tine· since I have hea......-d from you about a multitude of r~quests 
• ur own backlog claiLS. Cne o:f these is on ths King assassir.ation, :rn.·

I a;;i ·asld.:.'lg again uhen I m:!.Y e:l:_pect to hear from yoJ. on e.ll the other rt~quests, 
including my P..:\ res_uest for the records on me. T~:e appeal i3 sev2ral years old now. J:Iy 
recollection is that yog.r last refer-ence to this stated the pioocessing of tha ap~1eal. had 
:.::!.Ot :ncii conpleted. I have right:J und:~r the Act to ~or·, tha.11. co::_:iies. I went to exa:?:"Cise 
those.righ~s. This is impossible without obtai.!1L,; all copies first. As~!I have told you 
rep,~atedly I ,-rould prefer not to have to litigate this. m1at I am thus really asking you -
is doe s the CIA uant me to suit it on a req_m~st th:c!t goes back to 1971 and 0:1. which it ·is 
not in com:plia.."1ce? 1-io~ even processed t;;e aprieal? 
Anong tl~e factors makinJ it difficult to keop tract of these non-compliances is your
