Hedgman: There was no doubt in my ·mind that 
tfiis was one of the way[s], and probably what 
they thought was the only way that.would work 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 25). 
Hedgman explained Gottlieb provided him with poisons as a means 
of assassination: 
Q: And wh~t did he te.11 :(OU with regard t;o 
Fiow that might be accomplished? 
Hedgman: 
r·assume 
any case, 
passed to 
... He brought some biological agents. 
that that ls the correct word.· But in • 
poisonous agent with him, which he 
me .... 
Q_; These were lethal biological substances? 
Hedgrnan: Yes.· That was my understanding 
as a non-expert. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp; 18-19.) 
Hedgrnan testified that he received "rubber gloves, a mask, and a 
syringe" along with the poisons and that Gottlieb instructed him 
in their use (Hedgrnan, 8/21/75, pp. -20-21). Hedgman indicated that 
this paraphernalia was for administering the poisons to Lumumba: 
Q.,: [W]hen he [Gottlieb] came to the Congo 
to give you lethal biological agents for 
the assassination of Lumumba, was it clear 
at that time that the means for admini.stering 
those biological agents was to inject then 
into a substance that was tobe ingested by 
Lumumba, whether it be food, or drink, or 
• toothpaste or any other substance that was 
to be ingested? 
Hed~man: That's my iecollection, yes. 
(He gman, 8/21/75, p. 82; accord. p. 24.) 
Hedgman said that the means of assassinatio~ was not restricted 
to use of the poisons provided by Gottlieb: 
This was not a sine qua non that I employ this. 
If there were another metnod, another way, it 
would have been acceptable. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 19.)
