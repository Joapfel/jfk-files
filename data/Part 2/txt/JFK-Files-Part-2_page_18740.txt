1 JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and 
: EDWARD F. GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE1 s identity should be 
• protected.) As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and . 
cc:~perativ~. Ltl} 
• During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked 
if he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58 
·issue of' "The Nation. 11 The introducti(:)n of this topic 
into the interview was very casual and the exact date of 
the issue in which the article appeared was not actually 
·mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article 
nor had he heard about the article. Interviewing Agents then 
told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort 
. to nsmear" the Bureau. The Agents cormnented that the Bureau 
always welcomes constructive criticisni,_ and upon receipt of 
same, has always taken expeditious s~~s to make an;' • 
warranted changes in its operations. However, the article 
·appearing in "The Natj.onn contained no constructive criticism 
and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based on 
untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes. 
' 
JAFFE said that he would like very much to read 
this article and asked who the author was. When the 
name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE, 
. but when JAFFE was told that COOK wrote for the 11New York 
·world Telegram and Sun, 11 he expressed amazement. Interviewing 
Agents expressed idle. interest in knowing whatever provoked 
the writing and publication of such an ar~icle and this 
evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILEIAMS, 
editor of 0 The Nation, 11 was undoubtedly the moving factc:!:$ 
behind such an article appearing in 11The Nation." He 
said tµat CAREY MC WILLIAV.!S is violently anti-Bureau, 
was anti- 11McCarthy 11,~ is 9,nti-House Un-American Activities
