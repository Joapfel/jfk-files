~ DETAILS: 
On 12 November 1969, KARL D. ACKERMAN (former Counselor for Administration, 
United States Embassy, Bangkok, ThaHandL 99 Victoria Drive, Atherton, California, 
was interviewed by SA ROBERT J" NOV.ACK and the writer, and related substantially as 
follows: 
ACKERMAN had several conversations with Colonel WALTER ADAMS concerning the 
practical problems of getting weapons, belonging to a MITCHELL Lo WERBELL, into 
Thailand from the Republic of Vietnam in order that WERBELL could put on a fire power 
demonstration for the King of Thailand 
O
s birthday_~_ At all times during these conversa­
tions I ACKERMAN assumed the,weapons were WERBELV s wares, and that he had 
brought them from the· United States with him. With this in mind, ACKERMAN stated 
that he instructed Mr o GERALD T. CARTA to annotate WERBELL' s travel orders with a 
Bangkok United States Embassy Funding Citation number, ACKERMAN said the citation 
numbers were in a block of numbers belonging to the Embassy, and because he did not 
feel he had the authority to issue WERBELL any other type of number, he issued him an 
Embassy number, When ACKERMAN was asked if he knew PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT, he 
said the name was vaguely familiar but could not recall anything further o When 
ACKERMAN was aske::l H he knew E.ARLENE DOBBS, he stated that he did not, to the best 
of his knowledge. ACKERMAN stated that hls knowledge of WERBELL came solely from 
ADAMS and other stori.es he heard around the Embassy of the fire power demonstration 
to be given for the Ki.ng, ACKERMAN stated he had no personal knowledge of WERBELL.
