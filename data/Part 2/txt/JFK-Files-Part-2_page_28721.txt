• The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr. 
Chairman 
.Committee on House Administration 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr; Chairman: 
I am requesting that you consider authorizing a· 
retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counsel 
of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K. 
Tanenbaum. Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee 
was erroneously terminated:at the close of business July 31-­
three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee. 
This administrative error was an oversight, which went unno­
ticed until after the August pay period when he notified the 
Committee that. he had not received a paycheck for August 1 
through 3. His annual rate of pay was $36,000; therefore!t 
the amount I am requesting he be retroactively paid is $300. 
Mr. Tanenbaum was·a valuable employee!t well thought 
· of by the, Cammi ttee. I regret the error and am hopeful that 
you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay· 
he has earned. If there is anything further I can pro vi de, 
please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to 
this matter is very much appreciated. 
LS:rwm 
Sincerely yours!t 
LOUIS STOKES 
Chairman
