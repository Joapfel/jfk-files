PERU 
1. At least 181 Peruvians visited Cuba in 1962 
on visits long enough to permit indoctrination, and 
according to an agent who participated, more than 150 
of them were given guerrilla training. Following the 
training, 90 of these were designated by Peruvian 
leftist militant leaders as members of the. "Peruvian 
National Liberation Army." 
2. Over the past two years more than 235 Peruvians_ 
have been identified as travelers to Cuba. Last De­
cember two top Peruvian Communists said that over the 
past year the militant Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left (MIR) had sent 200 to 300 Peruvians to Cuba, in 
groups of 12 to 15, for guerrilla training. 
3. An estimated total of some 5,000 persons have 
taken part in acts of sabotage, terrorism; assaults 
on police outposts, bank robberies, land invasions, 
destruction of haciendas, strike violence, and riots. 
The ruling junta in January launched a majorround-up 
and arrested 729 Communists and leftists, of whom we 
estimate that 50 to 100 may have been trained in Cuba. 
There are still 209 in jail, of whom only one is a known 
Cuban guerrilla trainee. The junta has announced a 
series of mass trials to be held in Lima and provincial 
centers, charging the violence.was part of a Soviet­
Cuban conspiracy to make Peru a Communist state. In 
the course of the violence there have been 18 killed, 
including four police, and 165 wounded. 
4. Out of a total of 137 recorded acts of vio­
lence, 49 were clearly sponsored or controlled by 
Communist elements. Three Cuban nationals and four 
Peruvians trained in Cuba were identified among 
leaders of the striking miners who caused damage 
estimated at $4,000,000 to the Cerro de Pasco smelter 
at La Oroya in December. The Cubans have not been 
· apprehended. 
5. The violence in the Quillabamba-Cuzco-Puno 
area is attributed to the Indian and peasant guerrillas 
of Hugo Blanco. Local officials estimate Blanco's • 
force at 2,000, but this is probably an exaggeration. 
Blanco and his lieutenants are not known to be Cuban­
trained or Cuban-supplied.
