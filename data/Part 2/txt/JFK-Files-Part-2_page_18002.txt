Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen 
Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON· 
---_.,... .. ---· 
I pointed out that there would be no possibility 
of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining 
that our functions and methods of operation are totally 
different and would actually be incompatible in some areas . 
i- noted that our modest request had actually been scaled .... 
down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited. 
each office to a single Agent,with only one Clerk-Stenographer. 
I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which 
had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin 
and stated that we would not have made the request ·if we 
"had no~ felt it full_y jus~ified and r·esponsive to the 
• President's instruction. I said that we would, however, 
car~fully consider each part of th~ request once more to 
. ~ 
see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel 
involved might be reduced. It was agreed that following this 
review, we would meet agairi for fur~her discussion during 
the week o~ November 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations. 
concerning the specific areas follow: 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 
·The Agency for International Development Mission 
here has been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of 
u. s. efforts to influence the Brazilian Police. We have 
been covering this enormous country from our office in 
Argentina on a 2,500 mile round ·trip bas~s. No criticism 
has been made of our, liaison contacts with the.Brazilian 
Police or other agencies, and we feel we should insist on 
reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in
