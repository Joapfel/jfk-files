ATTENTION Mr. Norbert Shepanek 
FROM Edward J. Foy, Jr. 
Chief, Africa/Plans 
SUBJECT Marchetti/Marks Book 
-~ 
1. Mr. Sam Halperin has questioned our request 
that Item 339, page 509 remain classified on the ground 
that references to CIA activities in the Congo in an 
official report of the U.S. Senate declassified the 
referenc~ to the Congo. 
2. The existence of a CIA presence in the Congo 
is reported in an interim report of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975. It 
may be ~rgued therefore that to agre~~to declassifitation 
of ·the reference to the Congo would hav.~ the effect of 
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged 
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse 
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. 
We believe the item should remain classified and that 
exemption S(b)(3) would applr in the case of the Congo.
