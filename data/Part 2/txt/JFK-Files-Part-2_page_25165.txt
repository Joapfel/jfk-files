On August 25, 1963, in a cable from HIL.SMAN to LOIXJE (personal), sent via CIA channels 
(DIR 63891), there appeared the following messar;e: 
"State cable sent separately represents agonizing at hir,;hest levels. Course outlined is 
dangerous but all awee that delaying clear cut US stand ts even more danr;erous. It won't 
be easy for you, but be assured we will back you all the way." (5)

OCCURRENCE: 
In a CIA cable to Saigon (DIB 63855), of August 25, 1963, the following message appeared: 
"FYI CIA not consulted re cable being sent separately, which however cleared at highest 
levels. In circwnstances believe CIA must fully accept directives of policy makers and seek 
ways accomplish ob,jectives they seek. While have not seen exact text, understand it invites 
LODJE final judgment .... Danger in present course of action appears to be throwing away 
bird in hand before we adequately identified birds in bush, or songs they may sing. Thus 
sup:gest a real search for courses of action which might retain options in our hands at same 
time as taking positive stand rather than waiting for situation to clarify (at which point we 
probably unable to affect it.) 'l'his boils down to seeking some middle ground for at least 
interim period. . " ( 7)
