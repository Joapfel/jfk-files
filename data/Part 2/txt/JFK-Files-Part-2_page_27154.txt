Interview with John Stein 
David W. Beiin, 
Executive Director 
178-10004-10396 
I interviewed Mr. Stein in his office at the CIA Headquarters, Langley, 
Virginia on March 18, 1975. The interview commenced at ll;l0·a, m. and 
continued until approximately 1:20 p. m. No one else was present. At 
the outset of the interview, Mr. Stein signed an Advice and Waiver which 
is annexed hereto, 
Mr. Stein, along with several other Deputies, were assigned to an Ad Hoc 
Committee to review various alleged domestic activities of the CIA. 
Stein's particular area was the counter-intelligence staff, except for 
the activities of that staff relating to t-he CI/SO project and to the mail 
intercept project. 
Stein said that, after his review, he concluded that the job of the CI 
staff was essentially to "horse'-' the FBI into doing something. In fact, 
according to Stein, once you eliminate CI/SO and the mail intercept 
project from the CI staff, their activities were benign insofar as the 
scope of this Commission's scope of inquiry was concerned. He said 
that, unless you conclude that keeping records relating to Americans, 
per se, is improper, the CI staff files contained little of interest. 
(a) Action-oriented Matters 
I asked Stein whether he had found any evidence of domestic breaking 
and entering directed by the CI staff. Stein said that he had found no 
such activities, with one possible exception. Stein stated that, if such 
activities seemed appropriate, the CI staff would inform the Bureau
