Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each 
of the cases which are pending prosecution at this time. 
Since the U. S. Attorneys', conference early iµ 
April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these 
cases. Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in 6ne 
case, the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts, 
was permitted to surrender following the return of a true 
bill of indictment. The Micel violation actually occur~ed 
on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities. 
The Assistant U.S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred 
his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges. 
When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the 
case was presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Boston, 
Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960. 
There are also four cases pending in which 
prosecution was authorized prior to April, 1960. 
On May 19, 1960, Donald David Kitch, Portland, 
Oregon, District Manager for Western Oil Company, who, on 
May 12, 1960, made a false report while seeing his boss off 
on a United Air Lines flight in Portland, Oregon, entered 
a plea of guilty in u~ S. District Court. Sentence was not 
imposed pending the completion of a presentence investigation 
and subject was released -0n his own recognizance. This 
conviction brings the total number of co~victions to 17 since 
the effective date of this statute, July 14, 1956. These 
convictions, with the exception of the Kitch conviction, in 
which sentence is not yet imposed, have resulted in 6 years 
actual ~ntences, 10 years probationary sentences and $2,150
