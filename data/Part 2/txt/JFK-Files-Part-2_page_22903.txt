t.he first of August. 
Senator Baker. I agree with you 100 percent. 
The Chairman. This Committee has got to get its business

Senator Hart of Michigan. But what is not clear-cut t.o 
me is how we report to our peers. 
The Chairman. We will take that up. 
Senator Schweiker. We discussed that at one meeting. We 
had a little informal meeting. Maybe you missed that, Phil. 
The Chairmar.. Thsre is nothing that could be gained by 
putting it off or deferinq it or postponing it. It is very 
TOP SECRET·
