7ie feel that the Svt:.tii-east is a very difficult area to work be?ause of our lack of 
contacts. OUr only ·southeastern Chapter rit;ht now is that in Tar,,pa, Florida which 
I originally organiied bef~re comin;:; up to.work in the tlational Office. 
I for one.am convinced of the possibility of such an enterprise but !mow from 
elC!)erience that it is quite a-problem and requires sane sacrifice on the part of 
those inv ,lved. 
You must realize that you will come under tremendous pressures with any a tte:npt 
to do F?CC vrork in that area and that you will not be able to ol?erate in tho r.ianner 
which is c,nventional here in the north-east. Even ~ost of our.big city Chapters have 
been forced to abandon the idea of operatinc an office in public. The national office 
here in llew York is the only 0ne in the- country;today and the l!ew York City Chapter 
uses our office too so it is the only Chapter with an office. l.!ost Chapters rui-,c dis­
covered that it is easier to oi:,eratc semi-privately out of a home arid iraintain a P.O.

3ox for all mailings and public notices. ((A P. o. Box is a must for any Ch.apter in tile 
organization to guarr.atee the continued contact with the national even if an inciivic.uUal 
should move or drop out, )J ',7e do have a serious and often violent opp0sition <,:1d t,ii.s 
, proc,;edure helps prevent many unnecessary incidents which frighten away prospective 
S'-lpporters. I definitely would not recor,unend an office, at least not one that will 
be easily identifyable to the lunatic fringe in your can~unity. Certainly, I would not 
recommend that you engage in one at the very boginning but wait and see how you can 
O!)erate in the commnity throueh several public experiences. 
'.'le will be able. to e:bve you some assistance from here, but not much, It is u;,
