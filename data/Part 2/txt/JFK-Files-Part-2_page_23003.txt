with the Sta. tion a moment ago, I think· we may have created a:•. 
misimpression that the only people involved in CIA operations 
were people who were paid by the Agency. Isn't it also true 
that there were many mr:!11\bers of Cuban exile groups in Florida 
who participated voluntarily from time to time in CIA sponsored 
operations? 
Mr. Halley. I think that you may have to sharpen that up 
for me. I am not sure what you really mean.

Mr. Daron. I am talking now about the paramilitary 
operations. 
Mr. Halley. No. I do not know of any people that were 
involved in paramilitary operations that ware not in some way 
paid. 
Mr. Daron. By the Agtncy? 
Mr. Halley. By the Agency. 
Let me make ~ure that we understand each other, because 
during this period of time there were a lot of independent 
Cuban gro~ps who cl~imed that they had sponsorship from the 
Agency but did not, and were operating, and there was~ period 
in time whtn these groups could not run their operations from 
Florida without runninq the risk of being picked up by Customs, 
Immigration, Coast Guard, the FIJI, or if we had information on 
it, you know, we might pass the information to the Coast r.uard
