under.section 8(b) ofthe CIA Act of 1949. I am informed that when an 
expenditure of this type is recorded on Agency books~ nevertheless. a 
memorandum account -is maintained so that .the ·Agency has a record of the 
precise amount of Governm_ent funds invested in the proprietary. I am. also 
informed that, if a proprietary were to be fully liquidated with the_ proceeds 
scheduled to go to the Reserve, but the funds returned are in excess of the 
inves·tment .• th,e excess would not be placed in the Reserve, but would be 
credited to Mis·cellaneous Receipts. Where· funds are returned to the Agency 
from a proprietary, the current procedure is for the Agency to "reverse" 
the original expenditure entry and, for those funds which are to go into the 
Reserve, the Reserve account on the Agency books is credited, with notifi­
cation to 0MB . • 
8. Let us take a hypothetical situation where 20 years ago the Agency 
expended $1 million to establisq a proprietary. At that time the $1 million 
would have been recorded as expended, certified under the Director's 
authority for purposes contemplated by the appropriation of 20 years ago . . .. 
In the meantime, that '$1 million _would have been spent by the proprietary f · 
for salaries, purchase of equipment, or for other purposes·. The Agency 
either suppi"emented its original expenditure with additional monies or the 
proprietary might have made a profit during these years. This proprietary, 
at Agency d1rection, now liquidates its activities, including the selling of • 
assets. Under the Constitution and the laws cited above, it is my opinion • 
that_ the law requires. all such return of funds to the Agency to be c_overed 
• into the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts.

9. The Agency may not legaHy expend these funds once again ~ithout . I . the approval of the Congress, and oy that I mean the full appropri3.tions 
1-
proCeSS and not merely the approval of 0MB and notification to our two 
appropriations committees. The esJential elem~nt missing in this latter 
procedure is that there has not beeri an appropriation bill approved by the 
Congress as a whole and signed by the_ President. In effect, the Agency 
would have had its appropriation supplemented without the full appropriation 
process.
