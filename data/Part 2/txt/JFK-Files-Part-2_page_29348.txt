to Ms. Goodpasture. 
Mr. Arehart stated that he believed that the summaries would 
have been maintained at the station, probably in a chronological file. 
Mn .. Arehart was questioned extensively about the retention 
and erasure of tapes used in the listening post. Mr. Arehart said that 
the tapes produced at the base would fall into three catagories: 
1) tapes produced by taps on Cuban related phones; 
2) tapes produced by taps,on Soviet related phones; 
3) tapes produced by taps on other phones such as Mexican radicals, poli-
ticians, etc. 
Mr. Arehart said that the tapes produced by the Cuban taps were maintained 
in the listening post. He said that he had a special rack for these 
tapes in his workshop which was on the floor above the room in which 
the listening post was situated. This rack had thirty slots in it. 
The tapes from.each day's production went into a seperate slot,with 
the oldest tapes going back into use in the monitor room, i.e. the tapes 
from the Cuban tapes were held for thirty days before reuse. Mr. Arehart 
said that he routinely got requests for delivery of specific Cuban 
tapes from Ann Goodpasture but that the tapes were not routinely given 
to her unless she asked for them. 
Mr. Arehart said that the Russian tapes were routinely given 
to Ms. Goodpasture so that she could get them to the Russian transcribers. 
He said that not all of these tapes were returned to him. He said that 
he knew this because his supply of tapes for the Russian taps kept 
dwindling. He assumes, while claiming no actual knowledge, that tapes 
were routinely retained by either the Russian translator or someone in 
the Station. He does not know which because he claims to have no.
