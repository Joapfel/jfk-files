will closely follow investigative action to loca-ce

If the subject is reported to have gone to any other 
foreign country, the Washington Field Office should be 
requested to check the records of the Passport Office 
of the State Department for verification. 
When all logical leads have been exhausted in the case 
of a missing important functionary, consideration should 
be given to circularizing all field offices vrith the 
subject's photograph and background information for the 
purpose of alerting the entire field to the identity 
of the subject. Bureau authority must be obtained be­
fore circularization is made. In seeking Bureau author­
ity, advise the Bureau as to the positlon held by the 
subject and what efforts have already been made to locate 
him. 
If this procedure is to be effective, its a.pr:1.ication 
must necessarily be restrictive in the number of subjects 
to which i~ is applied. Therefore, requests to circularize 
must be made only after every possible lead has been 
exhausted and then only in the cases of the roost impor-
tant missing functionaries.
