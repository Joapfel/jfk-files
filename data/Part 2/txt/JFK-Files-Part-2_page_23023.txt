frankly I do not -remember in what forum, and your reference to 
the scuba diving has triggered that response. Nothing about 
exploding sea shells. 
Mr. Baron. You do not recall ev~r hearinq Desmond 
FitzGerald mention that subject or hearinq that Desmond 
FitzGerald was involved in explorinq that possibility, plantinq 
an exploding sea shell? 
Mr. Halley. The exploding sea shell is enough of an off­
beat kind of thing that I think I would have recalled it. I 
10 don't recall it. 
11 I do recall Castro's scuba diving, and that representinq 
12 a vuln~rability and somewhere in the recesses of my memory, 
13 that does strike a bell with me that some exile group, somebody 
14 was talking about Fidel Castro being vulnerable while he was 
15 scuba diving. 
16 Mr. Baron. Did you~ever hear of a plan to present Castro 
17 with a skin-diving suit in which bacteria injurious to his hdalt 
would have been cultured, bacteria that would have pronuced 
tuberculosis and would have produced a dreadful disease?

Mr. Halley. I have never heard of any bact,eria approach 
to the problem of dealing with Fidel Castro. 
I do want to come back to this that I do recall something 
about scuba diving, you know, on th~ range of Fidel being 
vulncrabl~ at the tim~ he was scuha diving, but I do not recall 
exploding sea shells or bacteria.
