G~n. Cabell explained that the Pinar de Rio supply mission h.ad 
not taken place because of the absence of specified communication 
from the DZ, and the Escambray operation had been canceled because 
o! weather. • He said that these missions are still planned, and asswned 
_ that the Group had no objections. The members so signified. 
/s. U-2, Cuba 
Gen. Cabell said that the photographic coverage on t.l-i.e first 
flight had been only about 50%, because of cloud cover. He continued 
that we are analyzing the exact results on a priority basis and that 
some time after the middle of next week we should be in a position to 
make reconunendations for the missions required to extend the coverage. 
Mr. Gray commented somewhat wryly.that this was all right with 
. him since he "would certainly not be available to discuss anything of 
this kind before the middle of next week." The other members appea:::-ed 
to have the same reaction.· 
J6. Policy Consideration Re Cuban Exiles 
Mr. Gray said that Assistant Attor:c.ey General Yeagley had spoken 
to him after his meeting with Col. King and Messrs. Est.er line and 
Holman. He had said that the information given to hin1 by the CLA 
representatives, and the arrangements for future coordination ii 
necessary, were entirely satisfactory to him. He had stated, however, 
that a problem remains with respect to action the FBI should take; 
that is, the FBI needs guidance in its handling of Cuban exile groups 
other than those under the direction of CIA. 
The Group agreed that the best way to attack this problem would 
be to have Mr. Yeagley attend next week's Special Group mee'ting and 
discuss the matter at first hand. Mr. Parrott was asked to make 
. arrangements far.'.'this.
