particular Committee members have concerning the inquiry. We 
need to understan:d the specific objectives the Committee seeks 
and relate these to the priorities of the materials you will need. 
I believe we can be helpful if we know these. Again, I am convinced 
that the constructive long-term contributions that we both envisage 
from the Select Committee's work will derive in a far more concrete 
fashion by focusing on specific and major questions about intelligence 
rather than consuming an inordinate amount of time reviewing the 
details of all of our past history. In that way our main energies 
ani:l our judgment can be addre·ssed to what kind of intelligence we 
w~nt in our free society of the fu~u;r-e'.~ rather than what we may 
have had 'ih the past.. •• • 
Sincerely,
