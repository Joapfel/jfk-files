OCCURREt·lCE: Mecklin stated that the American position following the incident at Hue 
was to "urge Diem to repair all Buddhist grievances forthwith, to accept resbonsibility 
for the May 8 killings, and to inde1ru1ify the victims and apologize, perhaps y visiting 
Hue himself to do so." (Ambassador Nolting was on a Meditterranean vaction at the time.) 
"According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from 
Washington, 'direct,relentless, fablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States 
had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government.._.' In despair Trueheart 
in JW1e resorted to a fonnal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures 
(police effort. to pre~ent ':111d dispers~ illegal demons t~a tions) , ~1\~,~1;-"f1{ed. States would 
be forced to dis~ssooate itself publicly from such acti~ns ,~W~E:v,hl~~d;i~~~ did two months
