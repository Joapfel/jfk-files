Testimony of _3un<ly 
Bundy testified that the contingency referred to in USA~I IOU and the related 
documents was "what would we <lp if Castro were no longer there", but that 
"clearly one of the possibilities woul<l be assassination". (r.uncly, p. 77.) 
However, Bundy emphasized that NS/\:1 100 represented an effort to assess the 
effect should Castro he removed from power by any means (inclurlinr; assassina-
tion) but "without going further with the notion (of assassination) itself".;, 
(Bundy, p. 77 .. ) 
:'<"If people were sugzesting this to you and you were curious about whether it 
was worth exploring, one way of getting more light on it without going any fur­
ther. with that notion itself would be to ask political people, not intelligence 
people, what they thought wouid happen if Castro were not there any longer. 11
