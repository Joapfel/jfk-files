various Presidents and Attori1ey·s~Ge11ei·a1·import::mt-intelligence matters 
on ari"Tiidivlclual basis:-The-·Intelligence Letter served to consolidate this ...---•--··· " 
information into one document. By August, 1970, changes in our commun-
ications capability, including the ability to aiford immediate teletype 
dissemination of intelligence data to The \Vhite House and the development 
of other reporting procedures such as the Summary of Extremist Activities, 
made the Intelligence Letter no longer necessary. Items sub1nitted for this 
Letter by the field were disseminated in these other ways. In :Pecember, 
1972, the use of the code word "INLET!! was discontinued and field offices 
so advised. The field was also advised, however, they had the responsi-
bHii:y to b~ alert for this type intelligence data. • 
ACTION:
