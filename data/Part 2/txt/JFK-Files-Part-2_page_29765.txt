says that Go~it~±n was given a settlement of approximately 
$200,000.00 and provided with Donald as an A.A. and guards. 
Gqlitsin was first given the name "John Stone." His wife 
was called "Irene" and his daughter "Kitty." The CIA 
had told him that he could write a book. 
It was Donald's feeling that G?litsin· was a very 
intelligent defector. His knowledge of leaks from Western 
Intelligence sources was phenomenal. He turned up traitors 
in many Western countries, including but not limited to: 
Wennerstrom in Sweden; two West German 9enerals, and Willy 
Brandt's secretary; a high-level F~erich leak in NATO (Cf., 
DeVosjoli information) and gave the CIA information which 
led to the unmasking of "Kim" Philby, then the number two 
man in British Intelligence, as a Soviet agent. Donald said 
that Golitsin had been stationed in Vienna in 1954 and then 
brought back to the Soviet and placed in the section of So­
viet (KGB) Intelligence which dealt with America and the 
Western countries. In this capacity he was able to read 
the material which these traitors had been sending to the 
Soviet side. He had an incredible memory.and had been plan­
ning to "come over" to our side for some time so he prepped 
himself on things which would be to our interest to know. 
He defected in 1961 in Helsinki. Howard Osborne went over 
to Helsinki to bring him back to the United States. One of
