Mr. Schwarz. You said that Nosenko, one of the reasons 
you suspected Nosenko was a double agent, or a planted agent, 
rather, was because he was saying things that were contra­
dictory to some other high quality person who theretofore had 
been giving you information before Nosenko came-to this 
country? 
Mr. Anileton. That is right. 
Mr. Schwarz. What was the nature of the information 
relating to the Kennedy assassination that the high quality 
person had given you? 
Mr. Schwarz. Let me say this so that it makes a little 
more sense. 
In December 1961 a member of the KGB in Helsinki defected 
r. '· , , :-y,; 
to us. !!is name is Golitzen. He has never been in service, 
except Jack Anderson came out with an erroneous account of it, 
alleging that he had stated there was a plot to assassinate 
Nixon. He did not make such a statement. 
Mr. Kirbow. Do you think this statement should be on 
the record? 
Mr. Angleton . I don't mind it being on the record after 
the Anderson article. They have been looking for him. 
Now, his is prohably without any question the most major 
defection since World War II as far as Soviet intentions, 
Soviet organization, and Soviet operations are concerned. 
And the reason, arnong others, that it was so important was 
TOP SECRET
