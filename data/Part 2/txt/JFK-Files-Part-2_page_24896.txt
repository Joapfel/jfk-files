The chain of events revealed by the documents and 
testimony is strong enough to permit a reasonable inference 
that the assassination plot was authorized by the President. 
It is absolutely clear that Allen Dulles authorized the plot. 
The juxtaposition of discussions concerning "disposing of" 
Lumumba and taking "straightforward action" against him at NSC 
and Special Group meetings with Dulles' cable to the Congo, 
Bissell' s representat_ion to Gottlieb ·about "highest a·uthority", 
and the delivery of poison to the Congo can be read to support 
an inference that the President and the Special Group urged 
the assassination of Lumumba. 
Robert Johnson's testimony that he understood the President 
to have ordered Lumumba's assassination at an NSC meeting does, 
as hesaid, offer a "clue" about Presidential authorization 
which, however, should be read in light of the uncertain record 
of the meetings Johnson attended and the contrary testimony of 
others in attendance at the meetings, including the President's 
national security advisors. The fact that both the Chief of 
Station and Gottlieb were under the impression that there was 
Fr for the assassination of Lumumba 
is not in itself direct evidence of such authorization because
