• 4. During the period from 26 April to is May all the 
technical equipment from the Agency ._to the FBI \~as delivered, 
installed and tested. Everything seemed to be w_orkir.g. • No Agency 
personnel were involved- in any w-?-y with actual installation of 
equipment in Identity 6_1 Fr.om May to February Agency tech-
nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair woi:k on occasions 
of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion did 
they ente!-' Id~ntity 61. 
5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 ; be 
stopped on 3 February 1972 after 'FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover 
advised that- he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and 
might have to advise them that the installatior. in Identity 61 • 
was initiated at CIA I s request. The operation and equipment~ to the 
best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 Dec ember 1972 
when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The 
request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76 
delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on 
nationaliz·ation of foreign holdings, While the FBI was still 
in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of 
State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible 
coverage of Identity 61 and on 22 December 1972 coverage 
was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December 
1972. 
6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed· against 
the risks involv~d, led the Agency to conclude that the activity \Vas 
not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 CIA requested the .YBI 
to discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised 
that microphone surveillance of lden 61 was disc ontinuecl.
