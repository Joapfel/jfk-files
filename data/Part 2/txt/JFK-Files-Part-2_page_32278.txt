SUBJECT: 
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs 
United-States Policy Toward Cuba 
United States Policy 
On November 20, the President set forth the broad guide­
lines of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the 
following words: 
"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are 
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in 
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards, 
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive 
connnunist purposes, there will be peace in the 
Caribbean. And, as I said in September, 'we shall 
neither initiate nor permit aggression in this 
hemisphere. 1 
11We will not, of course, abandon the political, 
economic and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt 
subversion from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that 
the Cuban people shall some day be truly free. ·But 
these policies are very different from any intent to 
launch a military invasion of the island.H
