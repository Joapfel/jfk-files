SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
22 November 1963; 
December 1963. 5 
many others are dated 23 November 1963 through 
9. (S) This is one of the most-complex requests because of 
the following facts: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
at one time, there was a tape of Oswald in existence but it has 
since been lost or erased; 
the relevance of these tapes is argued even though they do not 
contain the Oswald conversation; 6 _ 
j ·. 
t:tlis was not an unilatera-1 oper~~,tion but rather a joint op~rat~ 
~1th the Mexican Government;/~ • 
there is a confidential request from the ARRB(to the Mexican J 
~GovernrnenVfor any (Copies of t~>oswald conversation they 
may possess; and, 
quite obviously, the sensitivity is not so much the mere fact that 
we possess such tapes but our release of the extent and actual 
conversations captured. 
10. (S) • The good news, at least at this time, is that the 
ARRB staff has agreed to postpone Board consideration until May 
and, in the interim, the Agency will have an opportunity to 
review (i.e., listen and transcribe) and determine the 
sensitivity and provide detailed arguments in this regard. 
ISSUE 5 -- Protection of ~!TAMIL~ 
5 (S) The scope of this request is quite significant; it includes five boxes 
of 185 tapes from operations against both the Cuban and Russian Embassy. 
6 (S) The ARRB staff position on the relevance of the tapes has three forms: 
There could be conversations about Oswald and/or the assassination on the 
22 Nov+ tapes which could give clues to Oswald's visit to Mexico City on 
25 September - 3 October. The absence of any conversation about Oswald or the 
assassination would itself be of historical int~iest. Or, there are 
transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations that mention the 
assassination in the collection and, thus, by definition, the tapes are 
assassination r~\cords.
