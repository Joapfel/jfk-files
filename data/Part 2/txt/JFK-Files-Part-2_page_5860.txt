MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
1. Pursuant to ARRB- ~Resquet No. CIA-16,the Office of 
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre­
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following 
responses are provided to those questions which pertain to 
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are 
the best reasonable answers based on available information. 
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to 
1 October 1994. 
Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as 
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time 
of the assassination of President Kennedy. 
Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office 
of Security (OS) held two files which contained information 
on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled "Defectors File" 
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and 
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee 
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in 
the automated security database known as the Management Data 
Program/Personnel Security (MOP/PS). These files were 
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the 
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted 
of microfiche records-which were superseded by the automated 
system. This hand search produced the same results as the 
automated search of MDP/PS. 
-
2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an 
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official 
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file), 
#00,90079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of 
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along 
with numerous soft files. Since _this material has been 
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files 
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search 
of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any 
of these files. Attached is all of the available 
information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL 
files. This information was retrieved from the Information 
Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review 
of general office administrative files.
