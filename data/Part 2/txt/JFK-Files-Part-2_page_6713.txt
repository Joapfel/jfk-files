Priority Requests from ARRB Staff 
5 December 1996 
1. The ARRB Staff is planning to interview Russ Holmes about his JFK. Ancillary (working) Files. Dave Marwell has requested that 
Holmes be given on one day clearance so that he can look to the files. How do you want to handle? • 
2. Has David Vance Vanek (SSN~H571) ever worked for the Agency (0017 Vanek is an army officer who served in 
Thailand and Vietnam; could have been detailed to Agency. He figures in one of the conspiracy theories that the ARRB staff is currently 
taking depositions on. Can DO check or is this an OP issue --we have not had a lot of luck with OP. Initially the ARRB staff was going 
to make this a formal request, but agreed to hold off for the moment. The theory involves counter-terrorism training and the death of an 
American with knowledge of JFK assassination. 
3. Agency Officers in Moscow: The ARRB staff is researching Oswald's contacts in Moscow. The records shows that he came into 
contact with other Americans besides Snyder (the Consular Officer). Gunn requested a list of the CIA officers in Moscow a few weeks 
ago. Based on discussions with Ellie, etc., I told him a list did not exist and would be considered very sensitive if we did prepare one. I 
ask him to be more specific; if he had names, we would check against Agency records. Since then his staff has located a list of senior 
officers in Moscow prepared for the HSCA (Eileen has copy). He has now resurrected his requests. Let discuss the next step. 
4. Did Mrs. G. Stanley Brown (Verna Deane Stebbens Brown, born 12 August 19281 work for the Agency; what was her status 
when she was in Moscow as Embassy receptionistlsecretary7 She is the wife of George Stanley Brown. an Agency employee from 
1952-1962. According to the ARRB staff, she had contact with Oswald (see item #3). 
I will give you a call on Friday to discuss our responses fo the above request..
