Instruct ea.ch interested Bureau office which has ma.de further dis­
semination of such information to follow the instructions set forth 
above., 
107S 
Also set up a. control file regarding this corrective action, and upon 
comole·f;ion of same submit to the Bureau a final letter under the in­
for~ant rs caption identifying each case by title, character, _Bureau file, 
where known, and date of communication. 
This letter will be used to check all pertinent Bureau files to see 
that necessary corrective action has been taken in each inst.a.nee. 
If necessary, other field offices.which have received information from 
the informant should also be requested to submit summary letters s·how­
ing what corrections have been ma.de., 
It is imperative that all information from the in~ormant be correctly 
labeled and great care must be ta.ken to see that this is done. , 
Occasionally, an ex-informant through his speech, writings, or actions 
raises a doubt as to his relia.bility"subsequent to the time he was an 
informant. It is not necessary to go back and change the evaluation of 
the information attributed to that individual in the absence of a 
definite indication that the informant furnished unreliable information 
to the Bureau while he was an informant, 
14. Dissemination of information from sources of questionable reliability 
and known unreliability should be made in accordance with pa.rt II, 
section 5, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.
