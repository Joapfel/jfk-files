I would like to say· s0mething a.b_e;ut the_ JY:~0blem of 0ur Party'. s 
~ tyle of W9rk .. 
. Why must there be a revolutionary 1~arty? There must be a rev:.-:­
·_utionary party because the w0rld contains~~n0mi8S whry oppress the 
/::ople nnd the peopla w-~.nt to thr-~v, off enemy oppression. ~~In the 
:r·a c,f capitalism anti imrerin.lism,. just:_ such a revolutionary party 
:s the Communist Party is needed. Withbut such a party it• is si~ply • 
~mp~ssi~lc f~r the p~0ple to throw nff enemy oppr0ssion. W~ ar~ 
'c~munists, wo want to lead the people .in overthrowing the ene3Yi ~nd 
30 we must keep our ranks in good order, we must march in.ste~, _Olir 
.:.:coops must be picked troops and our weapons gt1od weapons. , ..• ·-
r'i th0ut these conditions· the enemy cannot be. ove:cthrr.,wn. 
. What is the problem now facing· our P~rty? The g(~ncra: ~ inc of X;: 
.• the Part~ is correct and presents no problem, and the Party! s 
Work has been fruitful. The Party has several hundred thousand 
· m:r:,mbers who are leading the people ·in. extremely h~rd and bitter -
• • str 1.1ggles against the cne:11y. • • This is plain to . everybody and 
be:yond all doubt, •. · · · . •· . · . · -.•. ·. 
• Then is ther~ or.is there not any problem still £acing' our 
Party? I say there is and, in a certnin ~ense, the problem is 
• quite serious, .. . . .. . . 
g~What is the prnblem? It is the fact that "there is some- .. 
thing in the minds ~f g number of our C(mra~es which strikes 0nc-
as not quite right, not q~ite pr0per.. . • • 
In other·words, there is Etill something wrong with our style 
of stu~iy, with our ~tyle in. the Party's internal ~.nd external· __ 
~elations and with our style of writing. By something wrong with 
the style of study we mean the ~nl~dy cf subjectivism. By some-· 
·thing wrong with ~ur atyle in Party relations·we mean the malndy 
of sectarianis~, By s0mething 0rong with the style of writing_ 
we~ mean the r~8.lady of stereotyped Party· writing. All these :ir~ 
wr3ng 1 • they are ill winds, but they are_ not like the wintry n0rth 
winds that oweep across the whole sky, Subjectivis~ 1 sectarianism 
and stereotyped Party writing are no long~r the d~~inant £tyles,. - • ! 
but ~erely gustG of contrary wind, ill winds fro~ th~ rrir-raid 
tunnels, It is bad, however, th~t subh winds should still be· 
blowing in· the P2.rty o We must se2.l cff :the passages whic~1 p~G - .. 
duce them. Our whole P~rty should undertake the job of sealing· .. • 
• off these passages, and so should the Party School~ These ~hre~ 
ill winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and ,stereo---typ(;d P.:l..rty 
writing, have their historical C;rigins. -.·_Although no longer. 
• dominant in the _whJle Party, they· still constantly create trrJuble 
.. 2.nd assail us., Theref~re,. it is nece~-3sary to resist· them and to 
study, anR.lyse, f:lnd elucidate them, · • .. . .. - . . . . • 
·-Fight _subjectivism in order t~ rectify the style of study,, 
fight .sectarianism in order to rectify the style· in Pn.rty rel;:,_-
