and to make recommendations to the President and the director of the CIA. See 
id. at x. The Commission was to issue its final report within three months and 
to terminate one month after presenting its report. See Exec. Order No. 11,828,

surveillance of mail between the United States and the Soviet Union was illegal, 
(2) the declared mission of Operation CHAOS to determine_foreign influence on 
domestic dissidence was proper, but some activities exceeded the CIA's

The most powerful of the post-Warren Commission inquiries was that made by 
the House Seledt Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which in 1976 reopened the 
investigation that bad been seemingly_ closed a dozen years earlier. n79 The 
Committee, chaired by congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, explored several 
controversial areas of John F. Kennedy's assassination, along with those of his 
brother, Rob- [*14] ert, and Reverend King. n80_Tbe ~CA suffered from its 
own limitations, which are beyond the scope of thisArticle._n8l. However, the 
HSCA's conclusions, which now seem to be in question, held that the Committee 
could not rule out a conspiracy to kill the President. n82 This finding directly 
challenged the warren Commission .. n83 For example, th~ HSCA believed that 
advanced acoustical techniques demol1Strated that there had been more than one 
shooter in Dealey Plaza~ n84 That analysis was subsequently.repudiated, n85 but 
it was too late to counter the damage done to the Warren Commission's 
credibility.
