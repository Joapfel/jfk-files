WASHINGTON 25, D. C. 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ,~ 
JAN 2 9 1962 
From: Brig. Gen. Lansdale 2cl 
~.<o• 
Noting that you will be away from the country most of the 
month of February, there are some matters vital to our Project 
for which we should provide, Certain proposals should have 
evidence of your support. Some strong decisions may have to 
be made if our Project is to Vlin its goal -- and the bureaucratic 
machine has too many people captive to it, one way or another. 
It is my hope that you will make someone specifically 
responsible to speak for your determined course and have the 
role of being .your "presence" as far as possible. This demands 
a personal conviction, freedom from bureaucratic instincts, and 
reasonably direct access to the President, Perhaps Dick Good­
win could fulfill this role. Secretary McNamara is an alternate 
suggestion; he has so many irons in the fire that I hesitated men­
tioning him. You might be considering General Taylor, but I do 
not believe he can quite play this role; he is still too much a fine 
military bureaucrat at heart. 
As you know, I remain convinced that our goal can be won, 
Perhaps, if we can keep forcing U.S. agencies to work hard at 
it, the goal can be won through their efforts. Yet, their efforts 
haven't been impressive to date, and I still feel that we m.ight 
uncork the !ouchdown play independently of the ins'titutional pro­
gram we are spurring. 
It may be a special effort which professional labor operators 
can launch to stir up workers in Latin America and Cuba, It may 
be through ethnic-language groups; has an untapped action 
potential. It could be a warming-up t e always lively youth 
element in Latin America and Cuba, through some contacts specially 
used. It could be with the families through the Church, with families
