2 The rejedtion of Oswald's offer to defe2t makes absolutely

4 Mr. Sav.ryer has· just pursU'ed that momentarily. I think tha

to eight large files~ you only re~d the first poriion of one 
'file. You said no KGB ~ver ·talked to Oswald regarding 
letting him defect. The reason you gave us for that was that h 
slashed his wris:ts and you concluded he was unstable. Yet prior: 
to that discovery of his instability, you granted him a visa 
in two days and he asked to be permitted to defect prior to 
slashing his wrists, and therefore you had to make the decision 
prior to slashing his writs, prior to knowing that he slashed 
his wrist, that you were going to rejec~ him. That doesn't 
hold•:.water either. 
Finall~ you said in your testimony American defection was 
very rare. All the more reason, if it only happens once every 
year or a couple of times a year, or three times between '56 
and '59, it is totally incredible to me that he would not have 
~~ 1 been interrogated. No reasonable person can believe that story ,...., ii
