d. As one example Raneiri 
Mazzilli, President of the Chamber 
of Deputies and next in line for the 
presidency, __ told Ambassador Gordon 
on Saturday that he profoundly mis­
trusts Goulart's intentions and in­
tends to maintain the strictest con­
gressional vigilance. 
e. Our statio~ in Brazil be­
lieves that Goulart is living in a 
dream world. He seems either out 
of touch with reality or very poorly 
informed.· Public. opinion is not 
with him and the tradition that po­
litical power should only be trans­
ferred constitutionally is very 
strong in the army, coup report.s 
notwithstanding. 
f. The biggest danger from 
this quarter is that the opposition 
may resort to some illegal act,giv­
ing Goulart the excuse to take over.
