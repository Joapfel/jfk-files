(Memo from Achilles to Bmvles, 5/24/61) 
A May 26, 1961·, memorand11111 from Bowles to Bundy begins: 
'1 Following up on our discussion of the Dominican 
Reµublic at yesterday's meeting of the Special 
Group, I am forwarding you a draft telegram which 
we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our Consul 
General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementin0 the 
guidance he will be receiving on the recently 
approved contingency plans." 
qinutes of the Special Group meeting on May 25, 1961 do not, 
however, reflect any discussion of the Dominican Republic. 
If, as Bowles' memorandum suggests, a discussion concerning 
the Dominican Republic did occur at the May 25 meeting, it is 
not known what the discussion involved or what decisions, 
if any, wete made. 
Richard Goodwin personally prepared alternate drafts to 
the !)roposed State Department cable to Dearborn. Goodwin testi-
fied that it was his intent in revising the cable to communicate 
to Dearbo!,n, President Kennedy's personal belief that the United 
States:. 
" . didn't want to do anything that·would 
involve us further, the United States further, 
in any effort to assassinate Trujillo·."
