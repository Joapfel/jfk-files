a. First, note again that the three elements are 
joined by an "AND" meaning all elements must be met to 
satisfy a postponement. 
b. Second, the first requirement of living or 
2 
traveling outside of the U.S. is not tied to "cover." Many 
officers who do not work under cover all of the time are, in 
fact, provided cover for overseas TDY's. Thus, any officer 
who might "reasonably" be expected to travel outside of the 
U.S. would warrant postponement of his/her true name. This 
would seem to include every CIA employee, contract employee 
and independent contractor, past and present. 
c. With respect to the third element, Mr. Gunn and the 
Board appear to be in error. To my knowledge, they have no 
authority to require that an individual be consulted 
concerning his or her wishes to maintain cover, thus having 
his or her true name postponed, or to give up cover, thus 
having the name released. This decision does not lie in the 
first instance with the individual but is an institutional 
decision which lies solely within the purview of the Agency 
and the executive branch of the government. CIA as an 
executive agency charged with the creation, maintenance, and 
dissolution of cover mechanisms is the only entity competent 
to make such a decision. It alone knows if release of an 
officer's true name will compromise an existing cover 
mechanism which will, in turn, expose others who share or 
have shared the same cover. It alone knows if release of an 
officer's name will expose CIA sponsorship (a cover entity)
