This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the 
question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the 
Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated 
meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduled 
for the week of 7/14/75. 
By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Fran~ Church and 
John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the 
Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session 
during the week of 7/14/75. The purpose of this meeting is to 
discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which 
might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documents 
essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division i';J) 
preparing for the Director's use copies of each of the writt~ 
requests received from SSC annotated with the dates of our 
response to each request; the date it was delivered to the 
Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff. 
There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated 
by three recent written requests of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received 
by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on 
7/8/75); and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). All three 
of these requests appear, in part·, to disregard the privacy of 
certain individuals or requests the identity of sources ~,, •i·
