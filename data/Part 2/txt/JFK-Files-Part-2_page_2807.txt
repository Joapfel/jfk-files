SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS KENT 
operational experience. His ingenuity, originality and flare 
are balanced by sound common sense and enriched by his sense of 
humor and personal modesty. Mr. Kent was personally responsible 
for the creation and implementation of two important Division 
programs - one in the political action field and the other in 
the propaganda field, which were designed to influence foreign } 
attitudes toward the Allende Government and to dissuade foreign (. 
governments from providing economic assistance to Chile. These 
programs were highly successful, and since the same techniques 
can be applied in support of the new Chilean military government, 
the programs are being retained and hopefully will continue to 
produce results which make an important contribution to the 
achievement of U.S. policy objectives. 
Mr. Xent continued to supervise the SA Section in the same 
highly effective manner noted in previous efficiency reports. 
He also continued to meet and handle several key Chileans, 
including a top civilian adviser to the new Chilean government. 
He put in long hours, working eleven or twelve hours a day during 
crisis periods. 
Mr. Kent's transfer to the economic section of WH Division 
will enable him to make fuller use of his talents in the 
specialized and important field of economic intelligence, in 
which he has a particular interest. It is, however, a severe 
loss to the Branch, ~hich has benefited immeasurably from his 
imaginative yet level-headed approach to operational problems 
and challenges. He is much liked as well as respected by 
Branch 6 personnel and has contributed greatly toward main­
taining the high morale and effectiveness of the Branch as 
a whole.
