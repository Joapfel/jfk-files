No. 1. The very f;nmll, bome-m~de· grenode is exnctly 
the~ame n the srnn.11 explo!3tve device used ~o -s.ct off 
the fire bomb. • r ""

It is the CO2 e~~tiidge as described in the . 
preceeding directions, only- instend of using n ·cigarette •:. • 
to tTme the fuse, you cnn light tho fuse nnd throw it. 
This little CO2 cartridge just as it iR doesn't .do a 
lot of dn~nge, but it cnn be dressed up to become n very 
lethal weapon. It.can be made·into a deadly anti­
personnel. weapon or a ~ory dangerous bomb. 
The saall CO2 cartridge can be dressed up by ff-fling 
. with 3/4 • blac!{ pc"::dc:- . ~nd 3/-'1 shot, or needles. This is· 
obvioulsy anti-per~onnel and will, penetrate -when the CQ2. -·• 
. explo.~tes, but still is not. big -enough to kill. It has 
certi~n ndvantages, howe~er. It can be taped to a ~indpw~ 
. even.,.. with your hands behind' your back, -snnd left burning .,.... .. ... . .. , ... -.... ,. ' . . . '' ' .. ' ~1th the·trusty ~igare~te~ - Or it could b&·~ped, ~ith 
>th.~- ~~e?!"e.tt·e t 0 -~--~h~ fuel :tnn.l{ 0f- ~ ~~!';; If th-rown into 
• • · a ·_car , it is• guaranteed· to-. bruise the occupants and _ . 
. empty _.the car of nll ,person:,;lel in record· tirne. Further, 
·the CO2 is so small _it c~n~ensily be concealed on pour 
person. .. 
-Now, to·_ make an actual gre·nade, a weapon that kills, the 
.. fol·Iowing can be done: 
Take. a used, empty lerosol can, pu11·off the 
little plastic sprny device, nnd with a hnmmer a.nd nail•· 
pound-th{? little plastic nipple down into the can. Use 
a punch or scr~wdriver with hammer to widen t~e hole and 
make it large enough so"th~t large shot cnn be inserted 
through the hole. Then· fil.,1.~, .with 3/4 black powder and· . 
. i/4 ~ullets or smt\ll-headed·nails. !nf=;crt fuse, and. 
lighi when ready to throw. The· fuse should be an inch and.: 
~ half in length and should leave your hand when it 4 has 
burned to an inch.• 
CAUTION: Tho explos,fve force of this wenpon is grent. _ 
It is even morednngerous·thnn n stnndnrd nrmy grenade. 
Needless to say, a too-short fuse will result in a. . 
~cnttered grenadc~holder. A too-lo~g- fuso will result 
in the person or persons.nt whom you hnve thrown it to 
have a ch3nce to throw it back and blo·w you _to frngments. > 
A guerilla with lowsi aim in·close qunrters cnn"kill as. 
brothers. This thing is•: equivalent to about 12. shotgun . ••
