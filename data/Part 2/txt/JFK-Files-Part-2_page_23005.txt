think they could do it. We think they should ba guided to run 
only twenty, fifteen, something like that. So they were not 
totally dependent on me. 
Mr. Daron. l'lhat was the nature of the split of responsi­
bility between Task Force W and JMWlWE Station? 
In other words, were there certain operations that were 
run directly out of Task Force W? 
Mr. Halley. Also, you have to put this into a historical 
time. What period are you talking about.? 
Mr. Daron. During th~ period of your tenure. If there 
were changes during your tenure at JMWAVE, why do you not 
explain those? 
Mr. !!alley. There were. Each one is different. Let me 
give you a couple of examples. 
Washington, Task Force W, essentially did not run~:~ 
ny_paramilitary operations where they took command and control 
for sending people to Cuba. For instance, if Task Force Win 
Washington wanted to •plant a_.radio in Cuba which was to'.be pick d 
up by foreign intelligence agents who coulrl report, they would 
·task us to implant that radio in a cache in a particular area 
in Cuba, for'.instance; Oriente province. We would know simply 
that it was a radio ·perhaps·.• lfo would then put it into 
Oriente province, write up the site, give them the rip cord. 
They would communicat~ to t.ht: agents· in ·cuba who· would' go 
recover the cache.
