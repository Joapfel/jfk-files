Funding for the proprietary is accomplished through a cut-out 
mechanism whereby the Agency sends U. S. Treasury checks to ten 
contractors. The proprietary then bills the contractors for 
"services rendered" in the same amount as received by the contractor 
via Treasury check. Funding· for the other corporations was done 
through use of notional firms. The ISOTROPIC guard force contract 
was handled by intra-Agency transfer of funds. BNDD reimbursed the 
Agency for all TWOFOLD expenses, except for salary of the one staff 
agent. DOD reimbursed the Agency for all ZULU expenses.
