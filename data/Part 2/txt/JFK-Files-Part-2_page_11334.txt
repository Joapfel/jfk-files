(10) Dissemination at the Bureau 
There are some situations in which dissemination is made at the 
Bureau instead of in the field. In the majority of instances, 
informat~on received by the FBI should properly be furnished 
irmnediately to some other agency within the executive branch of 
the Government so that the respt•nsibilitics of the other agency 
might be fulfilled properly. Ca.re must be taken, however, not 
to disseminate informu.tion to any field branch of another 
Go.vernment agency where such a procedure is deemed inadvisable 
because of the inadequ?,cy of security measures in .that branch. 
In these instances the data should be brought to the immediate 
attention of the Bureau for dissemination at the SOG. An 
example of the latter is, of course, the Atomic Energy Cc,mrnission, 
which ~eceiv~s reports only through the Bureau, as noted Jn 
·· section 87D 7c[{3))of this manual. Information relatin;": •::, '•\. 't . . ': foreign travel plans of security subjects -is dissemin~k 
to interes.ted a.gen_cies, including the St2.te Department, ,,isly 
at the SOG, as set out in 87D 6b (4). Dissemination is also 
ma.de at the SOG to the Sta~e Department, unless it appears 
undesirable, in those cases in which subjects have been 
indicted for violations grounded on subversive activities. 
Dissemination in these cases is m2.de to preclude these subjects 
from util~z~ng the fact they obtained a passport to ~efute 
a.llega.tions o·f subversive connections. The State Departt• ~nt, 
therefore, will be in po~session of data concerning a. dcfundant 
should he attempt to utilize this tactic in such a.n action. 
b. Data developed concerning individuals who are not within the Bureau's 
investigative jurisdiction 
(1) Members of the armed forces 
The Delimitations :A.g:reement between the FBI and the a:rmed forces 
intelligence.a.genci·es states that the responsibility assumed by 
one organization in a given field carries with it th·e obligation 
to exchange freely and directly with other subscribin~ ori;;aniza.tions 
a.11 information of mut~al interest.
