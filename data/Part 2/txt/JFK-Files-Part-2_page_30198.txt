The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located 
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381 
of tlte Committee Offices. 
About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon 
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with 
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095 
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photo~ were loose~on-t9p of 
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the 
books were numbered 39El, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages 
consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane 
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure 
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane 
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen 
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy 
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was 
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check 
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing 
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out 
since September of 1977 according to the check out log. 
Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the 
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978 
if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They 
both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently. 
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked, 
but shut. 
Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request 
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the 
Metropolitan Police Identification section responded to Room 
3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Pvt. 
Pat McGinnis, Sgt Blake and Detective Pvt McGinnis was 
able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior 
of the safe, ~nd from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was 
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday 
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross 
or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times 
during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned 
over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession. 
The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June 
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the 
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA. 
On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by 
Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert 
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471 
in Room 3381 of Committee Office. 
On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to 
the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.
