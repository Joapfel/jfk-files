Mr. Schwarz. Is that the form in which you sent the 
message which is contained in Exhibit 3 to Chile? 
Mr. Phillips. It is. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, apparently Exhibit 4, which you 
drafted initially, said that it was from General Bennett, and 
then it was changed to say it was from General Philpott. 
Did you make that change? 
Mr. Phillips. That is my handwriting above that said 
Philpott, and someone else's handwriting below that said 
Bennett. I think the signature on the original document 
was from Philpott. But that is my change there. 
Mr. Schwarz. And is the change on the second page --
the sentence reads: 
"Do not allow 
message", and then in handwriting it is asserted "Note that 
General Bennett is out of the country". 
Mr. Phillips. Yes, that is my handwriting. 
Mr. Schwarz. Having seen that, and these changes, what 
do you recall about the circumstances that led you to make 
those changes? 
Mr. Phillips. It'is possible that this message is one 
of the rare messages that sometimes occur, that you are h~nded 
something that is written out, and there is no secretary, 
and it is two o'clock in the morning or something like that. 
On some occasions you will take a very rough draft and ask
