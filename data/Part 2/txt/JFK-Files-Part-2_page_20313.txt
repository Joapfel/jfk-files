November 27, 1967 
TO ALL AMERXCAN WOMEN: 
I aru pro~d of the fact that my first vote cast in Congre?~ / 
was a vote against the war. It was the first oppo~tunity 
£or a woman to vote, becaus~ I was the first woman to be 
elected to Congress. 
l believed then, as~ do today, that women are the ones that 
must be concerned with the needs and development of the 
human race. I have always fought £or the.dignity. of all 
human beings - for those of the present as well as those 
of future generations. 
I will continue to struggle as lci-ng as I live. I hope all 
women will respond ~o the following call and join·me in 
Washington on January 15, 1968, the opening day of Congress. 
. . 
With highest hopes, 
JEANNETTE RANKIN
