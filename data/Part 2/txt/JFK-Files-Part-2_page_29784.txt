MEXICO CITY -- CIA 
Personnel: 
From.~ther sources, namely, through information garnered 
by our own investigation, we are also aware of others 
involved with CIA Me~ico City Station.in 1963. 
Mr. and Mrs. Boris Tarasoff: 
As one of the CIA's husband-and-wife teams, the 
Tarasoff'-~, had the job of translating arid transcribing 
conversations in the Russian language going in 
and out of the Soviet Emba~sy by telephone. 
They were experts in voice identification using such 
aids as newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous 
informations about different individuals to help 
determine geographic origins, etc. about persons 
whose conversations were being tapped. 
The Tarasoffs were directly involed in the translation 
and transcription of the Oswald conversation, although 
the specifics have become dim in Mr. Tarasoff's 
memory. 
Tarasoff succeeded George Misko. 
Tarasoff was never questioned by any investigative 
agency about the OswaLd conV~~sations. 
Boris Tarasoff thought the conversation was .most 
likely between Kanstaninov and Oswald and did not 
involve Kostikov or Yatskov. Tarasoff knew no one 
by the.name of Kostin. 
Tarasoff presently resides in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
William Bright: 
Identified by Tarasoff as CIA "contact" between 
the station and the translators. ·It is not clear 
whether Tarasoff was in the station or in a separate 
intercepting unit, but it appears that he was 
p~obably outside the station. 
Bright seemed especially interested when the second 
call between Oswald and the Soviet Embassy was 
intercepted and Oswald identified. 
Robert Zambernardi: 
Identified by Tarasoff as the photographic expert 
at the Mexico City station.at .. least from September 
1963 to November 1963.
