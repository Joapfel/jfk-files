We have recognized ·delicacy of developing sources within;'}~/-;·· 
establ~·shments of ost~nsi~ly fri~n~ly countrie~ and i7! view of ·----t}f 0 
• close znterrelationship with quest1.ons of forezgn policy we have 
in past regularly consulted B~reau of Security and Consular Affairs 
_in State Department to be cert~in we were not running into risky 
foreign policy situation whereby, if State not consulted, State could 
later say our activities had posed serious problems. To insure our 
efforts did not run afoul of for_ei.gn policy considerations we adopted 
"]-step" procedure: (1) we had liaison check with State orally when 
we selected particular country as logical target; (2) if State agreed. 
on target country we, by ind.ividua_ 1 letters, secured State clearancf--;··. 
prior to investigation of each potential source; and (3) if . . I • i 
investigation favorable we, by individual letters, secured State I A~ 
clearance :lot. ~ni~i~l. interv~e'll! w(~h potent~al source to assess f ./'ht/ 
potenti«l, relzabilzty, stabzli.ty, etc. Thzs gave State three potnis~\ • 
where they could advise us our objectives were- too risky considering \ 
foreign policy implications. ·As noted in my memo 5-29-59 this has 
not worked satisfactorily because State has consistently UXlited until 
step (J) to decline clearance after we had expended considerable effort. 
It uns noted that in dealing with Bureau of Sec~rity and Consular 
Affairs we were dealing with super-cautious group which· lacked real 
authorityo In view of 1JXJ,steful expenditure of effort created by this 
situation it u.as recommended we have liaison go to Deputy Under 
Secretary of State Robert Murphy, uho is knowledgeable of intelligence 
functions, to work out something practical. . . . . 
On 6.;.2-59 this ux:is discussed with Murphy by our liaison 
representative, o. Ho Bartlett. L'urphy did not know we had been 
-.,/ .having this problem and said he would appreciate our coming to him 
--.J on these matters and depending on each individual case he would make•. 
_ \~ detenninationo He suggested Bartlett come to him .and give him_fact~ 
·1 ' \ by letterhead memo 07: any. other system Bureau desired and he would 
\ -~ then grant approval 1,mmediately or check where necessary. _. , ,,
