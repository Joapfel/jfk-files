Dear Director Sessions: 
SEI.KT COMMITT& ON INTULIGENCE 
WASHINGTON. OC 20510-8475 
October 17, 1188 
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is 
#88-3613 
- I 
conducting a comprehensive review of· U.S. counterintelligence 
and security Rrograms and capabilities. Included in this • 
review will be Executive branch efforts to stem the flow of 
sensitive technology and equipment to foreign governments. 
Recent press reporting has -lleged that such transfers 
have been made by the military offices of Egypt and Israel. 
Accordingly, I request that the FBI brief th'e Com.mi ttee staff 
on any unauthorized transfer of technology and equipment from 
the United States ·by the Egyptians and by the 'lsr~elis. For 
the latter, we are particularly interested in any role played 
in these transfers by the Israeli Defense Procurement Misslon 
and Trade Center in. New Y~rk. ~
