:~~~=mat:0~ cf a counterintelligence nature to detect and/or 
prevent peDetration of the Agency's orga~ization, employees, and 
ac::.ivities by foreign or domestic organizations or individuals. 
S?.S conduct:.ed research in connection with empioyee loyalty cases 
and mair.t:ained records identifying personalities, environments, 
and personal traits of individuals who had been of 
coun~erintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained 
lia:s~n with various government agencies in connection with 
counterintelligence activities and'coordinated the counter 
i~te:lligence effort throughout OS. SRS reported directly to the 
Director of Security. 
Question 4 - In the OS/S~S memo of Oct 31, 1960 written by 
Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of-several defectors are 
listed. What do the MS and EE file prefixed designate? How are 
these designations assigned. 
As noted in question 1, records were categorized according 
to the type and the older file numbers reflected the file 
category. "M" designated a miscellaneous record; "S" designated 
.... . ~ ' ...... , ... · 
.. -,• .... , . . . . ... - .. 
a Security Research Staff record. Therefore "MS" most likely 
refe~red to a miscellaneous record of interest to the Security 
Researc~ Staff. uE" or "EE• designations covered subjects of 
interest to the Domestic Contacts Division for 
inforrr~tion/intelligence purposes. -It appears that at least some 
of these a1pha designations were converted, to numerical values 
circa 1964. 
Question 5 - Does OS process security clearances for non­
employees {e.g. sources) to receive access to classified 
information? What kind of files are created by this process? 
How long are these files maintained~ 
Security clearances per se are not processed for non­
employees (sou~ces/contacts}. The Office of Security conducts 
appropriate national agency checks to try to determine the 
reliability of those individuals who are of interest for coBtact 
purposes because of their foreign travels, specific scientific 
information, etc. In a few instances an ad hoc 
clearance/validation may be requested in the event some 
classified information would be revealed in the course of 
acquiring intelligence from these sources. The validation period 
is normally five years, and any files.created are maintained in 
the individual's name for a period of ten years after the 
validation period has expired. The DO would most 1 ikely have 
further information on a particular source.
