Electric engine which was found to be unacceptable. The senior 
Navy member of the Evaluation Group stated that none of the designs 
was acceptable without very substantial change. 
A different view was expressed by the Source Selection Board 
which recommended that further work to achieve a satisfactory 
design be conducted exclusively with Boeing. It recognized that 
' ... i • 
substantial changes had to be made to the Boeing design: a different engine 
was required, the means of stowing missii'es was unsatisfactory, the 
radar equipment required revision, and feasibility of substituting 
capsules for ejection seats had to be explored. The Source Selection 
Board proposed that a letter contract be issued to Boeing for the 
limited purpose of refining a design specification which would be 
acceptable to the Navy and the Air Force. The Board's recommenda­
tion was concurred in by the Tactical Air Command, the Air Force 
Logistics Command and the Navy Bureau of Weapons. The Air Force 
Systems Command, however, which would have the over-all responsi­
bility for development of the aircraft,. recommended against the selection 
of Boeing, and proposed the award of study contracts to both Boeing and 
General Dynamics, as suggeated by the Evaluation Group.
