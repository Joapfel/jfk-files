1. Identification: The purpose of Project ZRRIFLE is to spot, 
develop, and use agent as sets for Division D operations. Agents will be 
spotted in several areas, including the Uriited States, but for operationa~ 
security reasons will probably not be used in their countries of residence. 
Present developmental activity is being conducted in the WE and EE areas, 
but it is anticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The 
project will be operated against third-country inst_allations and personnel. 
2. Objectives: The objective of this project is the procurement of 
code and cipher materials, and information concerning such materials, 
in accordance with req':lirements levied on the Clandestine Services, 
primarily by the National Security Agency. Since these requirements are 
subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the 
• duration of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of 
need and opportunity. The project will be conducted by Division D with 
assistance from area divisions and stations as needed. 
3. Background : In response to the increasing r_equirements for the 
operational procurement of foreign code and cipher materials, Division D 
in 1960 began the spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity. 
During the ~ame period requirements from NSA became more refined and in 
many respects more sensitive. Because most stations are not equipped to 
conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely
