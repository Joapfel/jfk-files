1 America management made a survey of the 18 and determined that 
.,..,, 
Southern Air Transport in Miami, Florida was the most attractive 
as a purchase possi~ility. It operated two C~46s--- one owned, one 
leased -- between Miami and points in the Caribbean and South 
America. Its associated company owned the four-acre property on 
which SAT was located. Moreover. it operated at a modest profit 
and had no long-term debts. 
Negotiations for the purchase of SAT were successful and on 
August 5; 1960; the CIA exchanged $307,506.10 for all outstanding 
shares of capital stock of SAT and its real property owning affil­
iate. The Agency owned these shares in the name of Roger C. Hyatt, 
a former board member of Air America. Mr. Hyatt together with 
Percival Brundage and Perkins McGuire were added to the SAT board 
of directors. 
Under CIA management Southern Air Transport operated with two 
semi-autonomous divisions·: the Pacific Division and the Atlantic 
Division. The Pac~fic Division performed the MATS contract and 
supported Agency heavylift r.equirement s in East Asia. The Atlantic 
Division continued to operate in the Caribbean and South America; 
doing the same sort of flying SAT·had done prior to Agency acquisi­
tion. The Atlantic Division was also able to furnish certain support 
for the Cuban and Congo operations. At the peak of its activities, 
the SAT fleet, comprised. of both owned and leased aircraft, included 
Douglas DC-6, Boeing 727, and Lockheed L-100 Hercules aircraft.
