II. FOR FOREIGN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 
Simply stated, covert action may be defined as activity w~ich sup­
ports the sponsoring natibn's foreign policy objectives but is concealed 
under circumstances permitting that nation to plausibly deny its actions. 
The National Security Act of 1947 did not specifically include 
authority for covert operations. However, it granted to the National 
Security Council, then created as an instrument of the President, the 
authority to direct the CIA to ''perform such othei functions and duties 
related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National 
Security Council may from time to time direct.'' Thereafter, at its 
-
first meeting in December 1947, the National Security Council issued 
a top secret directive granting the CIA the authority to conduct covert 
operations. From 1955 to 1970, the basic authority for these operations 
was National Security Council 5412/2.* 
This directive framed the purposes of covert operations entirely 
in terms of opposition to "International Communism,"** directing the CIA 
to counter, reduce and discredit "International Communism" throughout the 
world in a manner· cons is tent with U. S. foreign and military policies. 
It also directed the CIA to undertake covert operations to achieve this 
end, and defined covert operatibns as any cov~rt activities related to 
Today the basic authority for CIA covert action operaticins is National 
Security Decision Memorandum 40, which.supert:eded NSC 5412/2 on Feb­
ruary 17, 1970. 
** By contrast, NSAM 40 of 1970 d·escribe_d covert a.ct ions as tho.se secret 
ac dvities designed to fort her :Pf;ficial U. S. programs and policies 
abroad. It made no reference,t:o communism.
