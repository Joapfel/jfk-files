Mr. Baron. It appears to me that the Bandoeng Conference 
took place, according to testimony, in 1955 
and that the incident he was describing was either in '55 or 
4 ' late in '54.

Mr. Hunt. I had no recollection of it whatever. ~ 
is not suggesting that is some basis for personal animosity, 
I trust. 
Mr. Baron. No. He did say, though, that you might have 
had knowledge of that suggestion, although he wasn't sure of 
10 it. He said you were involved at that time in a place where 
11 you might have seen cable traffic like that .

Mr. Hunt. That's quite right, but I never saw that 
traffic. 
Mr. Baron. Let me pick up one last general question for 
the moment at least on assassinations. 
Do you have any knowledge of even the consideration of 
assassinations at high levels of the American governemnt? 
In other words, we have been using the term higher 
authority and I would like to use it for the moment now to 
refer to the level of the DCI or the National Security Council, 
the President, his close White House advisors, Cabinet 
officials, and the DCI. 
Do· you have any knowledge of any people at that level 
seriously considering assassination planning? 
Mr. Hunt. No, none. I think you have to bear in mind
