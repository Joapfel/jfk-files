The effort was directed at covering the dismantling an~ abandonment of 
the missile sites, at covering the roads and highways leading from the sites 
to the ports, and at covering the port areas to observe the material as it 
arrived, was assembled on the docks and loaded aboard ships. 
As stated, the intelligence community believes that all strategic mis­
siles and bombers which were·· in Cuba at the time of the quarantine were removed 
by the USSR. However, they acknowledge the existence of continuing reports to 
the contrary and freely concede that, in terms of absolutes, it is possible the 
despite our surveillance program, we were misled and deceived. 
VI. CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN CUBA 
A. Intelligence Activities and Operations Generally 
Since the withdrawal of the strategic missiles and the IL-28 bombers 
the intelligence community has turned its primary attention to surveillance of 
the situation as it now exists. High level U-2 photographic flights continue 
on a regular basis. Since the U-2 was shot down on October 27 there has been 
no further attempt to interfere w1 th our aerial reconnaissance. The reason 
for this one incident amidst a pattern of acquiescence in the overflights re­
mains a matter for speculation. 
The collection efforts using the technical and the various human sources 
available, such as refugees, exiles, and returned prisoners of the ill-fated 
Bay of Pigs operations, and others is a continuing process. The close surveil­
lance of merchant shipping arriving and departing Cuba, by naval air and sur­
face ships continues, as does the peripheral surveillance by electronic recon­
naissance and photographic aircraft. There is additional surveillance of the 
aircraft activity over and near Cuba, from bases and ships to the extent that 
radar range permits.
