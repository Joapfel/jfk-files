• RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT ~ 
As Operation Mongoose goes into the approved a~~ies~f ~::s': 1( q ~ ) 
a number of policy questions have started to arise. Current problems, t} 
needing resolution,_ are listed below. It is requested that the Special \ 
Group (Augmented) provide guidance, as a matter of some urgency.

1S,a'tiy~td~t, immediately, Defense reports that the proposed area~­
is adequate for this training, but that such training of covert agents 
who will be introduced ultimately into Cuba represents a security problem 
and a departure from past security procedures; due to the fa,ct that U.S. 
Government sponsorship will be apparent to trainees. Capture and 
interrogation of any of these covert agents could result in exposure 
(in international news media) of U.S. official involvement in efforts to 
unseat the present Communist Cuban regime. A policy determination 
is needed as to whether or not agents to be infiltrated into Cuba should 
be trained on U.S. Government installations. 
There are other U, S. military installations _and properties, in 
the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean areas, which ClA would like to use 
for similar training and operational purposes in the future. The same 
policy determination could cover al"i uses of identifiable U.S. Government
