before it was ~ven conducted. Both Blakey~.and I 
' stated that what we could now state was that we had come 
to the Agency with the suggestion that they investigate it, 
because we felt that from among the alternatives now available 
to the Committee, that alternative was the .one with the 
best chance of success. Finally Blakey also noted that 
his hope was that after the Agency's investigation was 
complete, copies of the reports could be placed in the 
Agency's and the Committee's files, and that would be the 
end of it. 
The meeting was terminated with the gerieral understanding 
that Blakey's suggestions would be followed, and the Agency 
would let us know when they had their reports complete.
