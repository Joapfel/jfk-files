Finally; I raised the question of what planning was being 
done to internationalize the border problem. In respons·e 
Cottrell simply refefred to his plan for dealing with_ the. 
situation in Laos.· -Today I talked with Bob Cleveland in State 
-about the same polrit~' .He referred to the arrangements that are 
being made for a meeting of_ ~G and US0M_Chiefs of countries 
in the area sometime in July _,··at which the border problem, 
among others, •will· be discussed·. He also referred to the fact 
that Ben Wood is _c_yrrently working on a counter insurgency plan 
to cover all of Southeast _·Asia. Defense had earlier been ·asked 
• to prepare such a plan but had failed to do so. (I find~ 
great inertia, apparently rooted .in a basic la~k of sympathy, 
whenever I attempt to raise the question -of .finding some means 
to involve the international community· in the border question. 
Neither Cottrell ·no·r the State Department representativ~s--,seem 
very·much. interested: Have you ever discussed this question 
wit_h ·Alexis Johnso~?- ·I think i·t might be useful· to do· ··~o~.) 
Following the·'meeting··r followed up witn Cottrell. on the 
conversation you had had. with him in the morning, -·asking-him 
whether he didn't.think it would be·desirable to send General 
Taylor to _South Viet· Nam··to consider the -~equest for··a:•;.,100,000 
man increase and also to make sure. that our mili·tary· activi.ties 
in .South Viet Nam, \tf~_re._:.really being _reorien~e·d~-·: He re_acft:ed·. • • ~ 
negatively . t61thHr proposal,. taking· the v·iew that it was·, wi­
q.esirable t·o ·conttnue s.ending missions out to inspect the wqrk 
of ··people in the field.- . In a later conversation with .someone • 
else in State I .got a much more f~vorable reaction to this idea~- . 
.The mo·re· I think about it the ·more I· am ·convinced: that ft would 
be highly desirable. I very-much share your uneasy feeling about 
the situation.·.
