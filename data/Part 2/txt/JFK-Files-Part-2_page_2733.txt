MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Commendation of Mr. William Kent 
During the last five months I have turned to Mr. Kent 
on two occasions to help the Latin America Division in 
connection with Senate Select Comaittae's investigation 
of ~overt action in Chile. When confronted with a need 
to produce a paper on Chile in a short timeframe, I 
instinctively turned to him. It vaa not only because he 
had expertise on Chile, due to service in the Chile Branch, 
but because ha ia highly skilled in written presentation. 
He organi~•• his material vell and present• it in a lucid, 
highly readable manner. On the first occaaion, ha ~elped 
us prepare a paper that was eventually uaad by the Director 
in his preeentation before the Senate Select Committee on 
14-15 July, On the second occasion hie contribution waa 
uaed by the DDO in hie appearance before the Senate Select 
Committee on 28 October. Both of tbcee papers were 
excellent and have vithatoood critical acrotiay. 
Aaide from Mr. Ken~•• ability to write I would like 
to take this occasion to record my overall high esteem 
for Mr. Kent as a professional and as a peraon. I have 
always considered him to be nne of our more able and pro­
mising officers. Bis dedication 1• •xe•plary; be baa spent
