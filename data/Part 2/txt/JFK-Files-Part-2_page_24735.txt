described executive action as a "general stand-by cap-abili ty-
11 
to 
carry out assassination when required (I.G., p. 37). The project 
I 
was given the code name ZR/RIFLE by the CIA.* 
A single agent ("asset"), given the cryptonym QJ/WIN, 
was placed under Harvey's supervision for the ZR/RIFLE project, 
but never used in connection with any actual assassination efforts. 
Richard Helms described QJ/WIN's "capability": 
"If you needed somebody to carry out murder, I guess you 
had a man who might be prepared to carry it out." (Helms, 
6/13/75, p. 53).

Harvey did use agent QJ/WIN, however, to spot "individuals 
with criminal and underworld connections in Europe for possible 
multi-purpose use" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 50). For example, QJ/WIN: 
reported that a potential asset in the Middle East was "the leader 
'"") 
r of a gambling syndicate" with "an available pool of assassins"

However, Harvey testified that: 
"during the entire existence of the entire ZRRIFLE proJect 
... no agent was recruited for the purpose of assassina­
tion, and no even tentative targeting or targ~t list was 
ever drawn." (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 45.) 
Project ZR/RIFLE involved, .generally, assessing the 
problems and requirements of assassination artd developing a stand~ 
·k ZR/RIFLE was a cryptonym relating to two programs. One was 
the executive action assassination capability. The other was 
another program which is not part of the subject matter of ~his 
report. (William Harvey had been in charge of the CIA section 
with general responsibility for such programs.) This second 
program was genuine, but it was also to provide a cover for any.,. 
e;;cecutive action operation. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. -49.) •
