With respect to submarine versus surface ships, 
McNamara restated the opinion that surface ships were better 
and were quite invulnerable because they would operate in 
coastal waters where several thousand ships of all types would 
be operating and therefore the missile ships could not be readily 
identified and attacked. 
The President seemed to feel that the multi-lateral 
forces idea was not going to go any place; as he .wound up, he 
seemed to be thinking more of how the idea could be put to bed without 
its failure being used against the United States or his administration 
to the advantage of de Gaulle and others who held stricly to the 
"European control" idea. 
No action was required on our part. I expressed no 
viewpoint at this meeting.
