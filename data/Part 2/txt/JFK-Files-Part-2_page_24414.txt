Cuba after the overthrow of Castro (I.G., p. 29). The Report 
speculated that Varona was interested in the assassination 
scheme as a means of financing the purchase of arms and 
communications equipment (LG., p. 31). 
Varona claimed to have a contact inside 
a restaurant frequented by Castro (Roselli, p. 21). As a 
prerequisite to the deal, he demanded cash and $1,000 worth 
of communications equipment (I.G., pp. 31-32; O'Connell, p. 23). 
O'Connell recalls that Colonel J.C. King, .head of the Western 
Hemisphere Division, gave him $50,000-in Bis.sell's office to 
pay Varona if he successfully assassinated.Castro (oiconnell, 
pp. 17-21). O'Connell stated that Bissell also authorized him 
to give Varona the electronics equipment that he requested 
(O'Connell, pp. 20-24). 
Bissell testified that he did not doubt that 
some cash was given to O'Connell, and that he was aware that 
the poison pills had been prepared. He did not recall the 
meeting, and considered it unlikely that O'Connell would have 
been given the money in his office (Bissell, 6/11, p. 40). The 
Inspector General's Report, relying on an Office of Security 
memorandum to the DDCI dated June 24, 1966, as well as on an 
interview with the person who signed the voucher for the funds, 
placed the amount at $10,000 (I.G., pp. 31-32). If the 
Inspector General's conclusionswere correct, the funds which 
Bissell allegedly authorized.were probably the advance payment
