10. Illegally Infiltrated Agents: The two 
successful black infiltrated teams (COBRA rurd AMTORRID) 
which have produced substantial intelligence will be 
continued, resupplied, and reinforced but pointed 
primarily at continued intelligence collection and at 
the recruitment for intelligence collection purposes of 
other Cubans who already are legally resident in Cuba 
in the areas where the teams are operating tinar del ~~ 
R.io and Orientej. In ad.di tion, on the most carefully 
selected basis, where it appears feasible, additional 
agents and teams will be infiltrated black into Cuba 
in an effort to duplicate the performance of the COBRA 
and AMTORRID teams and particularly to recruit and, as 
possible, train additional agents legally resident in 
Cuba. 
11. Exfiltration: As feasible, agents and potential 
recruits now in Cuba will be exfiltrated for 
training, indoctrination, supplying with communications, 
and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated into 
Cuba, primarily on intelligence missions. Where possible, 
this will be done through legal travel channels, but 
where this is not possible, it will be done wherever 
feasible through our black infiltration-exfiltration 
facilities, primarily our maritime assets.
