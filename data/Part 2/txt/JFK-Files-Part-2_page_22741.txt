can go all the way on dow~ the line. This ties up thousands of 
man-hours. 
Mr. Johnson. Could you explain that "satisfy the 
questionnaires?" 
What does that phrase mean, "satisfy the questionnaires'2" 
Mr. Angleton. The opposition wants to know, find out 
from your sources the following questions. 
Mr. Miler. In other words, the requirements they put 
on the agent. 
Mr. Angleton. Now, that agent is allegedly in the CIA 
and there is a penetration, then you' are just going through 
games, and they will play such an operation. They could have 
a very senior penetration into the.Agency and play al'ong on 
a double in order to lead you to believe that they do not have 
a penetration. And they can tie up your manpower and put 
doubles underneath him and another agent, and they can give 
him a radio set, and with the radio set they can give him 
crystals, and he needs other crystals, and it involves more 
and more of your own personnel and manpower. And you can 
tie up NSJ\: monitoring all the links. 
And so this idea that has all of a sudden been novel and 
newly discovered in the Agency th.:,t Counterintr.?lligence must 
ue aggressive is in my view a joke, It's a joke. 
Mr. Miler. You have to know what you're dealing with.
