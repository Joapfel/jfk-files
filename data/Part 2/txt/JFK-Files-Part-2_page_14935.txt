none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as 
a result of the listening device. The Supreme Court on 
June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to 
questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial 
memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on 
July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum. 
This memorandum indicated the listening device, 
installed with trespass under general Departmental authori­
zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney. 
The United States Supreme Cou~t on November 7, 
1966, vacated the income tax conviction· and granted a new 
trial, which will not be set until after the Robert Baker trial.

To date, the Bureau has received over 1,000 names 
of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination 
if such subjects have been cov~red by FBI microphones. A 
number of problems have resulted. 
One problem which has been encountered, and 
which can be expected to 6e even more serious in the future, 
is the lack of identifying data accompanying-the names of 
individuals on whom.the Department has made inquiry in these 
matters. For example, one list recently received included 
475 names, in some cases With a minimum of identifying data 
and in others with no identifying data a~ all. In order that 
an accurate determinatio~ can be made whether an individual 
in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones, 
it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate 
identifying data when submittin~ these names for review.
