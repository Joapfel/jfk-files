Most of the paramilitary operations and the training was

f: Q Now, the facilities that we have been talking about, 
7 training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special 
6 Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special 
9 Operati6ns Group, is that correct? 
lC :,ell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probab:L'y 
some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic 
12 Training Station is under the Office of Training ana but I 
13 would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would 
probably staff the training facility with their people who hav~ 
the expertise in paramilitary operations. 
l6 Q ;,ow, were the people that were being trained at 
these facilities basically Cuban refugees?
