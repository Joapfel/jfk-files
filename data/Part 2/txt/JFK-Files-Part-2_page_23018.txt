involvement with this activity? 
Mr. Halley. I would say that is correct. 
I want to go back to these other points, though, because 
I want to be meticulously correct here. I do not recall the 
specifics of this inventory of equipment. I do not recall, 
6 you know, sitting in a parking lo~, surveilling any kind of a 
7 vehicla.· On the other hand, I do recall having been involved 
8 with Harvey in some sort of an effort with a U-Haul t.ruck. 
9 Now therefore that last sentence you have read is correct,

to furnish support for a htadquarters operation from which I 
was otherwise excluded. 
Mr. Baron. You are not denying, are you, that you may have 
sat near the parking lot and surveilled the truck until it was 
picked up? 
Mr. Halley. I have no recollection 
Mr. Baron. One way or the other? 
Mr. Halley. No, I would say that my sitting in a parked 
car with Harvey surveilling a parking lot is the kind of thinri 
·that wo\lld have stuck in my mind. I do not recall ever doing 
that and that is the thing that has me a little perplexed here 
and I am having trouble matching this 'thing up with my own 
mcmory. It would have been damned unusual for Harvey and I to 
have sat in a parking lot, and I just. do not recall that. 
I do have a vagu~ recollection of being involved with him
