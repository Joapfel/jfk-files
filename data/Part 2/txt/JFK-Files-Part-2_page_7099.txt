labor organization which could serve as a platform 
for spreading pro-Castro prop~ganda among urban 
labor movements. The embryonic Single Center of 
Latin American Workers (CUI'AL), which held its con­
stituent congress in Brazil in January 1964, ends 
Havana's quest. This Brazilian congress was such 
a total failure, however, that it is doubtful if 
in the near future CUI'AL will provide Havana with 
the type of organization it envisaged. Cuba's sup­
port for the 9 March Second Latin American Youth 
Congress (LAYC) also was well established. This 
conference, too, ended in near-failure. Havana now 
is attempting to organize another hemisphere "soli­
darity-with-Cuba" congress in Montreal, Canada in 
July. This proposed congress--which, however, is 
beirig officially discouraged by the Canadian govern-
ment--would be modeled on a similar effort staged 
in Niteroi, Brazil in March 1963.
