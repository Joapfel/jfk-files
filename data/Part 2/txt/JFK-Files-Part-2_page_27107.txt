After finding the shellfish toxin in the vault, a complete inventory was 
taken. A large number of dangerous chemicals or drugs of various types were 
found. These materials relate to a number of past programs of TSO, including 
the drug project, the development of harassment materials for crowd control or 
~eeting disruption, crop contamination programs, etc. Small amounts of several 
other lethal preparations 1·1ere found. Two of these are known to have been 
obtained by the Agency for testing at Fort Detrick. Nothing is known about three. 
others. Also found were a number of L-Pills issued to agents, and formerly to U-2 
pilots, for suicide purposes in the event of capture. 
Boston contended that he had no recollection of the shellfish toxin having 
been obtained from Fort Detrick and stored in the laboratory. On 30 June, dis­
cussions were held with Dr. Gordon in.an interview at which Boston was also presen 
Gordon stated that the toxin had in fact been called back from Fort Detrick and 
stored in the laboratory on the basis of his own decision which resulted from 
conversations with Boston. It was their belief that the cost and difficulty of 
isolating the shellfish toxin were so great that it simply made no sense to have 
it destroyed. Apparently no one, including the Chief of TSD, was told of this 
decision or the fact that the material had been delivered by Fort Detrick. As 
Gordon recalled, this took place prior to his being told by the Chief of TSO to 
inform Fort Detrick that destruction of the material on the inventory list should 
take place. Boston who was present during this discussion took.no issue with 
Gordon's account. Neither could recall precisely how the material was delivered 
to OTS, but the DOD investigation indicates that it was delfvered to Boston by 
someone from Fort Detrick.
