The Honorable John Glenn 
To avoid disrupting our continuing efforts to gain 
access to the Russian files on Oswald, the fact that the 
Agency has had direct contacts with the Russian service on 
this topic must remain classified. For.the purpose of 
correcting the public record, I suggest the following 
unclassified statement: 
In response to a request from the US embassy in 
Moscow, the ·Russians have reviewed their file 
holdings•on Oswald. They have advised us that 
they had nothing that would add to our knowledge 
or to the 22 November 1991 ABC television special 
on this issue, which they termed •detailed and 
objective.• 
I enjoyed the opportunity to testify.before the 
Commi~tee, and I hope that these corrections prove helpful. 
A similar letter is being sent·· to-Ranking-Minority 
Member Roth. 
Sincerely, 
~TY>1~ Robert M. G es
