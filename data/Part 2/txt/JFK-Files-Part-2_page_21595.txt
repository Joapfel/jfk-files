INTERVIEW AND MEETmJ SUMMARY 
had not been eliminated in 1967 the intelligence 
community could have dealt with the New Left 
later. The CIA would have had assets to assess 
the issues. Such questions involved New Left 
travels overseas and relationships with foreign 
agents. 
The FBI and CIA did discu loping a cover ( ) 
in the U. S. to get int ravelers gained S 
very little. The irnrnedi em was the pro-
posal for a joint approach. When Papich was there, 
it got no further than discussion. If the CIA did 
set up cover in the U. S., the FBI provided no 
support. However, if the CIA desired to use a 
company it would ask for a check of FBI files.~ 
Papich is not aware of any political organiz 
created by the CIA, although it may have b 
in the 50's or 60 1 s. There was discuss 
FBI about creating its own group aime 
and discussion of whether or not to 
know about it. There had to be

FBI informant travel overs 
to CPUSA members. The FBI wold not tell CIA 
about informant trips to Moscow or Paris before-
hand. The reason was that the CIA would have 
notified its field agencies that the informant's 
life should be protected. Instead, the FBI informed 
the CIA of the results upon the informant's return. 
The FBI liaison section was made up· of six or seven 
agents. Papich and Biil Creager handled the CIA. 
Creager dealt specifically with USIB, the Security 
Committee, the Interagency Defector Committee, and 
the Office of Security. Papich and Creager backed 
each other up in their respective areas. There 
were several liaison agents at the Pentagon. The 
liaison at State was Oren Bartlett. The other 
liaison agents were not so deeply involved in in-
