A bulletin entitled, "Build ·Black Newspaper" 
dated July, 1967, stated, "A group of black revolutionariej· 
in Detroit, Michigan, have begun work on the production of 
a new newspaper. It is hoped that the first edition oft.he 
'Inner City Voice', will appear on the newsstand in August -
of 1967. 11 According to the bulletin, the I-CV's goal is the 
building of ·a mass circulating revolutionary propaganda 
program. The bulletin stated the newspaper was to concentrate 
on local news, cultural and social events, as well as providing 
coverage of radical politics. 
A source advised on March 17, 1970, that the ICV 
wa? published from July of 1967 through June of 1968, when 
it was terminated. In the fall of 1969 a newspaper similar. 
to ICV appeared on Detroit newsstands which was called 
"SAUTI", meaning Voice in Swahili. This publication, in its 
first edition stated that it emerged from the rev, and its 
purpose, in addition to the above, would be to exist as the 
official organ of the Leag~e of Revolutionary Black Workers 
(LRBW). In January of 1970, an edition.of uSAUTI" stated 
that it would continue publication under the old name of 
"Inner City Voice" and would provide coverage of the black 
extremist labor movement. In the spring of 1970, the ICV did 
not publish the infla.'llmatory articles which were common in 
1967-68, but called £or the overthrow of the United Auto 
Workers (UAW) leadership and control of black workers at 
Detroit area auto plants. •
