Dear Mr. Chairman: 
OCA 97-1969 
8 January 1998 
2000 
Thank you for your letter of December 16, 1997 in which 
you expressed interest in the status of Central Intelligence 
Agency's (CIA) processing of records related to President 
John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
You referred to the Assassination Records Review Board's 
concern that CIA may not be processing records at a pace 
sufficient to complete the work on time. I want to assur~ 
you, as I did to the Review Board's Executive Director in 
the enclosed November 21, 1997 letter, that the Agency is 
committed to taking all necessary steps to meet the statutory 
deadline of September 30, 1998 for reviewing all of the 
Agency's assassination-related materials. As the Review 
Board has noted, we are cooperating fully with the Board 
and its staff in this effort. 
We share the Review Board's goal of declassifying 
and releasing the relevant records to the fullest extent 
possible. As you are aware, it is important that there be 
a proper review of all the records so that still sensitive 
information that might warrant continued protection can be 
identified to the Board. For the past several years a team 
of experienced reviewers has been dedicated to the task 
of declassifying the assassination records. Recently we 
shifted several additional personnel to the team in order to 
accelerate the processing of documents and assure the prompt 
transfer to the Review Board and ultimately to the National 
Archives.
