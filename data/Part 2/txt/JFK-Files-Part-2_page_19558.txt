wi_ll be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders aud/o~ Capitol 
Pol~ce. .The exceptic:Aare allowed on "ocassions of .ational interest becoming 
the congnizance and e~rtainment of Congress." • 
The petition of the Jeannette.Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the 
ente_rtainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit wh~ch:_;:: 
was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which 
is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to • 
declare it unconstitutio£1al. We have !3-Sked the Federal District Co~t for the 
District of Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to 
January 15th. Our request was denied. 'Ihe same request was made to the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals, and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible 
to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the 
appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence 
of ultimate victory. 
This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend 
to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this 
I 
will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.
