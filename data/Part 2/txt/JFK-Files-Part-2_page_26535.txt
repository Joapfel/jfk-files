2. Bracero Program 
SECRET 
- 3 -
The Mexican Government is privately seriously 
dis~urbed about the termination of this program. 
Congressional oppostion to it is strong and we cannot 
commit ourselves to continue" the program. • We are··fooking 
into ·tfie"·probletn to· see if anything can· be done to help 
Mexico. One possibility is an expanded community develop­
ment program in Mexico through private channels (P.L. 480 
foo9stuffs through U.S. voluntary agencies) if Mexico is 
interested. 
3. Mexico's Concern about U.S. Trade Policies 
Mexico is concerned about United States restrictions 
or threatened restrictions on textiles, lead, zinc and 
meat and other products and.United States cotton polici~s 
wh3=ch i~ claims hurt Mexican cotton exports to the world 
market. We recognize that we are natural markets for 
each other. We desire to expand trade, promote competi~ 
tion and develop markets. We want to maintain or expand the 
present level of access to each other's market but we would 
not be able to guarantee Mexico its present share of"out •• .. -
marlcet in each ·commodity or a, share· ih ·,ncre·cfsed ·corisump-t:ion. 
4. Chamizal Settlement

man who returned '"'~e Mexican flag to the Chami?al. He 
wants a ceremony ~t the Presidential level at El Paso-
Ciudad Juarez before December 196l~ to symbolize the Chamizal 
s~~tlement~. We should only agree to consult later in the 
y~ar oq ~n approp~iate ceremony and a possi~le date.
