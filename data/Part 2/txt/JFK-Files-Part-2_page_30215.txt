Mr Blakey ~as no_tofied at 5:05 PM after he completed a meeting 
in his office. He stated that from now_ on the JFK safe will be 
locked at all times. If something is taken out ~he safe will be 
relocked until it is ~eturned. 
I suggest that until such time as the persons tising that room 
are finished in there we sho~ld lock all ~he safes at all times
