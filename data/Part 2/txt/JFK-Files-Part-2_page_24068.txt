plots "were completely authorized'at every appropriate level 
within and beyond the Agency", although he had "no personal 
knowledge whatever of the individuals' identities, times, 
exact words, or channels through which such authority may 
have passed". Harvey stated that he had, been told by Richard 
Bissell that the effort against Castro had been authorized 
"from the highest level", ,and that Harvey had discussed the 
plots with Richard Helms,' his immediate superior. Helms 
testified thit although he had never discussed assassination 
with his superiors, he believed: 
" . that in these actions we were taking against 
Cuba and against Fidel ,Castro's government in tuba, 
.that they were what we had been asked to do. . In 
other words we had been asked to get rid of Castro 
and . . there ·were no limitations put on the means, 
and we felt ·we were acting well within the guidelines 
that we understood to be in play at this particular 
time. 
The evidence points to a disturbing situation. Agency 
officials perceived the effort to assassinate Castro to have 
been within the parameters of permissible action, but Adminis­
tration officials -(including McConen·-responsible for formulat­
ing policy were not aware.of the effort and did not authorize 
it. The explanation may lie in the fact that orders concerning 
overthrowing the Castro regime were stated in broad terms that 
were subji6t to differing interpretations by those responsible 
for carrying out those orders.
