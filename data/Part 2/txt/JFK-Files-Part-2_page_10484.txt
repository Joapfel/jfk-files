ME1IORAXDU~I "FOR: Mr. William E. Colb_y 
SUBJECT: Special Activities ... 
1. Following our recent conversation, I have 
searched my memory and ~r. ~cCone's.files ior examples 
of activities which to hostile observers or to someone 
without complete knowled~e and with a special kind of 
motivation could be interpreted as examples of activiti~s 
exceeding CIA's charter. 
2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962, 
DCI 11cCone, under pressure irom Attorney General Robert 
F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists 
Robert S. Allen c1.nd Pnul Scott j_n an effort to identify 
their sources for classiiied information wl1ich was appcnr-
ing in their columns. Because tile primary source appeared 
to be in the Department of Defense, ~cConc ordered me 
personally to bri~f General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA, 
orally, which I did. I understand Llorc co~plcte inforaation 
on this operation is available from the Director of Security. 
I, personally, managed to avoid gaj_ning any knowledge of 
what precise actions were taken, what information was gained, 
what was done with it, and when chc operation was terminated. 
3. As a result of a developing relationship with 
IDEN-122 theIJEN-123representativt: in Washington, 
and also as a result of certain inform~tion conveyed by 
I IDEN-124 , James Anl,;leton, with the approval of 
Dick Helms, a-greed i.o mount a counterespionage operation 
against the IDEN-95 in Washj_ngton. This involved 
breaking and entering and the ~emoval of documents from 
NW 38196 Docld:32989fi24 123
