I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the 
Department is that we could not provide counsaldirectly to the individuals 
because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the 
individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my 
knowledge the question concerning whether the Government c•uld pay for 
private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched. 
Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer 
and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahans request.
