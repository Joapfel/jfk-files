However, this immediately got us into an internal security 
and a police function. I told them they had to drop it, and 
they did. And it's too bad, because nobody else has found a way 
of doing it, and this information is floating over our heads 
right now and we cannot use it. 
Mr. Schwarz. Have there been any instances where you or 
your office advised the Agency that it should not do something 
when nevertheless the Agency went ahead and did it? 
Mr. Houston. I should think I would remember an occasion 
11 like that, but I don't.

Senator Mondale. Thank you. 
(Senator Mondale left the hearing room.) 
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Houston, with the Senator'absent, you 
don't have to go ahead. 
Mr. Houston. Fine, fine. 
Mr. Schwarz. I'm going to go on to another subject. 
Does anyone else have anything else about the Robert Kennedy 
meeting? 
Mr. Kirbow. I have only one other question, and perhaps 
more about the leadership of the Agency. 
Mr. Houston, your reputation over the some twenty-six 
twenty-eight years you were General Counsel was one of intense 
loyalty to the Director and the Deputy Director of the Agency. 
Mr. Houston. That is correct.
