MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief Historical Review Group 
FROM: Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
DO, Focal Point for ARRB 
SUBJECT: Proposal for Dealing with Employees' Names 
1. Cover mechanisms are an integral part of conducting 
clandestine operations. We are concerned about individuals that 
continue to be dependent on particular cover legends and on the 
organizations that cooperatively work with us to provide those 
• cover legends. The following proposal is offered to streamline 
the process of handling names and minimize the potential damage 
an inappropriate release could cause. 
A. Incomplete and Unidentifiable names: 
a. We will release the occurrence of a name when a 
common last name appears by itself or in conjunction 
with a common first name such that it does.not tend 
to specifically identify the individual. 
b. We will release the occurrence of a name if it 
remains unidentified after a reasonable search is 
conducted. 
B. Identifiable names for employees that retired 
overtly: 
In most cases, overt employees' names will be released, 
but in some cases overt employees may have a 
portion of their employment remain under cover. Such 
cases will require the same review as that of an 
employee who remained under cover into retirement.
