the vote in the Senate by bringing troops out and surrounding 
the Senate building. Hedgeman said that up to this point he 
had been thinking largely in parliamentary terms; that the 
way to rid the country of Lumumba was through the paramilitar 
method. After this experience of the 5th through the 7th, he 
decided more drastic and direct methods had to be employed. 
Hedgeman contends that the coup of Mobutu seized control was 
arranged and supported, and indeed, managed, by the Central 
Intelligence Agency. During the course of the interview 
Hedgeman spoke glowingly of Mobutu, who he feels is a man wit 
good political judgment, a sense of history, and the capacity 
to be a Pan African leader. Mobutu was only twenty-nine at 
the time. Hedgeman says his most difficult time with Mobutu 
came in February of 1961 when the Kennedy administration deci ed 
that a federalized government, including all political factio s 
was the only hope of averting civil war. Hedgeman was charge 
with going to Mobutu and-telling him that the United States 
had decided to withdraw all support from him and that he 
would have to resign. He said Mobutu was utterly shocked 
by this and could not possibly believe the United States 
could believe that the Congo was ready for parliamentary 
government. He said Mobutu was so upset that he drew his gun 
and waved it in the direction of Hedgeman and said "If this 
happens, I will die," and, looking at Hedgeman, "so will others." 
Hedgeman said Mobutu only put his gun away when Hedgeman 
told him that he did not personally agree with the decision, 
that he was just carrying out orders like a good soldier.
