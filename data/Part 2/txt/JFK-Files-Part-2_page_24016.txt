'~ \(f \iTrack-;•IFJ/.~'fhd' ~alerid!!J'ialso suggests that Karamessines and Kissinger 
met on three other occasions and so might have h~d the opportunity to 
discuss Track II. 
Henry Kissinger's testimony before the Committee differs 
from Karamessines in two respects: He believed Track II ,;,,•as "turned off" 
on·October 15; and,after that date,he was informed neither of the coup 
plans of the Chilean conspirators nor of the passage of weapons to them. 
He said that Track 11 was 
in the nature of a probe and not in the nature of 
a plan, ... no plan for a coup was ever submitted to 
the White House. So my recollection of events, 
this was a request by President Nixon for Track II 
which led to two or three meetings which then on. 
October 15th led to being turned off by the White 
House, after which Track II was dead as far as my 
office was concerned~ and we never received another 
report on the subject. (Kissinger testimony, p. 15) 
*** 
In my mind Track II was finished on October 15th 
and I never received any further CIA information 
after October 15th on the basis of any records that 
I have been able to find. (Ibid., p. 59) 
General Haig's testimony generally coincided with Kissinger's 
recollection: 
I left (the October 15th meeting) with the distinct 
impression that there was nothing that could be 
done in this covert area that offered promise or 
ho_pe for -success. I had the distinct impression 
that was. Dr. Kissinger's conclusion, and that in 
effect these things--and I wasn't even really 
familiar with what these two groups were to do and 
how -they were to do it, but they were to cease and 
desist. (Haig testimony, pp. 26-27) 
*** 
~tty recollection would be that we.had no hope for a 
viable, covert plan of action. That is the impres~ 
sion I got. (Ibid. , p. 29)
