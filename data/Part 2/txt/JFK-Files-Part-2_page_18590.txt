::_ R~: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL 
lliFORMANTS AS AN Th1VESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE!

. .Besides the eA-plicit recognition reflected above of 
•. the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants, 
there are other Supren1e Court cases which implicitly recognize 
this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's 
'identity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro v, United States, 
353 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an 
informant's information as the basis of prob?,ble cause for an 
. arrest without a warrant. (Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307 
.. :"• .. -,,.-(1959); I\-'IcCray v. Illinois. 386 U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly, 
.. _'. .-.-.. • tp.e Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may 
• - . form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit 
;-: .. • .. shows the underlying circun1stances which would give reason to 
.. .. : believe the informant is credible, and circumstances showing 
· . the basis for conclusions reached by the informant. (Aguilar v. 
·'. .Texa~t· _3?..? u. s~ 108 (1964)). _.7 
C The above-cited cases s·how that while courts ta.,;~o
