against a coup, but suggested that alternative leadership should be 
identified and cultivated. The recoinrnendations we~e prorn2tly 
approved by the President. (Pentagon Papers, pp.215-1_16) 
Oh October 3 Conein contacted Minh. Mirih explained that a 
coup was being plann~d, and requested assurances of American 
support if it were successful. f1inh -Outlined three courses of 
action, one of which was the assassination of Dien's brothers, 
* Nhu and Can (Cqnein, p.25; cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63). 
The Acting Chief of the CIA Station, D~vid R. Smith, cabled ori­
October 5 that he had recommended to Lodge that "we do not set 
ourselves irrevocably against the assassination plot, since the 
other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon or_a 
protracted struggle'' (Cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63). 
A cable from the Director, CIA to Saigon responded that: 
'' (w)c certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating, 
approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other 
hand, we are iri no way responsible for stopping every 
such threat of which we misht receive even ixi.rtia.1 knm·1-
lcdge. We certainly would not favor assassination of Diem. 
Ne believe engaging ourselves by taking position on this 
matter opens ·door too easily for probes of our position 
re others, re support of regime, et ceLera. Consequently 
believe best approach is hands off. Uowever,.~e naturally 
interested in intelligence on any such plan." 
* The other courses of action were the encirclement of Saigon 
by various military units and direct confrontation between military 
units involved in the coup and loyalist units. 
** Colby, who was then Chief, Far Eastern Division, drafted 
this cable for McCone. Colby testified: 
"Q: So you were on notice as of that date that the Director 
personally opposed any involvement by the CIA in an assas­
sination? 
"Colby: I certainly was." (Colby, p. 57)
