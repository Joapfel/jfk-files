when I arrived in Rome I read that Lumumba was captured. I learned 
from Mobutu and Casavubu that Lumumba would be imprisoned in Thys­
ville. 
COS MEETS WITH BISSELL, TWEEDY, AND KARAMESSINES IN ROME 
In November 1960, while Lumumba was at large, COS flew to Rome 
to meet with Richard Bissell, Bronson Tweedy and Thomas Kararnessines 
(then Chi~f of Station in Rome) for a briefing session on events 
in the Congo. The meeting took place at Karamessines' house. COS 
remembers a general discussion of events surrounding Lumumba's 
escape and of the situation in the Congo, but he does not recall 
any specific discussion of assassination. He said, "Perhaps we 
did discuss assassination, I simply don't recall. I was tired. I 
had flown all day. And I wasn't in favor of assassination." 
BRONSON TWEEDY 
COS assumed that Tweedy was knowledgeable of the assassinatio~ 
plan. However, he does not recall specifically discussing the plan 
with Tweedy prior to the delivery of the poison or while he was in 
possession of the poison. COS said, "I did talk with Bronson 
Tweedy much later about it to the effect that 'thank God nothing 
was ever done . ' " 
COS did not remember whethe·r Tweedy came to the Congo before 
Lumumba's death. COS thought that he must have'come later. COS 
said, however, that if Tweedy had come earlier he probably would 
have asked Tweedy about the assassination mission.
