Clandestine Informant Activities 
The Committee :i.s e_xamining all aspects of the 
FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover 
personnel and the techniques employed by such per­
sons. Although informants are the single most 
pro<;:Iuc·ti ve source of intelligence info.cmation, the 
diTficulties of controlling their activities may 
increase the possibility of improper conduct. The

accomplishment of legitimate objectives.
