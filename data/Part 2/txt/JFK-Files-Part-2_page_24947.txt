think I agreed to use it." Although he also said that he did not 
tell Gottlieb that he would refuse to use it. 
COS said that even though Gottlieb had told him that clearance 
for the assassination of Lumumba had come from the President and 
the DCI, he wanted verification from Headquarters of an assignment 
of such magnitude. COS said: "I responded to Headquarters with a 
double-talk message, saying that I had met the messenger and re­
questing confirmation. I then received a cable containing double­
talk confirmation, something like 'your assumption confirmed."' 
COS said "I never knew who was sending me these cables. They 
also said 'Director' and I sent my cables with a special slug. My 
cables were probably marked to 'Director" which is never actually 
seen by the DCI. COS thought that he destroyed his copy of .cables 
on this subject on instructions contained in those cables. He said 
that only a single copy of the cables had existed at the Congo 
Station. COS sqid that he was instructed by Got~lieb that he was 
not to discuss this assassination mission even with his own deputy. 
COS said that he did not discuss the operation with Glenn Fields. 
He also said that he would not have discussed the operation with 
Dr. Lester Houck because Houck was removed as Branch Chief in early 
fall due to dissatisfaction with his performance. 
COS said that he thought an assassination effort was "a bad 
idea, both morally and practically.If However, COS said that he 
may not have expressed his grave concern to Gottlieb because he was 
so taken .aback at receiving the assignment. COS thought that he 
told Gottlieb that he did not have a good means of access to Lumumba.
