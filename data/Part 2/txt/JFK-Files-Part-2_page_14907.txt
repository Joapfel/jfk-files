HENRY WINSTON 
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST 
91111-1 ACT OF 1940 
r'} 
u 
Henry Winston was one of the eleven functionaries 
of the Co1mnunist Party, USA, who were convicted on October 
11~- 1949, on a charge of co~spir~cy to teach and a~voc~te t~e 
violent overthrow of the United ~tates Government 1n v1olat1on 
of the Smith Act of 1940. Sentenced to five years in prison 
and·fined $10,000, Winston failed to surrender on July 2, 1951 
to begin servin?' his sentence. He surrendered on r,:arch 5, 1956, 
and received an°additional three-year contempt sentence, both 
sentences to be served in the U.S. Penitentiary at Terre Haute, 
Indiana. 
Since that time, the Communist Farty, USA, has been 
conducting a continuous campaign to effect Winston's release 
either through parole, executive clemency or amnesty. ~ecently, 
this campaign ,vas accelerated because 1'!inston was alleged to be 
suffering from a brain ttunor. On Junuary 22, 1960, Winston was 
transferred to the U. S. r,ledical Center, Sprin~fie Id,· r,:issouri, 
I 
where the presence of the brain tumor was co~firm~9. 0!1 J ar.iuary 
30, 1960, he was removed under guard to the konter1ore Hospital, 
New York City, where he underwent surgery on February 2, 1960. 
The tumor ,vas removed but as yet there has bee_n no statement 
as to mali~nancy. The last hosni tal bulletin indicates. his 
condition 1s satisfactory and his eyesight is improving. 
On January 26, 1960, a parole hearing for Winston was 
held before the U.S. Board of Parole in Washington, D. C., and 
\ 
several known Communists and Communist sym1;athizers appeared at 
. this hearins in Winston's b~half. Since tte attorney repres~nting 
Winston claimed that his briefcase containing petitions and 
signatures had been stolen, the Farolc Board agreed to postpone 
the hearing for one week to enabl~ him to dupl1cate the petitions. 
I 
· tJnonO' the· indi vidnals app~aring at the Faro le hearing 
was Reverend Eider G. Hawkins of N~w York City, a strong 
supporter of Conununist front organizatioos. Durcau files show 
that since 1940, Rev. l-hn~
1
kins has b-2cn arfi liated with, or has 
lent support to, ten organizations designated by the Attorney 
General pursuant to =~xccutivc Order 10450, as well as three 
other Co;nmunist fron~ organizations. Following l?cv. Ha,vkins 
I 
return to New York, information was received that he plans to 
contact~Reverend 2dward L. R. £Ison, the lresidcnt•s-minister, 
to u~g~ ~ev. Elso~ to talk wi ~h \~~ Frcsid~nt r~g~rding the 
poss10111 ty of a full parol~ tor )\' ins ton. It wns 1nd icatcd that 
I 
although Rev. El~on rany not want to yi~ld, Rev. Hawkins will 
"put tfi~ pressure on." (Liaison has been instructed to advise 
Rev. Elson of this possible contact by Rev. Hawkins and to 
confidentially advis2 him of Hawkins' subversive background.)
