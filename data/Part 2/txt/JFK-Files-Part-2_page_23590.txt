J,;:i.nsd.,1c's office ~no, in his ;i,h::;ence, pointcd_ont to Fi:111k Jf;,,nd 
the in;l.(ln1issibility: :1.nd stnpidity of putting thi.s type of comment in

I i;lrongly urged lfand to rccorninend to L;:i.n'..;,Jale that he_ excise 
the phrase, in qucs~ion fro1n ;i,ll cop_ics of this ~-ne1nora111l1.11n, in­
cluding those disse1ninr1.tcd to St;:itc, Defense, ;ind USJA. Shortly
