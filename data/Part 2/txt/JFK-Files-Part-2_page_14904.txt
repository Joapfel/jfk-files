confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information 
and that we will not disclose their identities without their 
permission. In the case of death or severe illness, we will 
be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand 
why this fequtrement has been added. 
I ',.· A third change makes it possible for either the 
Attorney General or the Director to certify that an individual 
is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure 
would be detrimental to the national security. The pre7?_ious 
draft required that this certification be made.by the Attorney 
General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the 
investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data 
and, at the same time, to decide whe~her the applicant is to 
have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this 
procedure may be criticized both by the public and the courts. 
This matter was discussed. with the Department by llr. Belmont 
at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General 1s Office on 
August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical 
standpoint and the standpoint of the Supreme Court~ . 
certij'ication concerning the need to protect an informant 1s 
identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case 
of the FBI or the appropriate department head in the case of 
other investi.gative agencies. 
The fourth change clarifies the authority of the 
department head to deny or revoke access to classified data 
without regard to the balance of the Order. Although the 
previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an 
improvement as it removes all p·ossible doubt as to its meaning. 
Our observations concerning the four changes, -as 
l 
summarized above, were forwarded to Assistant At·torney General 
Yeagley by memorandum dated February 8, 19&0.
