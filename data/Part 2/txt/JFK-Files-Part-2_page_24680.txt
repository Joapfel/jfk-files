he liave undertakena mission to the Congo if it involved assess­

else (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 26). 
O'Donnell was "sure" that he "related everything" to Hedgrnan 
about his conversations with Bissell concerning the assassination 
of Lumumba (O'Donnell; 9/11/75, p. 46). Hedgman, however, had no 
recollection of learning this from O'Donnell (;:,~chr,man, 8/21/75, 
p. 56). 
Beyond this, O'Donnell said that his discussions of assassi­
nation with Hedgman were seneral and philosophical, d~aling with

Hhen. asJ.ced to characterize Hedgnvm 's attitude toward as.sassination 
based on those discussions, O'Donnell ~aid: 
I will answer your question just as fairly 
and as scrupulo~sly.as I can. I have a 
great deal of respect for Hedgnian. And if 
he said something, I would believe hfr1 • t,) 
be speaking the ~ruth as he kne~ it without 
shading it .... The best I could sav, I 
think, -would be this, that he would.not have 
been opposed in principle to assassination in 
the interests of national sectiritv .... I 
know that he is a man of ,r'.reat moral per­
ception and decency and honor, and so forth. 
And that it would disturb him to be engap,:ed in 
something like that. But I think I would 
have to say that in our conversations, my 
memory of those, at no time would he rule it 
out as beini!, a possibility. (O'Donnell,
