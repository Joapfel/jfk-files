I asked if he was proposing overt in­
tervention by US armed forces. He said 
absolutely not. The essence of his plan 
would be to land in Cuba, presumably in 
the next month or two, a force of 600 
trained Cubans, following up this land­
ing with additional Cuban elements and 
then installing a government in the bridge­
head which would.call on us for financial 
and logistics support. He mentioned a 
number of names which were unfamiliar to 
me of Cubans who he said are politically 
unblemished in Cuba, neither pinks nor 
reactionary rightists.* 3/ 
On 30 November 1960, a Special Group meeting was 
held at which time Gordon Gray: 
* Considering that discussions within the Agency and 
within the Special Group had only recently arrived at 
the figure of '600 men for ~n invasion brigade, plus 
the fact that this brigade would establish abridge­
head from which a provisional government opposed to 
Castro might be announced, one might speculate on the 
source of Pawley's information. Jake Esterline has 
tended to denigrate the role played by Pawley during 
the course of the Bay of Pigs operation; but, nonethe­
less, throughout the course of .the operation Jake was 
charged with maintaining close liaison with Pawley. 
JMATE records indicate not only the numerous face-to­
face meetings between Pawley and Esterline during the 
course of the operation, but also reflect an amazing 
number of telephone conversations between the two 
during the life of the operation. In terms of the 
operational plan·per se, Esterline appeared to be 
most cagy in handling this subject during the dis­
cussions with Pawley. The recorded conversations 
focus on the potential leadership for the FRD -- with 
Pawley's "best" leadership choices usually being far 
to the right.
