one agency of the Government to· duplicate facilities 
readily available from another. A typical example of this 
procedure is purchasing photointerpretation gear for t~e 
Defense I~telligence Agency elew.ent located at ~FIC. In 
connection ~ith the current reporti~g require~ent, however, 
I have had our records researched for the past 2 years and 
Attachncnt i r~flects those transactions which appear to be 
relevant to the subject of ~his memorandum. 
d. In connection with the disclosures during the sum­
mer of 1971 that the Rand Corporation was not properly 
• safeguarding classified docu~ents, this Office undertook 
two acts.· I direc·ted the Sec_1JYi t-...:......QEfi c:er from our: West 
Coast Procure!nent Office at the Iden 87 _. 
to visit the Rand Cornoration and satisfy 
himself that classified material fu~nisl1cd them by the 
Agency was both properly safeguarded and accounted for. 
His report was affirraative. On 23 August 1971, the senior 
Security-Officer assigned to this Office forwarded a 
letter tci the Rand Corporation stre~sing and reaffirming 
the procedures Rand ~ust follow in safeguarding classified 
information furnished then by the Agency. Of residual 
interest in this matter, there is suw~arized the contents 
of a me~orandun of 2 July 1971 to the Executive,Director­
Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession. 
This memorandum reports that FBIS regularly 
disseninated renorts to the Rand Coruoration 
but that instructions had been issued to cease 
distribution of classified reports. While no 
other direct dissemination went to Rand, other 
USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing 
"many" copies of DD/I products to Rand as au­
thorized under USIB regulations. The memoran­
dum also states that Rand personnel had 
requested searches and document retrieval from 
the CRS facility. 
S. In connection with action taken for the Office of 
Security, there are three relevant items: 
'\

by.the Office of Security to print a book written by
