from Clara Santa's salary every cent paid for the

It is known that the Cuban government gives some 
money to Clara Santa's mother in Cuba. How much 
is not known. Clara Santa wa-ted to ask for a part 
of her mother's money in Mexico to help buy shoes, 
clothes, etc. to take back to Cuba, but she was told 
this was a capitalistic approach. 
Mercedes, though strict, is good about sending 
packages of medicines back to Cuba for Clara. 
Clara is apparently very color conscious. Always asks 
what color a person is. She says the Mexicans like 
Negro women, therefore she had to be careful. (Note: 
It is possible Mercedes told her this to keep her home, 
as this was insinuated once.) Mercedes does not like • • 
for Clara Santa to talk with people on the phone. The 
other maid, Carlota, commented Mercedes treated Clara

Clara's main complaint is that she has no free time,is 
tied to the apartment, does not have time for the movies, 
to get her hair done, etc. She also complains things 
are expensive in Mexico. Likes to buy clothes. Mercedes 
does help her with the washing and ironing. Mercedes 
also helps by sending a lot of the laundry out, especially 
that which needs ironing, like shirts. Compared to the 
Luna's, the cruz' do very little entertaining, thus.

asked Santa if she wanted to go, but Santa felt she had 
to tell Mercedes she was the one who: should go. Daisy 
and Santa criticize all the women who work at the 
Embassy, saying they ane a bunch of hypocrites. (Main 
complaint seems to be the other women have money, buy 
clothes, etc.) Santa said she would be glad when 
December came as she can then return to Cuba (did not 
say for vacation or PCS).
