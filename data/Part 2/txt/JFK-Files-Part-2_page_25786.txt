"It is true that it was s,1id tlirn by other factions 
that the real reason for inst,1lling the missiles was 
bec,n1se certain internal problems 1,.'~re driving the Rus­
si,1ns to use us to provoke the United St.1t~s. I am here 
to tell you that the Russians didn"t w,rnt ,111d do n\)t 
todr1y want war. One only need \'isit them on their 
home territory, watch ther;. at 1,·ork, share their eco­
nomic concerns, admire their intcn,c efforts to raise the 
\\'orkcrs' st.1nd:ird of li,·ing, to undcrst,111d risht ,11,,.,y 
that they are far, very far, from ,rny idea of pro,·oc:ition 
or domination. However, S_o\'ict Russia w,1~ nmfronlcd 
by two alternatives: an absolutely ine\·itable 11·,u (be­
cause of their commitments and their position in the 
socialist world), if the Cuban rc\'olulion w,1s ,1tt.1ckccL 
or the risk of a war if the United State,, rcfusins to 
retre,,t before the missiles, would not bive up the at­
tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose sociJlist solidarity 
and the risk of war. 
"Under these circumst.uices, how could we C~1l1,1ns 
have refused to share the risks L1kcn to save us? lt 
WilS, in the final anJlysis, a question of honor, don't 
you Jgree? Don't you believe that honor plavs a role 
in politics? You think we arc rom,rntics, don't v~,u? 
Perhaps we are. And 1·\'hy not? In ,111)' r:'\'Cnt, 1,-~ arc 
mi]itants. In a wc,rd, then, we af;rccd to the cmpl.1ce­
ment of the missiles. And I might ,1dd here that for lb 
Cubans it didn't really make "n much difference 
whether we died by convention,,! bl1111hing or a hydro­
gen bomb. Nevertheless, we we~ gambling with 
the peace of the world. The United States w,15 the one 
to jcopJrdize the peace of mankind by using the threat 
of. war to stifle revolutions. 
"And. so in June, 1962, my bruther Raoul and Che 
Guevara went to rv1oscow to discu:;s ways and means 
ofinstalling the missiles. The con,·(1y arri\'ed by sea in 
. three weeks. The United States was able to find out 
that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it 
took them hvo. months to disco\·cr th.lt these weapons 
were guided missiles. T\\'o months ... in other words, 
longer than we had calculated. l:3cc.111~e, of course, we 
were seeking intimidation, not aggression," 
The.conversation now turned to the Alli,1nce for l'rnr,­
res.s. "In a wav,". Castro said, "it 1v,1s a poud icle,1, it

hcd,ll"CS! Yes, 2C'l',ooo! Yet the re,Klion of the trusts 
w,1s terrible at th,1t time. Now.id,1ys, in the other L1tii1 
,\mcric.1n countries, because the Communist banner is 
used as a bo1~cym,in, the re,1ction of the American 
trusts is shrewder. They .ire going to choose strawmrn, 
so ,1s to ruic indirectly. But there will be difficulties. 
"This is why Kennedy's good ideas aren't goini:;. to 
\'ic!d ,111y i'csults. !t is \'cry easy to understand and· at 
this f'Oint he surely is a\\'arc of this because, as I told 
you, he is a rralist. For years ,rnd vc,us Amcri,:,rn policy 
- not the government, but the trusts ,rnd the Pentagon 
- k1s supported the L1tin Americ.111 oligarchies. All the 
prestige, the doll,1rs, and the power w,1s held by a class 
which Kenned:-, himself h,1s described in speaking of 
Batista. Suddenly a Presidenf arrives 0:1 the scene who 
tries to su~'lport the interests of another class (which 
has no access lo ,1ny qf the levers of power) to give the 
v.1rious L1ti11 American countries the impression that 
the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators, 
,111d so there is no more need to start Castro-type r.cvo­
luti011s.' What happens then? The trusts see that their 
interests ,1ic being a little compromised (just barely, 
but still cc,1i1pro111ised); the Pentagon thinks the stratc­
t;ic b,1scs are in danger; the pQ1,·crfol oligarchiec; in ,111 
the Latin Amcric.111 countries alert their American 
friends; they <1botas~ the new policy; and in short, 
Kennedy has everyone against him. The few liberal or 
allegedly liber,1! rresidents who were chosen as instru­
ments of the new policy are swept ont of office, like 
G,,sc:h in S,1:1110 DL,min~~o, ,,r else they ,1rc tr.:insformed.
