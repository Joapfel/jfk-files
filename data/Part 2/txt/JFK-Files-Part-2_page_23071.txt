Mr. Halley. I- do not know if your quastion means the same 
thing to me. I would prefer to say we had a liaison relation­
ship with the FBI, that is, on matters dealing with counter­
intelligence matters. There was a regular exchange of data 
with the FDI. There was an exchange of name traces on people 
that they were conducting investiqations on, for:· counterintelli 
gence purposes,We would trace certain individuals and with the 
FBI there were a couple of counterintelligence cases that we 
discovered that were turned over to the FBI. 
So this is in the context of the normal CIA-FDI liaison 
that existed between the two aqencies. _ 
12 Mr. naron. But the FDI was not involved in supporting 
13 paramilitary commando raids to thd sh0rd of Cuba, is that 
1 4 correct?

an organization?

Mr. Halh.y. No. The FBI did not train any CIA p~rsonnel 
during my tenure in the Miami Station. 
Mr. Baron. Did the FBI at any point provide with you 
links to people who had gamblinq interests inside Cuba? 
Mr. Halley. No. We cover~d the 9ambling thiner previously.
