of the idea that academics be off limits, period, and students 
in order to protect the integrity of our entire academic 
community, and it is the realization that if we continued to

close the possibilities 1·for recruitment, and the adverse

I . 
we ought to announce that, that that ought to be one of the 
purposes so stated in the grant to start with, while we are 
likely to get an education, ·it is also likeli if we can we
