at this particular time~. According to his own report 
of his position at this meeting, 
Mr. Gray pointed out that it would be 
unwise to mount any kind of an operation 
without the determination to see it 
through and that. an abortive effort would 
be worse than,no effort at all. He there­
fore thought that if this backup force 
was essential to ultimate success, full 
consideration should be given to it at 
this stage in the planning .. Mr. Dulles 
again urged:that a decision on this be 
deferred.* 91/ 
In support of Mr. Gray and in some contradiction 
to Mr. Bissell's view that perhaps the Cuban PM force 
would be able to carry off .the effort without any out­
side help, the President was reported to have indicated 
that 
He would go along so long as the.Joint 
Chiefs, Defense, State, and CIA think we 
have a good chance of being successful. 
He wouldn't care much about this kind of 
cost [the $10 million inc~ease not~d 
earlier]; indeed, he said he would de­
fend this kind of action against all . 
comers and that if we could be sure of 
freeing the Cubans from this incubus, 
• $25 million m:i.ght be a small price to pay. 
* In light of today's relations between the United 
States and other of the major 'world powers with the 
third countries, Gordon·Gray displayed -- in the 
.summer of 1960 --· a degree of foresight with which 
he has never been property credited. For he .noted 
at that time that if the US failed to deal firmly 
with Cuba, there was an obvious danger that other 
small nations would be encouraged to undertake harass­
ments of the major powers. 92/
