Until now, nothing. 
Asked if VACILIO had called. 
Said, no, only SOLORAZANO called saying 
it was not possible for him to send the note 
because of a problem. For major reasons it 
was not possible that day; maybe not until 
M:mday. If he wishes to speak with him, he 
will be at 21-35-70 until one in the afternoon. 
Correct. 
Said that NELA just called to give her the 
news of Kennedy's death and the wounding of 
his brother; that it happened in Texas. Asked
