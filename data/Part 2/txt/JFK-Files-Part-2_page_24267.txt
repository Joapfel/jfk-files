of some 26 CIA-owned companies. In cotmtry locations where 
physical contact with the nearest CIA.station is not operationally 
discreet, proprietaries can provide pay outlets and other adminis­
trative services for CIA personnel and agents. On occasion, firms 
based in locations with permissive corporate laws and regulations 
-- Liechtenstein, Panama, Delaware -- can engage in many activities 
unrelated to their charters. For example, insurance firms can 
acquire real estate surrounding targeted embassies on a non-attri­
buted bas is. 
4) Actual conduct of covert a·ction. In establishing the 
"radios" (Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty) in the 1950's, 
CIA acquired a means of directly influencing populations behind 
the Iron Curtain. These, of course, were eventually disposed of 
and placed under the aegis of the Department of State, but related 
enterprises, such as the book distribution program, which had 
operated under radio sponsorship, continued within the Agency frame­
work. 
5) Outlets for private investment. The Agency would deny 
that this is a 'Q_tirpose of proprietai::ies. Agency officials state 
that the standing policy is to prohibit the investment of operational 
funds of the CIA into private fields without explicit DCI authoriza­
tion. Actually, ·the existence of proprietary enterprises which, 
on occasion, return sizable profits, affirms that private investment 
has indeed been a widespread Agency policy. Moreover, the Agency 
specifically has authorized MHMUTUAL to act as an institutional in­
vestor for its own and any other Agency proprietary. So the question 
really is one of definition and shading.
