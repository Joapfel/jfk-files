could be subpoenaed for this purpose for open or closed testimony. 
Q: During the course of these investigations did you ever alter or fabricate 
any document previously prepared? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you know of such having been done in the Atlanta Office? 
A: No. 
Q,: Do you know of a tape recording pertaining to King which was sent to 
Mrs. King? 
A: Not during that period. It seems I might have heard such an allegation 
but there has been so much material news media wise the past year or two, 
I actually cannot be sure whether I read of such an allegation or might have 
heard it said. Ih any case so far as I am concerned it was hearsay. 
Q: What was your participation in. COINTELPRO investigations and what did 
they cover while you were in the Atlanta Office? 
A: I left the Bureau over four years ago and have absolutely no knowledge of 
what might be the present status of any investigation by the Bureau past or 
present. I feel very strongly that any answer I might give could conceivably 
adversely effect the Bureau's investigative position. For this reason I de­
cline to discuss this matter. 
Siedel stated the Bureau had recently stated it had discontinued COINTELPRO. 
The writer advised he was not aware of this; that his answer above remained the 
same. 
Q: Do you know of any effort by the Bureau to influence a political campaign? 
A: No.
