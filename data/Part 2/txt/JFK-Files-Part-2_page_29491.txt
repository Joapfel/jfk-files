A cable reporting Lee Oswald's contac{ with the 
.I 
Soviet Embassy was written and sent to Headquarters by 
Ms. Manell on l.O/8/63. Various reasons have been ad­
vanced to explain the seven day delay -iri sending this 
cable. David Phillips explained the delay by·saying 
that 'Mr. Manel 1- was too busy to be bothered by ·something -

Mr. Manellwas a busy mari, sometimes pro~ 
crastinating. His wife wa~ working for 
him, ~nd on one or t~o:occasions I spoke 
to Mr. Manelf kiddingly saying, h·ey, where 
is the ·cable about.His fellow, -or something 
like.that, or maybe to his wife. I am not 
sure_. In any event, what happened a few· 
days passed and Mrs. Manelt prepared a . 
message--she Was wor~ing for her husband,. 
and as· I recall it).ste typed it herself, 
but I am not positive on that point, but 
in any event, she prepared the cable ... 
and took it to Mr. M,nell at which time he -<rn..,,· 
signed off on it. Dt ring that process, it/ ) 
did come to me, also to sign offj because 
it spoke ~bout Cuban matters, and then went 517 
to the Chief of Station a·nd was released . .s.+:f/ ·-
A bl ind CIA memorand1,m entitled "Delay in sending 
the first cable about Oswalc" was located in a soft file 
on the.Unidentified Man pho1.ograph. This ~emorandum as-· 
serts that Dave Phillips ."d·dn't know what he was talking. 
about." The memorandum's ai s~rtion is correct. Mr. Manel
