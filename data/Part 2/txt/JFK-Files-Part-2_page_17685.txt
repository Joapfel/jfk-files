a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75. . \1. \ ,r 
' ' The concept behind the establishment of this Proje{- °"· 
is to develop a capability of implementing requests received 
from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and 
timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct 
its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible. 
We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to 
meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the 
exception tjf the research that will have to be done in the 
substantive Divisions. 
While the Project will direct internal work and 
related liaison with the intelligence community and the 
White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Offic~ _.~ 
of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary 
point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the 
Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all 
responses to these Committees. In addition, they will meet 
with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness 
of requests. If necessary, they will call upon the expertise 
of the substantive Division for determination as to whether 
a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to 
within a reasonable period of time and within the capabilities
