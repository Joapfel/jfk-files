Now, I read that as Helms' position being that the 
assassination of Schneider was something which presented the 
opportunity for the very thing that the U.S. wished to have 
done. 
Do you agree with me? 
Mr. Phillips. No, I can't agree with you on that. I am 
not sure about the suggestion from the language. But I will 
tell you the immediate reaction in our little task force when 
the word came that Schneider was dead, that is it, it is finish c 
Knowing Chileans, the moment that that violence occurred, 
Chileans, with the possible exception of a nut such as 
Marshall, immediately said,this is it, that is enough. There 
was still that tradition over the years. And I think that the 
moment we heard of it and we discussed it we said, that is 
it, there will be no more. In many countries in Latin America 
that would have been the signal for further action, weakness, 
and so forth. But in this case it was the end of the 
business. 
Mr. Schwarz. I want to run through with you the activi~ 
ties which were being undertaken with the Valenzuela group 
and with the Viaux group. In the case of Viaux, was that one 
of the assignments that the false flag officers had? 
Mr. Phillips. Yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. And in the case of Valenzuela, was that 
one of the assignments that had?
