representative of a foreign government ·preposed to me 
that I participate in an act; suc_h act being a criminal 
offense and inimical to the best interest of the United 
States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May 
1963, another representative of the same foreign govern­
ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I 
agreed to such a proposal. 11 . 
"In September 1963, I was informed by an American, 
• known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government, 
that arrangements for my participation in the afoi-ementioned 
act were completed. At that time, I refused the 'aforesaid 
proposal. . 
Approximately one week later, I was. instructed by this 
same person to either participate as previously agreed 
or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be 
disclo;-eci to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There­
.upon, I agreed to .follow the instructions of this person; 
although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation 
actuated my conduct of September·20, 1963, for whis:h I 
was arrested and am presently charged. • •
