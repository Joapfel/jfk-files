Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald. 
And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations 
Group. 
Q Now, was this a special group within the ODO or was 
it attached to one of the area divisions? 
A No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing 
called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And 
thac -- when Harvey left, he went to i2hie:f ·of· Sta ticin • Rome :-~~< . ·' - ,, - , , -
and Fitzgerald took over; ic became Special Activities Staff. 
It wasn't attached to anything except -- it rep6rted to the 
Deputy Director, Plans. 
Q And that was Mr. Karamessines? 
A \'.es. \'/ell, it was Helms at that time back when it 
was first cre~ted. Helms was DDP at that time. 
Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the 
Bay of Pigs? 
A :'/ell, not immediately. I think sometime around --
.in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in 
September, something like that, 1961. 
Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities 
Staff? 
A Special Activities Staff and consequently became the 
Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went 
back into the Western Hemisphere Division.
