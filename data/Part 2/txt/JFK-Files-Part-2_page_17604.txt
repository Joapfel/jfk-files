Previous interpretatio;is which have been furnished to you 
as to what may constitute trespass i.'1 the installation of microphones, 
suggest that the views expressed have beon tentative in nature and 
have attempted to prec:i.ct the course which courts would follow 
rather tjlon reflect the present state of t.he law. It is realized 
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection 
with the installati.on of a microphone. 'l'he question of whether a 
trespass is actually :i..uvolved and the second question of the effect 
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus 
obtained, mus.t necessru.·ily be resolved according to the cir.ct1mstances 
or' each case~ The Topa.rtment in resolving the problems which rnay arise 
in connection with the use of microphone surveilla'1ce wilt rev:i.ew the 
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities 
of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected. 
It is my opinion that the DepartDent should adopt that interpretation 
,~hich will permi.t mj_crophone coverage by the FBI" in a manner most 
conduc:i.ve to our national interest~ I recognize that for the FBI 
to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of
