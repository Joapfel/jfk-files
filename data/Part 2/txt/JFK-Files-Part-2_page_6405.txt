~=:]ri;::riefmg, send each Boord m,®e::::ra::, a lette,:kh expn,~ 
mentions that they have anlobligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to \\ 
publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified 
information. This approacfi, would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this 
obligation (which we would 1be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy 
agreements). Again, we bli!ff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing. 
I 
6. Ask Board meJbers and staffers to sign secrecy agreements on their way out. This option 
could be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board. member to sign it (there exist no 
sanctions for not signing), ti/though Board staffers have indicated they would support this approach. 
Generally speaking, a secr~y agreement signed on the eve of separation from.government service would 
be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to Board 
member$ N staffers, and t~erefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to esiablish a 
binding contract). Howevet, in this case, if the agreement was modified to indicate that it merely reduced 
to writing understandings which had been previously agreed to by the Board, we would have a strong 
argument the agret:1ment wks legally binding. Of course, this option would alert the Board to the fact that 
we do. not have any secrecy agreements previously signed by the Board. Even if the Board agrees to sign 
new secrecy agreements b~fore they disband, nothing would preclude them from disputing the 
enforceability of the agreerilents at a later date. 
I 
6. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the 
mid-19B0's, that appears td, permit the DC/ to write a regulation to protect intelligence sources and 
methods by requiring prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel who 
have served in positions of ~pecia/ trust and have been given access to CIA information. The regulation 
would be signed by the DC/, and promulgated immediately. Then the Board would be briefed on their 
responsibilities and obligatit,ns under the regulation. Of course, nothing would preclude the Board from 
disputing the validity of such a regulation at a later date. 
. I 
None of the above 'options guarantee success. However, I have discussed these options with 
I 
Dawn Eilenberger, and we believe that Option #_ is the best approach to take. O/M concurs. Please let 
me know how we should proceed, since our last chance t0 deal with the Board as a group will be at their 
23 September meeting.--=--=~LI =-=-=-=-=-=-=-~-::-::-::-::~~~~=======--=~-=~~=~~-=-=.:-=~~-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--c
