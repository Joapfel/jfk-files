1. Venezuela a. The country's six presiden­
tial ·candidates have swung into the 
home stretch of their campaigns. 
So have the terrorists, who are still 
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's 
vote. 
b. There is little doubt that 
the terrorist .effort has all-out 
• Cuban support. Castro looks on 
Venezuela as his prime target in 
Latin America and would'do everything 
in his power to prevent President 
Betancourt from finishing his term, 
c, So far, the terrorists have 
tried to intimidate the candidates. 
by harassing political rallies, bomb­
ing their party headquarters in 
various cities, and threatening them 
with assassination. They have tried 
to scare voters from the polls by 
creating a general atmosphere of law­
lessness. Kidnappings, like the one 
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault, 
are part of the pattern. 
d. The government counterattack 
is under the personal direction of 
Betancourt, who is as determined to 
finish out his term and turn over 
power to a freely-elected successor 
as Castro is to prevent this.
