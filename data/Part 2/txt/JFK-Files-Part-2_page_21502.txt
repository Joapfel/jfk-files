Cuba ________ 
CCUHRENCE: With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale' s memorandum to S1'1\ dated 14 Nov. 
1962 Harvey states: 111'he statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on 
this operation since early October was patently false. ·specific refer«:!nces made to the 
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale I s .memorandtun concerning a report for the CIA which he 
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirhl)atrick. This refers to 
a telephonic-conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever 
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu. 
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his 
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandIBn. 
During this conversation the s no discussion of previous operations except a brief 
discussion of the COBRA and earns and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's 
recollection, any specific s concerning assets inside or prior operations which 
SOURCE: would logically have !eel to th~_ <liscussions at the tlmr STAf'F: 
of the Matahambre operation." •
