specific areas:

11~ FBI Internal Security Int~lligence Ope~ations : 
The Committee seeks to de·termine the nature 
and purpose of FBI intelligence operations 
directed at foreign intelligence activities 
and subversive or exlremist activities within 
the United States. It has been alleged that 
the scope of FBI intelligence investigations 
is too broad and has extended to legitimate 
political activities .. Consequently, the Com­
mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili­
ties have been defined. 
Responsible staff: Senior staff 
Task Force leader 
Mark Gitenstein 
2. The FBI and the U.S. Intelligence Communit~ 
The Committee seeks to determine what have 
been the policies and procedures for coordina­
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the 
U.S. intelligence community. There have been 
occasions ih the past where friction between 
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious 
dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence 
com.munity. The purpose of this inquiry is to 
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co­
ordinating mechanisms.
