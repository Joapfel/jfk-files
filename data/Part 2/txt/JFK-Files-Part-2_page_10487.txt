into the US labor situation, and particularly to try 
to ameliorate the quarrel between George hleany-and 
Wal tcr Reuther. E)ci'\-36 steered a very skillful 
course in this connection, but the Agency could be 
vulnerable to charges that we went behind :\!eany 's back, 
or were somehow consorting with Reuther against Meany's 
wishes. 
8. There are three examples of using Agency 
funds which I know to be controversial. On.e was the 
expcndi turc of money under Project :,IOSES in securing 
the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners. Details of 
this qper8. tion arc best known to Larry Houston, iv,ike 
Miskovsky IDEN-131 , and J·ar1:c~ S1)1ith. Second, 
as you well know, when Lou Concin received his summons 
to report to the Joint General Staff Headquarters on 
1 Nover,1bcr 19G3 a large amount of cash went with hir.1. 
My impression is that the accounting for this and its 
use has never been very frank or complete. Third, at 
one of the early Special Group meetings attended by 
McCone he took strong except ion to propo::;a ls to spc-nd 
Agency funds to improve the economic viability of West 
Berlin, nnd for an investment pro;ram in :.I::-i.li. His 
general position was thnt such expenditures were not 
wi thii1 the· Agency_' s charter, and that he would all9w 
such spending-only on the direct pcr~onal request of 
the Secretary cf State or the Secretary of Defense, or 
t\!c White House. 
9. I raise these issues of funding because I 
remember the Agency's beirtg severely criticized by the 
House Appropriations Subcommittee for having spent $3,000 
for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors 
to secure the release of prisoners fro~ Cuba. 
10. Under the heading bf old business, I know that 
any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried 
about the fact that conversations within the offices and 
o~er the telephones were transcribed. During hlcCone's
