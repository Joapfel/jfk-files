BY--
I, C. Dougla~ Dillon, being first duly sworn, do upon oath 
depose and state: 
.From June 1959 until early January 1961, I served as Under 
Secretary of Stat~- During approximately 35-40 percent of 
that time, I served as Acting Secretary of State because of 
Secretary Herter's absence from Washington~ 
Secretary Herter, who preceded me as Under Secretary of State, 
had served as the State De·partment representative on the 54/12 
Committee, a predecessor of the present Forty Committee. When 
I became Under Secretary, the President asked me to retain my 
earlier responsibilities for foreign economic policy. Accord­
ingly, the Number 3 position in the Department.of State was 
designated as Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Robert 
Murphy was appointed to this position and took over the State 
Department's responsibilities on the 54/12 Committee. 
Because of the frequency of my service as Acting Secretary 0£ 
State, I was kept regularly informed of important 54/12 Com­
mittee decisions. On occasion I met with the 54/12 Committee 
and participated in its deliberations~ • ' 
During this entire period I have no recollection of any dis­
cussions or decisions looking toward the assassination of 
either Generalissi~o Trujillo or Prime Minister Castro. 
On one occasion in late July or early August.of 1960, shortly 
after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington, I attended a meet­
ing in the Pentagon at wl1ich the overall Congo problem was dis­
cussed. During the discussion, Which covered a great variety 
of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding the 
possibility of an assassination attempt against LUrnumba was 
briefly raised. The CIA representative indicated that the Agency 
did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended considera­
tion of·this subject. With this one exception I never heard any 
discu.ssion of assassination. attempts against anyone. 
Dated this 2 / day of May, 19.7 5.
