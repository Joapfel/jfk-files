there is a low level of confidence in the original estimate. There is also 
some question in our minds as to the adequacy of the information as to the num­
ber of Soviets newly arriving. Admittedly, there could have been undetected 
arrivals at smaller ports, where it is known that cargo ships have repeated 
their prior practice of unloading at night under conditions of strict Soviet­
imposed security. Since night photographic methods were not employed, we 
have little knowledge of what happened in these cases. In any event, as the 
matter stands at the writing of this report, the intelligence community does 
not believe it yet has sufficient concrete evidence to estimate any reduction 
in overall Soviet military capability on the Island. There is no evidence 
that any of the combat troops associated with the four armored groups have 
been withdrawn. 
C. Summary of Threat Arising from Soviet Presence' in Cuba 
Our summary of the threat and potential threat which the Soviet presence 
in Cub,a ~ presents to the Americas is as follows: 
l. Cuba is an advanced Soviet base for subversive, revolutionary and 
agitational activities in the Western Hemisphere and affords the opportunity 
to export agents, funds, arms, ammunition and propaganda throughout Latin 
America. 
2. Assuming without deciding that all strategic weapons have been 
withdrawn, there is the ever-present possibility of the stealthy re-introduc­
tion of strategic missiles and other offensive weapons, using the Soviet 
' 
forces still in Cuba as camouflage and security for the activity. 
3. Cuba serves as an advance intelligence base for the USSR., 
4. The potential exists to establish electronic warfare capabilities 
based on Cuba.
