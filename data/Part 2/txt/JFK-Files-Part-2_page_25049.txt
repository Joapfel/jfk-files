little different view of this. I think he had a view that 
the press looked on the President as someone who was not in 
full charge of the State DeparG~ent at time, and he thought 
this would contribute to that, which would be very bad for 
the President. So we were thinking of it_more from the 
international aspect. We had the contrary feeling. 
Mr. Baron. Did the President's trust in Allen Dulles 
diminish significantly after the U-2 affair. 
Mr. Dillon. No, because there was nothing wrong with the 
U-2 affair, except that tl-le President had authorized it 
specifically, it was flying on the day after he authorized it. 
The only bblix that came was in the after events, where this 
silly press release announcement was put out by NASA, I guess 
it was, that this plane had just been sort of flying around anl 
got lost, or something like that. And we really had a very 
difficult time about that at the morning meeting where the 
n2,vs came to us, which was out in the Virginia hills. The 
President hac.:. a meeting of a restricted nature afterwards, 
including me and Allen Dulles, the Secretary of Defense, and 
Colonel Goodpastor. 
And he put me in charge of handling the whole thing, and 
I 
gave me the responsibility. And he wasn't fully briefed on 
all the cover stories or anything of this nature. And I 
went back to the State Department and was working diligently 
on this and talking to Mr. Dulles as to what we would say.
