not practical, set forth circumstances and request Bureau au­
thority to make contact at home or place of business explain­
ing any need to contact employer. Letter should.contain state­
ment that, if subject appears cooperative, arrang_emen·ts ,·rill 
be made for another interview at secure place away from resi­
dence or employment, if necessary, to determine fully _degree of 
cooperation. •w • •

may be had without Bureau authority. No limitation on number 
of recontacts, but use good judgment. If fnterview authorized 
by Bure~u, advise Bureau of results of contact and plans for

Bureau. Questions should require· admission or denial by subject 
of all pertinent items of subversive information unless to do

tion insofar as potential dangerousness is concerned when subject 
fails to admit or verify subversive information obtained through 
previous investigation.

nished if needed in Federal proceedings.

must be submitted promptly in report or LHM, depending on 
priority designation, until he begins to cooperate as security 
informant or source.
