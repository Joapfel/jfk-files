Due to reports of popular unrest, political strife, and economic disruptions 
Cuba, it was suggested that the Special Group Augmented consider the value of 
an SNIE on Cuba made in the immediate future. 
For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial 
radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba." The Navy states that the new 
area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They 
will take place arotn1d_the_end_oL.the month. No proposals for actions by the Depar_tment ___ _ 
of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative, 
Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.
