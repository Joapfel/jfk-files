The so-called amagic bullet" or •singl.e bulleC-'!_.cheoey.--has been-the.-JanJ.b.ject 
of intense debate. See, e .. g., Edward Jay Epstein, Inquest: The Warren Commission 
and the Establishment of Truch 115-26 (1966) (criticidng. the single buil,et 
theory as based on a "misinterpretation• of ballistics testimony~ the· 11extremely 
cenuous findings of the wound ballistics_ test," and the omission of conflicting 
testimony); Marshall Houts, Where Death Delights~ The Story of D,r. Milton 
Helpern and Forensic Medicine 6.2-63 (1967) (concluding that a single bullet 
could not have penetrated seven layers of •tough human skin• in addition to soft 
tissue and. bones); Hurt, supra note 6, at 61-86 (arguing that result.a. of the 
speccrographic examination and neutron activity analysis did not support the 
single .bullet theory); Michael Kurtz, Crime o! t.he Century 175-76, 180•81 (1982) 
(criticizing the single bullet theory in light of the condition o1: the bullet 
and the deficiencies in the neutron activity analysis tests); Lane, supra note 
6, at 69-80 (concluding that the angles of impact and the condition of the 
bullet found at Parkland Hospital invalidated the single bullet theory), Raymond 
Marcus, The Bascard suilet: A search for Legicimacy for Commission Exhibit 399, 
1-77 (1966) (concluding that bullet 399 •was never fired at any human targeca 
and that che bullet was "planted" on the hospital stretcher); Marrs, supra note

the single bullet theory), Sylvia Meagher, Accessories After t.he Fact: The 
Warren Commission, the Authorities, and t.he Report 27-35, 137, 167•70, 461 
(1967) (concluding that the single bullet cheery is weak because, ot the three 
doctors whose testimony supports the theory, one retracted his original opinion, 
t.he second qualified his testimony, and the third was never s~own the Zapruder 
film or the stretcher bullet); Bona:r Menninger, Mortal Error: The Shoe That
