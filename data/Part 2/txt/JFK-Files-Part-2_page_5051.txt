MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM TALKING TO 
AMERICANS, AND NAMED C/O'S DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP WHOM HE HAD 
MET THROUGH J/1. 
3. DURING THE CONVERSATION, j/1 SAID HE HEARD AN AUDIBLE 
"CLICK" WHICH HE IS SURE WAS THE SOUND OF A TAPE RECORDER 
SHUTTING OFF. J/1 SAID HE IGNORED THE SOUND, BUT BOTH HIS HOST 
AND HOSTESS WERE SHOCKED.BY THE NqISE. J/1 SAID THAT ACEVEDO 
SEEMED·TO BE ALL BUSINESS THAT EVENING, ASKING QUESTIONS AND 
LEADING THE CONVERSATION. WHEN J/1 PHONED HIM ON 13 SEP WITH A 
PHONE.NUMBER HE HAD REQUESTED, ACEVEDO SEEMED TENSE. ON 15 
SEP, ACEVEDO CAME BY TO SEE J/1 AT HIS OFFICE, AGAIN REFERRING 
TO HIM AS HIS BROTHER. ACEVEDO WAS BACK TO HIS PREVIOUSLY 
FRIENDLY SELF AND ASKED J/1 WHAT HE WAS DOING OVER THE WEEKEND 
AND J/1 SAID HE WAS VERY BUSY. J/l'S IMPRESSION IS THAT HE WAS 
BEING TESTED AND THAT HE PASSED THE TEST. C/O SAID SHE WOULD 
CONSULT THE WASHINGTON EXPERTS AND ADVISE J/1 AT.NEXT MEETING 
WHICH IS. SCHEDULED FOR 1500 ON 24 SEP. WOULD APPRECIATE HQS 
COMMENTS PRIOR TO THAT MEETING. 
4. DURING THE MEETING, ACEVEDO TOLD J/1 THAT HE WANTED THE 
BIBLE FOR HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS CATHOLIC. HE SAID T~T 
PREVIOUSLY, PARTY MEMBERS COULD NOT BE RELIGIOUS AND REMAIN 
PARTY MEMBERS. HOWEVER; THINGS HAD LIBERALIZED TO THE POINT 
WHERE HE COULD NOW HAVE A BIBLE. (J/1 DID ADMIT THAT HE FORGOT 
TO ASK WHY, IF THINGS WERE MORE LIBERAL NOW, ACEVEDO COULD NOT 
GET HIS OWN BIBLE FROM cuBA.) 
5. J/1 SAID THAT BASED ON HIS ASSESSMENT OF ACEVEDO, 
STATION WOULD NOT GET FAR WITH HIM USING OFFICIAL AMERICANS. 
HE SAID HOWEVER, THAT A SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN INTERESTED 
IN TRADE IN CUBA (SPECIFICALLY IMPORT/EXPORT) WOULD BE OF 
INTEREST TO ACEVEDO AS HE HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN LEAVING 
THE GOVERNMENT AND INVOLVING HIMSELF IN BUSINESS DEALINGS. J/1 
ASSESSES ACEVEDO AS BEING INTERESTED IN MONEY (HENCE THE 
INTEREST IN BUSINESS), BUT STILL RETAINING'AN .INTEREST IN 
POLITICS. C/O TOLD J/1 THAT STATION A,ND HQS STILL HAD AN 
INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF ACEVEDO'S PERSONALITY AND THAT HE SHOULD 
CONTINUE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT. C/O AGAIN TRIED THE PLOY OF 
HAVING J/1 WRITE A LETTER TO C/O DESCRIBING ACEVEDO AS IF C/O 
HAD NEVER MET HIM. J/1 SAID HE WOULD TRY TO DO THAT. 
' ' 
6. STATION ASSESSMENT OF THESE RECENT EVENTS IS TWOFOLD. 
IT IS LIKELY THAT ACEVEDO HAS REPORTED HIS CONTACT WITH C/O'S 
DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP. IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THAT A SECURITY 
OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT ACEVEDO CONFIRM HIS VERSION OF THE 
CONTACT WITH THE SOURCE OF THE CONTACT., J/1. THE· EVENT$ OF 9 
SEP WOULD SUPPORT THIS THEORY, ESPECIALLY THE OBVIOUS AGENDA 
AND THE SHOCK AT THE MIX-UP WITH THE TAPE RECORDER (THIS IS NOT 
A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTING A TEST.) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY 
IS THAT THIS WAS A TEST FOR J/1, A SORT OF VETTING EXERCISE. 
SINCE ACEVEDO CAME BACK TO J/i.AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IT 
WOULD APPEAR THAT J/1 PASSED THE TEST. THE QUESTION REMAINS AS 
TO WHO WAS ABLE TO REVIEW THE TAPE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF 
SECRET
