ATTACHMENT 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
TSD hc3:s had a close working relationship with the FBI over 
the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has 
been fully briefed on TSD audio techniques and equipment. The 
follo\ving are situations where T~D equipment and guidance were 
involved in operations: 
(A) Identity 59 - Four masked transmitters were 
installed. Two have failed and two remain workable. 
(B) Identity 60 - A TSD built masked transmitter 
was-installed to collect emanations from a crypto­
graphic machine. The system continues to function 
when samples of the emanations are needed. 
(C) Identity 61 - Two transmitters have been 
installed and are operating. One is specifically 
designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the 
other is a straight audio transmitter to collect con­
versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening 
post. A third system is not oper-
ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape 
made from this roo1n was made ·by the _National 
Security Agency befort" failure. 
(D) Identity 62 - TSD furnished equipment and con-
sultation covering Identity 62 
First masked switched trans­
~itters were used in t\vo apartments used as tempor- • 
ary quarters. Later masked s-..vitched transmitters 
and microwave transmitters were installed in the 
permanent quarters along with 1nic and wire installa­
tions., entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install­
ation is not fully operational because the full comple­
ment of personnel have ·not yet arrived.
