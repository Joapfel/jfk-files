' 
Taken by itself, this course-of action might :xi:aise doubts 
concerning the inter-American legal basis under which we are 
continuing our surveillance. 
Psychologically, if tois were the only action taken, it would 
appear as though the OAS considered the crisis over, the presence 
of Soviet troops unimportant-, and its principle of verification 
surrendered (on-site inspection and re-introduction of offensive 
weapons) • 
(4) Combine (2) and ('3). 
Considerations: 
. This combination of actions is feasible,-and is likely to 
obtain unanimity or near-unanimity. 
The termination'of the COAS/OC makes strong language in the 
resolution more acceptable to the "soft 10 minority. 
Termination of the OOAS/OC, even accompanied by the proposed 
resolution, is.open to some of the criticism indicated under (3). 
'Much of this could be mitigated if, however, the action is accom­
panied by the action suggested in (9), which imposes economic 
sanctions. 
(5) Seek to enlarge the basis on which the Rio Treaty was 
invoked to enco ence of Soviet troo sand seek a 
.resolution in C for their withdrawal. 
Considerations: 
With adequate consultation and preparation, we should be abl_e 
to obtain a substantial majority. 
Such action would'.give a better basis for urging such addi­
tional steps as (6) and (7) and. (8). 
It would seem undesirable to take this course by itself unless 
we seriously contemplate taking some additional strong enforcement 
action. 
(6) In addition to (5), seek authorization under the Rio 
Treaty for collective action, including the use of armed force, 
to bring about the withdrawal of soviet troops in Cuba if the 
OAS call is not heeded. 
Considerations:
