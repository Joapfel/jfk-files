of aircraft to be employed from those 
. available be fi~ly resisted. 
3. That the ,operation be abandoned if 
policy does 'not provide for use of adequate 
tactical air support. ' • 
In order to insure the success of both the air 
strike and the air drop operations which would pro­
vide the logistical support for the troops holding 
the lodgment on Cuban soil, Hawkins urged, as he had 
in the past, authorization for the use of contract 
American pilots, the use of the airfield at Puerto 
Cabezas as an advance strike base, and the use of air 
bases in the United States for the. launching of 
logistical flight operations~* 31/ 
Much the same ground indicated in Hawkins memo­
randum was rehashed in preparing Mr. Barnes and the 
DCI for a Special Group meeting of 5 January 1961. 
* There is no indication that Hawkins ever changed 
his. attitude about the need for the introduction of 
. some US pilots into both the·strike and logstics 
air operations, even though his much quoted cable of 
13 April 1961 from Puerto Cabezas repeated the ~igh 
praise. for the.B-26 pilotswl:io were about to under­
take the D-2 air strike. See Volume I of the Official 
History of the. Bay of Pigs Operation, Air Operations, 
Part III, A for discussion of .the Hawkins cable in 
the context of the air operations.
