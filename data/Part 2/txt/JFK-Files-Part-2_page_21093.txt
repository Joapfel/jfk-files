As you are aware, James Angleton of CIA .frequently turns 
over to the Bureau on a highly confidential basis information which 
has been developsd through ope~ations headed by Angleton. In many 
instances the information is given to the Bureau without clearing 
through regular CIA channels. In almost all instances it is give·n 
to us with the clear understanding that if included in a rep6rt or 
other communication prepared for diss·emination outside the Bureau 
the information will be so Sf!_t forth that it cannot be traced back 
to either 'Angleto~I:{ CIA. • such instances where_ thw·nf.orma ion

from _him ou'tside the Bureau.Q 
~ .........._ : : In taking up such a matter with Angle tori last week it 
~ ~was determined· that he objected to attributing information which 
~ ~ he had furnished to "Confidential Informant T-2, an Agency of the 
-c:a '1~overnment·which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations." 
~ He pointed out that by describing T-2 as an agency of the Government 
which conducts personnel and intellige.nce investigations the Bureau 
was revealing to outside,agencies that the material did in fabt 
\I) come from another Government agency. ~ince the material related /':,. . 
~ to an individual u.1ho now resides innsrael_;JAngleton stated that, l S) 
~::~ in. his opinion, recipient agenc-ies c'r:ruld logically conclude that • 
~<:": the information had originated with CIA since such an individual 
,_·;;.::; would b.e under CIA jurisdiction insofar as investigations abroad 
fc; '-._)are.concerned. Angleton requested that the information merely 
C) i~.: be attributed to Confidential Informant T-2, who, in this instance, 
~!~~ could be described as being ~f known reliability.

c0 ,:-.l It ·is suggested that it would materially assist in the 
5 ;,rl· handling of information received from Angleton in· the future, if 
c~o the Liaison Section could work out a procedure whereby Angleton 
might be r~ferred to as a Bureau informant.This would permit the 
Supervisors receiving the Angleton material firsthand to transmit 
it to the field ·and advise the .field that the information in any 
report should be attributed to an informant with a temporary symbol 
number, which informant could be evaluated as having furnished in­
formati 9n of a reliable nature in the past. On the informant page 
the temporary symbol number: could be identified .by the reg.ul~ 
~u~eau symbol assig.ne'q),to Angleton.~~) c _[;fj-
