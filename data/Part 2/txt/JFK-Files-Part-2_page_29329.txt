relationship would have been at least partially responsible 
for reporting such a visit to Headquarters. 
Mr. Phillips was queried about whether, in such a case, 
it would have been routine for the Agency, station to take any 
action other than just reporting the information that had come 
to its attention. Mr. Phillips said that it could have happened 
in certain circumstances, such as if the contact looked as if 
he had recruitment potential or was a serious security case. 
In those instances it was possible that other actions would 
be taken. Mr. Phillips remembers one .such instance specifically 
and pointed out that it is ~elated in his book, Nightwatch, 
on pp. 126-128. This is·a story of an American military 
officer who offered to spy for the Cubans and an operation 
mounted against him by the Agency in Mexico. In response to 
a direct question Mr. Phillips acknowledged that the Station 
other than just reporting 
could, and often did, take actions/in regarcl. to Americans in 
Mexico that were in contact with Soviet or Bloc Embassies 
without a specific request from another interested agency; i.e., 
they often took investigative and operational action on their 
own initiative. Mr. Phillips said that the reason that the 
Station could do this was Mr. Scott's ranking (informal) in 
the agency. Mr. Phillips illustrated this point by sating 
that when Mr. Scott returned to Washington to report he did 
not go to the Chief of Western Hemisphere DiVision but directly 
to either the DCI or DDP. He pointed out that Scott had be~n 
a division chief himself prior to his assignment as Chief of 
Station in Mexico. COMMITTEE Sl::NSIT!VE
