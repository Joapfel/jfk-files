AFTER ·ACTION-REPORTS 
16. After the abortive exfiltration attempt by the M/V ADA, 
various relatives· of people involved began to ~e.ce.iYtL..te.l.e.phQ.ne calls 
and teleg;rams from Cuba reporti.ng___Qll t:hA arrest or safety of va;r;!,Q.US­
indivfavals. The=-=following excerpts were taken from various BARR cablt 
and debriefings of .Romelia LOPEZ Sosa and AMLE0-3: 
A. On 13 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 visited Tomas RODRIGUEZ 
Fuentes, of 1021 Margaret Street, Key West, former Captain with the 
National Police in Havana who had received a telegram from his daughtei 
Elsa OLIVERA, at 0920 hours 13 May 1964. (She was supposed to have co1 
out with BLANCO and AMllIG-4 in the ex:filtration). The telegram stated 
(English translation) "Congratulations, we are well, love to all, 
embrace. Your daughter.", and supposedly indicated the daughter was 
safe. 
B. On 14 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 was told by Daniel RODRIGUE' 
Santos that Valentin BLANCO, relati.~_qf_Armando BLANCO-LQrenzo, had 
received thre~-te"legrams from Cuba: the first on 10 May stated 
"Armando arrived all is well" , the second on 11 May stated, "Armando 
departed, all is well"; and the third on 13 May stated, "Yesterday's 
li1 
cable no good, Armando admitted or hospitalized", meaning j\rmando 
BLANCO had been picked up by Cuban authorities. - • ...

C. On 14 May 1964, AMLEO-.~-__Q~lled the C/0 and informed 
him that the 14 year old son of Mario REMIS (see para 3 A above) had 
called his father in Miami at 1130 hours that same date, and told him 
he had been arrested along with his mother and some ot~er_p~ppJ~__whi!e 
trY,ing__:tQ__leave-cuoa, and tnarthe police had let the children free, 
but continuea--:r-onold the adults under arrest. Reportedly only 
one car had, been picked up near the exfiltration point, and the people 
in the other two cars had supposedly escaped arrest for the time being

GENERAL COMMENTS ·ON·TRIP ·OF ·THE ·M/V ·ADA 
17. As noted ~n paragraph 8 of refe;r:'ence J, ~arious operational 
inconsistencies still exist in the ac~i.t..te.g __ ~QQY~Lr.e __ the 
exfiYtration trip of the M7V ADA to Cuba. WAVE is of the opinion 
that-some-o-f-t-hes-e-i-nconsi:-s-te1rcre~canbe attributed to genuine con­
fusion of facts by the principal source of information~ Rogelio LOPEZ 
Sosa, (who did not see the infiltration team of BLANCO and AMBIG-4 
again after their infiltration inland), and the wi.thho.l.d.!_gg of facts 
by AMLE0-3 who c~~ iders_.:thi§ __ acti v...it ~_was-his_own_per.s.ona r-·bus·1 nessr 
aii~ad-iiothing~to do with KUBARK. Danie 1 RODRIGUEZ Santos is 
proba6ly more knowledgeable of exactly what occurred during the infil­
tration, but due to.his illness AMSWIRL-1 was not able to interrogate 
him in Key West, and reportedly RODRIGUEZ is still very ill and 
KUBARK does not consider it worthwhile to attempt an interrogation 
of him at this time. It is also believed that RODRIGUEZ will withholc 
information he considers privileged, and it has been noted that 
AMLE0-31s principal organizer of the expedition, Ma;j,o RE~IS, has 
been visiting RODRIGUEZ daily in Mount Sinai hospital in Miami, Fla. 
Since the two infiltrees, BLANCO and AMBIG-4, are either under arrest 
or in hiding it is doubtful that their inside activities relative to 
AMLE0-3's family etco, will ever be completely clarified.' 
18. As noted in paragraph 9 of reference J, AMLE0-3 continues 
to look for methods whereby he may exfiltrate his family from Cuba, 
and has reached the point where he is no longer rational in his 
reasoning re the risk factors to himself or his family. AMLE0-3 is
