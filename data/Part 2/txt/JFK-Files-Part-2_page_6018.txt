personnel; he obtained sites for training and 
deployment, and he had primary responsible for 
day-to-day operations. AMWORLD was based in 
three locations. The AMWORLD propaganda. 
efforts were based in Costa Rico. The 
paramilltary efforts were run out of the 
Nicaragua base. The third base was located in 
Miami to service· AMWORLD requirements including 
the_collection of operational leads, servicing 
of dead drops and assisting in the vetting of 
AMWORLD perso.nnel." 
(C) Combs asked two follow up questions: Was_ part 
of the program to put in place a government in exile? 
W~s there ever a government in exile? IMS/ESG/HCS put 
these questions to LA and DO/IRO. The D0/IRO has 
provided the following additional write up, classified 
confidential: 
"(C) Based on file- reviews and recollect'ions 
from officers ihvolveq in the Cuban program, 
·there was never a Cuban Government in Exile. 
During the planning for the Bay of Pigs 
operation it was envisioned that after the 
invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and 
the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be flown 
to the area to establish a new Cuban Government. 
The invasion site-was never secured. 
(C) The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the 
failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after 
the release of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay 
of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was 
designed to support and unite several Cuban· 
exile groups under the control of Artime in an 
effort to enhance the cohesion of the exiles and 
augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda 
and paramilitary attacks against the Cuban 
mainland. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to 
foment a popular uprising in Cuba which could 
lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro. 
There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission even 
remotely came close to fruition and no evidence 
that a projected government in exile was ever 
considered as a viable option.''
