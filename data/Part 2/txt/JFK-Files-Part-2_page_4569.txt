then said that for the next two dinners he was going to have 
only two briefers and the briefing would be scheduled for 
fifteen minutes and that twenty minutes was the absolute 
maximum he :would sit still for. He said he wanted Mr. 
Rusk and Mr. McNamara to work this out together, with 
Mr. McNamara covering both the U. S. military and the 
Soviet military as covered by Mr. McCone, and Rusk 
covering the Soviet economy and the world roundup as 
covered by Rusk and McCone at the last hearing. I sub­
sequently checked with Bill Moyer to determine whether. 
• this was a change from the President's instructions to Mr. 
McCone or whether it might have been an oversight. Mr. 
Moyer stated that the President had given much thought to 
this and since Mr.· McCone would be away, he had changed 
the system to the one just enumerated. This makes abun­
dant sense to me under the circumstances and I considered 
any further discussion either with Moyer or the President 
inappropriate.

had to go out to dedicate a building. •

only to the Director upon his return .. Any actions indicated will 
be directed by me at the Monday morning meeting. I will send a 
very short, sanitized report of this meeting to Mr. McCone by 
cable.
