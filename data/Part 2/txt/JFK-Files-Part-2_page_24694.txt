WIROGUE only as .a CIA officer would "normally do ... when you 
.. 
speak in a derogatory manner of an asset." (Hedgman, 8/21/75,. 
p. 101) 
The Chief of Station maintained that WIROG1JE's proposition 
to QJWIN to join an "execution squad" could be attributed to 
WIROGUE's "freewheeling" nature. Hedgman said: 
I had difficulty controlling him in that he 
was not~ professional intelligenc~ officer 
as such. He seemed to act on his ovm without 
seeking guidance or authority ... I found 
he was rather an uriguided missile ... the 
kind of man that .could get you in trouble be­
fore you knew you were in trouble .... 
(Hediman, 8/21/75, pp. 96~97}. 
But Hedgman did not disavow all responsibility for WIROGUE's actions: 
[I]f you give a man an order and he carries it 
out and causes a problem for the Station, v,hy 
then as Chief of Station, well, you accept 
responsibility. (Hedgman,.8/21/75, p. 97.) 
In sum, the Chief of Station testified that despite the fact 
that the CIA was interested in the assassination of Lumumba during 
this period, ag~nt WIROGUE's attempt to form an "execution ·squad" 
was an unauthorized, maverick action, unconnected to the CIA assassi­
nation plan. 
Nonetheless, the fact that HIROCUE was to be trained in "medical 
immunization" (I.G. Hernorandum, J/ll~/75) raises the possibility 
that he was connected to the plot to assassinateLurnurnba by means 
of lethal l>iological substances. The 1975 report on WIROGUE's case
