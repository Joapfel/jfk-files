who could go abroad as bona fide leftists as reporting.mechanisms .. It was all 
targetted abroad. We never targetted it here in t~e United State~: I think 
the record of the Committee proves that, even the Rockefeller Commission or 
what have you. And this was something new, we'd never tried before on~ 
massive scale, and we worked very closely with the FBI on this. And most of 
the files we opened up. were names the FBI gave us with duplicate copies of 
what they had in their files on a lot of these Americans with leftists 
• leanings and what have you. The officer corps in the DDP didn't like it, 
thought we were. going beyond our charter, obviously thought we were trying to 
become a Gestapo, in effect, in the United States. And that was never the 
case. The appeals from various officers from various levels, and it was 
intensive argumentation, _both here and abroad, the ip~eals went up the line. 
There was no intention of trying to dampen down the arguments or the 
objections or the concerns. The appeals went up, n9t_once, but several times 
-- right up to Helms, the Director -- each and every time these things were 
examined again; looked at again, and orders came down to continue in terms of: 
our target is abroad, not the United States. Everything we are doing here has· 
... 
to be geared to something abroad. And we even changed procedures on a lot of 
this stuff .. It was tightly held information, the cables were tightly held, 
and MHCHAOS itself as an indicator. (The MH was just a digraph of the 
DDP-wide activity.) Everything wai done on special channels, special cabl~ 
channels, special pouch channels. It wasn't given wide distribution at all. 
Well, everyone knew the program was going on. We had many a staff meeting 
about this, DDP staff meetings. There was a lot of tension, no question about _ 
that. 
INTERVIEWER: And was the tension just with the young officers or. .?
