An article apneared in the March, 1972 issue of 
the "Liberated Guardiant', captioned "Women's Bail Fund; • 
Organizing Our Anger", written by five unidentified members 
of the Women's Bail Fund Collective. 
The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a 
group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women 
out of jail (150 so far). They have been organized for over 
a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20, 
1970. They have been active in supporting other groups 
involved in the prison struggle. They do legal follow-up 
for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking 
with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who 
the real enemies are, etcem:a." 
The article is introduced by the following 
statement: 
"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves. 
So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from 
as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these 
reflections in this article, using the words from their raps." 
The article, being reflections of the various 
members of the group, is a series of quotes by unidentified 
members concerning the WBF.
