WONAAC were j_ndependents and d~cided to resign publicly at

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance• 
at the afternoon session. According to one of the SWP • 
leaders, these women were frbm 31 states and three countries­
Canada, Italy anct·s~eden. The states that h~d more representation 
than others were Ohio, I1linois, New York, and Massachusetts. 
Most of the problems and differences between the 
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion 
law re-form. The SWP was charged with always having demonstra­
tions and rallies and never doing any work. through the legis­
lative process. 
The independents stated that they were tired of this 
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways 
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets. 
Afuer the independent 1;1omen publicly resigned in 
front of the plenary session) two other coordinators announced 
they wer•e staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's 
name is unknown. 
Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent 
women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC 
has d~bilitated the organization and most independent representa­
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion 
law change in organi~ations \•hlch have no connection with the 
SWP. 
The concern still exists, mwever, that WONAAC will 
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and
