COS did not recall agent QJWIN. He did recall that O'Donnell 
may have brought an asset into the Congo to help him. He said,

Congo in the fall of 1960, he must have known of QJWIN's activities. 
WIROGUE 
COS does not remember the true name of agent WIROGUE nor why 
or how he came to the Congo. When his recollection was refreshed 
by seeing cable traffid, COS said that WIROGUE was a difficult man 
to handle. For a short time, WIROGUE became a major in the Congolese 
Army. COS said that he had wanted ROGUE to pull together a sur­
veillance team. COS did not recall discussing WIROGUE with O'Donnell. 
COS's o~ly specific recollection is of being in WIROGUE's 
apartment and discussing an assassination squad. COS does not 
think that he mentioned the use of QJWIN in connection with this 
"execution squad." COS said that it was conceivable that he had 
approached WIROGUE with the idea of using him against Lumumba. 
But COS remembers he came to mistrust WIROGUE and felt that WIROGUE 
did not know what he was doing. COS also said it was unlikely 
that he would have sent the cable about WIROGUE's approach to 
QJWIN in ordinary CIA channels as he did if he thought this related 
to the actual assassination mission. Instead, it was merely 
evidence that WIROGUE was out of control.

was being held there. COS was in contact with various Congolese
