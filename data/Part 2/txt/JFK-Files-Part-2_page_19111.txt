The August, 1965, "Diploma tic List'" lists Yuri I. 
Bobrakov as a Second Secretary~ Soviet" Embassy, Washington, 
·n. c. 
I . • 
I' . A Confidential Source·advised on September 22, 
1965, that·on the preced~ng _d~y, h.~ had met with Bobrakov 
, and engaged in .conversation w1.th him. Sour~e stated. that 
Bobrakov seemed mainly to be. interested in getting across 
the idea that the propos_ed Multilateral· Forqe, (MLF) is a 
·bad idea and·is a stumbling block which is ,holding up agree­
ment at Geneva on disarmamento. He said further that Bobrakov 
expressed considerable concern over the danger of Germany's 
obtaining nuclear weapons. The Source said he pointed out 
to Bobrakov the unusual situation in which the United States 
·and the Soviet Union curr~ntly found themselves on the same 
side at the United Natiqo.s Secu.ri ty Council, ~ndeavorio.g. to 
keep· the peace. • • 
Bobrakov, . however, had no comment on this point. • 
Bobrak.ov told the Source that •his wife is an 
artist, wh~ µow has about twenty of her ·own paintings, most 
r of which she has done ~bile in the United States. 
• • .In th.e opin.ion of the Sourc1q., Bobrakov is not very 
•• suave or adept at conversation and may be somewhat uncomfort­
able in , ¢lealing _with Americans e Sou_rce also gained the im­
pression that Bobrakov's sense of AUmor is almost nonexistent. 
Source stated that Bobrakov attended a reception at 
the Embassy·· of Czechoslovakia on the evening of ~eptember 21, • 1965~ ~ • • ·
