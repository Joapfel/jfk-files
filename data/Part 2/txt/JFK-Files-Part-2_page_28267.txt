30TH ANO MARKET STREETS PHILADELPHIA. PA. 19101 
Serving the Greater Philadelphia and South Jersey Area 
to attend information seminars with my daughter, Sharon, at 
the three universities. As I told you, she plans to go to 
Georgetown, American or George Washington. 
If it's all right with you, I'd like to stop into 
the temporary offices of the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations when I'm down there. 
Meanwhile, best regards,
