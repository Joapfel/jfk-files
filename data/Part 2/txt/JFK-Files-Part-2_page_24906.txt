4. The Failure In Communication Between Agency Officials 
In Charge Of The Assassination Operations And Their Superiors 
In The Agency And In The Administration Was Due To: 
(a) The Failure bf Stibordinates To Disclos~ The 
Operations To Thei~ Superiors; and 
(b) The Failure of Superiors to Give Frecise Orders 
Regarding the Nature of Permissable Operations and to Make 
Clear That Assassination Was Precluded in the Climate of 
Violence Engendered by .the Aggressive Cove~t Actions 
Sanctioned by th~ Administrations. 
While we cannot find that officials responsible for 
making policy decisions knew about or authorized the assassina­
tion att_empts (with the possible exception of the Lumumba case), 
Agency operatives at least through the level of DDP neverthe­
less perceived assassination to have been permissible. This 
failure in communication was inexcusable in light of the gravity 
of assassination. The Connnittee finds that the failure of 
Agency officials to inform their superiors was reprehensible, 
and that the reasons that they offered for having neglected 
to inform their superiors are unacc.eptable. The Committee 
further finds that Administration officials failed to be 
sufficiently precise in their directions to the Agency and 
that their attitude toward the possibility of assassination 
was ambiguous in the context of the violence of other activities 
that they did authorize. 3) !)
