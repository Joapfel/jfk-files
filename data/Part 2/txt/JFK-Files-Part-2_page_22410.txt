con tra.cted with an ;\:-:1erican f i ::-::1 for that. J\.nd ,,:e shipped 
it in through thicd countries in Europe. It did hit the t~rget.i 
The thing we wanted to get a_t was the oil and tl~e 
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking 
down and if we could get a cobplete breakdown we would have 
everything at a standstill because in those days the autornoti~~ 
equipment wasn't coning in that rapidly from Europe because 
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going ta 
extend the credit . 
The railroad syste~ was in total disaster. The 
Soviets had such a long loyistics line, supply line, ;:,lus 
the fact that the Cuoans didn't like the Soviet equip::1ent 
because they were used to good American equipment. And th~,sc 
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Q I know there has been some paramilitary trair.in·.J 
in the United States. 
A Oh, yes. • 
Q In connection w:~h other operations. 
A Oh, sure.
