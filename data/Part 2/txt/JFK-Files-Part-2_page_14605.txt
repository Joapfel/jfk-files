We have a controlled program aimed at developing live 
sources in diplomatic establishments of countries outside the Soviet 
bloc wtth a view to developing investigative and intelligence data in 
"trouble-spot areas,," Under this program, we first diCfcuss a proposed . ~ 
"target country" wt th State Department via l taison to be certain we v-
are not running tnto a delicate foreign policy sttuatton, and to be ,, 
sure that State approves our general tntentton to deve,J,op sour·ces (~ 
regarding country concerned. lit the present time, Cuba ts not l.tsted. , 
as a target cou:n.try and we have not as yet discussed with State any 
program aimed at developing live.sources in C'uban eatabltshments in 
the u. s. lfhile we ha1)e not previously sought to designate Cuba- as a 
target country under our program, we do have numerous sources and 
informants, some oj which report on activities o/ offtctal Cuban personnel, 
In view of increasing indications that the Castro regime 
in Cuba is moving farther and farther in a procommuntst and possibly 
a pro-Soviet direction and in vtew of the increasing contacts between 
Cuban officials and represe.ntattves oj the Soviet bloc, tt·, ts believed 
we should undertake a program to develop live sources in Cuban 
establishments here. In this regard, it is further noted that in 
recent months there have been a number of defections by Cuban officials 
'from the t1astro regime in protest of Castro's con,ttnued drift towards 
-procommuntst positiono It ts, therefore, felt that -there is a strong 
possibility that we may be able to develop sources within Cuban 
establishments here who are dissatisjted with Qastro government and 
who may be in position to furnish valuable intelligence data.
