You have to understand the enemy int&lligence service before 
you're going to penetrate it, and you have to be secure from 
penetration yourself, and you then have to run that penetration 
very securely and on a very compartmented basis. 
Mr, Angleton. And there is one added proviso, then, that 
you can only run a first rate double agent if you have a 
source superior to him that he i~ unaware of. In the war, 
when we broke the German code, it was no problem to run German 
double agents because we could read their messages back to 
their headquarters, re-enciphered, andrthe headquarters messaqe 
back to the control, back to our double. So questions of 
danger 8ignals, questions of alerting him that he was under 
control and so on was taken care of because of communications 
intelligence. 
When you don't have communications intelligence, then 
the only other source that is superior is penetration, that 
somebody who can read back from their headquarters how they 
is, ; 
in fact, absorbing the thrust of that double agent. And tho~e 
conditions do not exist for thc·nureau or for ourselves, 
- Mr. Miler: Or for the military services, to run il lot 
of double agents. 
Mr. Angleton. I mean, they do not have the superior 
source of control over double agents. 
Senator Hart of Colorado, Why is that? 
Mr. Angleton. Uccaus~ they arc one, not breaking codes, 0,
