REPRESENTATIVES - COMPLAINANT 
TITLE 2, SECTION 244, use, ELECTION LAWS 
We were instructed by former Assistant Attorney 
General Vinson to interview the Chairmen and Treasurers of 
20 Republican Committees and one Democratic Committee, that 
filed late reports with the Clerk of the House of Represen­
ta~ives. There have been some delays in obtaining necessary 
information as well as locating the individuals to be 
interviewed. We have kept the Department fully advised of 
all developmen~s. 
Mr. Daniel W. Hofgren of the White House Staff 
declined to be interviewed, indicating the matter would 
have to be taken up with the General Counsel at the White 
House and the Attorney General. Hofgren indicated he was 
speaking on behalf of other employees of the White House. 
This, of course, has been reported to the Attorney General. 
We are going forward on an expeditious basis with all other 
interviews and current developments are being brought to 
the attention of the Department.
