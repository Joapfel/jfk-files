effort to prevent discqntinued informant from becoming involved 
in situ::i.tions which may prove embarrassing to informant or Government. 
Immediately after he testifies for first time, SAC should have serious talk 
with inform2.nt in presence of Agent who handled informant. This interview 
should be conducted in field office and informant told that: 
15. 
a.. He will no longer be operated by Bureau 
b. Since he is public figure, he will probably be contacted by representa­
tives of press, radio, and television for interviews and appearances 
c. He may be sought as witness by congressional committee~, Immigration 
and N'aturalization Service, and state authorities 
d. In connection with such interviews and appearances, in:formant must 
continue to be factual and truthful and must not puild up or embellish· 
statements, for if he does so he will wind up in serious trouble 
Advise Bureau results of such interview and comment _on its possible effe·c­
tiveness. 
Be alert to possibilities of former informant being contacted by represen-
tatives of publicity media and as witness by congressio'.!l,al committees, . 
INS, and state authorities. SAC is re-sponsible for knowing when former informant 
is scheduled or is likely to appear at hearing or make public appearanceof • 
of any kind. Prior· thereto in each instance, former informant must be 
contacted and instructions above reiterated by Agent who handled informant. 
Emphasize to former informant that he must stick to truth and make certain 
he can back up what he says, and if there is any deviation he wi.11 be sub-
jected to criticism, possible libel, slande_r, or other criminal actions. 
If he inquires as to whether he should appear or testify or otherwise 
cooperate with any public or private indi vi.dual or agency, advise him he 
must make that decision himself, but if he has appeared as Government 
witness in case which has not been finally adjudicated and decides in 
affirmati v~, h.e should contact USA for instructions. Advise .Bureau of any 
such situations and results of any interviews cond~cted. 
When contacting Agent feels discontinued informant could cause embarr~ss-
msnt to Bureau, make arrangements to have former informant come to fi-; :.-:l ( 
office where he will be personally met by SAC. At that time, he sho~l~ be 
impressed with fa.ct that his services were appreciated and were of corisid- . 
arable assistance to security of country and remind him that he signed agree~ 
ment when he was active as informant to maintain his relation with· Bureau 
on confidential basis. SAC should stress necessity for informant to main-
tain this confidence.
