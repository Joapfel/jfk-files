meeting, Esterline emphasized that training at the 
Fort Randolph and Fort Sherman areas of Panama was 
going to be,extremely limited; and since there would 
be no training areas in the United States; third 
country training activities would need to be estab­
lished. He emphasized again that secrecy was of 
paramount importance if the operation was to succeed, 
and stressed that the establishment of a Government­
in-exile was a key point to making the planned opera­
tion credible. Esterline further indicated that such 
a government hopefully could be announced by the early 
part of April and that the Headquarters for such a 
government could be located either in Puerto Rico or 
Costa Rica. 
Esterline also made an appeal for personnel to 
staff both the Panama training activity and Base Two, 
the Coral Gables Headquarters which later would be 
known as JMWAVE .. One interesting point made at this 
first meeting was that: 
Mr.. [Scudder] Georgia reported that 
the DDS Offices concerned had nominat~d 
nearly all of the personnel required by 
1 and 15 April respectively. Action was 
being taken to make all these available 
at once ... [and] it was agreed that DDS 
representatives would meet once a week
