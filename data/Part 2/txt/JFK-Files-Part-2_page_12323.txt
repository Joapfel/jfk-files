be furnished to the Bureau of the same type which is required 
for potential security informants. 
b. Except in espionage and foreign nationality matters in which the 
frequency of contact is dependent upon circumstances ·of the individual 
case, confidential sources on whom pending files are maintained should 
also be contacted at least once every two weeks ·in the same manner 
as security informants.

may be posted.
