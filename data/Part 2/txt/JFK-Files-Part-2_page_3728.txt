SUBJECT: • Special Activities 
1. Fo llo,l'i ng our recent conversation, I have 
searched my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples 
of activities which to hostile observers or to-someone 
~ithout complete kn~wledge and with~ special kind of 
motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities 
exceeding CIA's charter. 
2. First-, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962, 
DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert 
F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists 
Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an effort .to identify 
their sources for classified information whic'h was appear -
ing in their columns. Because the primary sourc~ appeared 
to be in the Department of Defense, McCone ordered me 
personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA, 
orally, which I did. I understand more complete information 
on this operation.,is available from the Director of Security. 
I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of 
what precise actions were taken, what information was gained, 
what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated. 
3._ As a result of a developing relationship witb
