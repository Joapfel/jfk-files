The Subcommittee inquired thoroughly i~to the reason for the transfer of 
the U-2 operation from CIA to SAC. It. is to be remembered that the SA-2 sites 
in the San Cristobal area had been located on August 29th. The U-2 flight whicl. 
was flown on October 14th was programed to over-fly this area. In view of the 
possibility that the flight might provoke hostile reactions from the SA-2's, it 
was concluded that it would be more appropriate for the operation to be ccnduc:t­
ed by the military rather than by civilians. This decision was entirely reason• 
able and proper. 
It is a fact, -of course, that the first U-2 flight flown by SAC was the 
one which resulted in obtaining a photograph of the MRBM site. This, without 
explanation, originally gave the Subcon:mittee some concern. However, after 
inquiring closely into the situation we are convinced that there is no signifi­
cance to it and that it was just a matter of timing and coincidence. 
F. Intelligence Activities and 9J2_erations Generally 
As has been indicated, the U-2 high altitude reconnaissance flights over 
Cuba continued at the rate of two a month, weather permitting, until September. 
The stepped-up schedule for September and early October has already been out­
lined. All of the U-2 flights prior to October 14th were flown by the CIA. 
After the mission which verified the existence of MRBMs in Cuba., there 
was a concentrated. effort to determine the precise nature of the missile buildup 
and the exact location, number, configuration and state of readiness of the mis 
sile systems. Between October 14 and October 22, the Strategic Air Command fle: 
a total of 17 high altitude sorties. Low altitude overflights were not initiatr:. 
until October 23, the day following the President's message.
