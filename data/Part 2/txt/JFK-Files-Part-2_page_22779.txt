Mr. J\ngloton. In 1961, 1000 of those had been pulled 
together. There was a briefing given by the general staff to 
high Kr.n people regardirig the field of military electronics, 
and during that briefing it was pointed out that they were 14 
years behind us, but they would overcome ancl surpass us throur1h 
three means: !lumber one was the Central Committee adding the 
2,000 staff officors for espionage; Second would be disinfor­
mation leading our scientific efforts in the wrong directions; 
And third was to enter into those kind of treaties which would 
bind our own scientific progress in military fields, 
\·Then I left tho Agency, I read a report by a man who 
knew nothing of this lect11re, and this was a group of Americ,1n 
electronic experts who had made a very sensitive, Top Secret 
study which stated that in this field the Soviets were four 
years behind us. 
This was in 1974 .
