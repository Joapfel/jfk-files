replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as 
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as 
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed 
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in 
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.
