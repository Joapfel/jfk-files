Alter Ego 
After ~ustin O'Donnel1/arrived in the Congo, he formu­
lated a plan for "neutralizing" Lumumba by drawing him away from 
the custody of the UN force which was guarding his residence: 
(a 'Donnel : [W]hat I wanted to do was to 
•get 1.m out, to trick him out, if I could, 
and then turn him over ... to the·legal 
authorities and let him stand trial. Be­
cause he had atrocity attributed to him for 
which he could very well stand trial. 
9_; And for which he could very well have 
received capital punishment? 
(o'Donnel~: Yes. And I am not opposed to 
,capital punishment. Qb'DonnelV, 9/11/75, 
pp. 20,-21.)* \ • / · 
To implement his plan, P'DonnelJmade arrangements to rent "an ob-

servation post over the palace in which Lumumba was safely ensconced" 
* According to an earlier report from the thief o0Station, it 
was the view of the Special Representative of the Secretary General 
of the United Nations that arrest by Congolese authorities was;'JUST 
A TRICK TO ASSASSirlATE LUMUMBA" (CIA Cab,!e Leap • . ,Chief 
of)Station to Director, 10/11/60). The (Chief of/Station proceeded 
to reconnnend Lumumba's arrest in the same cable: •

ARREST LUMUMBA IN BELIEF LUMUMBA WILL CONTINUE BE 
THREAT TO STABILITY CONGO UNTIL REMOVED FROM
