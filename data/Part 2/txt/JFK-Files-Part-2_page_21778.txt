Mr. Wides. And what was the mission and purpose of

outline? 
Mr. Sarno. They were to collect intelligence on Cuba, 
debrief refugees and provide bodies for any possible operations 
required by th~ station.

records. 
Mr. Wides. Was there a division of the members into 
two groups, with only a small group involving the debriefing 
of Cuban refugees? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, it wasn't too small a group, but if you 
would speak of the whole organization overall, yes, it was a 
small group. 
Mr. Wides. And at what point did you set up any cover: 
apart from the station as a proprietary or notional companyi 
in between the people and the Miami station? In other 
words, were the companies prior to the Latin America ~fi!@,11. 
-
company that preceeded•it, in time? 
Mr. Sarno. In the time that I handled.them, which is 
told, or perhaps four. I think we had our debriefing, you 
know, under one cover.
