Re: National Women's Poli ti cal Caucus {Nl·7PC) 
Policy Council t!eeting 
Source, who has furnished reliable information in the 
past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972: 
A Policy Council Meeting of the National Wcmen•s 
Political Caucus (l-MPC) was held in Nashinqton, D.C. during 
the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972. 
The Nl'JPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open 
organization of politically motivated women 
seekin~ equal recognition in the American 
community. 
During the Policy Council t""eeting there were no 
overt attempts· by any organized 9roup to influence the r:,olicy 
meetinq and there were no individuals present ·who identified 
themselves as members of any ors2nization which might be construed 
as subversive and/or supporting any cause except legitimate 
change. 
I 
Of significance, however, was the fact thv.t literature /l 
of the Women I s National A ... l:>ortion Action Coalition (r-IONAAC) was 
present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the r:'.eetinq 
area. All of the 1•IOUA...~C rr.aterial was qeared to the abortion 
movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for 
Hunter College, New York., July 15 - 16, 1972 .. 
WONAAC was feline.ea in July, 19 71. for the purpose of 
forming a national movement of groups scattered 
throughout the United States w·ho favor and 
now work to legalize abortion. The Young Socialist 
Alliance (YSA) and Socialist 1'·7orkers Party (SWP) 
_are playing a major role in 'NOI:'~J\J\.C. 
The SWP has been designated pursuant to 
Executive Order 10450.
