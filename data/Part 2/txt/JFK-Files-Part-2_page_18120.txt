On 9/9./75, J.ohn Elliff, Domestic Task For.ce. Head of 
• the Senate Select ·Committee, .telephonically contacted SA PauI V. 
Daly and requested .that SA Doqglas MacDougall be released for 
purposes of submitting to a ~tat£ interview concerning mail 
openi~gs . • • 
Elliff stated that he was currently being·interviewed 
by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however, 
he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanai"n.g-as" the Senat~, 1. j. 
Select Committee also requested .that he be made available for J 1 . 
Staff interv:iew on mail openings at .the same time. Elliff was {j 
advised that this was not ·true and that James Dick of .the Sena~ 
Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail 
covers was conc·erned f'Or purposes of an interview with MacDougall 
and that .this particular top.ic had. been confirmed with Dick on a 
separate occasion to insure .that their intent insofar as MacDougall 
was conc·erned was to interview him on mail covers. Elliff then 
requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in­
quired as to how lo~g this particular procedure might take. He 
was informed that pri'Or to MacDougall's being made .available for 
.such an interview the. Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning 
his Fifth .Amendment ·rights and would want MacDougall to. have 
sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain 
private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to 
protect his rights. 
Elliff subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly 
telephonically and stated he had checked with James Dick, 
Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that 
Dick had only asked that MacDougall be ~ade\ available for . 
interview concerning mail covers. Elliff stated that sin~.~ .-t:1,qi 2·
