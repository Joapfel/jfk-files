MR. HALPERN: The guard dogs were put to sleep in at least one 
operation. 
INTERVIEWER: You know in Spy Catcher there is mention of a 
dart gun. And I wondered .when I read that whether the British 
had worked on it and then we did? I wasn't sure. 
MR. HALPERN: According to Senseney, he did this on his own .. 
He and his laboratory types. I don't know Senseney. It's all 
in here. Read the written report. 
INTERVIEWER: All right. I'm going to. 
MR. HALPERN: You know, it's like this business I told you 
about my being out in Boulder, Colorado at the World Affairs 
Conference. Perfe.ct example .. It's okay for somebody to use 
the Church Committee Reports to damn CIA, but I can't use the 
same bloody report to defend CIA. So where the hell _do you go? 
INTERVIEWER: In one hell of a circle, that's for sure. 
MR. HALPERN: That's for sure. Round and round and round. 
Anyway, you caught me at a wrong moment. 
INTERVIEWER: No, it's fine. Tell me, why do you think the 
press was playing-all CIA up and playing CIA ... ? 
MR. HALPERN: I think part of the same business of being 
anti-establishment, anti-gov~rnment. Remember, this is after 
Vietnam, after Watergate. It all adds up. Attack, attack, 
attack, attack, attack. 
INTERVIEWER: Anti-secrecyr
