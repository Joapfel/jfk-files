the Consulate on Saturday, :he 28th. 1102/ The transla­
tor noted that this was the same man who had called the 
Consulate "a day or so ago" and h~d spoken in broken 
Russian. 1103/: From this i ,formation, and possibly a

as Oswald. 1105/ The probl ?m with assuming that the 
caller on 9/28 and 10/1 was Oswald is that Oswald spoke

who called the Soviet Consulate on Saturday and on Octo-
