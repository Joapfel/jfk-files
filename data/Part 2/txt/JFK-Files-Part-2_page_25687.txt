1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom 
are now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR 
86054 on 30 November 1963: 
Originator: Mr. Louis Armstrong

B. Tyng, Ms. Sue L. Darling 
Authenticator: Mr. William B. Tyng (''for" 
Desmond FitzGerald)

2. We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana 
flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana, 
Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria 
Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans­
mitted the\information ~ohtained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we 
have not been able to locate any documents relating to this 
matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files. 
3. We have been unable to locate any documents which 
would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from 
Mexico City. 
4. Assuming there was no ~esponse to DIR 86054, the 
originating Headquarters componen_t':.-sho,uJ.d. have initiated 
follow-up action if a response was not received. 
S. We have been unable to f{nd any further information 
relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
