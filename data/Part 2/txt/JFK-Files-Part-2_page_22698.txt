Coming back to what you stated, with our litmus paper and 
with our analysis of him, we treated him as a walk-in, as a 
part of the thing to confirm Nosenko'a bona fides, and the 
build-up. And he is the one who gave the_(uJJ_d_e_scription of 
the fact that for six months the place was immobilized for thi 
investigation, of all the high level all over the works, is 
the way he put it. 
Senator Mathias. You contrasted the way that the Russian 
treat a returned defector, ahd the way we treat them. And 
in that connection, to your knowledge was Oswald every 
interrogated when he teturned from Russia? 
Mr. Angleton. I don't know -- I probably would know, but 
I don't know whether the military -- normally that would fall 
within the jurisdiciton of the military, since he was a 
military man who defected. So I don't know• the :answer to that 
Senator Mathias. What about from Cuba? 
Mr. Angleton. I can't answer that. 
Senator Mathias. Or at any ~ime? 
Mr. Angleton. I think the Dureau interviewed him. 
Senator Mathias. The Dureau, not the CIA? 
Mr. Angleton. I am certain we never did, no. 
Senator Mathias. Out you think the FBI did? 
Mr. Angleton. That is just my sensation that they did. 
Senator Mathias. We will follow that up.
