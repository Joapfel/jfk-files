"(D)uring recent conversations with several friends, 
Giancana stated that Fidel Castro was to be done 
away with very shortly. When doubt was expressed 
regarding this statement, Giancana reportedly assured 
those present that Castro's assassination would 
occur in November. Moreover, he allegedly indicated 
that he had already met with the assassin-to-be on 
three occasions ... Giancana claimed that everything has 
been perfected for the killing of Castro, and 
that the 'assassin' had arranged with a girl, not further 
described, to drop a 'pill' in some drink or 
food of Castro's." (File R-505, memo from Hoover

girl friend) might know of the proposed operation and 
might pass on the information to one Dan Rowan, a friend 
of (Giancana's girl friend)". (Memorandum, Edwards to 
Kennedy, 5/14/62.) 
(ii) Consequences of the tap. Edwards told Maheu that if he 
was "approached by the FBI, he could refer them to me to be briefed 
that he was engaged in an intelligence operation directed at Cuba" 
(MeITK), Edwards to Kennedy, 5/14/62). FBI records indicate that on April 18,
