On 2 January 1961 Fidel Castro notified the 
United States Government that it would .. have to cut 
its Embassy staff in Havana to eleven person,s. On 
3 January· 1961, President Eisenhower held a meeting 
at the White House to discuss the Cuban situation. 
In addition to the President, and the Secretaries. 
of State, Defense, and Treasury, the participants 
included the members of the Special Group, plus 
Genera.l Goodpaster, Mr. Bissell, Thomas Mann, and 
T.racy Barnes. Among principal questions, of course, 
were if and when the United States should break off 
diplomatic relations with Cuba; and after some initial 
hesitation; before the day was over the United States 
did break relations officially with the Cuban Govern-
ment.* 
to those who were even marginally involved in planning 
the anti-Castro.operation and contri~uted nothing in 
~articular to understanding of any of them. 
Similarly, Barnes' memorandum for the DCI in prep­
aration for a 3 Jariuary policy meeting, rehashed the 
.same information that Barnes had presented to Chief, 
WH/4, just a few days before. 26/ Barnes appears to 
have suffered a severe case ofverbal diarrhea. 
* Before the firm decision was made to break diplomatic 
relations, there was great concern within the Agency 
that the COS, a communicator, and a PM officer, and 
possib_ly a fourth individual be retained as members of 
the Staff. 27/
