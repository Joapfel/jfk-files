Advise the Bureau promptly in form suitable for dissemi­
nation of a subject's return from travel abroad in'those 
instances in which stops have been placed with security 
services abroad through the agencies l~sted above. In 
instances in which an individual against V{hom s_tops hav.e

Curtain, the Bureau shall also be furn~shcd at that ti~e 
with recommendations as. to the desirability of interview

such an interview is authorized, it shall be c0nducted 
promptly and the c~se shall not be closed until such inter~ 
view is had and the results thereof submitted in report 
form. 
In some instances a security investigation of a subject not 
yet included in the security index may be in progress at 
the time it is found that the subject has recentl'y departe·d 
for a foreign country. If the evidence developed at that 
time warrants the inclusion of the subject i~ the security 
index were it not for the fact that he is outside the U. S,, 
form FD-122 should be submitted recommending his inclusion 
,in the unavailable section of the security index. After all 
initial investigation is completed, the subject•~ case will 
be handled the same as those of other subjects of a similar 
status who are included in the nnavailable section aa out of 
tlle country .. 
If the subject is an alien who has been deported or has 
otherwise permanently departed from the U. ·s., he should 
not be incluJed in the security index.

departed for a ·foreign country, his security index card· 
shall be placed in the unavailable section arrd his case 
handled in accordance with the instructions set fort~

Investigative.techniques 
While it is not possible to enumerate all investigative techniques 
which can and should be employed in these investigations, there 
are certain proven techniques which have_been used with con-
tinued success and should be applied wherever po~stble. • 
(a). File reviews . _ •..... ---~-: - • :·. 
(b) 
Upon the initiation of a.· security ·investigation of an •• 
individual, check the office ~~iices and review files 
thoroughly for any pertinent !~fbrmation on record showing 
background and subversive act;~ity of each individual 
subject. Include such information in ~he:initia~ investi­
gative report. 
-.. 
Once a __ main' ·se~~rity fil·e has be~n--;;pe~ed for-_ an- indiv.idual, 
sub·sequent information received concerning 'him sh::iuld be· 
channelized to that file; The reference cards. pertaining 
to the subject should b~·consolidated in the indices 
after each check and review of .fiies ha.s been made. - • • 
Security informints . • • 
Success of security investigations of individuals is 
primarily dependent u~on a broad· confidential informant 
oo~erage within every phase of su~versive ac\ivity. 
Information and evidence developed through such sources 
a.re unsurnassed in value because of nossible use not·oniv 
for inteliigence purposes but also a; admissible ~videnc~.
