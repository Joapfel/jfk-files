Mr. McGeorge Bundy said that by the 26th of July the Harriman 
negotiations in Moscow might have reached a crucial stage; he asked 
how flexible are the sabotage operations planned for that day (as 
explained by Mr. FitzGerald to the Standing Group on Tuesday). He 
said he was not suggesting that any change in the basic guidance for 
sabotage operations is indicated, but it is evident that in times 
of particular sensitivity all potentially provocative activities 
should be subject to review. 
In this connection, Mr~ FitzGera[d said that because of light 
factors these operations could not be run any later than July 28th, 
in this month's moon period. He pointed out that if it should appear 
that it would lie advisable for political reasons to postpone the 
operations until the August dark-of-the-moon period, then as much 
advance notice as possible should be given the agents,iin order not 
to damage their morale unduly, It was agreed that by. the time of 
next week's Special Group meeting it should be possible to make some 
kind of judgment about the possible progress of the Harriman talks, • 
and that a decision could be made at that time whether or not to 
postpone these particular operations.

Mr. Colby outlined the results of the past month's agent operations. 
In summary, he said that he believes the covert propaganda activities 
are beginning to catch on, but that so far there is not a great deal 
of tangible result to report in the sabotage field.

Mr. Colby expanded briefly on the paper of the 8th of ·July, on 
the status of projected Tibetan agent operations. He emphasized that 
the trainees will be sent back to India in the very near future, andj 
that discussions will then take place jointly with the Indians as to 
details of overland infiltration into Tibet. Planning for air drops • 
of agents is being deferred until sufficient operational intelligence 
can be built up to permit reaso~ decision_]- ~
