SUBJEC:.': It~volvement In Dornestic Affairs 
4. The CIA Library has several informal 
snag files intended to aid the librarians in 
answering"thq kinds of questions that they know 
they will get on a con~inuing basis. An 
appointnents file is a coll0,. tion of clippings 
on appointed federal officials: who holds what 
job \•;hen and ·what is his backqrour.d? 'l'he extremist 
files are a collection of folders on a variety 
of organizations and a few people with intricate· 
organizational links. Any sort of extremism 
is grist for these particu~ar files. And a few 
persons, e.g., RQp Broun and El<lrid0e Cleaver, 
have dossiers consisting aln:ost exclusively of 
clippings fron public meeia. These files are 
unclassified &;d consist nostly of clippings 
from the public press: U.S., foreign, underground, 
scholarly. 
5. I am not aware of any other kind of 
involvement in doreestic activities that is not 
related to dcvclop~e~t of tech~iques or logistics 
o~ l~gitinate training of CRS p~rsonncl.
