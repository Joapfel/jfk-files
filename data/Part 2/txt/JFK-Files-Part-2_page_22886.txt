Mr. me that question a 
year ago, Sena tor, I would have said in my experience ::.with him 
he was not such an officer, but I have no way of dealing with 
the kind of thing you have just described. 
Senator Mondale. It shatters me because I have always 
respected him. Because we know that these assassination attemp 
occurred. We know that Mr. Helms was a part of it. We have 
testimony that Mr. Helms and Mr. Harvey met and agreed •• not to 
tell Mr. McCone what they were doing. And then we have a 
document here -- well, that was Cubella -- and then we have a 
mtUno from Helms to Rusk which, in MinneRota • language looks 
like a lie. Now, I just don't knaw. Maybe there are other 
explanations. • 
The Chairman. The memo to Rusk had to do with Cubella 
rather than the Mafia. 
Senator Mondale. Is that it? It was not the Mafia? 
Mr. Schwarz. It was Cubella, except if you just substitut 
Cubella for the word Mafia. 
The Chairmih. What you said otherwise is correct. 
Sanator Mondale. Dut he was involved personally with 
Cubella, wasn't he? And he knew that, and this memo said no. 
Is there a plausible explanation? 
Mr. Madigan. TT~lms has one. 
Senator Dakar. Helms' position is that he did not lie, 
that he did not have anything to do with the Cubella incident,
