of considering possible unilateral action as opposed to using an 
exile group as a cutout. Mr. Bundy will explore exactiy what the 
feeling of higher authority is with respect to relations with exile 
groups. 
c. Additional Programs 
Mr. Johnson mentioned the activities of the NTS, which has 
.been broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet troops over Radio Caribe 
in the Dominican Republic. Mr. FitzGerald agreed to add this to the 
possibilities listed under fadio broadcasting. 
Mr·. Johnson questioned the extent to which proposition b., 
involving inciting Cubans to commit aggressive acts against Soviet 
personnel, is in accord with current objectives. 
On the matter of propaganda balloons, most members of the 
Group felt that these might be useful in connection with the particular 
target mention.ed - the May Day concentration which is expected in Havana. 
Mr. Johnson had some reservations which he wanted to check out further 
in the Department. It was agreed that should State take a favorable 
view, then the matter would be presented to higher authority. 
As to the request for Defense training facilities, Mr. 
Gilpatric asked that Mr. FitiGerald discuss the needs with Secretary 
Vance. Mr.•FitzGerald said that the principal requirement which can­
not be met in CIA facilities is adequate space for weapons training. 
Members of the Group recalled that the objection to the use of Defense 
facilities at the time it was presented during the MONGOOSE period, 
was that this would,make it difficult, if not impossible, to deny 
official U.S. involvement. Mr. Bundy said that he saw no objection 
if the purpose was to train Cubans for eventual open hostilities, but 
thought that in this case the objective might be better achieved by 
having them undergo regular U.S. Army training. The other members 
agreed.
