he r,ad gi·,·en it to Snaw. whom he'd rr.et 
by chanr.e on a business trip to New 
Orleans. The PSE showed hare stress dur­
ing his statement. No unreiated ::or.trol 
state..:,en: was available ior me to run tor 
comparison. 
This didn't really clear things up. There 
were several obvious alternative explana­
tions ior Odom's stress. For example, there 
Deception is not proved 
by ·stress, but given 
enough witnesses' testimony, 
the PSE is able 
to arrive at the truth 
had been a number of rather unsavory 
allegations in the press about Clay Shaw. 
unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom 
rr1ay have felt extremely uncomfortable 
about linking hi'l"!self to this mar. in any way. 
The coir.cidence of the box numbers 
seemed very suspicious. but Bob Smith of 
the Committee had pointed out to me that 
both Shaw's and Oswald's notebooks were 
filled wi:h numbers. so the chance of such 
a coincidence was o1ct that remote. 
A! this point I began tc wonder 1f the te!e­
visicn camera was the •·outside issue" in 
every case. Perhaps just oemg en television 
win so thoroughly rattle ,he average person 
that. lying or not. he i:; going to show s:res$ 
on the PSE. I checked this out by recording 
and charting a number of people on tele­
vision programs-pJb!ic officials. men in 
the street. aven witnesses to a paniculariy 
gn"esonie a:::cident. There was occasional 
stress. but it never reached the high level 
I was finding in the assassination tapes. 
I also recalled something else which put 
my mind tn rest on this point: the PSE had 
been used to analyze the statements of con-
!CS!:-:ir·ts -:in t"le te1ev1s1on program ,::; 10:·;

timony from a :arge E-"lough number c! v,i:­
nesses to create a d~tailed pic:L:re of th~ 
Garrison-Shaw afiai r. but it seems probab;e 
that. at the very leas:. Garrison did r.c, have 
much of a case against S:-ia·:: (a view later 
held cy a Nsw Orleans juiy) and ::~e!y !ha: 
Shaw was corr.pleteiy innocent of corr.plic­
ity in the assassinaticr.. The lesson o: this 
episode is twofold. Firs!. s'.ress in arv one 
person's testimony does not prove cecep­
tion. Second. given enough testimony by 
different witnesses. the PSE can arrive at 
the truth. 
The first person I ran on.the PSE who had 
any direct k"lowledge of the assassination 
was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu­
nately. only one of her statements was on 
the CBS tapes-that Oswald had owned a 
rifle. The PSE said she was telling tr,e truth. 
The rifle had been one of the 111::1jor points 
of controversy raised by critics of the War­
ren Report. The debate centered on two 
points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano 
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was 
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the 
Texas School Book Depository, and whether 
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon. • 
On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson. an 
employe'3 of Parkland Hospital. testified 
tha: he had found a rifle bullet on a stre:chei 
which he believed had carried Gcvernor 
Connolly. There was no stress in his state­
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth. 
Dr. Joseph D Nicol. Superintendent of 
the Bureau of Criminal lnvestig:ltion for the 
State of lilinois. ran ballistic tests on buliet 
fragme:-1!s tound in the presidentiai limou­
sine. and on the intact bullet fot;nd by Tom­
linson. Mice! testified that botri the intact 
bullet and the bullet fragments had been 
fired bi' the Mannlicher-Car::ano. He. too. 
was apparently fe!lir.g the truth. 
Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman o: 
the Dallas police c!ai!"1e::I that he found 
Oswald's Mann!icher-CMcano on tne six:h 
!icor of the Texas School Book Depositor/. 
However. on the day of the assassination. 
he had 10:d ti1e press tha! the rii1e he'd founc 
was a German Mauser. The following day 
he signed an a!fida•;it to that etfect. 8.ut or. 
the CBS tapes he testified that he had been 
mistaken about that point. that it had really
