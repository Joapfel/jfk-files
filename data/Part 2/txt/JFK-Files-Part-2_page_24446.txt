Bissell did not have a clear independent recollection 
of the dates involved, but recalled that discussions concerning 
the possible use of syndicate members against Castro began "in 
the Autumn of 1960". ~•r He recalled initial discussions among 
himself, Edwards, and Colonel J. C. King, Chief of the We~tern 
Hemisphere Division, which he said occurred before Dulles and 
Cabell were approached about assassinating Castro. Acccirding 
to Bissell, 
"those conversations, the subject matter was a capability 
to eliminate Castro if such action should be decided 
upon. 
"It is, therefore, accurate to say that my best 
recollection of those conversations (with. Edwards and 
King) is that they addressed themselves to the existence 
or non-existence of the capability and to the possibility 
of deve16ping a capability. They were not conclusive or 
decisive conversations ... nor would they have revealed 
a prior decision to implemeilt such a plan by anybody."
