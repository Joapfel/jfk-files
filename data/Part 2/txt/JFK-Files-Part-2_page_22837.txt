Mr. Bundy. That isn't exactly the way it works. 
Senator Morgan. Just.tell me what did you do. 
Mr. Bundy. I am trying to. 
Senator Morgan~ I have been listening all morning, Mr. 
Bundy, and I just don't get it. 
Let me go to one other question. Was it true a while

Mr. Bundy. Yes, that is certainly true. 
Senator Morgan. I have no other questions .

Senator Mondale. I don't like to ask this question,

Have you talked to others involved during this period

this testimony? 
Mr. Bundy. I answered that question. Yes, I have. 
Senator Mondale. Would. you repeat it briefly for us?
