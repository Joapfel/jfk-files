It was arranged that Roselli would go to 
Florida and recruit Cubans for the operation (Roselli, pp. 11-12). 
Edwards informed Bissell that contact had been made with the 
g~bling syndicate (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 20-21; I.G., p. 17). 
During the week of September 24, 1960, 
O'Connell, Maheu, and Roselli met in Miami to work out the 
details of the operation (O'Connell, pp. 25-26; Roselli, p. 12; 
I. G., p. 18). Roselli used the cover name of "John Rawlston" 
11 
and represented himself to the Cuban contacts as an agent of h""Jt/A, c,{( 
"some business interests of Wall-Street that had .. J· 7 
nickel interests and properties around in Cuba, and I f,\/{.cC 
was getting financial assistance from them" (Roselli, • 
pp. 9, 17). • 
Maheu handled the details of setting up 
the operation and keeping O'Connell informed of developments. 
After they had been in Miami for a short time, and certainly 
prior to October 18,* Roselli introduced Maheu to two indivi-
Maheu substantially confirmed his account (Maheu, .p. 111). 
O'Connell recalled that about three weeks after the New York 
meeting, Roselli told him, "I am not kidding, I know who you 
work for." (O'Connell, p. 26.) 
* Maheu recalls that he first met "Sam Gold" (Giancana) 
after November , 1960, when he was staying at the Fountainbleu 
Hotel (Maheu, p. 17). Other evidence indicates that the meet-­
ing took place earlier. When they first went to Miami, Maheu 
and Roselli stayed at the Kennilworth Hotel (Maheu, pp. 15-16); 
FBI records reveal that Maheu and Roselli (alias J. A. Rollins) 
were registered at the Kennilworth from October 11-30 (File 
R-505, FBI summary, p. 10). Giancana must have been involved 
in the operation during the October period at the Kehnilworth 
because l(l) the wiretap of Rowan Is apartment, discussed infra' 
was made on October 30·; (2) on·October 18, the FBI sent. a rnerrorandum to 
Bissell statinethat Gfancana had been telling several people that he was 
involved in an assassination attempt against Castro (see infra, p. ).
