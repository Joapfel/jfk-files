Higgins states that the Xa Loi pagoda, based on her o4 ·,;'~~-J~riences, was more a p11itical -· "$\ ~,~. h'\ ' 
command post than a holy place. It was the headquarter;~ ''from which the militant 1 
Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime.

Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen 
pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists. (Page 181)
