Dear Mr. Sprague: 
November 29, 1976 
When we talked the other week, you asked that I write 
to you to state formally my interest in working on the 
staff of t.he House Select Committee on Assassinations, 
and to tell~you when I w,ould be ready to go to work. 
As I told you during the interview, I am extremely 
interested in wo.rking as a member of the committee's 
staff. ·I look forward with enthusiasm to such an 
opportunity. 
I spoke with Judge Higginbotham last week, and it appears 
that my duties in connection with my appointment as a 
special master will be essentially over within the next 
two weeks. I have also inquired about living arrangements 
in W~shington, D.C. While nothing is definite yet, I 
am confident that I can find a room in one of the Jesuit 
communities there--most probably at Georgetown University-­
within the next two weeks as well. As a result, I can 
assure you that I will be ready to go to work in 
Washington, D.C., on Monday, December 13, 1976. 
One last item--in accordance with your suggestion, I 
have been doing some background reading on the scope of 
the investigatory powers of Congressional committees. 
Thanks again for taking time out of your busy schedule 
to see me. With every best wish, I am 
Sincerely yours, 
·-- 3 . f o--i..-u. ~ <0-1 -
