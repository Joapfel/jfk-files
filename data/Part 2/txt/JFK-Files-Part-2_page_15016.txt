SUBJECT: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FRIDAY, 'SEPTEMBER 8, 1967 
SYNOPSIS: 
Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation 
for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion 
at luncheon include: 
(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mro DeLoach on ~-5-67 concerning 
FBI' s pending requests for approval of electronic. sur.veillances. AG said he 
had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to 
meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter 
• of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised 
11 
FBI had so little coverage- -and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use 
surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic 
intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time . 
to bring Clifford and Ro stow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the/, :_ 
AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests. /</;/ _ ,.~·-.. -~" f

• Regarding above, Mr. De Loach noted it would be premature to i 
talk with Ro stow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they ~- [</ • 
could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially .-- \.•:·-:_·"-.:~.--._:_-__ --~-~.:.· ___ ·_·_ obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting schedule,d with AG on 9-6-67-- f _ -..
