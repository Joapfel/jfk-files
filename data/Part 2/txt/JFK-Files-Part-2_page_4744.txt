responses to the committees. Did you ... 
MR. HALPERN: I wasn't in there so I can't say. But I would say based upon 
what I know about the bureaucracy, it had to have a bad impact, a very adverse 
impact on: a. the morale of the people, b. the initiative of the people, 
which goes to zero or less than zero, you know, why should I stick my neck out 
kind of thing. It's got to then badly impact on any prospective agent you 
might want to recruit. A foreigner's got to have rocks in his head to be 
willing to work for the US Government these days in a clandestine capacity. 
And if I were a Case Officer .today, I'd have to think about the sanity of the 
guy I am trying to recruit. Doesn't he read the newspapers? Doesn't he watch 
television? In my day, we were able to protect the identities of a source. 
Really protect the identity of a source. And there were really, literally, no 
more than a handful of people who knew the true name of an individual. They 
might know something about the guy's background, his fapabilities, his access, 
that kind of stuff .. A person might never ask but even if they did it would go 
in one ear and out the other. We usually referred to sources by their 
cryptonyms. And that was good enough"for us. And that goes all the way up to 
Director. True names were things that you just don't talk about. And so in 
this day and age though, I'm not sure they can protect the true name of an 
individual. I was told, this is all hearsay, I was told that during the 
Carter administration that true names of agents were requested by and given to 
staff members of the White House staff. They obviously had the authority to 
ask for it and somebody gave it to them. I don't know how often that was 
done, but it was done enough. The mere fact that the cryptonym, mind you the ~ 
cryptonym, of Hussein, King Hussein, from Jordan was front page of The 
Washington Post and that scared the pants off them. And that was early on in 
87
