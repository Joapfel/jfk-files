3. Movement of Guerrillas and Arms 
Argentina 
Extremist members of the Peronist Party, apparently 
under the leadership of such figures as Hector Villalon 
and John William Cooke, were reported to be receiving 
encou~agament and·promises of larg~ su~s of money from 
Cuba in support of their efforts to train and orgar:d.ze 
subversive groups in Argentina. Villalon has stated 
that his plan calls for expanding and accellerating 
subversive activities in Argentina culminating in a 
complete take over within two_ y::ars. There is no indica­
tiori that Peron himself has agreed to thir, plan. It has 
been reporterl that leaders of the Communist Party of 
Argentin.s have been greatly annoyed by the tendency of 
the Castro =-eglme to support the revolutionar:-v Peronists 
without having consulted the Communist Party of Argentina. 
It is reported th:at the so-called Army of Fntional 
Liberation (ANL) of Argentina, which is a relatively 
small Castroist organization directed from Cuba by 
John William Cooke, has in recent weeks been negotiating 
for the purchase of arms and has been offered submachine 
guns, bazookas and other weapons by two or three private 
suppliers. It was reported, however, that the ANL was· 
having difficulty getting enough dollars from Cuba to 
make significant purchases possible.

The Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Relations on 23 
August protested formally to the Cuban Charge d'Affaires 
in La Paz against the Cuban Embassy support to the miners 
during the recent crisis. Subsequently, however, Foreign 
Minister Fellman informed the·Cuban Charge that he need 
not fear that the Government of Bolivia would break 
diplomatic relations with Cuba. There has, in fact, been 
no hard information linking the Cuban Embassy with the 
present mining crisis in spite of some unconfirmed 
reports of Cuban support.
