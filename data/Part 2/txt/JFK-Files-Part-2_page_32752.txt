The Air Force Council, chaired by the Deputy Chief 9f Air Staff for 
Operations, in the absence of the Vice Chief of Staff, with the concurrence 
of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, also supported the Evalua­
tion Group, and recommended that study contracts be issued to both companies 
for continued competition for another, 60 to 90 clays. The Coun~il recognized 
that neither the Boeing nor the General Dynamics proposal, as submitted, 
would meet the established military requirements. The CouncH f~lt that by 
i '. i ,, 
extending the competition for ari additional period "time and dollars &re thereby 
more apt to b~ saved than lost in the long run. 11 . It consic:iered that comp-etition 
should produce realistic cost estimates, further assurance of the validity 
of the eventual choice, and, iri all prqba,bHity, an earlier ftnal design. 
Agreeing with th.e Air Cotmcil!s proposal, the Secretaries o~ the_ 
Navy and Air Force recommended to me that- study contracts be award~d 
to both Boeing and General Dynamics. They'point~c:i out.that: . 
a. The proposals of these two companies were mar~edly 
superior to the others and offered the best chance of being b;rought u,p 
to stated Sellvice requirements. 
b. The Services were unanimous in rejecting the General 
Electric engine· (on w.hich the Bo~ing design h.ad been based) because of 
the low probability of its development in the. time required, sine~ riot 
even a prototype existed at the time.
