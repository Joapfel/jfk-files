(e.g., "stir up workers in Latin America and Cuba," ,,:ark throur;h "ethnic 
languaGe groups," "youth elements," or families through the Church") do 
not contain anv indication of assassination. (Lansdale, Ex. 4, p; 1.) 
On January 19, 1962~ Lansdale added an additional 
task to those assighed on January 18. This "Task 33" involved a plan to 
"incapacitate" Cubal sugar workers during the harvest by the use of chemical 
warfare means. (Lansdale, p. 29). Lansdale testified that the plan in­
volved the use of non-lethal chemicals to sicken Cubans temporarily and 
keep them away from the fields for a 24-48 hour period "without ill effects." 
After initial approval for planning purposes (with the notation that it 
would require "policy determination" before final approval), the plan was 
ultimately cancelled after a study showed it was not feasible and before de­
bate by the SCA. (Lansdale, p. 29, Special Group ~inutes, 1/30/62, p. 1.) 
Lansdale's 33 tasks were approved for planning purposes 
by the Special Group on January 30, 1962 (Minutes of Special Group meeting, 
I/30/62, i- 1). Thereafter, on February 2b, 1962, Lansdale detailed a 
six phase schedule for Mongoose, designed to culminate in October, 1962, 
_with an "open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime." (Lansdale 
Ex. 11, Program Review of the Cuba Project, 2/20/62, p. 2). As one of the 
operations for the "Resistance" phase proposed for September, 1962, Lansdale 
listed "attack on the cadre of' the regime, incl,uding key leaders." (Id., p. 
Lansdale's plan stated: 
_!_/ Lansdale's memorandum described the 
"It may be a special effort which professional labor 
• operators can launch to stir up workers in Latin America 
and Cuba. It-may be through ethnic-langua1se groups; Spain 
has an untapped action potential. It could be a w,?,rming-:-_up ,,. 
of the always lively youth element in Latin America and 
Cuba, through some contacts specially used. It could be with 
the families through the Church, with families resisting the 
disciplined destruction of social ,justice by the Communists. It 
could be an imaginative defection project which cracks the top 
echelon of the Communist gang now running Cuba."
