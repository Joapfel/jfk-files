Interview with John W. (SI 
SECRET 
Attached is an MFR summarizing my meeting with Mr. Whitten. On a more personal note, Mr. Whitten is an extremely 
charming and interesting gentleman. The meeting with him went much better than I had hoped, but it was also rather emotionally 
distressing for both Jeremy and I. Mr. Whitten broke down several times during the meeting and was obviously feeling very scared. 
Although Jeremy is sure that the Board will do the right thing here, we both agreed that Mr. Whitten is without doubt someone who 
should be protected even if it means going to the President.
