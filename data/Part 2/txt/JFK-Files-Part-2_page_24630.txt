4. The Plot to Assassinate Lumumba 
I~ the fall of 1960, a sci~ntist from CIA headquarters 
delivered to the Chief of Station in Leopoldville lethal bio­
logical substances to be used to assassinate Pa~r:ice Lumumba. 
The Chief of Station testified that after requesting and receiving 
confirmation from CIA headquarters that he was to carry out the 
scientist's instructions, he proceeded to take "exploratory steps" 
in-furtherance of the assassin~tion plot. The Chief of Station 
testified that in the-course of his discussion with the CIA 
scientist, Sidney Gottlieb, he was informed that President Eisenhower 
hac:J. ordered the assassination mission against Patrice Lumumba. 
Gottlieb's mission to the Congo was both preceded and followed by 
general cables urging the "elimination" of· Lumumba sent from CIA 
headquarters in an extraordinarily restricted "Eves Onlv" channel 
includirig two messages under the personal si2nature of Allen Dulles. 
The lethal substances were never used by the Chief of 
Station. But despite the fact that Luinumba had placed himself in 
the protective custody of the UN peace...:keeping force sho-rtly 
before the poisons were delivered to the Chief of Static~, ther~ 
is no clear evidence that the assassination operation was termi­
nated before Lumumba's death. There is, however, no direct evidence 
of a connection between. the CIA assas'Sination plot and the events 
which actually led to Lumumba' s death.")'(

. the circumstances that led to Lumumba's death in Katanga.
