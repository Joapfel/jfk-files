ME!-!ORANDU~-1 FOR: 0/DDI 
SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affair~ 
1 ~ 'l'his F.,e::1orandu:n responds to the DDI 's 
request for a listing of any question&ble 
involvements in do~estic affairs. I do not believe 
that CRS is doing anything that a reasonable 
man could construe as improper. 
2. CRS does, of course, have several programs 
to acquire still pj_ctures, r.1ovies, videotapes 
and books· either privately, se:crctly or \•;i thout 
acknot.-;ledqC:7!(:m t that CIA is the actur1.l end user. 
CRS is regularly .involved with Custo~s in looking 
at the content of film cans ao.ciresscd to the 
Russian r.r::bassy in ~-;·c"'.shington. Custorr:s occasionally 
also provides access to oLl~cr filn from denied 
areas. It 1:1ay be ,!ddressed to private citizens 
or_ organizations or other C:!mbassies. These efforts 
are aimed at acquisition of positive foreign 
information. 
3. CRS files do not generally bear on U.S. 
citizens or oraanizations. The bioara.ohic fiic-
- J - ~ 
building criteria specifically excludes U~S. 
nationals unless the person has becone of such 
major importance in the political life of a foreign 
country that the file is essential. (To my knowledge, 
only 2 persons so qualify. One i~ the wife of 
the opposition lec1.dcr of Guy.ana . and the other .. 
is Hope Lang .. Our Cuban files probably include 
sorae persons who are now U.S. citizens but we 
have no way to separate the~; we have files on 
U.S. defectors to_ Cuba.)
