Mr. Osborn. Not to the best of my recollection. 
Mr. Rhea. That is all I have. Thank you very much.

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Osborn, if you would, just very briefly, 
on the subject matter that I am going to be directing your 
attention to, the mail programs, the various mail programs that 
you may have had knowledge of while you were with the CIA, I 
would like to have you very briefly trace your career for us 
in briefest terms with the Agency. 
Mr. Osborn. All right. 
., ,. 
I jointed the Agency on 10 October 1974. 
I worked in what was then known as the Office of Collection 
and Dissemination, which concerned itself largely with the 
collection of any information that had any foreign intelligence 
import from other Government departments and agencies such as 
the Department ··of Commerce, the Department of Interior, the 
Department of the Treasury, and so forth. It was essentially 
a liaison job. 
I served there about a year and a half, and I then jointed 
the Contact Division of the Office of Operations, which was 
concerned with the selection of foreign intelligence inforrnatio 
from American businessmen and private organizations who had 
business abroad. 
I served there until roughly 1950, when I jointed the 
Office of Special Operations
