THE MICROFILM PORTION or THE SEQUESTERED COLLECTION 
As I noted earlier, there are approximately 72 reels of 
microfilm in the sequestered collection. (Incidentally, we 
h?lirEI"" arranged to have all of the microfilm records printed 
in hard copy. ) 
The decision to microfilm a portion of the sequestered 
collection was apparently based on two major considerations: 
First, the integrity of the sequestered records 
had to be maintained. 
_Second, a number of· the files requested by the 
HSCA were active and had to be available to allow people to 
continue conducting their normal activities. 
The solution was to replace certain records with 
microfilm versions. These records were microfilmed during 
1979-80 with the approval of the Assassi_nations Committee. 
THE CONTENT OF 'l'HE MICROFILM 
A sizeable portion of the microfilm--approximately 50 
percent-:-duplicates the hard.copy--files-.- - For example,- there 
are 12 reels of material from the Oswald 201 file. 
The bulk of the reels consists of files on 
individuals and organizations, including personnel files of 
CIA employees. There are also a number of files on anti­
Castro organizations. All but a small percentage of the 
materials are CIA-originated cables, dispatches, memoranda, 
reports, and correspondence. 
:s·.r 
There are questions of privacy that we believe the 
Board may want to consider in,· determining what information 
is to be released to the public. Some of the records 
contain, for example, medical information on an individual. 
There are also questions of relevancy that we suggest 
the Board consider. For example, many of the documents 
cover sensitive activities that go far beyond the timeframe 
of the assassination or investigations into the 
assassination.
