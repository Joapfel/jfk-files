March 1956 - Jtih~ 1959 
In mid-March 1956, through a letter by McCord extended 
from his home address, arrangements were made for Wiley to 
come to Washington, D. C., for three days to brief Hazel 
Mackie, Personnel Pool (Offlce of Personnel), on certain 
administrative matters for the processing and typing of the 
index. The Personnel Pool work would result in 8 full copies 
of the index: three copies to the Security Office, one copy 
to Staff D, one copy to CI Staff~ one copy for the FBI, one 
copy for the American Legion and one copy for Wiley. 
(It is presumed that a copy of the index was given to 
the FBI; however, there is no document which could be located 
that states a copy was in fact given to the FBI.) 
Concurrent with McCord's interest in Wiley, he and 
Morse Allen (SRS) were working on Operation Recovery, a
