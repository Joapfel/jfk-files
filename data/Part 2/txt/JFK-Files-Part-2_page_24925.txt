The Committee notes that many of the occasions on 
which CIA officials should have informed their superiors 
of the assassination efforts but failed to do ~o, or did 
so in a misleading manner,. were also occasions on which 
Administration officiaJs paradoxically may have reinforced 
the perce?::ion that assassination was p1~rmissible. 
For example,· when Bi_ssell spoke with Bundy about an 
executive action capability, Bissell failed to indicate that 
·an actual assassination operation was underway, but Bundy 
failed to rule out -assassination as a tactic. 
In May of 1962 the Attorney General was misleadingly told 
about the effort to assassinate Castro prior to the Bay of Pigs, 
but ~ot about the operation that was then going on. The Attorney 
General, however, did not state that assassination was improper. 
When a senior administration official raised the question 
of whether assassination should be explored at a Special Group 
meeting, the assassination operation should have been revealed, 
but a firm written order against engaging in assassination should 
also have been issued by McCone if, as he testified, he had ex­
hibited strong aversion to assassination.
