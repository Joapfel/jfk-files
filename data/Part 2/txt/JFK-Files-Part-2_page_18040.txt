He asked whether the request for the King 
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told 
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was 
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored 
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment 
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in 
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He 
asked why -the taps were discontinued and I told him I 
do not now recall whether I was told why they were 
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the 
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King· as opposed

Epstein asked 1-vhether we had conducted any

and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had 
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had 
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name 
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met 
with Ra-1-pb Mag±ll (then publisher or the Atlanta 
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it
