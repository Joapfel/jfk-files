were all rejected because merger with another supplemental was 
not an acceptable solution and the app~rent conflict of interest 
was too great. 
The sale of SAT to the President of the firm, Mr. Stanley 
William5;was another area of possible conflict of interest. 
However, Mr. Williams was not an employee of the U.S. Government 
during any period of association with SAT.or CIA. He had been 
the owner prior to CIA acquisition and 
of SAT.during CIA ownership was at the 
his role as nominal President 
direction ol1crAJwhich·made 
or approved all decisions in regard to acquisition of aircraft and 
other major policy determinations .. Additionally, this potential 
area of ~onflict had been_~ecognized at the outset of sale pro-
'\ ceeding5;which was the basis for obtaining third-party professional 
evaluation and appraisals and the provision in the sale agreement 
against windfall profit from disposition of assets. An underlying 
philosophy for sale back to Mr.-Williams was to restore the corpo­
ration to the status of private ownership once the need for it as 
a jovernment-controlled entity h~d terminated. Such action was 
considered in the best interests of the SAT employees as well as 
in the interest of th~ U.S. Government to maintain another viable 
commercial air carrier. 
CONCLUSION 
f SAT and its real property owning The CIA acquired ownership o 
affiliate, by purchase of all outstanding shares o~ capital stock 
Such acquisition was accomplished under the on August 5, 1960.
