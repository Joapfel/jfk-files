r information they had acquired through sigqals intelligence, 
t concluded that an imaging satellite they had believed to be non­
( operational was in fact operational and actively imaging their 
I te~ritory. Since the Soviets had bel~eved it was non-
operational, they had taken no countermeasures (i.e., 
concealment) and the US had acquired a treasure trove of 
intelligence. Immediately upon learning the true status, they 
took extensive countermeasures and invaluable intelligence was 
direc.tly and immediately lost.

8. (S) With further respect to question four, we have the 
quintessential factor for exploitation. If the foreign service 
believes its asset, they act on the information to the detriment 
of the United States; if they do not, the United States may 
escape damage fully or. to some degFee. This is the critical 
question that a foreign.country must answer and it is the 
critical information that we must protect vis-a-vis defectors in 
our fold. 
. l 
9. (S) In the matter at hand, we are very constrained by 
what the Russian government knows by virtue of their own 
knowledge and what they have acquired from the substantially 
released document and the Los Angeles Times article. The 
Russians know that Sergei PAPUSHIN (i.e., IJDECANTER) defected.to 
( the United States; they know or suspect what he told the US; they 
know or suspect that we fully understood the import of what he 
said; they do not know, however, whether we be1ieved him and thus 
incorporated his in£orma.tion into our. operationa1 practices and 
activities. And it would be critically damagi,Tlg today to confirm 
to the Russians the final piece of the PAPUSHIN puzzle and allow 
them to have the ultimate benefit from what heretofore has b~en a 
US intelligence success. 
. 10. (C) Indeed, as a reference point for this discussion, 
1
