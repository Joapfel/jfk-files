Beach where any convention activities were to take place, 
employees of catering services, limosine service, employees 
in -- what do they call it, t::ie Civic Center in Miami. It 
is a big auditorium down there. I forget what they call it. 
Foreign news people and media, television, radio people. 
Q ,,·ere these jeople on ,,ho:n name traces were requesi:ed 
all foreign nationals? 
A All foreign nationals. 
·J ('ias there any check made to deternine whether 
any of them were American citizens? 
A We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement 
that they .have identified these people by nationality before 
we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time 
they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizen 
which we promptly sent back to them and told them we could 
not trace .. 
Q And this practice was followed both in 1968 and 
1972? 
That is right. 
Q And where s,ere these names traced? 
They were traced back here and also in Miami. The 
Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check 
here. In the case of Cubans, ::orobably the Miami Station had 
more information on the Cubans t':lan we would have back here. 
'.J 3ut the names ,,,ere traced through Agency files?
