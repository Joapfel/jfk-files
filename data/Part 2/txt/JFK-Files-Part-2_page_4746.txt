MR. HALPERN: Just the bare beginnings of that because. you see. the Freedom 
of Information Act wasn't actually amended until '74 and didn't go into effect 
until. I think it was, December of '74. Just as I was getting ready to 
leave. And we all knew that was going to be a problem. A real problem. And 
it became a problem. All you've got to do is read the testimony of George 
Cary. John McMahon. Admiral Inman. Well. you can go through the old great 
hearings. The amount of bad impact. adverse impact. it had with various 
intel_ligence services around the world. Particularly our old friends. And 
I'm sure it's gotten worse rather than better. With books like Woodward's 
book and so on and the continuing leaks. But I must say from where I sit on 
the outside. and I am only guessing. most of the leaks seem to come from the 
Executive Branch of government~ I'm not just talking the White House but I'm 
talking the whole slew at all levels rather than the Hill. The Hill has got 
its problems but the Hill is doing more in terms of protecting itself, and 
protecting the information that's given than the Executive Branch has been 
able to do. 
INTERVIEWER~ More recently? 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah. And over the last ten years. It's quite clear. You 
just. you know. you do this with a sixth sense and a gut feeling. You can 
tell what's right and what1 s wrong and what's true and what's false~ More or 
less. You can~t be totally right but you get a pretty good estimate or a feel 
on this thing. And so help me. the Executive Branch is a rotten sieve all 
over the place. Much worse than in my day. 
INTERVIEWER: Is that right?
