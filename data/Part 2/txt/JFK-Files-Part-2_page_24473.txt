meeting with Dulles, or indeed that President Eisenhower would have approved 
a Castro assassination in any event, and (ii) that he would not have dis­
cussed such a matter without telling them. They conclude, therefore, as a 
matter of. opinion, that President Eisenhower was never told, and testify, 
as a matter of fact, that they never heard anything about any assassination 
at any time. 
(iii) In addition to the I.G. Report (which found that the CIA could 
not say that any assassination .activity carried on during this period was 
responsive to Administration pressure), the documentary evidence showed that 
the subject of Castro's removal was discussed at two meetings of the Natio~ v-v-4 T 
d,d -Security Council and the Special Group in March 1960. The minutes of these 
meetings indicated that the discussions were in the context of a general con- f~ 
I I 
' ~ sideration of the proposal to train a Cuban exile force for an invasion of 
Cuba and an assessment that Castro's overthrow might result in a Communist /v " t -fil, 
( t~ 
takeover. Gray and Admiral Burke testified that .the discussion of Castro's 
removal at these meetings did not refer to assassination, but rather to the 
problem of creating an anti-Castro exile force strong enough to insure a non­
Communist successor to the Castro regime. In any event, no action was shown 
to have stemmed from those meetings. An additional Special Group document 
showed that when a question regarding planning for "direct positive action" 
against Cuban leaders was raised at a meeting in the Fall of 1960 (shortly 
after Phase I·of the CIA/underworld assassination operation was initiated), 
the Deputy Director of the CIA told the Special Group that such action was 
beyond the CIA's capability.
