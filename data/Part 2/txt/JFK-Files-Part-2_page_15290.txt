·This programwas•initiated in 1954 and expanded·in 
. 1955 and 1958 to provide for.the acquisition of positive 
. intelligence data as well as other information which··would 
assist FBI investigations through three principal phases: 
(1) ·Regular notification from U. s.·intelligence agencies as to 
· arrival in ··u. • S. of intelligence. personnel from non-Soviet-bloc 
c<:>untries; (2) Maintenance of technical surveillance of official 
establishments of selected non-Soviet-bloc countries with 
approval of State Department; and (3) Development of· live sources. 
within such diplomatic· esta:blishme.nts. '. · :y. 
SCOPE AND COST: 
. The first phase consists chiefly of file reviews·

February, 1967, 24 telephone surveillances on non-Soviet-bloc 
establishments were discontinued in accordance with the Director's 
.instructions that.the total number.of.telephone surveillances· • 
be -substantially reduced. The cost of operating this ph~se of 
the program consists primarily of monitoring the technical 
installations involved and the translation of .the intelligence 
product. These costs are ana~yzed each time the technical 
surveillance is _justified (on ·a quarterly basis .aft~r-.,.th_~ .fi-rst · 
month's operation). The co~t appears to be fully justified.
