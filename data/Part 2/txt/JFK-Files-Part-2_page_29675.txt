the. Elena Garro allegation properly. th~ Committee does 
not believe that it can recdily dismiss Ms. Gar~o•s

of: 1) the corroboration of details of Ms. Garro's story;l.lfil_/ 
2) the possibility that soneone impersonated Oswald in

Oswald by Ms. Duran and Mr. Azcue anij the de~cription of 
Oswald's companion by Ms. Earro. 1183/
