Mr. Goldsmith. What is the date of that transcript? 
Mr. Shaw. 28 September 1963 is what is listed on here. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall whether you ever saw that 
transcript before? 
Mr. Shaw. I do not recall. I must have seen it after-

:Mr. Goldsmith. When was the first time that this trans­
cript was linked to Oswald? 
Mr. Shaw. I have no idea. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Let us backstep for a moment. The 
transcript that appears at CIA No •. 13 contains a notation in

" 
Mr~ Goldsmith. Yes. 
Oswald also said I was there last Saturday. The trans­
cript you just looked at, September 28th, was for a Saturday. 
Do you recall whether anyone ever came to you and .asked 
you whether¥ou were aware of a contact by Oswald? 
Mr. Shaw. I do not recall that anybody ever came to me, 
and I do not think that they did. This sounds familiar. I 
would have heard about this after the assassination, because 
I remember Sylvia Duran was the person being a Mexican citizen,
