or Robert Kennedy: 
"The Chairman: You do not recall ever having discussed with 
the Attorney General a plan or a prpposal to assassinate 
Fidel Castro?" 
"General Lansdale: No. And I .am v~ry certain Senator, that 
such a discussion never came up ... neither with the Attorney 
General or the President." • (Lansdale, p. 18.)* 
Lansdale further testified that the plausible deniability concept had no part 
in the fact that he never discussed a Castro assassination with President Kennedy 
or the Attorney General.** .Lansdale testified that he "had doubts" that assassina­
tion was a "useful action, and one which I had never employed in the past, and dur­
ing work in copying with revol4tions and I had considerable doubts as to its utility 
and I was trying to be very pragmatic.I! (Lansdale, p. 31.) When asked if he thought 
the President was not aware of efforts to depose Castro and his government by any 
means including assassination, Lansdale answered "I am certain he was aware of ef­
forts to dispose of the Castro regime. I am really not one to guess what he knew 
of assassinations, because I don't know." (Id., p. 32.) 
i"J With regard to the Castro assassination attempts, Lansdale testified that 
Harvey "never" told him that Harvey was attempting to assassinate Castro. (Lansdale, 
p. 24 . ) Lansdale stated: 
"I had no knowledge of such a thing. I know of no order 
or permission for such a thing and I was given no infor­
mation at all that such a thinrr was gain~ on by people 
who I have now learned were involved with it."· 
(Lansdale, p. 58). __ */ 
~/ Thus, when Lansdale was questioned about the "touchdown plays" 
( discuss~d in detail above at p. ·), there was this testimony: 
"Genator Baker: Now do you completely rule out the possibility 
that the touchdown play had to do with the possible assassination 
efforts.ae;ainst Fidel Castro?"
