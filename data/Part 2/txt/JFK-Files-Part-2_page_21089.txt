Re: Central Intelligence Agency, 
Informati-on Receiued from. James 
Angleton 
the Bureau, particularly with regard to that in rmation which he 
receives from~e Israeli, Intelligence Seruice Angleton is now 
furnishing th iaison Agent blank memoranda ich are dated, 
captioned, and which q_arry a control number; for e::campl e, "SP--1." -. 
This number will serve as a ready reference when some question 
c.omes up w.ithf..n the Bureau or the CIA. The Liaison Agent will make 
an appropriate notation on each memorandum indicating that the 
documents emanate from Angleton. It is bel iev.ed advisable to set 
up a control file containing a c.opy of each document furnished by 
Angleton. This can be done in a manner similar to the arrangement 
effected _i_n handling reports received fromfg.tott.:] (S) • 
In view of the above, Angieton more or less falls into 
the category of a Confidential Informant. He furnishes information 
of a sensitive nature and it is, therefore, belieued that when 
di~H:rem..inating his da,t(S, he. should be protected· as a _source. Up· to 
date Super vi's ors have been handling this information in a secure 
manner; however, since the volume.of data receiued from Angleton 
has increased, it is belieued desirable to alert all Section O iefs 
regarding the handling of information received from Angleton.
