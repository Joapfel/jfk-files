' (S) Required Prote-ction of Warrenton Training Center 
as CIA Facility 
• Moreover, in the past several years, the federal 
government has had a heightened awareness of the 
violent domestic organization threat posed by the 
self-styled "militias" which have a ~tated intent 
to destroy government communications capabilities 
and facilities. We know, from information 
provided by federal law enforcement authorities, 
that the target list of such organizations 
includes federal communications centers and WTC 
Stations c and D exactly fit this target profile; 
• By way of examples in this regard, in June of this 
year, the Sheriff of Fauquier County reported to 
WTC information regarding, first, "a local militia 
group, and, second, "unusual" comments from 
individuals living near Station C that we were 
communicating with UFO's; 
• Any higher profile would realistically and 
seriously threaten the physical and personnel 
security of WTC. And, as evidenced by the 
attached map-of WTC, such threats do not need to 
penetrate the fence line: Agency officials are of 
the opinion that a bomb commensurate with the one 
which exploded at the Oklahoma City federal 
building could do substantial damage to the 
Agency's communications equipment and could kill 
numerous federal employees at _WTC ·from outside the.· 
fence line in circumstances we do not control. and· 
could not prevent. 
or imply that they know that WTC is a CIA facility and, hence, it would appear 
that our cover, in fact, is quite good.
