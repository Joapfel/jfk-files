LWOPUS DOES NOT MENTION ANY SPECIFIC SUM, RATHER HE SUGGESTS 
THAT HE IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO SOME SORT OF CONTRACTUAL 
AGREEMENT. THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT THE FIVA GROUP 
APPEARS TO BE ATTEMPTING. THE FIVA GROUP STATES IN NO 
UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THEY NEED MONEY. 
C. IN EACH CASE THERE APPEARS TO BE A LARGE VOLUME 
OF MATERIAL LWOPUS STATED THAT UP TO NOW HE HAS PREPARED 
SEVEN FOLDERS ON FOURTEEN COUNTRIES AND FORESEES WRITING 22-
25 SMALL BOOKS OR EPISODES ON DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE FIVA 
GROUP ALSO IMPLIES THAT A LARGE VOLUME OF MATERIAL EXISTS. 
LWOPUS CLAIMS THAT HIS WRITINGS WERE BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTARY 
SOURCES. THE FIVA GROUP MAKES NO SUCH CLAIM, BUT IMPLIES THAT 
THEIR MATERIAL IS FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. 
D. BASED UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF THE 
MATERIAL AND THE TIME SPAN IT ENCOMPASSES, WE SUSPECT THE 
LWOPUS MANUSCRIPT MIGHT BE A JOINT EFFORT. IF IT IS NOT A 
JOINT EFFORT, COLLECTION MUST HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 
TIME BY SOMEONE WITH EXCELLENT ACCESS TO ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. 
THE FIVA GROUP IS A COMMON EFFORT OF AT LEAST FOUR (AND 
PROBABLY MORE) RETIRED KGB OFFICERS. 
E. LWOPUS NOTED THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR HIS SAFETY 
AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY. HIS FAILURE TO SHOW AT THE EMBASSY IN 
VILNIUS DURING THE WINDOW MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF HIS CONCERN. 
AMBASSADOR JOHNSON STATED THAT HE HAD ALREADY ALERTED THE 
EMBASSY, INCLUDING THE LITHUANIAN FSN IN HIS OFFICE, THAT THEY 
SHOULD BE ALERT FOR THE RETURN OF THE LWOPUS MESSENGER. IF 
LWOPUS BECAME AWARE THAT THE LITHUANIAN EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN TOLD 
TO WATCH FOR THE MESSENGER, HE MAY HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RETURN. 
IN SUCH CASE, ASSUMING THAT YURASOV IS CONNECTED WITH THE FIVA 
GROUP, THEIR OFFER TO THE HOLLYWOOD FIRM MAY BE AN ALTERNATE 
PLAN. 
F. IN EACH CASE, THE MATERIAL PRESENTED WOULD HAVE 
APPEAL FOR THE GROUP TO WHICH IT IS OFFERED, I.E., THE OFFER 
TO US OF INTELLIGENCE RELATED SNIPPETS REGARDING IN-PLACE 
AGENTS VS THE OFFER TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OF THE MORE 
SPECTACULAR CASES THAT WOULD APPEAL TO A MASS AUDIENCE. 
G. THE NAME OF YAZKOV (TRUE NAME ANATOLIY YAKOVLEV) 
IS SIMILAR TO YURASOV. ALTHOUGH IT IS CERTAINLY NOT TRUE IN 
EVERY CASE, THE FORMER SOVIETS FREQUENTLY USED COVER NAMES 
SIMILAR TO OR WHICH HAD THE SAME FIRST LETTER AS THEIR OWN 
NAME.
