CLIFFORD A. JONES 
PERJURY 
Clifford A. Jones, former Lieutenant Governor of . 
Nevada who is closely allied with Nevada gambling interests, 
was indic~ed January 5, 1966, on three counts of perjury 
as a resu1t of his having testified falsely before the 
Bobby Baker grand j~ry. This testimony concerned payments 
Jones arranged through one of .his cor.ipanies of $10,000 to 
Baker through Wayne Bromley, a close associate of Baker. 
U.S. District Court Judge Gasch presently has taken under 
advisement pretrial motions of Jones for continuance of 
trial and change of venue. 
On March 25, 1965, in response to request of 
Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls from 
Bromley to Jones and Baker. Bromley .and his attorney had 
asked that this be done. Department held such monitoring 
would be legal. On March 26, 1965, Department requested 
we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and 
Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles. Purpose of meeting was 
to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his 
testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given. Bureau 
declined to monitor this meeting because of lack of security 
of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure 
of the coverage. Department then got Bureau of Narcotics 
to assist in monitoring of the meeting. 
Recently we have responded to Department's request 
regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones. Such coverage 
involved twenty conversati@ns over four Las Vegas and one 
Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential 
and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This 
coverage will be subject matter of future pretrial proceedings.
