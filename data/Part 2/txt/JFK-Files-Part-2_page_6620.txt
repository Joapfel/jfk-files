Re: ,Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for 
Additional Information and Records 
Dear Barry: 
I am writing to memorialize·our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of 
Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the 
CIA. 
We discussed the following formal requests: 
CIA-1 (Organization materials) 
i 
CIA has ni.ade records available to the Review Board. The Review Board 
staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board 
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to 
do nothing further at this time. 
CIA-2-5 Complete . 
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches) 
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could 
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the 
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996. 
CIA-7 (Histories) 
Mexico City. CIA has shown the Me~ico City history to Gunn. CIA will 
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,
