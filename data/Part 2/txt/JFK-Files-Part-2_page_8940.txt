officer.) ~

29 January~~ 
According to a sensitive source 
(from conversations with unrecalled KGB officers 
lt is common knowledge among 
employees that GRIBANOV was expelled from the KGB and 
CPSU and is now on pension, partial r~ther than full, ai a 
result of the NOSENKO defection. When NOSENKO was being 
considered for assign,,1ent to Geneva (in· 1964), a tiummary 
st.1tement of his activities was prepared in the Second Chief 
D1rectorate and sent to GRIBANOV. This su~mary contained 
considerable "compromising information", concerning NOSENKOi 
if acted upon properly, it would have removed him from 
consideration for this trip. GRiiANOV read the summary 
material, ran a line through all of it,·• and. added the riota-" • • •• 
tion: £end him to Geneva." The general feeling ls that 
GRIBANOV was willing to overlook a lot of NOSENKO'a 
deficiencies because of GR1BANOV's l~ng~time friendship 
with NOSENKO's father. 
Comment: NOSENKO originally asserted that GRIBANOV 
was responsible for ~ending hi~ to Geneva in 
1964, but after retracting 1 his claim that 
G.IUIIANOV had played any°,special role in his • 
assignments, he asserted that BANNIKOV appro•ed 
the 1964 trip. NOSENKO·denies that his faiher 
and GRIRANOV were acquainted.
