8. LOPEZ. began to count cars to while away the time. During 
the period 1630-1900 hours LOPEZ counted 38 6X6 type trucks with 
approximately 50 militia each, all travelling in the direction of 
Matanzas. One bther truck, containing about 15 negroes and 6 whites, 
who LOPE~ states were not Cubans, was observed going in the same 
easterly-direction. LOPEZ states that the traffic was unusually heavy 
in both directions. RODRIGUEZ returned about 1900 and he and LOPEZ 
went back to the boat. RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that he had been able to 
get transportation for both AMBIG-4 and BLANCO; AMBIG-4 to Quivican and 
BLANCO to Artemisa where their respective families are located. 
RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ took the boat out about a mile, shut off the 
engine and went to sleep. (The above information in para 8 is the 
version AMLABEL-1 obtained from LOPEZ.) 
9. ~n_:the AMLE0-3 version of this period, again acquired from 
LOPEZ, AMLE0-3 reported the following activity: Upon his return to 
the boat_about 1900 hours, RODRIGUEZ saw LOPEZ and told him to wait 
and then RODRIGUEZ returned to Guanabo to see his fiance and reportedly 
to establish contact with fric.nds of A-3 in the GOC. J\~3 would not

family from Cuba. AMLEO- refused to provide any further information 
relative to these supposed inside contacts of his. AMLE0-3 states 
that RODRIGUEZ returned to the boat about 2330 hours on 10 May 1964, 
and then he and LOPEZ boarded the boat and went out to sea for the 
night. A-3 also stated that LOPEZ told him that at least eight local 
fisherman dropped by ·to look at the boat while it remained at the reefs 
and nothing was done to insure the cooperation of the fishermen nor 
did LOPEZ attempt to hold them at the spot to prevent their informing 
on t~ infiltration to local security authorities·.

10. After putting out to sea, RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ slept during 
the night and awoke the next morning, 11 May, at about 1130 hours-to 
find themselves directly across from the city of Matanzas. They 
returned to the Guanabo area about 2030 hours. (LOPEZ said the boat 
would only do about 4 to 6 knots). They took the boat back close to 
the original landing place, waited to see some light signals indi­
cating all was clear, and when they didn't see them they decided to 
go in anyway and investigate. Whe~--~EE!'.Q~;!.m.at.e.ly-2CL:yai::ds af f shore,
