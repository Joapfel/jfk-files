SEl"iATE SELECT CO'MMlTTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
It is noted that referenced SSC lettar requested un­~xeised copies o-f the Februa:ey 22, and June 12, 1962, communi­
cations from New Y-Qrk which appear to have been the "articulated 
predicates for the •continfil-. case. st The SSC letter did not 
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any specifi<;. ncominfil case." Therefore, we were unable to locate 
any pertinent doct;ments bearing_ these dates in our Hea.dqun:i;-tcrs • 
files •. At a meeting on November 12, 19751 between SSC Staff 
• Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Int~lligence 
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents 
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12, 
1962, captioned "Dr. Mart;in Luther Ring, Jr.; SM ... C"" and New York 
letter dated Augu,st 21, 1962., captioned "Communist Infiltration of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C." 
New York airtel -dated February 12, 1962, is being 
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received 
from our New York office~ Excisions in this document are 
fewer than those w.a,de in a copy previously provided the SSC~ A 
~opy bearing no or fewar excisions cannot be provided the SSC 
for reasons made clea:tt during the oral briefing of Se~tor 
Church and selected SSC. Staff members Qn November 5, 19-75. 
It is not"ed that New Yorli letter dated August 21, 1962, 
which is being deliv~red with this memorandum, is not believed to.have been previously provided the SSC.
