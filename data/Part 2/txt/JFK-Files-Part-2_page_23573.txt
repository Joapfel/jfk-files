statement that our covert activity "should be viewed only as the 
covert contribution to any nationc,tl program designed to. bring 
about the eventual replacement of the Castro government. 11 This 
is correct; and there follows from it {a) that our covert activity 
should encourage the spread of the political sentiments within Cuba 
most likely to rally support for Castro's overthrow {which means, for 
example, Ray rather than Batista), and (b) that our covert activity 
should harmonize with our basic national policy of rescuing the Cuban 
Revolution, as set forth in the White Paper. 
It is a fallacy to suppose that clandestine activity can be carried out 
in a political vacuum.
