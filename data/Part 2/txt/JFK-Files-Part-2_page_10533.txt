MEMORANDUM FOR 
SUBJECT 
. ·-
• 8 May 1973 
Deputy Director for Operations 
Areas of Possible Embarr~ssment 
to the Agency 
1. Sometime in the spring or early sumrner of 1971, Mr. John 
Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to 
the Jnve s tors Over s0as Service (IOS). The original reque .st •:va s 
non-specific_ but it gradually eme.rged that Dean was co.ncerned with 
the possible ad,..-crsc publicity that might develop regarding the 
President's nephew, who was employed by 1OS. 
2. There were multiple channels from. the White House to the 
Agency on· _this subject: 
a. Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director 
Helms. 
b. Son1cone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI, 
General Cushman (sec attached telephone conversation). 
Note that Ehrlich1"!1.an is rnentioned, and 
c. John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels 
were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by 
the CI Staff to Mr. F.red Fielding for Mr. John Dean. 
3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since 
it gives the flavor of White House concern, It took several days to 
uncover the fact that the While House interest centered on the involve­
ment of the President's ncphev.,r with 1OS and possible adverse publicity. 
· The reports subrnitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were 
coordin2.ted with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-, 
ject died down and \':e did not pursue it further. 
4. Please return the attachrnents 
pu_rpose.
