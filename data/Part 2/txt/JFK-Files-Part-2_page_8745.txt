release to public by Warren Connnission, report believed 
to have been passed to FBI Miami by WAVE Station. 
Concerned infonnation from a Western diplomat alleging 
that the assassination of President Kennedy was the 
result of a plot prepared and executed jointly by 
Chinese Conununists and Fidel CASTRO through 
intennediaries. The intermediaries were alleged 
to be Ramon B. CORTES, Mexican-American, and 
FERNANDEZ Feito (fnu), a lliban, both located in 
Dallas, Texas. It was also alleged that these men 
were financed through an unidentified bank at 14 Wall 
Street, New York City. 
Memorandum to the FBI from CIA (SAS) Dated 7 Dec 1963 
Reported the above infomation to the FBI. Also noted 
that reportedly Fidel CASTRO was extremely worried 
about the current probings talcing place into the 
assassination of President Kennedy and about the 
possible findings. The utterances about the plot 
came from SAAVEDRA (fnu), allegedly a close friend of 
Celia SANCl-lEZ. It further states that there appeared 
to have been no Soviet participation in the plot 
because at that time the Soviets were too close to 
the Americans. We advised the FBI of no Agency traces 
on OORI'ES and FERNANDEZ, but cited a Robert NIETO 
then living in Miami who could give details on O)RTES
