certain secrete trom disclosure. see 44 u.s.c. 2101(6) (1994) (identifying the 
grounds on which the Review Board may postpone release of assassi_nation 
materials); Sanders & Zaid, supra note 62, at 419 (explaining the Board's 
obligations when it decides to postpone release of a document). 
nl44. See Duval, supra note 14, at 668-71 (identifying 10 justifications for _,, 
nondisclosure). 
nl45. See id. at 621-22 (observing that maintaining secrecy of advic~, 
recommendations, and opinions allows officials to Apropose, comment, and 
criticize without concern that their comments may seem foolish or contrary to 
popular sentiment" and to compromise "wit.hout loss of face").

nl4 7. Secrecy in the High court is a practice, a -matter of the Court's .. 
-culture and traditions, not. of law. see Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, The~­
Brethren xi (1979) ("The Court has developed certain traditions and rules, .r.:-" 
largely unwritten, that are designed to preserve the secrecy of it~· 
deliberations, 0 ). The Justice who tells what took place in conference is 
indiscreet and is likely to forfeit the respect of other Justices, :but.he :breaks 
no law and neither do his law clerks. See id. Indeed, one of the argu.mencs 
raised in the wake of opening the-papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall wast.hat 
his written commentary on his colleagues may have made it more difficult for 
them to deal with one another now knowing that the public.understood the reasons 
that they held certain positions. See id. at xii (observing that, because· 
Justices are not elected bu't are appoinced for life, they are not disposed to 
allow their decisionmaking co :become public). The matter is posed differently, 
however, in Great Britain. The Official Secrets Acts make it unlawful for a 
government employee t.o·make an unauchorized disclosure of official information 
or for anyone who has received the infomation in violation of the Act to 
communicate _it to anyone else. Official Sec::ret.s Act, 1911, l & 2 Geo.Sch. 28,

The virtues of openness in government, therefore, can be and of'ten are 
overstated, especially by a self-interested press and medi;,.. Openness does mean 
cha't bad advice can be challenged, :but the consequence may be that good 
·decisions are never reached. Open records and •sunshine laws" n148 may only 
dr!ve people to less easily documented forms of communication, such as the 
telephone. n149 Although the costs and benefits of secrecy and openness in 
government are not easily calculated, we do know that loose lips still sink 
ships, even in our own thermonuclear age.

requirements").
