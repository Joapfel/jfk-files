Dulles also authorized the expenditure of up to $100,000 "TO 
CARRY OUT ANY CRASH PROGRAMS ON WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPOR­
TUNITY TO CONSULT HQS" (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). He assured the 
~hie£ o~Station that the message had been "SEEN AND APPROVED AT 
COMPETENT LEVEL" in the State Department (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). 
But the Director of Central Intelligence made a special point 
of assuring the §~ief o~ Station that he was authorized to act 
unilaterally in a case where the United States Ambassador to the 
Congo would prefer to remain uninformed: 
TO THE EXTENT THAT AMBASSADOR MAY DESIRE 
TO BE CONSULTED, YOU SHOULD SEEK HIS CON­
CURRENCE. IF Ii1 ANY PARTICULAR CASE, HE 
DOES NOT WISH TO BE CONSULTED YOU CAN ACT 
ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT 
PERHIT REFERRAL HERE (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). 
This mandate raises a question as to whether the DCI was contem­
plating a particular form of action against Lumumba which the 
Ambassador would want to be in a position to "plausibly deny" 
United States involvement. DDP Richard Bissell testified that he 
was "almost certain" that he was informed about the Dulles cable 
shortly after its transmission and that it was his "belief" that 
the cable was a circumlocutious means of indicating that the 
President wanted Lumumba to be killed (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33, 
64-65).* 
* See Section 5(c), infra, for additional testimony by Bissell 
on the question of authorization for the assassination effort 
against Lumumba.
