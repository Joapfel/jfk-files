several forms: 
a. we couJ.d blow up a us ship in Guantanamo B&¥ and 
blame Cuba. 
b. We oould blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere 
1n the Cuban waters. We could arrang~ to oause suoh 1no1dent 
1n the vicinity of Havana or Santiago as a spectaouJ.ar resuJ.t 
of Cuban attack from the air or sea, .or both. The presence 
of Cuban planes or Bhips merely investigating the intent- of 
the vessel could be fairly compelling ev1dence that the ah1p 
was taken under attaok. '!'be nearness. to Bavaria or Santiago 
would add credibility especially to those people that might 
have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The US could 
follow up with an air/sea rescue operation covered by US 
·righters to "evacuate" remaining members of the non-existent

wave of national indignation.
