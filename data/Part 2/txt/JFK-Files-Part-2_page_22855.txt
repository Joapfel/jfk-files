opportunity prior to. the·'testlmony/·and now ·agai.n· if/you seek 
to do so, to refresh your recollectio·n; will you recount for 
the Committee what happened in the summer.of 1964 in connect-
ion with this matter? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, it is a relatively small matter in the 
context of what you are discussing, but what happened in the 
summer of 1964 was that it came to our attention that there 
were relations between Cuban refugees in Cuba and people 
apparently associated with the Mafia. And this did not seem 
to be a good idea. And this was in a period in which 
sentiment had been steadily growing for some time against 
activities by Cuban refugees that were wholly outside the 
control and not really in the interest of the U.S., and that 
they should be associated,with a criminal group. 
And so when the matter came to the Special Group, the 
decision was made to refer it to the Department of Justice 
as a matter of internal American law enforcement. That was 
done. 
And the Department said that it was going after the 
matter, which it then did, and reported back. 
The reports don't give any conclusive picture of what 
really was going on, but they do show that the Bureau went 
to a number of people asking around about these matters, and 
as far as I know, it then faded away.
