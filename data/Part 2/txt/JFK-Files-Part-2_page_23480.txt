there were one man or two, CIA would have to maintain its own 
organizational integrity.} 
There then ensued a lengthy examination of qualifications and 
availability of a·nwnber of individuals. It was finally decided that, 
taking all things into consideration, including the aspect of q1_.1ick 
availability, Ambassador Willauer would probably be the best choice. 
On the CIA side, Mr. Dulles nominated Mr. Barnes. It was recog­
nized that these nominees would have to be checked with Mr. Gray's 
associates. 
Mr. Mann suggested that Mr. Willauer might also do the FRD 
job, but the DCI pointed out that this requires a covert approach and 
must be done by the Agency. 
As to Mr. Pawley, it was decided that it would be unwise to have 
him embark on a grand tour or to endow him with official government 
status. Mr. Merchant said he would not object, however, to Mr. Pawley 1 s 
talking to President Frondizi. , 
Mr. Gray then mentioned the report which had reached his 
friends about a representative of the FRD who had apparently just 
returned from a trip around Latin America. It was noted that the 
individual referred to was probably Sardinius, and Mr. Dulles said 
he would obtain a written report of the trip, for passage to Mr. Gray 1 s 
associates. 
Mr. Bissell reminded Mr. Douglas of the outstanding request 
to the DOD for thirty-eight NCOs and officers for service outside the 
u. s.
