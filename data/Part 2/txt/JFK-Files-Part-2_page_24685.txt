But O'Donnell had no knowledge that QJ1HN was ever used for an 
assassination mission (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 36, 42). 
O 'Donn'ell said that, as far as. he knew, he was the only CIA 
officer with supervisory responsibility for QJWIN and QJHIN did 
not report independently to anyone else (O'Donnell, 9/11}75, p. 28). 
When asked if it was .possible that QJWIN had a mission independent 
of that he was performing for O'Donnell, he said: 
O'Donnell: Yes, that is possible -- or 
it could have been that somebody contacted 
him after he got down there, that they 
wanted·him to do something along the lines 
of assassination. I don't know. (O'Donnell, 
9/11/75, p. 29.) 
But he discounted this possibility as "highly unlikely" because it 
would be a departure from standard CIA practice -- placing an agent 
in a position of knowledge superior to that of his supervising 
officer (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 29). 
Despite O'Donnell's doubt that QJHIN had an independent line 
of responsibility to the Chief of Station, a cable of November 29 
shows that Hedgman was aware of WIN's activities. 
In that cable, the Chief of Station reported through the PROP 
channel to Tweedy that QJWIN had begun implementation of a plan to 
"PIERCE BOTH CONGOLESE AND UN GUARDS" to enter Lumurnba ·' s residence 
and "PROVIDE ESCORT OUT OF RESIDENCE" (CIA Cable IN 49486, Chief 
of Station to Tweedy, 11/29/60). O'Donnell said that he had directed 
QJWIN to make the acquaintanceship of the member of the UN force 
whose help he sought for the plan to snatch Lumumba from UN custody
