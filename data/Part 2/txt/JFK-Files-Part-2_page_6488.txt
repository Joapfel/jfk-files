1. Ref'erenoe is made to memorandum from Chief' of' Operations, 
OUba Projeot, f'or General Craig, subject: "Operation MONGOOSE", 
dated 5 Maroh 1962, which.requested brief' bnt preoiee 
description ot pretuts • -whioh the Joint Chief's of' Statf' 
oonsider would provide justifioation tor US military inter­
vention in CUba. • . 
2. The projeots listed. in the enolosure hereto are forwarded 
as a prelilid.nary submission suitable f'or plmm~ purposes. 
r. 
It is assumed that there will be s1m1lar submissions tran . 
other agenoies and that these inputs will be used.·as a basis 
f'or 'developing·a time-phased plan~ The 1nd1v1dual projeots 
oan then be oonsidered on a oase-by-oase basis. 
3. This plan, in~orporating projeots selected trc;,m the 
attached suggestions, or from other sources, should be • . 
• developed to f'oous all efforts on a speoific ultimate, 
objective whioh would provide adequate justifioation f'or 
us military intervention. SUoh a plan would enable. a log1oal 
build-up ot incidents to be combined. with other seemingly 
\U11'8lated events to oamoutlage the ultimate objective and 
create the neoessary impression ot CUban rashness and 
irresponsibility on a large soale, direoted at other 
oountries as well· as the United States. '1'he plan would also 
proper],y integrate and time phase the oourses of' aotidn to 
be purBW)d. The desired resultant from the exeoution of' 
this plan would be t9 plaoe the United States in the apparent 
position of' suf'f'ering defensible grievanoes f'1'om a rash and 
irresponsible . government of' CUba and to develop an inter- · 
national image or a Cu.ban threat to peaoe 1n the western 
Hemisphere.
