OPERATIONS 
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE 
In the case of -D0M-i.'2A, this informant was originally 
developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested 
the New York Office might have use of informant's services. 
This information furnished to New York Office which replied 
that in the absense of organized activity informant ~ould be 
of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from 
Dominican communist groups to reorganize activityo This, 
of course, is not a desirable situation. 
OBSERVATIONS: 
. We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation 
to turn -B0M-1:0 and MM:;J.."2 over to CIA is sound, ev·en though 
both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable 
intelligence information to us. By making these informants 
available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplicat1on 
or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate 
officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency 
is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

In accordance with the desire of the President that 
the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic~ we are setting up a 
regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo consisting of 
three men. This will not be an operational office but rather 
wi~l serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data
