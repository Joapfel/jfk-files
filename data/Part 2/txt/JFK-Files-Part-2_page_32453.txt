'fHE CASTRO. THREAT TO LATIN AMERICA 
Despite diminished prestige, especially among government 
leaders, Castro retains great influence ov~r politically 
unsophisticated Latin Americans. He is also supported by 
Western Hemisphere Communist parties and the vast majority 
of extreme leftists. Castro's main appeal lies in his clai~ 
to be the leader of a successful revolution against "Yankee· 
imperialism 11 and in the support he is ready to provide 
subversive activities throughout Latin America. 
The degree to which Cuba is involved in. current 
hemisphere unrest is not clear. Antigovernment nationals and 
Communists of various Latin American countries, however, 
have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro-Castro 
indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962, 1,000 to 1,500 
are believed 'to h~ve received intensive education and training 
in sabotage and ·guerrilla warfare. Significant representation 
has been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, 
Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. There is no definite 
proof that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups, 
·but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are 
reliably reported to have been furnished, 
Cuban leaders have also called wi~h increasing frequency 
for open rebellion as the 11only road" to liberation for the 
Americas; they have been especially vociferous since the first 
of the year. Leading officials, such as Castro, Blas Roca, 
Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are 
among those calling for revolutionary violence. The 
11Detancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a 
primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high 
priority. " The use of the Prensa Latina organization and 
the agent network already in existence makes it virtually 
sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities .. 
Latin A~erican governments are generally now more alert to 
Castro's threat. Inadequate security forces and widespread 
poverty throughout t.he area, however, make it almost certain 
that Cuban-supported insurgenc~~ill have an effect out of· 
pioportion to the number of people involved.
