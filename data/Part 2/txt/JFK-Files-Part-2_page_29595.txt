HSCA staff have wondered wt ether or not the Mexico City 
.Station was entirely fort'hcoming of their own will 
with Headquarters. This speculation was based on three 
pieces of information. ~he first is the report in 
MEXI 7024 that HeadquartErs had all the available in­
formation. The second i~ a note from Win Scott on the 
R6~ting and Record Shee~ for·MEXI 1033 which says: 
I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at 
1620·hours on 23/XI. I told ~ohh Scelso at 
1630 hours (our time) on 23/XI that this would 
be·on route to him. 
The third is· ·a cable reporting that .on· the 23rd Win 
Scott had an urgent call to see the President of 
Mexico. The cable repor1:s that Scott expected ihe 
Pres.ident to express his condolences over the assas­
sination but "developed ·.:hat (Mexican agent) had 
located ca11· to Soviet Enbassy of Lee Oswald 
made on 28 September. B•ilieve fact that. (Pre~ident 
of Mexico) aware of this contact (from our joint 
operation) and passed da·:a to cos is important." 
. (MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, pa:~as. 2 and 3) 
The Commi tte.e declines t, > speculate that the .Mexico City 
Station was possibly con:;idering not reporting all 
the information· availabl•? to them. It was considered 
• that this may have ·been •~ontemplated in ·order to pro­
tect. themse;t.ves from a /c.1arge about their failure to· 
re_port _the· information p,~ior to the assassination.
