M. A. Jones to Bishop 
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
~ ' 
· In connection with the situation in the Western District of 
New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on 
3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment 
has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity 
has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district. 
With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District 
of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's 
attentio:µ on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information 
indicating these judgeships have been filled. 
Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently 
advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue 
to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.· 
As an example of shortages which have been brought to the 
Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in 
the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967, 
there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121 
defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose­
cution for more than six months. 
It is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of 
July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose­
cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office 
has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874 
subjectso
