PROGRAM OF COVERT ACTION 
BACKGROUND 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
A. On 29 Decembe,r 1~60 the Special GrollP approved a plan of covert l • 
action to support the internal and e~iled Dominican dissidents which 
involved provision for increased propaganda directed against Trujillo~ 
and the financial support of selected exiled groups. Additionally this 
·authority included authorization for;CIA to ma.ke available to selected 
exile groups communications and equipment support necessary for them to 
develop a capability to undertake thf infiltration of personnel and 
equipment into the Dominican Republic. Since none of the exiled groups 
had an existing underground organization within the area, it was the 
Special Group's concept that this delivery capability could be eventually 
used to support the plans and activities of the internal opposition with 
whom the Agency and the Consulate are currently in contact. 
B. On 12 January 1961 the Spec;ial Group authorized CIA to make 
i 
available to Dominican dissidents a 'limited supply of small arms and 
other materials on the condition that the internal opposition develOp 
I 
the capability to receive·these materials and that the materials be in-
troduced into the Dominican Republic by Dominicans themselves.
