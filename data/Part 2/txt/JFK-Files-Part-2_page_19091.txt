Also, th~t tbe~oviet news­
men are befriending American 
newsmen. "Many of our tips 
come from them," S~m went on. 
• "In some cases, of course, the 
tips are deliberately planted by

"We didn't feel any tighteni1,¥ 
of restrictions because of t]le 
Viet Nam crisis even thou( h 
we got the official propagan/ a

• \ Sam said the Soviets were 
, , ·etty good about letting for­
e gn newsmen travel around the

I didn't ·travel as much as the 
ousted premier, Nikita Khru­
shchev, and generated less copy.

Sam spoke wistfully of the 
f

hchev, whom the ABC cor~e­
pondent got to know well. 1 
On one occasion, Khrushcl:;ev 
,ingled him out at an Austrian 
;Embassy 1·eception in Moscer1w. 
' The Russian leader called Jaffe 
1out of a crowd of diplomats and 
•raised his glass in a toast to the 
newsman. Noticing that Jaffe's 
glass was empty, Khrushchev 
• filled it from his own, raised 
his glass again and said: "My 
best wishes to you." 
It was Jaffe who later scored 
a world newsbeat on the ous!er .

He talked off the top of his

are more sophisticated and they 
don't talk much. So it takes more 
time to get stories on what the

As a 15-year-old Merchant 
, seaman during W qrld War II,

to fit from the U.S. governmen '.

interviewed Chou, the Chinese 
were worried I would editorial­

swer format and they were sur­
prised and pleased that I didn't 
editorialize."" ' --
