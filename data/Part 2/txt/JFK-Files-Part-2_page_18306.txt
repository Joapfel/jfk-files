It is the Committee's intention to insert in some of the 
blanks in the documents an identifying description of IRS 
_personnel who assisted the FBI in'certain instances, such 
as "an IRS Special Agent
11 
or "an IRS Inspector
11
• We will 
make these identifications. based upon our notes from the 
·documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents 
ih which such descriptions have been typed in order that 
you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this 
way, we will avoid public identification of the IRS per­
sonnel even though Bureau agreement has previously been 
obtained that these individuals are not 11 sources".
