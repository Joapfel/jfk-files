MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Cline, DD (I) 
SUBJECT: Castro as a Threat to the Americas. 
I think that in analyzing Castro's potential in the Western 
Hemisphere as covered by paragraphs 9 through and including 21., 
we should consider his posture and potential under various alternatives 
of possible United States decisions and probable Soviet policies. 
Let us assume for the moment that the United States meets 
the exact letter of the Kennedy-Khrushchev exchange and no more. 
This would mean the withdrawal of IL 28s, the halting of. the establish-
ment of a submarine base, and some acceptable .form of inspection 
verifying the removal and assuring against the reintroduction of 
offensive devices, U.S. commits not to invade. At this point U.S. 
commitment on propaganda, sabotage, guerrilla activities and other 
actions designed to overthrow Castro is not very clear, but I think 
that we can assume that such activities if attempted would be no 
more successful in the future than they have peen in the past,which is 
about zero.
