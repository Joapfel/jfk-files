The Board accepted the Agency's and ARRB staff's recommend~tions on 204 additional 
documents. 
Reconsideration and Appeals: 
If the Agency wishes to ask the Board to reconsider a decision or plans to appeal to the 
President, the ARRB staff has requested that it be notified prior to the letter to the Agency informing the 
DC/ of the Board's decision. We expect the letter on or around Dec. 1st; the Board's determinations will 
also be published in the Federal Register on· that date. As mandated by the White House, the Agency 
has seven days after notification to appeal a JFK Board decision to the President.
