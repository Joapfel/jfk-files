I,! 
President Kennedy received me at the White' :House 
0n Tliursday, October 24. My appointment had been 
'.;chtduled for 'i :30. I waited in the C1binct Confic>;cnce 
'ocm, and at 5 :45 the Pres id en t, following his. usual 
CU"t• ,m, came to look for me himself so that he'. c:ould 
escort me into his office. He apologized for the. d'elay, 
no! so much as a courtesy or to fbuer me, but· to ex­
rlain the schcduiing of his time, which seemed to be 
vcr'· i;trictly organized. As we passed through the' small 
rco:n where hi~ secretary was working, we caught a 
glimrse of ivtrs. Kennedy lca,·ing by a French wjndow 
on L.:r way to the private garden of the vVhite House. 
The President c:illed her back tu introduce me.: : 
• It was stiH Indian summer in Washington'., i The 
weJther. was very w,um, and both the President~ and 
Mrc Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus cryhanc­
ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity 
wli:, h was in rath_er surprising contrast to the so_lernnity 
of entering these august chambtrs .. The President 
(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, spcaking:with 
quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at 
time~, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al­
m0•;f, l would say, rnmplctcly expressionless) iTivited 
me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which \~:as in 
the middle of his office. He sJt in a rocking chair op­
posite the sofa. T.he ihterview was to last from 20 to 25 
minutes, and it ,vas interrupted only by a brid tele-
pho:1e call. • 
The President immcdi.1tely asked me how the French 
~tt•.;,1tion was develo 1)ing. After my reply, h~ spoke" 
about General de' G.q.lle. He talked :n a reL:ixed f~~hion,

THE AUTHOR 
like someone ,vho has at last found ~olace in indiffer­
ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated. 
John Kennedy was a rrian who liked to get to the heart 
d .a matter quickly,....,..,_,'11ake decisions even more 
r,1pi9ly. But this was not possible in dealing with de 
Gaulle, who is more difficult to h,rndle than Khru-
• shchev. One day, impatient at not understanding the 
General's reasoning and intent upon convincing him, 
Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct. All in vain. Odd­
ly enough, however;since the recent visit of de C,rnlle's 
foreign minister, Couve de Murvi11E'. to vVashington 
Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply rnncerned 
Jbnut Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had 
mnde up /1is mind not to worry about them any more. 
According to him, it was a waste of time. 
"Mr. Couve de Murville Jnd I both verified that we 
didn't agree on anything," the President told me. "And 
we agreed that.such total disagreement was hardly c.:il­
culated to create a flourishing friendship betwren two 
great Western. nations. I came to the conc)usion that 
Ccncral de .Gaulle's strategy, which is ·rather incom­
r'rchensible to me, requires a certain ,,mount of tension 
1\·ith the United States. It would seem that only through 
this tension is it possible to restore tn ELiro.pe the desire 
to. think for itself and renounce its torpid _oependence 
on American dollar aid and politic.ii )~'tlidl~ii!':
