Subject: OGC's comments on piuposed JFK regulations. 
1) OGC submission 
Bob's comments should be included in our response to 
the Bo~rd, however, not as he has reconunendeq. The language 
and tone is very different and does not inserted well into 
existing text; I think his comments will work better as a 
separate paragraph or as an addendum. 
2) DI IRO 
Kathy's comments on section 1400.2 ar.e on target, but q 
little strong. I don't think the board will buy changed 
"used" to "created". Our proposed response, as written, 
does question the scope but not directly. (note: The FBI 
proposed wording, if accepted by the board, would­
satisfactorily limit the scope of this section) . She does 
have a point fn changing "intent" to "as presently worded". 
On section 1400.7, Kathy's reaction is the same as 
Gloria's. I think our response adequately address the 
concerns here, but could be strengthen without changing the 
tone of the response. (Note - OGC comments will also address 
"scope" which clearly is Kathy's primary concern.
