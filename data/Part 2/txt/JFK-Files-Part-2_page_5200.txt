Attached are the final versions of the DS&T and DO briefing questions. There arc no changes in 
the DS&T questions. Questions have been added to the DO list to reflect our conversation 
March 19 and 20, You, of course, already have our detailed explanations for the earlier DO 
questions. If you have any questions or if there are any problems, please give me a call. I should 
be in all day. See you tomorrow.
