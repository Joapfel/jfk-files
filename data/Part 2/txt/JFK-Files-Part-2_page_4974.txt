EXAMPLE. (FIELD COMMENT: THE SOURCE PROVIDED THE QUALIFIER ON 
*THE "ALLEDGED" NATURE OF MOB INVOLVEMENT IN THE<KENNEDY> 
*<ASSASSINATION,>WHICH\l0.fu.1fJJCT-7JAPPARENTLY REPEATED AS IF IT WERE 
ESTi'I.BLISHED FACT.) 
7~COMMENTS ON TERRORISTS: TERR-ORTSTS-, -EV·EN---'.f-HQSE-WH0 
OPERATE Ul-JDER THE GUISE OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR, NORMALLY HAVE AN 
UNDERLYING FINANCIAL MOTIVE ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV. RUSSIA, AS 
OTHER COUNTRIES, IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED THAT ADEQUATE 
SAFEGUARDS BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM ACQUIRING 
NUCLEAR MATERIALS. RUSSIA ALSO WANTS TO SEE AN IMPROVED 
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH 
TERRORISTS AND PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LEGAL 
LOOPHOLES. 
8. MAMEDOV ALSO MADE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON SEVERAL 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
((ZYUGANOV)) - ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS AND THE RESULTING 
DISCONTENT HAVE ENHANCED HIS CHANCES AT THE PRESIDENCY. IT 
\woULD NOT BE OF CRITICAL CONCERN SHOULD HE WIN THE COMING 
II.PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SINCE THE COMMUNISTS HAVE Ul-ffiERGONE A 
TRANSFORMATION AND WOULD NEITHER BE ABLE NOR WILLING TO TURN THE 
/CLOCK BACK. THE NEW RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO 
!ITALIAN COMMUNISTS BUT MAMEDOV WOULD DREAD TO SEE AN 
/ITALIAN-TYPE POLITICAL SCENARIO IN RUSSIA. THE RETURN OF 
COMMUNIST PRESIDENTS IN POLAND, HUNGARY AND ROMANIA HAS NOT 
CAUSED DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH WESTERN NATIONS, NOR 
, SHOULD THIS HAPPEN WITH RUSSIA. 
((ZHIRINOVSKY)) - A POLITICAL HOOLIGAN, ZHIRINOVSKY HAS 
LOTS OF FINANCIAL BACKING. WITH HIS ATTENTION-GRABBING ANTICS, 
HE PROVIDES A DIVERSION WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS CARRY ON THEIR 
UNSAVORY (I.E. CRIMINAL) ACTIVITIES. IT REMINDS ONE OF THE 
RUSSIAN TALE WHERE TWO CHARACTERS DISTRACT A CROWD WHILE THE 
THIRD IS BUSY RIFLING THEIR POCKETS. ZHIRINOVSKY HAS PRESENTED 
NO SERIOUS PROGRAM TO PERMIT HIM TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT VOTES. 
( (LEBED)) · WITH HIS BASS VOICE AND PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT 
APPEAL TO THE DISCONTENTED, HE HAS EARNED SOME POPULARITY, BUT 
HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOLID PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE 
AND WILL NOT BE A SERIOUS CONTENDER FOR THE PRESIDENCY. 
9. RELATIONS WITH CANADA: MAMEDOV FAVORS CLOSER TIES 
WITH CANADA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. THE 
HALIFAX SUMMIT AND ( (YELTSIN'S)) BACKING FOR STRONGER ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD (I.E. THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT'S BLESSING IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN). THE 
NORTH IS AN IMPORTANT COMMON FACTOR. FOR RUSSIA, DEVELOPMENT OF 
THEIR NORTHERN SEA ROUTE WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY AS IT WILL 
PROVIDE A SHORTER LINK TO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING ROUTES.
