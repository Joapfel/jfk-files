Mr. Tweedy. Tha:t ie the wa.y a.11 cabloa were ad.d.reaeed. 
I aee he sent ono specltlca.lly to DCI. 
Mr. Baron. Ott the record . 
{Discussion, off tho rocord.) 
Mr. Baron. Onthe record. 
Let's turn back now. 
I believe while we were ott the record and examlnin9 this 
cable closely you corrected me, Mr. Tweedy, on tho fact that 
this cable was not sent from Leopoldville to the Director but 
rather it was sent from hcodquartcr8 to J~copoldvillo; is 
tha.t correct? 
Mr. Tweedy. Correct . 
Mr. Daron. And it appears to you from the designation 
ftAllen w. Dulles", at the top of the telr.grdm, that this was 
a personal message signed off by the DCI himself to the Chief 
of Station. 
Mr. T'l,.lccdy. Correct. As I said, he might not have 
drafted it but it certainly would have been his sign off. 
Mr. naron. And let me direct your attention to 
the portion of the cable that says in hiqh quarters here it i~ 
th~ clear-cut conclusion that if LLL continues to.hold high 
office the inevitable result will at best he chaon and ~t 
worst pave the way to a Communist takeover of th~ Congo with 
disastrous consec1uences for the prestige of the U.N. dnd for 
the intere9ta of the Free World generally.
