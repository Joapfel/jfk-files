FROM: q .Je~~ (C), OIG/IMO 
SUBJECT: .(AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records 
1. (AIUO) The OIG/IMO received a request from the 
AD/IG/INV to search for records needed to verify certain 
nominees. During the course of this search, the IMP 
discovered what appeared to be the inadvertent destruction 
of permanent OIG records. 
2. (AIUO) The records, cases from 1977, were retired 
in 1980. See exhibit A for a copy of the original ,records 
retirement request. 
3. (C) When form 140 (exhibit A) was approved by the 
Agency Archives and Records Center (AARC) and returned with 
a job number (80-01770R), the records were prepared in 
folders, placed in boxes, and a shelflist was created (see 
exhibit B for shelflist). 
4. (AIUO) Please take notice of the highlighted 
portion of the ~helflist that claims the records disposition 
as 'permanent'. This along with the use of the terminology 
'case no.', led me to believe these were permanent records. 
5. (AIUO) Exhibit C is a completed request (form 
141b) from AARC for authority to destroy these records. All 
·of the records except those listed on a handwritten note 
(exhibit D) attached to form 141b were destroyed. 
6. (AIUO) At this point, I referred to the original 
form 140 (exhibit A) to determine what Records Control 
Schedule (RCS) and Item Number was used to retire these 
records in 1980. I ordered a copy of the old RCS 0:7-76 and 
checked the disposition of item number '3b' (see highlighted 
section of exhibit E). The disposition does allow for the 
lawful destruction of these temporary records.
