MEMORANDUM FOR: JFK Assassination Records Review Board 
VIA: Associate Deputy pirector for Operations . 
_Associate Deputy Director for Operations/Human_ 
Resources and Programs 
FROM: Eric L. Qualkenbush 
Chief.~ Office of Central Cover 
SUBJECT: Proposed CIA Name Release 
1. The Agency strongly objects to the release of names of 
individuals presently under cover, whether active employees or 
separated employees. As described below, this action would 
brea·ch Agency commitments to these indi victuals who agreed to work 
under cover in addition to breaching our obligations to the cover 
providers. 
2. Employees sign a secrecy agreement (Attachment A) upon 
entering on duty with the Agency. This agreement pledges the 
employee's secrecy to information which is classified and has not 
been publicly acknowledged by the Agency and requires the 
employee to protect such information from unauthorized 
disclosure. This secrecy agreement, as long as it remains in 
force by mutual agreement, obliges CIA to protect the identities 
of Agency employees, our cover providers and covert activities. 
3. Because this secrecy agreement creates a moral as well 
as. legal bond between the Agency and the employee, it is Agency­
policy to protect the names of former employees who have 
separated under cover unless the Agency and the employee mutually 
agree to remove the cover. Identifying as CIA those employees 
who are mandated by the Agency to use a cover story, i.e., 
Department of State or the "ABC" Corporation, for their entire 
Agency career as well as into their years after separation from 
the Agency, jeopardizes: 
• the personal safety of former employees;
