It is clear from the record, 1 moreover, that the defeat at the Bay of Pigs 
had been regarded as a humiliation for the President personally and for the CIA 
institutionally. 
By July the Special Group hid agreed that the basic objective ''is- to provide 
support to a U.S. program to <l~velop oppositiori to Castro and to help bring about 
a regime acceptable to the U. S ." '. (Memo for the Record, July 21, 1961.) Occasional 
harrassraent operations were mounted during the summer but there was neither over-
all strategy nor much activi_ty. 
2. National Securitv Action Mernorand~rn 100 of October 5, 1961, and the 
CIA Intelligence Estimate 
The documentary evidence and testir10ny inc"J.cate that in the fall of 1961 
the question of the effect of Castro's removal from po,;.,er aml the prospects in 
that event, for U. S. military intervention were considered by the Kennedy Admini­
stration. 
Two studies -~ere prepared in this connection. -Pursuant to J:!ational Security 
Action Hernorandum _100 ("NS/1.N 100''), the State Department was aske<l to assess the 
potential courses of action open to the U. S. should Castro be removed from the 
Cuban scene, and to prepare a contingency plan with the Department of Defense 
for military intervention in that event. The CIA, prepared an "Intelligence 
Estimate" on the "situation and prospects" in Cuba. As discussed below, the 
evidence indicates that the focus of these studies was on 
of action open to the U. S. in a' post-Castro Cuba, rather 
might bring about Castro's removal. However, it a 
was not e,~clmled frorn the potential means by which 
l1SNI 100
