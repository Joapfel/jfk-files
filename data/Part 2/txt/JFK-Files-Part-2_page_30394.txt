CI staff could be consider1~d as speaking for the Directorate. 
Mr. Goldsmith. Is tht! Domestiq Contact Division part of 
the CI Staff? 
Mr. Tovar. No, part of the Directorat~ of Operations. 
Mr. Goldsmith. • The rEisponse of the Agency dated April

person who read that, whatE,ver document it was, would say, 
"Hmmph! He looks. like,. he might'be interesting", and perhaps 
would then get in contact \.1i th CCD and suggest if they get in 
contact with a person, let us say he is known to be living in i I 
I 
New York, suggest that they might want to seek out his location! I
