SUBJECT: Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations, 
Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973 
1. The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to 
have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D. C, 
(at 1520 16th Str,eet, N. W. ). In the four years of its existence the 
Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing 
house for the study of assassinations. It maintains contact with 
other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be 
at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area. 
2. In addition to research, the Committee acts to heip 
individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus 
files suits for private persons demanding access to classified 
information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles 
relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of 
m.ovies. It publishes a newsletter. 
3. The conference of November 23-24-, 1973, is the first of 
its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University 
was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee 
free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee 
will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a 
repository and research center. 
4. The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay 
of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation 
of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a 
tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an 
attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After 
deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press 
'representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150, 
if that many.
