SUBJECT: THE JFK DECLASSIFICATION EXPERIENCE 
3. Consid~rable skepticism in the public, th~ media, 
and, unfortunately, the Congress results from the in-house 
conclusion that denial is justifiable in the absence of 
"official acknowledgment'' of Executive Branch information, 
even though such information is already in the public 
domain, from senior Agency officials' publications, 
Congressional investigations, books by former Cabinet-level 
NSC members, even Presidents. This inflexible legal 
strategy may win the battle and lose the war. Lawsuits are 
a lot more expensive than negotiation. 
4. The Agency Task Force that in 1992 considered 
some of the aspects of DCI Gates' "openness" phil~sophy 
did not have the benefit of the JFK experience. I sugges'c 
that a senior-level panel be established to consider an 
objective look at the need for continued classification 
of generic versus specific sources and methods information, 
particularly that already in the public domain and when 
dealing with matters of high public or historic interest. 
HR 70-14, referring as it does' in paragraph e. (4) to 
"Guidelines for Declassification'' in Executive Order 12356, 
does not promote the tactical approach which is suggested 
in the Comments section on page eight of the attached.
