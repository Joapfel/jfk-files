Jaffe continued: "Petrovskiy was concerned because 
'The Washington Post• is on.a deliberate kick to defame him. 0 
Jaffe indicated Petrovskiy has been accused of being responsible 
for t:he Soviet Union using the United Nations (UN) for its own 
advantage. Jaffe stated: "He· (Petrovskiy) admits he made a 
mistake. He thought because. it was made-public and was given to 
a group, he was able to publish it, and this has caused 
j 
i embarrassment for the UN.11 Petrovskiy told Jaffe that 0 Robert 
Esterbrook has had two articles· sot·t of attacking me. I admit 
I made a mistake. I was wrong. I told the Secretary General VI 
(of the UN) this. I didn't know.you had a g~oup through which 
this should be cleared: Why should this man continue to attack 
me'? Two articles in 'The Washington Post' and one in the 'Los 
Angeles Times.' 11 Jaffe said Petrovskiy indicated the Secretary 
General of the UN was upset over the incident and Petrovskiy 
wonders if he should try to 11pull the book back" (from publication), 
if it is still possible to do so. 
,,.. Jaffe advised tqs.t the next day he visited the UN and 
talked to Petrovskiy and ,/(F.NU)"Log5.nov/\iho is (Soviet) Press 
Officer here (Washington,-D.,.Ctt) .and used to be Press Officer in 
Moscow., We had a conversation. He said he would be in Washington 
this week and would look me up. Loginov started to discuss the 
Chinese. I said I would like to go thereo He said he had been in 
China and speaks Mandarin., He said he was very·skeptical about one 
poi~t in (United States President) Nixon's press conference, why 
he brought up Czechoslovakia in the press conference. 'Do you 
(Jaffe) think it was a slam at us (Soviets)?' He seemed to read 
a lot of stuff into it. u • .. ~ , ,,
