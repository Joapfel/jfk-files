them intimately and to keep our knowledge 
current. Our performance falls too short. 
A lack of communication and inter-
action between the Director of Central In-
telligence and CIA's counterintelligence unit. 
The present Director lacks counterintelligence 
experience. He has asked for, and received, only 
one two-hour briefing on the subject. Most of his 
predecessors, in contrast, were vitally concerned. 
Through briefings and through operational parti­
cipation they acquired a real familiarity with 
the wide spectrum of counterintelligence and the 
problems that it inevitably engenders. The pres-
ent Director of Central Intelligence, on the 
other hand, has.managed CIA's affairs without 
consulting me or other highly experienced 
counterintelligence officers about Agency opera-
tions, programs or priorities. Those now desig-
nated to succeed us cannot, with the best will in 
the world, make a sudden leap that will carry 
them across decades of intensive, daily experi­
ence acquired by those who already have left the 
Agency and those who are unquestionably leaving 
in the not-too-distant future. Thus counter-
intelligence is left with a growing threat, un­
diminished responsibilities, a sharp reduction 
in capabilities and no- effective access to the 
Agency's top managerial level on substantive 
issues. ..., (' ,·.-. ·,
