28 February 1978 
MEMORANDUM FOR: O/SA/DO/O 
FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
REFERENCE: 
Attention: Mr. Shepanek 
William F. Donnelly 
Chief, Information Services Staff 
House Select Committee on Assassinations 
Request for Information on 201 Criteria (S) 
OLC 78-0070/19, 23 February 1978 
1. (S) With reference to the conversation of 
27 February between Mr. Shepanek and Mr. Cleffi of ISS, 
attached are copies of DOHB 70-1-1, 15 November 1974, 
and an earlier version, CSHB 43-1-1 dated 15 February 1960. 
A close study of the list of questions submitted by the 
HSCA Staff has led us to conclude that the most complete 
and effective way to respond would be by inviting the 
Staff to review our regulation governing the criteria for 
opening, maintaining, controlling and closing 201 files 
by the Operations Directorate. A careful reading of the 
regulation provides an answer to every question posed by 
the Staff. 
2. (S) The earlier version of the regulation is 
included to reflect the situation as it existed in the 
period of their primary concern (1958-1964). The later 
version provides an expansion, clarification and refinement 
of the earlier versions.
