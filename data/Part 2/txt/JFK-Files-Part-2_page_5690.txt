SUBJECT: ( s) Warrenton Training Center Cover Considerations I • 
c. Station D serves as the Agency's primary receiving 
site for world-wide communications. It also handles a 
significant quantity of message traffic for the White House 
and member organizations of the Intelligence Community on a 
24-hour basis. This message traffic is vital to national 
security preparedne·ss. 
WTC's cover allows it to maintain a very ~ow profile. It is that 
low profile which protects the personnel and missions as 
described above. Removal of that protective cover, by act or 
deed, would provide easy targets of.opportunity for ;counter­
intelligence activities, terrorist activities, demonstrations, 
and emotionally unstable individuals. • 
5 .. (S) In summary, any affiliation of WTC an~ the Agency, 
no matter how insignificant the individual occurrence or document 
release may seem, ha_s the very real potential to jeopardize 
lives, disrupt the Agency mission, disrupt woi;-ld-wide classified 
message traffic, and, thereby, do irreparable harm to the 
national security of the United States.
