The 10/1 10:45 call is clearly relevant because the 
caller identifies himself as "Lee Oswald" The 10/1 · ,10:31 
conversation is probably relevant due ·to the similarity with 
the 10/1 • 10:45 call· and the marginal n~tations about 
' 
the quality of the Russian spoken by the caller, The 9/28 11:ST 
call is clearly-relevant, a~ain due to the marginal notations 
and the involvement of Silvia Duran. Duran's calls on 9/27 
clearly related to· Oswald dte to the subs~antive information 
discussed in those calls. 
In summary, the ~bove liste~ calls contain the substance 
of the informatio~ available to the CIA MCS prior to-the. 
assassination from the Soviet electronic intercept operation. 
The -first three calls on 9/;7/63 and the one ~n 10/3/63, 
if they were in~eed Oswald, add little of substance to the 
information that was availal,le from. the-other calls. 
3. When were the In1ercepted Conv~rsations· 
linked to Lee Ha1·vey Oswald. 
l 
HSCA staff-researche1-~ reviewed the transcripts from 
the liaison wiretaps on the Soviet Embassy. The ch~onological 
production from this operat· on is on microfil~ at CIA 
.Headquarters. 480/ In additi,,n to the choronological file, 
numerous copies of the tran:;cripts that pertain to Oswald were 
fo~nd throughout the CIA's ·'il~s on Lee H~rvey Oswald.
