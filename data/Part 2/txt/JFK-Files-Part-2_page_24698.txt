.... 7. The Question of the Level at which the Assassination Plot 
Was Authorized 
The chain of events revealed by the documents and testimony 
is strong enough to permit a reasonable inference that theassas­
Sination plot was authorized by the President. It is clear that 
Allen Dulles authorized the plot. 
At the leas~, the . chronologi•cal relationship between strong 
Presidential or other White House expres.sions. of hostility to 
Lumumba and CIA steps toward the assassination of Lumumba is close 
enough to make it appear that Dulles thought he was.acting in re­
sponse to pressure from above in approving assassination as one 
mean·s of removing Lumumba .from the political scene. 
Nevertheless, there is enough .countervailing testimony by 
Eisenhower Administration officials and enough ambiguity in the 
records of high-level policy meetings to raise a doubt as to whether 
President Eisenhower intended an assassination effort against Lumumba. 
The chain of significant events in the Lumurnba· case begins with 
the testimony that President Eisenhower made a statement at a meet­
ing of the National Security Council in the Summer or early Fall of 
1960 that came across to one staff member in attendance as an order 
for the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. • The next link is a memo­
randum of the Special Group meeting of August 25, 1960, which indi­
cated that when the President's "extremely strong feelings on the 
necessity for very straightforward action" were conveyed, the Special
