• In early 1966 we conducted detailed investigations 
conc~rning six items of possible irregularities (Conflict 
of Interest) on the part of Senator Dodd. These investi­
gations were conducted at the ~pecific request of the 
Department following its review of voluminous documents 
made available by columnist Jack Anderson (Drew Pearson's 
leg man)o These matters have_been under consideration 
by the Department. since May of 1966 w.hen our investigations 
were completed.. 
Today (3/16/67) we received a letter from 
Assistant Attorney General Vinson requesting investigation 
concerning possible election laws violations based on • 
testimony given before the Senate Select Committee on 
Standards and Conduct which is now holding hearings con­
cerning Senator Dodd. Vinson's letter is being analyzed 
and appropriate recommendations will be submitted .
