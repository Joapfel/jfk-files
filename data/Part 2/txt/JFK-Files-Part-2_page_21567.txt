Mr. Madigan. And that was accomplished as far as you kno? 
Mr. O'Connell. The film was made, but they never did 
release it, because things started to get better with the 
leader, and they felt that they wouldn't use it. 
Mr. Madigan. Were Agency facilities used by Maheu for 
the production of this thing? 
Mr. O'Connell 
Los Angeles. 
No. I hired a small independent studio i 
Mr. Madigan. And did Agency officials fly out there, 
the ones that knew about the backdrop and all that? How was 
that done? • 
Mr. O'Connell. It seems to me that they were just --
at this point I .am not too sure whether they superimposed it, 
I guess is the word, with that background. I am not so 
sure at this point, it has been so long ago. That was away in 
the mid-fifties. 
Mr. Wides. Could we get back to the question that we had 
started on, which was the files and where they would exist? 
You said that the operational files from all of your dealing 
with him would be in the Family Jewels, because they were all 
sensitive-admissions.

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
