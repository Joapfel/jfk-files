they•ve only 9ot 18 or 19 thousand people on the Hill to begin with and it 1 s a 
hell of a lot better than what CIA must have: at least 16,000 probably. 
Alone. So look at the Pentagon, look at.the State Department. 
INTERVIEWER: Isn't it interesting that time after time when one talks about 
leaks or when one reads about it, frequently an article in newspaper stories, 
the Congrass is oftentimes the bad guy, the executive department is not very 
bad. 
MR. HALPERN: Well, that•s why I
1
d take another look at that article and it 
leaked the information in it and read it again. And sometimes you wonder, 
hey, it probably didn

up. Not every staff member, for example, on the committees has access to all 
the information anymore. That•s been true for quite a while. Not every 
Senator or Congressman can come and -- well, they better not·take anything 
away from the Hill. None of them can take even thei~not~s away. They•re not 
supposed to make notes of what the hell they are reading. So the days of 
looseness up on the Hill have long since gone on this kind of stuff. 
INTERVIEWER: There have been some.real improvements on it. 
MR. HALPERN: They have learned the hard way. And they really mean it. And 
they realize that their own reputations ~re at stake. Which I think has a big

re~~mber that the House committ~e staff is, in effect, a small professional 
staff now. It's not run the way the Senate committee is run. It's a smaller 
group, they've been there a longer time and the staff director, Latimer, Tom 
La ti mer, has been there from the beginning. It
