Dear Mike: 
On March 4, 1976, Mr. James Johnson of the FBI re­
viewed the Select Committee's dr.aft titled "CIA and FBI 
Mail Opening." James Dick and Thomas Dawson of the Com­
mittee staff revised the draft to meet all security 
problems previously raised by Mr. James Lee of the Bureau, 
and discussed the revisions with Mr. Johnson to make cer­
tain that their concerns were met. 
This letter is' to confirm the fact that, unless I 
receive word to the contrary from you, the Department of 
Justice has no objection to the publication of this report. 
Thanks again for your help throughout the inquiry 
into this subject. 
Copy to Paul Daly 
Sincerely,
