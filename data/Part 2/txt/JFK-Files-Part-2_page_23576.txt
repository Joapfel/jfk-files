' MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT: 
I believe that the concept of a "command operation" for Cuba. udliscuaaed 
with you by the Attorney Oeneral. ts the only effective way to handle an all· 
out attack on. the Cuban problem. Since 1 understand you are favorably db1-
posed toward the idea I will not dlecueur why the present disorganized and 
uncoordinated operation cannot do the job effectively. 
The beauty o! such an operation over the next few months le that we cannot 
lose. If the best happens we will unseat Castro. U not, then at leue we .will 
emerge with a stronger underground. bettel' propqanda and a tar dearer 
idea of the dbnenadou of the prabl@ma: which aUect u. • 
The que1tion then la who should head this operation. I know cf no one cur:rent-
1 y in Cuban aUa!rea at the State Department who can do ilo N~ ls it a very 
good idea to get the State Department involved ln depth in such covert activi­
ties. I do not think it should be centered ln the CIA.. Even if the CIA can find . . 
someone of auf.fic:lent force and stature, one of the major problems will be to 
:revamp CIA operations and thinking •- and this will be TOl'J hard to do from 
the ·ln.slde.. • 
I believe that the Attorney General would be the moat e££ect1ve c::ommande:r of 
such an operation. Either I or 111omeone else ehould be arHtlgncd to him as 
Deputy for thia activity, since he obv101,u1ly will not be able to devote full time 
• to it. The one danger here ls that lie might become too c:lo1ely identW.ed with 
what might not be a aucce1sful operation.. Indeed., chances of succ::eaa are very 
speculative. Tlare are a lew anawc.r111; to thb:

(1) Everyone knowledgeable In these aUalrs .. ..; ln and out of govern­
ment -- la aware that the United Stat.el la already helping the underground. . , 
The precl&Ht manner of aid may be unknown but. the fact of aid ls c::om.mon 
knowledge. We will~ blamed tor not winning Cuba back whether or not we 
have a "comm.and operation" and whether or not the Attorney General heads it.
