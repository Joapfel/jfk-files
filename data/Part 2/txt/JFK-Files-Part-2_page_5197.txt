most cases a substitution for the true name be used. In 
prior releases of these same documents, the Review Board 
agreed to redact the true name and substitute ~source.* If 
the Review BQard is concerned about tracking particular 
sources throughout the records, a particular identifying 
substitution can be used for an individual source throughout 
(for example, "Mexican source 1 •) . 
18. (S) Among the names that are currently being 
considered for release by the Review Board, the following 
are some that the CIA proposes be treated in this manner: 
• True name of LIRING/3, an encrypted ass~t of the 
--'SI~fe:Jld _llriT~ate 7al--pe-ne'tratfon of the- Cuban\ 
~----Embassy_~ -~-1_fJl-Wl..f_e also workeg_at-:-the. Emb_al:lsX. an<:3-
he was apparently suspected as be~ng CIA though it 
was never proven. LIRING/3 at some point 
disappeared and we have no way of knowing what his 
current situation is. 
• True name of ERTHYROID/3 ,)the unilateral~ 
(~ne_!-E_~tJon__::_6~[.j:Jie-~i<i:ar.aguan Servic~ .) The Review 
Board will recall that it has already been fully
