'
being requested for clearance for our initiation of program to develop

For a number of years, we have ·had a program to develop live 
• sources in official establishments of noncommunist countries, designated 
as "target" countries, because of presence of certain significant factors. 
·Japan has not previously been designated as a "target" country. 
State Department ·"secret" Research Memorandum RFE-36, dated 
6-17--64 on "Communist China's Policy for Establishing ·l)iplomatic Relations,' 0 
. reports that Peiping's interest in~expanding its network of diplomatic 
ties has significantly increased in past three years. :communist China. now 
bas diplo~atic telations with 48 count~ies and, becau~e of its recent 
successes and continued intensive efforts, . it may soon :·overtake 
Nationalist China which has recognized 60 countries. ftccording to the. 
memorandU!Il, this is liable to have -immense effect on Chinese repres·entation 
in international organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN).

According to State Department, Japan is the number one target on; ,) 
Communist China's diplomatic horizon and an intensive step~by-st~p :\' 
. cultivation of Japan is under way. CIA's "Secret" Special/Re~'t, "The . ., 
•• China Problem in Japanese Politics," dated 5-1-64, report~f ·v.tt in Japan. 
• supporters of the Japanese Government feel that developmqhtiof Japan's 
informal relations wilI: ripen into full-fledged diploma¢c relations with '<>. 
Communist China. 
. . 
The fact that trade between Japan and Communist China is on the ,~ 
increase certainly can be expected to encQurage establishment of (>, • 
·diplomatic relations between these countries in the not too far distant .. ,f 
~\ future. In 1963, this trade increased 60 per cent ove~ 1962 and it is ~ 
\ expected to take another big jump in _1964. Further, the Communist Party "' 
\ of Japan (CPJ) is urging close ties with China. This organization of :tE 
' approxim~ tely 105,000 members has· taken the side of Communist China in ~.ts
