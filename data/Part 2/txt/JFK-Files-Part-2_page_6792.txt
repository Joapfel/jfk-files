Fifth and finally, section 6 of the joint resolution, which . • 
outlines the grounds for postponement of public release-of a 
document, makes no provision for postponing release of 
documents that may contain Executive privilege or deliberative 
process, attorney-client, or attorney work-product information. 
While such privileges could be waived in the public inte~est and, 
in fact, are not likely to arise with respect to· factual information 
directly related to the JFK assassination, they would be 
unavailable under the joint resolution in the rare case that they 
might be needed. 
These are technical problems that we believe can be solved 
in ways that will, in fact, expedite the release of documents 
bearing on_the assassination of President Kennedy. 
But, again, whatever the future course of this legislation, 
CIA is proceeding even now to review for declassification the 
relevant documents under its control. Further, we will cooperate 
fully with any mechanism established by the Congress and the 
President to declassify all of this material.
