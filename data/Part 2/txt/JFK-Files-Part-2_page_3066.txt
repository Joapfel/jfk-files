of US business groups as a cover for the Agency's 
support of the Cuban opposition, particularly the 
use of US business as a funding mechanis~, was also 
hazardous in the eyes of the author of the memorandum 
under study. If the author was correct in·assuming 
that this cover would not withstand careful scrutiny, 
it. would mean that the anti-American contingents would. 
have additional ammunition to use against the US. 
The memorandum suggested that many of these risks 
could be eliminated if propaganda activities were 
' 
moved to Third countries and if fund raising activi-. .

Based on the, language, the familiarity with the 
Guatemala activity and the nature of the critique, 
it is probable that Tracy Barnes wrote the memorandum 
in question. The memorandum may have been prompted 
in part by the increasing attention which the OCB and 
the c.abinet. had been giving to fire bomb attacks on 
the Cuban cane fields by light aircraft flying out 
of the·united States. The Agency fully supported Gen­
erai Quesada's effort to put an end to such flights.* 30/ 
* Quesada was Director of the Federal Aviation Agency.·
