4. In addition to the "category II" items, there are 
a number of additional subjects largely geographic in.nature 
for which the DCI feels CIA should assume respo~sibility 
for preparing comprehensive papers. In view of the • 
apparent ad~ersary relationship between the Senate Select 
Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation·, it may 
be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with 
specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency 
probing and result ~ri a positive solution to proble~s before 
they aris~.

1n·rormed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga·­
tions whi9h will clearly impact on his agency's affairs. At

under way indicate a possible communication _gap in adequately·
