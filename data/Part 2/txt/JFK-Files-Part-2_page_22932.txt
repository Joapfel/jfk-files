Mr. Kelley. Who was Mr. Gordon Chase? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, he was an assistant of mine at the time 
with special responsibilities for Cuban affairs, and perhaps 
more widely in Latin America. He was at that time a foreign 
service officer secunded to the White House.

Mr. Kelley. Did he provide staff assistance to you with 
respect to tha Special Group or the Special Group (Augmented)?

Mr. Dundy. Well, he may have done in some exceptional 
case wh~n I needed his opinion on a matter, but in ordinary 
cases he would not have been party to Special Group work. 
Mr. Kelley. What kind of things did he do with the 
special responsibility for Cuba? What did that-' involve? 
Mr. Bundy. He would be keeping in touch with the Cuban 
Task Force, which by this time was in the Department of State, 
the MONGOOSE operation having been disbanded. He would have 
been responsible for ke~ping me alert to matters that were 
proceeding in that Task Force that might have an implication for 
the White House. 
Mr. Kellay. Who was the h~ad of the Cuban Task Force? 
Mr. Bundy. Well I don't want to get this wrong, but I 
think by this timl:l it was Mr. Crimmins.
