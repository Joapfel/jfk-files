~104'?10422-1oos7]. [ 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 [ 
30 October 1975 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Chief, CI Meeting with Mr. Paul Wallach, Chief 
Counsel of Senate Select Committee on Intel­
ligence 
This meeting occurred on Wednesday, 29 October 1975 
as a result of concern on the part of Senate Select 
Committee officers that the Agency was not forthcoming 
with file material related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case, 
i.e. , the assassination of President Kennedy. The 
following points were made by the principals as indicated. 
Chief, CI - To open the meeting Mr. Kalaris made it clear 
that the Agency is anxious to demonstrate that we have 
nothing to hide and that all pertinent material was made 
available to the War·ren Commission. He added that the 
procedure for making material available to the_ Senate 
Staff posed certain pr~blems with regard to sources, 
methods and liaison, which were delaying the turnover of 
material. He then presented several examples of the 
sanitization process in which cables taken directly from 
the 201 file were· edited so that all ·evidence of source, 
method and liaison information was removed. 
Chief Counsel - As an opening reply Mr. Wallach stated 
that his position was that he conside~ed that the Senate 
Committee should have the same access as the Rockefeller 
Commission. He added that in his discussions with several 
senators on his committee they had mentioned reports that 
a Rockefeller reviewing official by the name of Belin who· 
had had access to the original file>had appeared on several 
talk shows and was going to write a book based on his 
review of Agency_holdings on the Oswald case. 
Chief, CI - Mr. Kalaris then pointed out that there were 
certain pariictilarly sensitive asp~cts of the material 
which could not be released for use outside of the building.
