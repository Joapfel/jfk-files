-Washington and New York City was•too remote to warrant expenditure of mzin­
powcr and money.for purpose of endeavoring to expand program in this 
direction at this time. With regard to relaxing requirement that potcntiz}I 
sources be interviewed under suitable pretext, preferably of a cri1ninal 
natur~, Conference .felt we are operating in too delicate an area to let 
do~n safeguards at this tioe. Conference agreed that New York and 
Washington Field Offices should, on a highly selective basis, endeavor to 
dcv~lop higl1er-level sources ~~ere situation_ permits such efforts by • 
making approaches to them through sources currently being operated on 
lower levels (such as chauffeur~ clerks, secretaries, et cetera, in diplo­
matic _establishments). This will be done. 
AJ)~lINJSTRATIVE CONTROTS: 
. _Controls are.exercised on day-to-day basis through review of 
outgoing instructions to field. Teclmical surveillances are subject to 
90-day evaluations. No interviews are conducted of potential sources with­
ou! specific State Department clearance. Control file is mai11tained.to 
,J11ch copies of pertinent correspondence are regularly routed. Semi-
annual evaluation of program encompasses review of control file.
