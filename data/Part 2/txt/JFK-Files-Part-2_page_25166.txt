Jn August 26, 1963, in a CIA document entitled "ONE Staff Memorandum, No. 60-63, Internal ONE 
,vorking Paper, CIA Distribution Only, 11 the following statement appears: 
'On balance, we believe the best hope for the preservation of US interests and attainment 
)f US objectives in South Vietnam lies in the possibility of a coup d'etat by anti-Communist 
1ationalists with suffic:lent military support to obviate prolonged civil war. Such a p:roup 
nlr,:ht not prove able to salvae;e the situation and, indeed, might eventually prove no better 
:han the present rep;ime. Such a deveJ.opment would, however, enable the US and anti-Communist 
1ationalist elements to make a fresh start .unencwnbered and unhampered by political errors of 
)ast years, months, and weeks. In such a fresh start, we believe, lies the only viable hope 
'or the attainment of US interests and objectives in South Vietnam. 11 (8)
