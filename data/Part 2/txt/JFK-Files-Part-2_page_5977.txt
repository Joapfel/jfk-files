1. Per the Review Boa:::-d sta:: f's :::-e~est the followi:ig 
is a brief explanation of how the_pirector.ate of Ope~at1ons. 
(DO) proc.essed -cables· in the ·1963/19.64 t_i,me-.frame. ··As ·we··

· .... ahd ''i'ri. a.Ti ,.p'i:-~babili ty none ever existed, the info::::-mation ' 
provided is based solely on the rna~ory of DO officers 
familiar with procedures in place at the time. 
2. Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed 
its own registry. Although each registry was configured to 
meet each division's unique requirements, there were common 
functions performed by all the re~.:.stries to include: 
collecting, sorting,· and celiveri~g of incomi:ig cables; 
maintenance of incoming and outgo.:.~g cable ftchronos*; 
collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouc~ 
material; and the issua::1ce and maintena~ce of ~pseudo and 
alias* card files. 
3. To the specific q~estion regarding processing of 
cables, on a daily basis, usually six day pe~ week, each 
registry collected its incoming canle traffic from a central . • h 1 1 • ""h C • 1 S • • • • .I'

a~c were f=equently alte:::-ed to mee: cha~ging operational 
requirements. Sorted cables were ~~en delivered to specific 
operational/area desks .. A nc~rono~ copy of each was 
maintained, on a temporary ~asis, usually for 90 days and 
then destroyed, 
4. Outgoing cables we:::-e created and coordinated by 
appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by 
the c~ief of the division o= a designated releasing officer. 
~Released• cables were then ha..~d delivered or sent by 
pneumatic tube system ( a syst"em long ago dismantled from 
the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariate 
for processing into the Agency's communication network. 
~chronow copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the 
registry for a 90 day hold and then destroyed. 
5. I~ is important to note that the cable scenario 
outlined he::-e is general in nature and that throughout their 
existence registries and their procedures were frequently 
altered until the registry system as described above was 
eliminated in the mid-1980's.
