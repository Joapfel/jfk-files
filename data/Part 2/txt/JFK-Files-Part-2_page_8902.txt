In 1964 NOSENKO cLi.ir11od that he had been dealing with 
TSYMBAL 2ince 1960 or 1961, when he was looking for some 
candidates for recruitment and came across some whose baci~­
g~ound would have made them suitable for the Special filleg~'~: 
Directorate. NOSENKO met TSYMBAL in Moscow in the KGB Head­
quarters and TSYMBAL hud asked him several times to transfer 
to the First Chief Directorate and suggested that he might be 
assigned to the United States. In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL had 
dinner together several times a week, sometiLles accompanied 
by KISLOV and sometimes alone. It was TSYMBAL's influence, 
NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access to the residency 
in 1962 and established tlw precedent from which he was 
granted access in 1964.
