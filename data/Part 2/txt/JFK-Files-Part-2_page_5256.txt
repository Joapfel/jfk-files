SUBJECT: JFK Review Board Actions on CIA Records 
4. The DO Position: The Acting Deputy ,Director for, 
Operations reluctantly acquiesces to the release in full of the 
16 documents with the exception of two that contain the names of 
two Agency employees who retired in covert status. The Do·.argues 
that acknowledging these officers could expose them to physical 
danger, possibly threaten past operations and individuals with· .. , 
whom they worked, and abrogate our agreement to protect their 
identities. The two documents (#104-10015-10052 an_d #104-1005-
10153) and the DO's argument for the continued protection oT the 
two former employees are attached. {S) 
5 CSI Position: After consultation with OGC, we.rdt>:-'not 
believe the oo•s damage argument would merit Pr~sidential j . 
reversal of· the Board's decision. The Board's staff has advfsed 
that in the absence of "clear and convincing evidence" of a 
threat to the personal safety of a retired officer if his or her 
employment were revealed, the Board does not believe the JFK Act 
permits withholding names. The DO does not cite evidence that 
the two of~icers would be in physical danger. Furthermore, OGC 
advises that the DO's current policy of liberally rolling back 
cover for career covert officers who ask to be retired overt 
would seriously undermine the credibility of such an appeal. (S)
