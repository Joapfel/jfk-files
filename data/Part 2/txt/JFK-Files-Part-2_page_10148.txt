SSC Letter Dated February 18, 1976 
FEB 2 o 19_76 
• 
Attached is a lettet from the Senate S~lect 
Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests 
interviews with FBI agents who wrbte various mem-
.oranda concerning the Black Panther Party in Chicago. 
Because such interviews might impair the Department's 
ability to conduct a defense in the ____ triaL in 
Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand­
ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate 
response to Senator Church's letter. One possible re­
sponse would be to provide the SSC with the transcripts 
of the FBI agents testimony at the trial concerning 
these memoranda, in~tead of allowing the SSC to inta~­
vie.w these agents. We wou·ld appreciate it ·if: the FBI 
would also consider what response would be appropriate 
. to this lett.er .
