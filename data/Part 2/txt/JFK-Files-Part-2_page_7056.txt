closure-oriented than President Reagan's 
order. The current Executive Order applies to 
all Executive branch records and, unlike the 
JFK Act, requires agencies to engage in a sys­
tematic declassification of all records more 
than 25 years old. The Executive Order gives 
agencies five years-until April 2000-to 
declassify all classified information that is (1) 
more than 25 years old, and (2) is of perma­
nent historical value unless the "agency 
head" determines that release of the informa­
tion would cause one of the nine enumerated 
harms. The Executive Order provides for 
continuing protection for sources and meth­
ods where disclosure would damage the 
national security. It also protects, inter alia, 
information that involves diplomatic· rela­
tions, U.S. cryptologic systems, war plans 
that are still in effect, and protection of the 
President. 8 • 
The JFK Act guidelines 
that governed the disclo­
sure of records relating to 
the assassination of Pres­
ident Kennedy were 
detailed in section 6 of 
the JFK Act.9 The JFK Act 
allowed the Review Board to postpone the 
release of assassination recor_ds only where 
the agencies provided clear and convincing 
evidence that one of five enumerated harms 
would occur if the Review Board released 
the record and that the harm outweighed 
the public interest in disclosure. The statute 
allowed protection of intelligence agents 
and intelligence sources and methods if the 
agency could show that the agent, source, 
or method currently required protection. 
The statute further allowed the Board to 
protect the identity of living persons who 
provided confidential information to the 
government if the agency could show that 
disclosure of the person's identity would 
pose a substantial risk of harm to the per­
son. The JFK Act allowed the Review Board 
to postpone release of information if release 
would constitute an unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy or if release would com­
proµ,.ise the existence of an understanding 
of confidentiality between a government 
agent and a cooperating individual or for­
eign government. Finally, the JFK Act 
allowed the Review Board to protect cw­
rent information concerning protection of 
government officials. 
2. Key Distinctions Between Standards 
of Release Under the FOIA, the Execu­
tive Order, and the JFK Act 
In considering whether the JFK Act was nec­
essary to guarantee public access to assassi­
nation records, Congress evaluated the effec­
tiveness of both the FOIA and the 
then-current Executive Order 12356. Both the 
House and the Senate concluded that the 
FOIA and the Executive Order, as adminis­
tered by the executive branch, had failed to 
guarantee adequate public disclosure of 
assassination records. 
At the time that the JFK Act became law, the 
largest collections of records concerning the 
assassination were under the control of the 
FBI, the CIA, and the Congressional Commit­
tees who investigated the assassm.ation. The 
FOIA provides special protections for each of 
these entities, and thus could not serve as the 
mechanism for maximum disclosure of 
assassination records. First, the FOIA 
exempts CIA operational files from disclo­
sure. 10 Second, the FOIA provides broad­
based protection for law enforcement files 
and therefore allows the FBI to protect a sub­
stantial amount of its information from dis­
closure.11 Third, the FOIA does not apply to 
unpublished Congressional records. u Con­
gress found that the FOIA did not require 
adequate disclosure in those records that it 
did cover. Thus, Congress believed that the 
FOIA was not a satisfactory mechanism for 
guaranteeing disclosure of assassination 
records. 13
