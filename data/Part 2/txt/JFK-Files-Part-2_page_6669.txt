begin review for declassification immediately of this material. And, indeed, as I 
speak,· the reviewers are going through a substantial number of documents, and I 
anticipate that many of these will be released shortly. • 
As we carry out our program. to declassify Kennedy assassination documents, our 
goal will be to release as many as possible. In fact, I recently approved a new CIA 
declassification guideline for our Historical Review Program which specifically di­
rects a presumption in favor of declassification. I believe we can be verr forward 
leaning in making these documents available to the public, and I have mstructed 
the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to heart. 
To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in reviewing these documents 
for declassification, it is important to place them in some context. The CIA's collec­
tion of documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy consists of ap­
proximately 250,000-300,000 pages of material. Thia includes 64 boxes of copies and 
originals of information provided to the Warren Commission and the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald accu­
mulated after President Kennedy's assassination. Unfortunately, and for reasons 
that I do not know, what we are dealing with is a mass of material that is not in­
dexed, is uncatalogued, and is lliJhly disorganized-all of which makes the review 
process more difficult. The material contains everything from the moat sensitive in­
telligence sources to the moat mundane news clippings. 
These records include .documents that CIA had in its files before the assassina­
tion, a large number of records that CIA received later as routine disseminations 
from other agencies, as well as the reports, correspondence, and other/apers that 
CIA prepared in the courae~of'. the asaa.aaination investigations. I shoul emphasize that these records were asaem ,led into the present collection as a result of specific 
inquiries received from the W en Commission or the House Select Committee on 
Assasainationa. I have pre a chart that illustrates this point. 
As you can see, prior to i>re.ident Kennedy's aaaeasination, CIA held only a small 
file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of SS documents (approximately 110 
pages), some of which originated with the FBI, State Department, the Navy, and 
. newspaper clippings. Only 11 documents originated with the CIA. I have brought 
along a copy of Oswald's file as it existed before the assassination so that you can 
see first,.hand how slender it was at the time. As I have already noted, we have de­
classified the CIA documents in this file with quitf! minirnal deletions, and we are 
providing them to the National Archives. The records in this tile dealt with Os­
wald's defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 and his activities after his. return in 
1961. By contrast, it. was only after the assassination that CIA accumulated the rest 
of the material on Oswald-some SS,000 pagea-moat of which CIA received from 
other agencies after November 22; 1963. • • • • . 
You have asked about documents in our possession ,enerated by other agencies. 
In fact, much of the material held by CIA ·originated with other agencies or depart­
ments. For example, in the 17 boxes of Oswalcl records; approximately 40 percent of 
the documents originated with the FBI, and about 20 percent originated from the 
State Department or elsewhere. Our staff' is still going through tlie material com­
piled at the request of the Warren Commission and the House Sel~ Committee on 
Assesslnatiomi, which includes 63 boxes of paper records and one box that contains 
72 reels of microfilm. The microfilms, in part, overlap material in other parts of the 
collection. We estimate that within the 6S boxes of paper records, approximately 27 
pel'.CeDt of the. documents originated with a: variety of other U.S. Government agen-
cies, private organizations, and foreign and American press. • • 
Although our holdings do include man_y doc;uments from other agencies, we none­
theless have a substantial collection of CIA documents that will require considerable 
effort to review, and as I said earlier, at my direction, this review for declassifica• 
tion is now underway. A preliminary survey of these files has provided us some in­
dications of what they contain, Although the records cover a wide variety of topics, 
they principally focus on CIA activities concerning Cuba and Castro, Oswald's defec­
tion to the Soviet Union, and Oswald's subsequent activities in Mexico City and 
New Orleans. They also include a large. number of name traces requested by the 
staff of the House Select Committee on Asaeasinations, as well as material relating 
to the Garrison invest.igation and Cuban exile activities. • 
The CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally because of the limits 
in the Privacy Act (which protects the iiames of Amencan citizens against unau­
thorized disclosure), the sequestration of many documents by the House Select Com• 
mittee on Assassinations, and the fact that many of'the documents belong to ~en­
cies other'than CIA. However, we have·alread_y taken steps to lift.the sequestration, 
coordinate with other agenci~ and to begin the process of declassification. If neces-
