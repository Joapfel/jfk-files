In view of subsequent developments, one inter­
esting suggestion made by the Inspector General in 
No'vember 1957 was the following: 
On the island of Cuba, probably only 
a US citizen, in some way known to be 
connected with the US Government and 
"assumed" to be backed by Washington, 
would.have the ability to act as inter­

groups in the Batista Government and 
work out a possible "cease fire." This 
would have to be done covertly, and any 
results achieved either not ever publicly 
announced or certainly not advertised 
until after the election. Any public 
attempt to bring peace would be fore­
doqm.ed to failure by each side probably 
indicating exorbitant demands and then 
being unable to withdraw from its 
announced position.* 9/

time Kirkpatrick was thinking of William D. Pawley, 
former US Ambassador to Brazil and. Peru and an 
American :businessman who:operated significant enter­
prises in Cuba, to negotiate with Batista. Within 
a year's time, Pawley, • who also stood high in the 
ranks.of the Republic Party contributors, was desig..;. 
nated to undertake such a mission to Cuba.
