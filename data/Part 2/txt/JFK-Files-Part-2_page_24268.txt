B. Size of U.S. Financial Stakes 
The size and variety of U.S. Government financial stakes in 
CIA proprietaries has already b~en described in great detail. 
The attached Table I gives an overview of proprietary income and 
expenditures over the years. Some 450 proprietaries have been 
created over the years with 20 presently active (See Table II.) 
The largest sixteen proprietaries received about 80% of U.S. in­
vestment (i.e., subsidies). Accordingly, most proprietaries are 
shown to be small-scale operations. In many cases -- the so-called 
"notionals" -- the overseas proprietary actually conducts no business 
at all; it simply has a commercial charter, staff, and cover arrange­
ments for Agency collection and action projects. 
Table I also shows that proprietary income consists of a mixture 
of CIA subsidy and income. In some cases, the outside income is 
from sources outside the U.S. Government income -- e.g .. Air America 
has received income for aircraft maintenance of KLM airliners in 
Southeast Asia. But for the most part, proprietary income is in the 
form of "cross-orders," from CIA and other Government Agencies .. 
For example, the CIA paramilitary p~oject in the Congo placed orders 
for aircraft engines and pilot services with Intermountain Aviation, 
Inc. As an example of order placed by other U.S. Government Agencies, 
AID contracted with Air America to carry rice shipments in Laos. 
In this sense, many proprietaries are analagous to what are called 
0 intragovernmental funds" or "industrial funds" in traditional U.S. 
Government budget and accounting terms. 
Table I shows, and as we remarked previously, that compared 
with earlier years, the size of proprietary expenditures has markedly 
declined. The potential for future expansion is nevertheless present.
