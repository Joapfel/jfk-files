Novel occurred in 1975 and there is.no.apparent reason 
for Novel having singled otit Mr. Osborn as a defendant. 
Mr~ Jameson also requested traces on two individuals 
who.are alleged _oh ye been involved in this matter--
r • a: d • e P • ffe H~. was advised 
tH Office of Securit ad d.-0f either of 
these individuals. 
3. Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably . 
be receiving a formal.request for p~rtinent information ·/ 
as thi~ ca~e:devel~ps, but he merely need~d-a preliminary 
reading in o~der to determine if Mr .. Osborn should be 
defended by the Department of. Justice in this litigation. 
Aside from indexing the-names of Blansc~tt and.Pfiffer to 
Novel's file, no :further action is contemp],ated by the 
undersigned. •
