to normal activity. Though most of the dart launchers used in these develop­
ments \~ere developed for the Army, the Agency did request the development of a 
small hand-held dart launcher for its peculiar needs. 
Clearly a lot of work was done on human incapacitation. OTS apparently 
received continuing requests for safe, effective and rapidly acting, incapacitat­
ing devices. Much work ~1as done in trying to use the dart system for such 
l 
purposes, but real success was never actually achieved. Since larger amounts 
of appropriate agent are required to incapacitate a human than to kill him, no 
scheme was developed for introducing sufficient amounts through the use of darts. 
Attempts were made to solve this problem increasing the area of the darts 
available for coating and for making a dart which would dissolve in tissue 
which could thereby introduce more material into the system. Hark on this pro­
ject 1·1as underway when the association ~iith SOD .ended and Edgewood Arsenal 
endeavored to complete the project using unexpended Fort Detrick funds. Success 
.ias.not achieved, however. One reason for the preoccupation of those involved in 
the project with the incapacitant problem may well· have been the substantially 
greater difficulty of solving it when compared to developing lethal mechanisms. 
Substantial work was also done for the Agency in the development of spoilants 
for agrlcultura~ products, biological materials for the ~ontamination of petroleum 
stores, and agents for use in the destruction of electronics, optical systems, 
structural materials, etc. At times in the history of the project, requirements 
for such materials as these were apparently very high on the Agency's list.
