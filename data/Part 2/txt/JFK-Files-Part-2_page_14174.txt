Intelligence Community Staff of a registry for documentation , 
relating to the Congressional investigation~, and furnished 
you with a format for abstracts to be provided to the registry 
on each formal input to a Select Committee. In addition to 
having in the registry the abstracts or, as appropriate, the 
actual papers submitted as documentation to a Select Committee, 
it is important that we establish a method for reporting on 
interviews. Accordingly, I am enclosing a proposed format 
for abstracts to be used for reporting on interviews by 
Congressional Committee members or staff with your personnel 
which involve information on Community activities or which, in 
your judgment, raise the possibility of follow-on queries else­
where concerning the functioning or activities of ~he Community.
