Arrangment of security index 
a.. At Bureau 
Entire index is maintained on IBM tabulating cards. Security index 
cards are printed by automatic data processing and transmitted to 
field. An alphabetical breakdown of true names and all aliases of 
subjects is also maintained at Bure.au for administrative purposes. 
b. In field office 
Active security index in each field office is maintained in four 
sections: geographical, alphabetical, unavailable, and spectal sec­
tions. Complete set of each field office's s~curity index is alio 
maintained away from headquarters city in same manner as geographical 
section with unavails.ble and special section cards filed in ha.ck. 
(1) Geographical section 
(2) 
After receipt of three security index cards from Bureau and ~fter 
necessary data have been added to two cards, file one in geo­
graphical section of index {except special section and un­
available section cards) and one in duplicate set maintained away 
from headquarters city. Geographical ·section is broken down by 
residence address in accordance with needs of each office. Where 
logical, it should be broken down by state, county, city, and, 
if needed, into boroughs or suburbs and precincts. Cards are 
filed alphabetically under each geogra·phical breakdown. Cards 
in this sect ion will be withdrawn and used by Agents should 
apprehension of subjects become·necessary. 
Ca.rds will show "unknown" residence for (a.) subjects whose 
addresses are ·not known but prompt location within division is 
expected and (b) subjects whose location in another division 
is in process of verification. File these cards in breakdown 
designated "Verification Pending." With Bureau authority, 
offices covering large industrial areas may set up second geo­
graphical section and file cards by subjects' employment. 
Depending on tima of day apprehensions are initiated, geograph­
ical-employment or geographical-residence section may be used. 
Alphabetical section 
File duplicate ca.rd alphabetically ~n this section; there is no 
other breakdown. Alphabetical card is control card. If card 
is vrithdrawn from geographical section t·or apprehension, make 
notation on alphabetical card.
