Memorandum .Mr o Donahoe to Mr .. Belmont. Re: Intelligence Coverage :of ••• 
Friendly Foreign CoWltfies 
the person interviewed. _The: Conference was of the opinion that 
this requirement should not be. relaxed since we are dealing in a 
most delicate area and must proceed with all possible precautionary 
measures. It was noted the procedures we have followed in the • 
past have been successful and that alteration of such procedures 
is certainly not mandatory at this timeo ·'., 
,.' 
Third question related to the possibility:-,of utilizing 
_sources which we have already developed to reach ·higher-level 
sources. In this connection; it may be noted most of our present 
sources occupy clerical or secretarial positions in the various 
establishments where they are employedo The Conference felt that 
on a highly selective basis we might be able to work through one 
or more of these lower-level employees to develop some official 
in the same establishment who would be willing to cooperate with 
.the FBI. This would permit the acquisition of higher-level 
intelligence data r~lating to the specific country involved. 
The Conference was of the opinion that the New York and Washington 
Field Offices which handle all but a very few of the sources 
already established, should be alert for any possibilities of 
. stepping up our intelligence acquisition methods 'in this manner. 
Those two offices agreed to do thiso • 
ACTION~ 
. This disposes of the three questions raised in referenced • 
memorandum. No further action is necessary. ~
