and may assume that such advice and 
acknowledgement on our part would be 
Agency approval for his activities. 
While such is not the case, it is 
believed that we should formalize 
this part of our contract with him 
so that he knows that his personal 
activities, regardless of area, are 
not construed as an extension of 
Agency plans or programs. At the 
same time, Subject can be assured 
of our continuing interest in him 
as a "standby" asset. 
"Should you have any questions 
concerning this subject, I would be· 
pleased to discuss them further."
