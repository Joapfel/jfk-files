Mr. Tweedy, I auopect that waa the first cable that 
ever went out. In other words, the firnt cable that ever 
~cnt out to Larry Hodgman. He must have realized, he would 
have been perfectly clear on hie end, the way one's minds were: 
running even though it was purely a·.cOnt~hqency. 
Mr. Daron. I am sorry. I don't think I under8tood 
that. 
You say the first cable that went out. 
Mr, Tweedy. That waa the first way that Hedgman was 
ever adviaed that there was any thinking of that kind in 
Washington, wae via our cable. I am sure he wasn't back in 
the States over anything of this kind . 
Mr. Baron. Today you distinctly remember a cable sent? 
Mr. Tweedy. I think 1 remember that much more distinct­
ly than anything I remember in the last few minutes that it 
was a cable which asked him to be thinking of that. 
Mr. Daron. That was pursuant to your conversat'ion 
with Mr, BiGsell? 
M.r. Tweedy. That was, 
Mr. Daron. Oid you send that c~ble or Mr. Disscll 
nend that cable. 
Mr. Tweedy. It probohly would have been a cable I 
wouldhave written and probably released by him. 
Hr. Baron. Do you know what was in that cable? 
Mr, Tweedy, God knows,J don't.
