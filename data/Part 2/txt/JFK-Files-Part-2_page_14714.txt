as a prime suspect. From·a check of latent fingerprints 
against those of white male fugitives for whom "wanted" 
notices had been placed in the files of. the FBI Identification 
. Division, James Earl Ray was. determined' to be the true 
identity of Eric s. Galt. At the request of the FBI, Canadian 
. authorities determined that a Canadian passport had been 
issued to Ray in the name of Ramon George Sneyd, and on 
June ·s, 1968, Ray was arrested by Scotland Yard when he 
presented the Sneyd passport to travel from London to 
Brussels. At the conclusion of extradition proceedings,
