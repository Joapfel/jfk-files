the clandestine operator enough so that pretty soon the clandestine operator 
was captive of the analyst .and would be doing his research for him. And we 
had plenty of calls from DOI analysts which in effect, the answers were in the 
Library of Congress, for God's sake go get them. He are not going down there 
and get them for you and we are not going.to buiden the field people with

US Government, don't get me·wrong, but not the Clandestine Service. The
