is that right? 
Mr. Madigan. I Cubella is in 
the strict context of the memos, operatin, on his own.' 
The Chairman. Well, I believe rather than speculate, we 
had bc,tter look back carefully, and that.ought.to be another 
subject for Mr. Helms when he returns •. • 
Senator Mondale. Well, then I will\stand corrected. 
Senator Hart of Michigan. Would you yield? 
I want to make the same record note that I suspend the 
comment I made about that document yesterday. I thought it was 
a flat-out lie. 
Stlnator llondale. I did too. I withdraw that, and I think 
it wouid be good if the staff would write us a little memo. 
Senator Baker. Fritz might like to know that yestdrday I 
asked Counsel if they, as a combined staff operation, would 
prepare for us, and I believe they agreed to do this, prepare 
for us two briefs, one citing the testimony and the exhibit 
evidence, that would support an inference that the authority 
was Presid~ntial; and another brief, citing the record and the 
exhibit evidtlnce citing the inference that it was not. There 
is an abundance of both, to.be frank with you. So that we 
can lay them down side by side and make our owu s~parate 
judgment . 
Do I understand the staff is goinq to do it? 
The Chairman. That is right.
