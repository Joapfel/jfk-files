• If they do not, the 6~her service may escape damage fully 
or to some degree. 
• This is the critical question that a foreign country must 
answer and it is the critical information that we must 
protect vis-A-vis defectors in our fold.

• In the matter at hand, we are very constrained by what the 
Russian government knows by virtue of their own knowledge and 
what they have acquired from the substantially released 
document and the Los Angeles Times article. 
• The Russians know that Sergei PAPUSHIN (i.e., IJDECANTER) 
defected to the United States; 
• they know or suspect what he told the US; 
• they know or suspect that we fully understood the import 
of what he said; 
• they do not know, however, whether we be_1ieved him and 
thus incorporated his information into our operationa1 
practices and activities. 
• And it wou1d be cri tica11y damaging today to confirm to 
the Russians the fina1 piece of the PAPUSHIN puzz1e and 
a11ow them to have the u1timate benefit from what 
heretofore has been a US inte11igence success.

• In sum, question 4 -- bona fides -- is the CI key. 
• The CIA to date has released all of the substantive 
information relating to IJDECANTER in this_particular 
document. 
• But we must protect his cryptonym here, in this 
particular document, if we are to preclude a substantial 
CI benefit to the Russian Federal Security Service when 
they assess this new information in light of their 
• previous knowledge and acquired informatiof1..,-incl:uding_,_
