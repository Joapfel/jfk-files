MR. HALPERN: I don't mind, like Hersh, you're against using 
human spys? Fine, stay that way all the way through. 
INTERVIEWER: Rig~t. be consistent. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, that's right. But don't go saying it'5 all 
right to shoot somebody, but not shoot somebody else. Or 
whatever, however the hell else you want to do. And 1 remember 
we were arguing even at the time of '75 and '76 when we were 
discussing, how do you think Admiral Yamamoto died during World 
War II? We picked up, using COMINT, where the hell Yamamoto 
was going to be. And we deliberately sent out P-38s at extreme 
ranges of the P-38s with just enough gas maybe to come back on, 
if they were lucky enough with no maneuverability really. They 
had to know the exact spot to go get them. And the orders were 
"Get Yamamoto." That's killing a guy. That's deliberate 
murder. Sure, we were in the middle of a war where people get 
killed all the time. Well, as far as we were concerned on 
Cuba, we were at war. Castro was a target. I don't see no 
difference, I don't see any difference .between going after and 
specifically killing the leader of a country, or killing some 
poor Joe private at the e·nd of the 11 ne and I don't even know 
his name. And I'm shooting at him and he is shooting at me. I 
mean, that's ridiculous. I mean, what the hell, you are going 
out there the kill somebody. I don't care what you call it. 
INTERVIEWER: They keep looKing for a declaration of war. 
MR. HALPERN: Well, that went out with the Indians, a thousand 
years ago. The Japanese didn't use it against the Russians in
