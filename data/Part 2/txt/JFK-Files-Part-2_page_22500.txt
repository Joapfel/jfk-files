McCord recommended that Wiley had a personal acquain­
tance with a number of the well-known ex-Communist Party 
key functionaries, such as Louis Iludenz, as well as a 
personal acquaintance with the heads and research people 
in all of the Federal Congressional Committees, and State 
Investigating Committees in New York State. 
McCord was next in cbntact with Wiley on 27 December 
1955, receiving an account of pertinent points retrieved 
by \•/iley from the indexing project. In addition, Wiley 
stated he had discussed th2 indexing project with Herbert 
Philbrick (an ex-FBI penetration of the CPUSA), who had a 
continuing interest in the project and had indi=atcd he 
,rnuld be willing to help Wiley get a job in the newspaper 
field should the project tc terminated. Wiley also com­
mented that he had had lengthy political discussions with 
Karl Wittfogel (one-time Communist) in recent years, ar.d 
was in contact with Wittfogel a few weeks before. 
Speculation on identity of Private Individual 
When McCord's 27 December contact with Wiley was 
brought to the attention of Bannerman, he directed Westrcll 
to "Explore with Jim Angleton (CI Staff) the possibility cf 
getting about two months' expenses for subject (Wiley) and 
in the meantime we can complete -our clearance of him and 
try to make out a project. We should also make a survey 
of his work to be certain a project is justified." Westrell, 
in turn, directed McCord to talk to Birch O'Neal (CI Staff) 
about the matter. 
In the interim, on 24 December 1955, Wiley completed 
a Personal History Statem~nt (and a report of medical his­
tory) reflecting he had b~en employed since November 1954
