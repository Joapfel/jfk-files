T P SECRET 
Head of the GIM.CO Company that had.this huge contract in the 
Congo, met with people at the State Department to discuss the 
situation as to whether the contract was going to be performed 
or not in the Congo. 
Do you recall any of that background? And does that 
refresh your recollection about the urgency of the~situation 
at that time? 
Mr. Dillon. No. The only thing I recall is that there 
were -- which I think I mentioned maybe earlier in our informa 
conversations -- that there were talks at the time about the 
possibility of using US military force in one way or another 
I think the fa~t t.l-iat the r·vasp was ordered there fits righ 
in with that sort of general recollection, that it was 
something that we were very worried about. And I don't 
remember this particular·contract with this company. In fact, 
I don It think I have ever heard of citfocfo.; 
Mr. Baron. Did you have an independent recollection of 
the ordering of the Wasp to the Congo -- or to the shores of 
Africa? 
Mr. Dillon. Not of that one particular thing. But I do 
remember that there was consideration of the use of military 
-- I think there was some talk about airlift capacities and 
things of that nature,too, at that time. 
Mr. Baron. Again to refresh your recollection, I believe 
CIMCO, c:.:rdi'-C-O, stands for the Congo International '.-•.
