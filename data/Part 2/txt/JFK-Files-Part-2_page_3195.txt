also had some suggesti:ons .which he made to Mr. Bissell 
about the conduct of the Agency's anti-Castro program. ' . • 
For whatever reason, in late December 196Q Lansdale 
forwarded to Bissell a number of suggestions which 
had been presented to him by an Army reservist who 
had put in two weeks of active duty with OSO at Lans­
dale's direction researching Cuban political objectives. 
Inasmuch as the Agency had devoted many months to

The Special Group held its last meeting of 1960 
•On 29 December, and there were, _in addition to the 
standing problem of the use of US air bases to sup­

ization of the Cuban exiles, and considerable discus-
sion about the possibility of initiating action against 
Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. It was emphasized 
that Mr. Pawley was stro_ngly in favor of intervention
