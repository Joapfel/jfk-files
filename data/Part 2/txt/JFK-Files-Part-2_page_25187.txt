In a personal letter from McCone to Lodge it was stated that: "I was told by Dean Rusk 
that you proposed that Gen. Lansdale(replace Richardson as Chief of Station). I wish 
to emphasize the agency will reorient the Saigon station any practical way to rreet your 
desires. Personnel, including the·station chief can be replaced ... Lansdale would 
not be acceptable to the organization or to rre personally ... if the decision is to 
abandon all hope of working with the regiire then Richardson probably should be replaced 
We have no current intelligence nor resulting estimate in hand which could lead 
us to conclude that the present regilre can be disposed of, or that there exists a 
replacerrent regime which would be better. This is not however to say that a coup rray 
occur even before you receive this letter ..... "
