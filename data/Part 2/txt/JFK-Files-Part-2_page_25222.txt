~CCURRENCE: In the latter part of October, CONEIN stated, the people in Washington figured 
~hat CONEIN was being set up as "patsy" and that this would be highly embarrassing for the 
~.S. goverrurent in case he was found out to have been set up. Therefore, the people in Wash 
~ton made ma.de recomrendations that sorrebody rrore senior to him and with extensive militar.-
background should take over from him. When Washington then sent a rressage to Arrbassador 
:r.,oDGE and recomrended that a capable officer and a personal friend of CONEIN' s, GENERAL 
i.gSTILWELL take over, GENERAL DON and the coup rrembers said, no, we trust CONEIN, we don't wani 
i-e.nybody else. pp. 31-32
