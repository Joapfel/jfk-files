4000 to 5000 since the first of the year, the level of confidence in its accu­
racy varies even within the intelligence community. Other sources present con­
siderably higher estimates --some ranging up to 40,000 and more. Bearing in 
mind the substantial underestimation of last Octobei; we can only conclude that 
no one-- outside of Soviet and Cuban official circles --knows how many Russian 
troops are now there. The 17,500 estimate is perhaps a minimum figure. 
In any event, it is believed that the Soviet expedition, combined with 
the Cuban forces, as an entity, is quite powerful in a defensive sense. The 
air defense system is believed to be of a high order of effectiveness. The 
coastal defense cruise missiles do not form a tight perimeter defense of the 
Cuban shoreline, evidently because the quarantine turned back the necessary 
launchers to complete an interlocking net similar to the SA-2 system. This 
gap in the island defense may be partially covered by the KOMAR missile craft. 
The Soviet Anrry units, trained in mobile aggressive armored warfare, if well 
coordinated with the static defense ability of the Cuban native forces, could , 
offer severe opposition to any attack. This opposition would be sufficient 
to make it necessary to mount a large sea-borne landing effort along with any 
desired air-borne effort in order to be sure of success. The public evidence 
of the forces assembled during the October crisis indicate that the combina­
tion of Soviet and Cuban forces would require the bulk of the ready forces in 
the United States and the Atlantic Ocean. 
Based upon their judgment that all strategic missiles and offensive 
weapon systems have been removed, the intelligence community does not believe 
that Cuba now presents any major direct military threat to the United States 
or Latin .America in an offensive or aggressive sense. Strategic weapons may
