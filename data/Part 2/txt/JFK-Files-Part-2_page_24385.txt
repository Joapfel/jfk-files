The Castro case is an example of a plot conceiveJ by United States 
officfals to l~iil a foreign leader. The Lumur.1b2. plot falls into the same 
category. 
In tlte case of Trujillo, al thour,h-the U. S. Government cer.tainly 
opposed his regine, it did not initiate the µlot. Rather, United States 
officials responded to requests for aid from local dissidents whose ai1;i 
clearly' 1.;as to kssassinate Trujillo. By aid in~ them t~is country was in-
plicated, whether the specific weaponry actually supplieJ was !Tleant to kill 
Trujillo or was only intended as a symbol of U.S. support for the dissidents. 
The Schneider case is different from that of both Castro and Tru­
jillo. The United States Government sought a coup and provided support to 
local dissidents, knowing they believ~d that General Schneider was an obstacle 
to their plans. ilowever, even thou3h the support included <leadly veapons, 
it appears that the intention of both the dissidents a·nd the United States 
officials was to abduct, not to kill, General Schneider. Similarly, in 
the Diem case, United States officials did want a chan3e in Govern;.1ent, but 
there is no evidence that the United States sought the death of Diem himself.
