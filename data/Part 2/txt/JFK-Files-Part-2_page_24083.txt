Schneider 
The issue here is not whether the objectives of the CIA were 
contrary to those of the Administration. It is clear that Presi-
dent-Nixon desired to prevent Allende ·from.assuming office,· even 
if that required fomenting and supporting a coup in Chile. Nor 
did White House officials suggest that tactics employed (includ­
ing as a first step to kidnapping General Schneider) would have 
been unacceptable as a matter principle. Rather, the issue posed 
is whether White House officials were consulted, and thus given 
an opportunity to weigh such matters as risk and likelihood of suc­
cess, and to apply policy-making judgments to particular tactics. 
The record indicates that up to October 15 they were; after Octo-
ber 15 there is some doubt. 
The documentary record with respect to the disputed post-
October 15 period gives rise to conflicting inferences. On the one 
hand, Karamessines' calendar shows exi~tence of at lea~t. one White 
House contact in the critical period prior to the kidnapping of 
General Schneider 011 October 22. However, the absence of any sub­
stantive memoranda in CIA files--when contrasted with several such 
memoranda describing cont~cts with the White.House between Septem­
ber 15 and October 15--may suggest a lack of significant communi­
cation on the part of the CIA as well as a lack of careful super­
vision on the pare· of the White House.
