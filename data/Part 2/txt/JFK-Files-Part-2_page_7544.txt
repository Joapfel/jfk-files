MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Latin America Division 
ATTN Chris Hopkins 
FROM Graphics and Authentication Division/Senior Operations Officer 
SUBJECT Photo Comparison 
REFERENCE ODO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977 
1. On 23 March)Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried 
photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were 
examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise 
and Identification Section. 
2. The results of the comparison is as follows: 
A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight 
differences which are probably due to subject's age differences. 
B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing 
is most apparent here. 
C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of 
time factored in. 
D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities. 
(Comparison of eye detail is not possible due to poor photo quality) 
E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but 
the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend 
from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could 
be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting. 
F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and 
the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps 
the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities 
are very close.
