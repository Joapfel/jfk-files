CIA officials maintain that they acted· faithfully in transmitting 
messages to Generals Benriett and/or Philpott and in never sending a 
message without proper authoriza'tion. Mr. Karamessines was par.ticularly 
forceful in this regard: 
... I can recall no instance in my experience at the Central 
Intelligence Agency in which a message was received for -an 
·~inOividual, an officer of the·government anywhere, in what­
ever department, which was not faithfully, directly, promptly 
and fully and accurately delivered to that officer, or to his 
duly authorized representative. 
(Karamessines tesUmony, p. 79) 
We may have played tricks overseas, but it stopped at the_ 
water's edge, and we didn't pl.3.y _ tricks among ourselves or.

four possibilities tliat could explain the· conflict. First_, Generals 
Bennett and Philpott were cognizant of Track II and communicated their 
general instructions to the Army Attache. This possibility would be 
contrary to. thel.r sworn testirilony~ SeCond_, General Bennett was not aware 
of Track '1fbut General Philpott was and communicated gener:al instru·ctiofls to 
the Army Attache. This possibility is uupµorted by Roth's testimony
