The Guerrilla 
MOV !:;l\1 ENT: You mentionPd at another

man Jnd tllis kind of formulation ~;el•rns 
to fit in dirt>etly with the ~uPrrilla as· 
a political man. Would you like to cc.;rr.rmr.t 
on this? 
HlJfY: Yes. The guerrilla. is· a very 
unftjlie man. This is in contrast to ~ta rxist­
Lenlnist orthodox thi: .. ories where the party 
• controls the milltary. The guer dlla is hot 
ohiy foe warrior, me iriiii(ary ffgritt.'r; •• • 
he is also the military commander as 
well as the ·~,ol!!!~al th.eorctit.:i:!n. !Jrb:-:.~·, • 
says· "poor th~ pPn. wittiout the guns, 
poor the gun without the pen".;. The· pen 
being just an extension o! the mind; a 
tool to write down concepts, ldeas.~The 
gun is only an extf'llSion of the body, 
the extension <1! our !ang-ed teeth that we·. 
lost through evolution. It's the weapon, 
1t, s the claws that· Wt' l0st, it's the body. 
The guerrilla is the military commander 
and the political theoretician all in on£>. 
In Bolivia Che said that he got very. 
little help from the Communist Party 
there. The communist Party wanted to 
be the mind, the Communist Party wanted 
to have full control of the guerrilla 
activity. But yet werpn't taking part in 
the practical work of tt1e guerrillas. The 
guerrilla on the other qand 1s not only 
united within himself, but he also attem1 1ts 
to\spread t!ds to the people by educating 
the· villagers, giving- them politjcal per-·. 
·spect1ve , pointing out things, educating • 
them politically, and a rmtng the people.· 
ThereforP. the guerrilla is giving the 
peasants and ·workers a mind. Because .. 
they've al ready got the bodyJ,you get a 
unity o! the mind and. the body, mack
