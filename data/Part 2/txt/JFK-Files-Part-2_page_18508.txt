Memo~andum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 
• 
It was rea.dily apparent that they were asking these 
questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to 
certain•informant files, the identity of which they already 
had but did not divulge. They did state specifically that 
the informant files in which they would have an interest 
amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants 
that had publicly been exposed for one reason or another 
and were no longer being operated as current informants. 
The indication was that the request would be for access 
only to such files for review in FBI space. 
ACTION: 
For information.
