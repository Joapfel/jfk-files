arms (i.e., a paramilitary or revolutionary implementation as 
o~posed to a specifically targeted assassination use). (Bissell, 
7/29, p.80), 
Concerning the briefing paper, Bissell testified tha·t: 
'' ... it is perfectly clear that I was aware at the 
time of the memorandum to Mr. Bundy that these 
dissident groups were, and had for a long time, 
been hoping they could accomplish tha assassination 
of Trujillo. As a matter of fact, the requests since 
some seven or eight months earlier was a perfectly 
clear indication of that, so that fact was not new 
knowledge." (Uissell 7/22, p.102) 
When asked why the rnemorandur.i d:j__d not include the fact that 
the dissidents intended the assassination of Trujillo, Bissell 
replied: ~

an element of concealment here. I would be very 
surprised if it were the latter, in this case." 
(Bissell, 7/22, p.101) 
In response to questions concerning the lack of information 
in the February 17, 1961 briefing paper concerning the uses to 
which the requested arms might likely be put by the dissidents, 
Bissell stated: 
" . I would say that the Agency's failure, 
if there be a failure here was [not] (sic) to state 
in writing that the plans of the dissidents 
would include assassination attempts." 
(Bissell, 7/22, p.99) 
Bissell's briefing paper for Bundy concluded with the 
assessment that a violent clash might soon occur between Trujillo
