But, in contrast, Eisemann pointed out: 
I can't say that was true on the opera­
tional side of the shop. A Contingency 
Task Force, a program developed by the 
Clandestine Servipes, was designed to 
make available Agency-personnel who could 
be pulled out of any position that they 
were assigned to and moved into any urgent,. 
high priori~y type of project. JMATE 
. Proje.ct, was a high priority project; and 
the Contingency·Task Force concept, in iny 
opinion, failed at that point because the 
Clandestine Services did not provide the 
top quality people we needed for the posi­
tion'to be filled. After JMATE Project ... 
the Contingency Task Force was completely 
abolished .. Many people in the Agency were 
designated from the Support and the Opera­
tional side_to fill various positions as 
they would come up, but it didn't work from 
the Clandestine Services side. We had real 
problems, trying to get qualified ... top 
qualified people ... to do those jobs. In 
my opinion, the Contingency Task Force was 
a failure. It was set up and designed so 
that.qualified personnel would be completely 
immunized and processed and ready to go with 
passports at any given time. But you 
couldn't get the people you wanted -- I'm 
talking about qualified key professionals 
in•the Clandestine Services -- b'ecause the 
Division heads in the Clandestine Services 
would not release those people. 117/
