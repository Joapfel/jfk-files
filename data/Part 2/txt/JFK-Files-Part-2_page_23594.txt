Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact, 
he said he once heard a CIA maj say that assassination was a bad idea - ! -
because once started, it never !ended. However, an agent in the field I • 
I might regard killings of one sort or another as within his mission in 
supporting one political factidn over another. And of course someone 
might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that 
the CIA sometimes acted without, or eve·n against, instructions (e.g. 
by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In 
ge'neral, Latin ·American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in 
all Washington agencies including the CIA. 
2. CIA Activities .in Brazil: 
Goodwin knew little of CIA activities in Brazil. The United 
States had strongly backed Quadros and never liked Goulart. In the 
period before 1964, the U.S. g~ve political support to anti-Goulart 
factions: followers of Kubitschek and even to the Furtado in the 
Brazilian northeast. The U.S. ·had been involved in Brazilian elections 
for many years and presumably spent a good deal in the 1963 congres­
_sional elections.On the military side, Wa:lters was brought from Rome 
to keep a contact with the Brazilian military. How much further 
Walters' activities might have extended Goodwin did not know.
