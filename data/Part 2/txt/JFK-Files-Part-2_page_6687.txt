HT LINGUAL Security Support Files/SR POINTER 
Files 
. L. On 7 DecembeJ;-~19_93, this office coordinated with ~arry 7 
lZeemanjof DO/IMS, on @J..11JJ in reference to the HT L_IJiGUAL_. 
s·e-cu-r-i ty Support Files/SR POINTER Files. I asked Mr. Ze~ if 
his office had any problems with. our office destroying these 
files as they were within .our guidelines for destruction. He 
;responded by saying that they had retired their files in_l991 and 
would have to look into it further. On 8 December 1993, /Mr) 
'lZeeman)called to say that his office, DO/IMS, had no profrrelh with 
\i-s~de-s·troying our support files • to their HT LINGUAL project as 
they'destroyed their files in the late 1980's. The few files 
they retired: in 1991 were on the Administrative and Policy issues 
of.HT LINGUAL. 
2. Since the DO no longer has a need for the information 
in these files (list is attached) and has essentially approved 
their destruction, we· have supplied to you copies of our own • 
Security Records Control Schedule which verifies that these files 
meet destruction criteria. As you can see though, by the comment 
on the SR POINTER Files, we need to be sure there is no litig~tion open befor~ we destroy. ••• 
3. In light of paragraph 2, our office now awaits OGC 
approval. Your coordination with ·oGc in this effort is gr~atly 
appreciated. Please note,·destruction of these files include the 
SR POINTER name index which is currently utilized by this office 
for the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) 
cases. Destruction of this index will aid in decreasing 
unnecessary review and research on part of FOIA and PA.
