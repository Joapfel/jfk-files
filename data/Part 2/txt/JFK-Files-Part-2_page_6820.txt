agencies or departments to appeal decisions by the Executive· 
Director to release information may not provide sufficient time for 
me·aningful review of what could prove to be a large volume of

\Vhile such privileges could be waived in the public interest and 
are not likely to arise with respect to factual infoI'lllation directly 
related to the JFK assassination, they would be unavailable under 
the joint resolution in the rare case that they might be needed.
