Ad.ministration when events in Congo wore hcatingup, After 
Congolese independence, what was the general atmoophere in 
the State Department and at the CIA in relation to LumlJ.lflba, 
the general attitude toward Lwnumba? 
Mr. Tweedy. Well, I think you would have to etart by 
saying what was the general assessment of the situation in 
the Congo. Lwnwnba was really sort of the last thing you 
came down to. 
The worry in WAahington about the 8ituation in the 
Congo was that here was the largest geographical expression 
in Africa that thretened to go up in smoke, up becau:!le the 
Kremlin wa!5 about to march in and take it over-, not- because 
it was about to break up tribally and do all the things thdt 
those African countries in their early years were at least 
vulnerable to. The only trouble with the Congo WhB if it 
happened there the side effects would have been infinitely 
greater than, of course, if it had happened anywhere else. 
Mr. Baron. What would those side effects have been? 
Mr. Tweedy. Ali one culd do w,u1 iassess those, but it 
would have set a precedent, for example, the neighboring 
country by which great store was set by the West was Nigeria 
an<l if the same infection crossed that border one was afraid 
that thiR would go up in smoke ~nrl that in effect there 
was a possibility of the continent disintegrating before it 
really had had a chance to get under way under its own aegis.
