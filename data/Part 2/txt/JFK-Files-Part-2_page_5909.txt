Question 2 - How are Office of Security records indexed? 
Prior to 1964 alr index records were. maintained on 3x5 inch 
index cards. When the information was known, these cards 
i~cluded names (primary, alias, telecodes), file nµmbers, 
k::.n/re:!.atives, location/residence, DPOB, citizenship, occupation, 
polygraph number, reference source data, information codes, 
.remarks, SSN, sex, employer, and file retirement data. To locate 
a file =ecord, the subject of interest was searched in this card 
system. 
During mid-1964 these index cards with the exception of 
impersonal entities, were under conversion to a keypunch system. 
T::ie impersonals (companies, publications, intelligence services, 
o:::-gani=ations, etc.) were maintained on cards unt-il much later, 
possibly mid-1970s. Aside form the subject name indices, the 
O:fice of Security also indexed information of interest within a 
file record. This information could include associates, 
companies, publications, other government agency reports 
:information, etc. 
TODAY'S INDEXING PAR..!\METERS ARE VERY LIMITED.
