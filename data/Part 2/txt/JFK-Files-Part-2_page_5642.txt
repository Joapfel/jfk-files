DECEMBER 1993 AND MY WIFE AND I, BOTH 75, CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST HERE 
BECAUSE OUR 2000 SQ. FT. APARTMENT IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF 2 
POST OFFICES, SEVERAL SMALL SUPER MARKETS, MY FAMILY PHYSICIAN, OUR

4. {v_!~NNA} Is FULLOF-ISLAMICTERR<>RISTS~ THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL 
ASSAS~INAT1ONS., EVEN OF A CITY COUNCILMAN, BY THEM IN RECENT YEARS. 
UNDER(_A!,JS_'!~ LAW, I, AS A FOREIGNER, CANNOT EVEN GET A PISTOL 
LICENSE. YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD. 
4. I HAVE TWICE TESTIFIED BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES ABOUT 
THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. THEIR FULL REPORTS SIMPLY CALLED ME THE 
"DESK OFFICER" AND THAT HAS SEEMED TO SATISFY EVERYONE. NEEDLESS TO 
SAY, IF YOU DO EXPOSE MY NAME, I WILL NOT EVER TALK TO ANY 
JOURNALISTS OR SO-CALLED HISTORIANS. 
S. IF MY NAME IS EXPOSED, I 
WITH THE WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF 
ETC. WHICH I PACKED AND PAID 
BECAUSE OF MY STROKE, I WILL 
MOVE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE. 
APT. SO CONVENIENTLY LOCATED. 
WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LEAVE VIENNA, 
FURNITURE, PICTURES, LIBRARY, CLOTHING, 
TO HAVE MOVED OVER HERE IN 1983. 
BE UNABLE TO DO ANY PACKING AND THE 
WHERE CAN I RESETTLE IN A 2000 SQ FT. 
6. MY WIFE AND I LOVE LIVING HERE FOR MANY REASONS, AND LEAVING 
WOULD BE A CRUEL AND NEEDLESS FATE. 
7. I REGARD THIS LAW AS DISHONORABLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST ME, I WANT TO APPEAR 
BEFORE THE BOARD AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT, WHOM I HAPPEN TO ADMIRE. I 
WILL PAY MY OWN WAY BACK TO DO SO. I SERVED IN WWII AND NEVER 
SPARED MYSELF; IN THE OUTFIT I WORKED HARD, WAS FEARLESS IN DEALING 
WITH MY SUPERIORS (CORD MEYER AND DICK HELMS CAN TESTIFY TO THAT) 
AND MY ADVERSARIES. I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF THREATENING TO EXPOSE 
THINGS TO PRESSURE YOU. I WILL BE EMPLOYING AN ATTORNEY OR TWO, 
FAMILIAR WITH OUR AFFAIRS, TO REPRESENT ME. I WILL NOT DENY, THAT I 
CONSIDER YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IMPLEMENTING THIS LAW TO BE ENGAGING 
IN DISHONORABLE CONDUCT, UNWORTHY OF OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICE.
