felt that the tapes and the FBI and the CIA interrogations o.f 
'64, '65, and 1 66 should not be considered as reliable 
statements. 
Is that not correct? 
Mr. Nosenko. Ye~, because I considered the whole arrest 
8 was unlawful, without due process of law, illegal arrest~ 
9 what was the finding as unlawful by Rockefeller Commission.

Mr. Edgar. Thank you. 
You were held under those spartan conditions and you 
indicated that those statements would have tobe unreliable. 
Now, I have three specific questions, then, to ask you. 
Have you ever told the CIA that these statements could 
15 not be considered reliable? 
-16 Mr. Nosenko. Sure, when we started, they change the 
17 situation, they moved me from spartan conditions, started to 
1a talk with me as a human being, to treat me as a human being. 
19 Mr. Edgar. Did you go on a point by point correction of 
20 any of those statements you previously made? 
21 Mr. Nosenko. It wasn't in the form of simply returning 
22 to document, it was case by case, whatever concerns me, my 
~3 biography, my work, whatever cases I knew, whatever cases I 
24 was involved, all questions were raised by 20, 30 times each 
,~ case, when it was reevaluation of all information given by me. ,.... ii
