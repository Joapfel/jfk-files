4. SIM has transr:,itted the results ·of•interrogation of SEChOES and CARDE!,AS to 
Preside~t Fulg~ncio BATISTA, but the latter's reacti~n to these new develop­
r:ients is not knmm. Further .action by the Cuban•aut.ho'rities is conplicated 
by the fact that the Govern:-rent's r.:ain witness, Ct-RCE1JAS, is of dubious re­
liability, because of his ho~osexuality. CARCE~AS is also reported to be 
the coctor of the fa::iily of Santicso VERCEJA rleyra, Xinister of Cefense, who 
vouched for him wnen he was arrested by SIM.
