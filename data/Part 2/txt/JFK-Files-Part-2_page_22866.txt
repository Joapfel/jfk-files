out'that the President was t,he 
. . •' 
one who wanted to know~. My impression here is that whatever 
concern we have, General Taylor or I, in the frame of this 
language, it was precisely to insulate the President from 
any false inference that what he ~as asking about was 
assassination. It is easy to confuse.the question. What 
are things going to be like after Castro, with the other 
question, and we were trying to focus attention on the 
information he obviously wanted, which is, what would happen 
if we did do this sort of thing, and not get one into the 
frame of mind of thinking that he was considering doing it. 
That is the distinction, I think. 
Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any further recollection of 
discussion of this matter in this fall of 1961? And by this 
matter I mean either the broader inquiry into what it would 
be like if Castro disappeared, or a scenario arising of the 
specific subject of assassination. 
Mr. Bundy. No, I don't. 
Mr. Schwarz. Had you ever hearti before I asked you 
about the last night about a conversation, an alledged conver­
sation, betwe~n the President anti the Journalist Theodore 
Schwartz, and or Mr. Goodwin in this timeframe? 
Mr. Bundy? I saw that in the newspapers. 
Mr. Schwarz. Or in Esquire magazine? 
Mr. Bundy. Wherever I saw it, I saw it in print.
