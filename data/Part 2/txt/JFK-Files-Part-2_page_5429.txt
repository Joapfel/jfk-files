name beyond June 1, 1997, if CIA provides to the Board, prior to May 1, 1997, 
additional evidence that satisfies the criteria of either category 1 (above) or 
category 3 (below). • 
3. Names having effect on current intelligence interests. lf CIA believes that 
the release of a true name may compromise currently existing ~telligence 
operations or might otherwise cause an identifiable harm, it must provide 
evidence that (a) the officer currently is engaged in clandestine activities; (b) the 
release of the true name would compromise ongoing intelligence operations or 
would compromise operations with current intelligence value; (c) the release of 
the true-name would reasonably be expected to cause significant harm to a living 
person (including family members), or (d) the release of the true name would 
cause a significant harm to the national security or the foreign relations of the 
United States. If CIA satisfies this burden, the Board presumptively (see Part II 
below) will release a pseudonym and postpone the true name until 2010 or until 
such other date as CIA reasonably shows to be a date on which the release could 
be made without causing harm. 
Part II. Names of Officers Who Are Important to the Assassination Story. 
The Board presumptively will postpone the release.of names consistent with 
categories 1-3 of Part I. However, for certain persons whose names appear in a 
context that is important to the assassination story, ·the Board may nevertheless 
vote to release the true name. In all such. instances, the Board will notify CIA of 
the importance of such a person and provide CIA with the opportunity to 
provide additional information in support of postponing the release of the 
names. These names shall be reviewed on a case-by-case ·basis, with due 
consideration being given to the importance of the person to the assassination 
story and ~uch evidence of harm as CIA may provide.
