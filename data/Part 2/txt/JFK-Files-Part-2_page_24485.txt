Meeting of Branch 4 Task Force, March 9, 1960), shows that the first 
meeting of the CIA task force establish~d to plan-the training of a 
Cuban exile force was held on March 9, 1960, the day before the March 
10, 1960 NSC meeting. (Memorandum of First Meeting of Branch 4 Task 
Force, March 9, 1960). At that March 9, 1960, CIA meeting, the CIA 
task force discussed "an operation directed at the overthrow of the 
Castro regime" and described that operation as one in which a Cuban 
exile force would be trained for "6-7 months." In the discussion of 
this operation, it was noted that a principal problem was the weakness 
of the Cuban exile groups which "had no real leader and are divided 
into many parts," but it was hoped that during the long training 
period the "opposition groups will have been merged and will have formed 
a government-in-exile to which all trained elements could be attached."

According to the memorandum of the meeting, 
chief of the CIA's Western Hemisphere division 
J.C. King, had stated, "unless Fidel and Raul Castro and Che Guevara could 
be eliminated in onepackage - which is highly unlikely - th.is operation 
can be a long, drawn-out affair and the present government will only be 
overthrown by the use of force. 11 (Id., p. 1).
