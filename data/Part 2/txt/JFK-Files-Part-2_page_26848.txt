Group began? 
2 A. It began -- well, it beaan around June of '63.

involved, were ther,c, a areat nanv Cubans in the southern United 
States who were active in :-2volutionarv fronts that were beina

:! :; factions. Obvious1,, t!1e leaders -of the fronts knew that the 
i!

ii CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these 
fron1:s rlid not know thev '.·1ere beinq subsidized bv the Agency 
or the U.S. Government. 
o. But when vou sav "suooosedly," does the fact appear 
to be otherwise? 
• .:\. ,·/Ell, based on n,· 2xperience with the Cubans and this 
type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that 
it wouldh't take long for ~nowledqe of any subsidy to surface 
itself .. 
\·las it your ornnion and impression at that time, Mr. 
Sturbitts, that a great many Cubans considered themselves to be 
involved in the CI~ oraaniza.1:1.ons?
