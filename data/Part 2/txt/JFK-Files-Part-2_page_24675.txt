Bissell Test:ified That he Asked O'Donnell to Plan 
and Prepare ~or an Assassination Operat~on 
Bissell remJmbered "very clearly" that he and O'Donnell 
t~e assassinaJion of Lumumba in the fall of 1960 (Bissell, 
6/9/75, p. 75) and that O'Donnell reacted neljatively (Bissell, 
9/11/75, p. 18) .. Accorting to Bissell, O'Donnell said that he

I . 
and prepare for" the ~ssassination of Lwnumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
I p. 24).
