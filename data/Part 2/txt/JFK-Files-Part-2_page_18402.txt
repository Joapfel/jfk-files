to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various· ~I. 
types of operations which will be discussed, although it was,~ ~ 
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid . ::~~ 
discussing ·the Soviet targe! specifically.- I have recently_ ~ :. !' ~ 
learned that the SSC Staff is_ aware of the fact (from mater1a J : . 
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a serie. 
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S." The info,;f-\J c,/· 
mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on tot.

have brought this information to the senators' att.ention, and

spect to these operations, which of course were carried-out in
