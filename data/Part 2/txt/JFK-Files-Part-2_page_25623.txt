FBI agents Hill and Dodge met with Rosselli and his lawyer, 
Cantillon. At this time Dodge informed Rosselli that the 
FBI was aware that he was not a U.S. citizen. Dodge indicated 
something about Nevada and some other secret organizations. 
Rosselli met with Sheffield Edwards in 1966 for some drinks 
and discussed his problems with the FBI. 
Rosselli received a telephone call from an FBI agent, Jack 
Barron in June of 1970. The agent informed Rosselli that his 
appeals can be reversed. He was told that his lawyers and 
friends can't do anything for him in Washington. 
Rosselli talked with Bill Harvey prior to his testimony before 
the Select Connnittee to see if Harvey had objections and 
Harvey only suggested that Rosselli protect those people whose 
lives and whose families might be jeopardized by his testimony. 
Rosselli stated he did not know the five so-called Watergate 
burglars -- Hunt, McCord, Barker, Martinez or Sturgis. 
Roselli had no doubt that the Cuban operation was on behalf 
of the CIA and not Mr. Hughes. 
Rosselli stated that his Cuban contacts were never informed. 
that this was a CIA project, but that be represented a Wall 
Street business; 
·In the period 1967-1968, Rosselli failed to register as an 
alien and faced criminal charges. 
Rosselli describes how he is brought into the operation 
Maheu's contact· and O'Connell's .satisfying him that the'y 
were government representatives. 
Rosselli stated that Sheffield Edwards was not overly concerned 
with the FBI's contacting Rosselli. 
Rossell's reason for not informing his sources that it was 
a CIA operation was because he believed he would be more 
successful doing what he was doing by representing big 
.business. 
When the FBI contacted Rosselli in both 1966 and 1970 
they hinted that they wanted Rosselli to provide information 
about United States gambling interests.
