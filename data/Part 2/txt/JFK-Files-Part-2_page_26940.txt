A. You mean in terms of years? 
Q. Yes. 
A. Well, I would think that I would probably say from 
about 1967., and I think the debriefinqs as such, of course 
we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out 
and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off 
about, I guess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe --
Q. I see. 
A. -- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just 
terminated that part of the activity. 
Q. •Well, in addition to <lebriefing refugees that came 
in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any othe 
intelligence gathering functions --
A. No. 
Q. In the connuni ty'? 
A. Well, I can't give you a real yes or no ·to that. I 
would suppose that there is an·outsi<le possibility they could 
have been use<l to debrief people within the community, within 
the Cuoan community, but we had in the organization all thes 
peonle were r.uban with the exception of we had what we call an 
On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime·staff·employee and he 
had a couple of assistants, including a secretary.· These people 
were directly under his control;· Though the organization as it 
was set up, they ha<l their own chief and this type of thing, 
but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Office
