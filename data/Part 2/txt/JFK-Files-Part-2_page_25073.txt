"Castro Dlasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders 
Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." 
This item was introduced by an editor's note 
referring to the fact thc1't Castro had turned 
up at a Brazilian .Embassy recer:;tion Saturday 
night (7 September) where he had submitted to 
an impromptu interview~ Barker's account of 
the interview reached New York Sunday after­
noon. 
"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister Fidel Castro 
said Saturday night: 'U.S. leaders would he 
in danger if ~hei helped in any attempt to do 
2..way with leaders of Cuba.'" 
"Bitterly denouncing what he called 
recent U.S. prompted rai~s on Cuban territory, 
Castro said:. '\·le are prepared to fight them 
&nd answer in kind. U.S. le2.ders should think 
that if they are aiding terrorist plans to 
eliminate Cuban .leaders, they themselves will 
not be safe. '" 
" .... World affairs seemed to be 
entering a more peaceful climate.a few days 
ago, but now this trend has changed with 
attacks." 
"'The U.S. is always ready to negotiate 
and make promises which later it will not honor. 
This has happened to promises made during the 
October crisis. They have been broken as can 
be seen with new attacks. 
9 But I warn this is leading to a very 
~angerous situation that could lead to a worse 
crisis than October's .... '"
