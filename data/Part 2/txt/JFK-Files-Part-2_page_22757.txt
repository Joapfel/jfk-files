I, 
Mr. Angleton. Well, I don't.know what.that really mean~, 
instant analysis. I mean we've always done instant analysis. 
Mr. diGenova. I know that but it's our understanding, 
we've learned from the Agency that there has been a movement 
away from in-depth historical research toward more current 
sort of analyses. 
What you're suggesting to me by saying that there's 
been no analysis done of those cabl_es is that we've lost a 
valuable CI tool since that study hasn't been.done, and I'd 
like to know if your assessment of the current trend toward 
research is a bad one? 
Mr. An0leton. I think i~ makes no sense whatsoever . 
Mr. Miler. It's disastrous. It will lead to complete 
chao~ within a very short tima because you're trying to analyse 
an indiviclual case without having the ability to relate 40 
other cases to that case. 
Mr. diGenova. There's no integration in other wordo. 
?Ir. Miler. That's right and you cannot operate in a 
!i vacuum. 19 ·I
