/ 
as the 22nd of August l 96 l, cl;fter the Navy and the Air Force had been 
working together for almost 8 months, it was reported to me by both 
Services that development of ~ s1rngle TFX aircraft t9 fulfill st~ted 
requirements of bo~h Services Wq.S 'n,ot technically feasible. 
While this attitude, ba~~d o~ ye~rs o~ going separate ways, 
was understandqbl~, I did I1ot cqnsider jt Wi:\-.S .a reali~tic approach, 
considering the versatility a.1;1d capapilities that could be built ~nto a 
' ' ' 
modern airc;raft because of advc1.pces in technology. • I was also 
convinced that, if we cou+d achieve· a single tactical fighter, we would 
save at l~ast one billion dollars, in dev~lopment, production, ~aintenance 
and operating cost£!!. In sho,rt, after study and review,. I believed that 
the development of a single aircraft of gemiine .tqctical utility to ·both 
Services in the projected time fr.a,me Wc\,S technically ~easible and 
economically desirable. I directed that we c;::ontinue to work toward 
this objectiv~. Beca,.gie this decision was peculiarly my own, I kept 
myself ~ully advi1;3ed of the dev~lopment pf the JI'fX as it progressed 
over the succeeding 14 months.
