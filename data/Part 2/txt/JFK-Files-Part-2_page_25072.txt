"Goldwater's Toughness Challenged by Castro" 
by Daniel Harker, AP Staff '\'lri ter 
" Bitterly denouncing what he called recent U.S. 
pr6mpted raids on Cuban territ~ry, Mr. Castro said: 
'We are prepared to fight them and answer 
in kind. U.S. leaders should think that if 
they are aiding terrorist plilns to eliminate 
Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be 
safe . 
. • The U.S. is alwo.ys ready to negotiate 
2.nd make promises which later it will not honor. 
This has happened to promises made durins the 
October crisis. They have been broken as can 
be seen with new attacks. 
'But I warn this is leading to a very 
dangerous situation that could lead to a 
worse crisis than October's .... '" 
[From an impromptu interviiw given by Castro at a Brazilian 
Embassy reception this week.]
