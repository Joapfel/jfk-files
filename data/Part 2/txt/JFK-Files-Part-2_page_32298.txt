(3) Tailor a special civilian and military program . 
for Brigade members. Encourage the Brigade to continue 
as a "fraternal" unit similar to the "Flying Tigers". 
Encourage those Brigade members who enter the current 
military training program for Cubans to establish a 
Brigade military reserve component which other U. S. 
militarily-trained Cubans could join. 
Under existing authority, HEW could provide the 
f9llowing additional benefits for Brigade members in 
need, over and above those now offered: ·special employ­
ment counseling and placement service; extended student 
loans to provide for all institutional costs such as 
tuition, books, etc., even if this exceeds $1,000 per 
year (living costs to be provided by another agency); 
expanded vocational training in the Miami area; increased 
financial assistance to needy persons while in training; 
increased distribution of surplus food (with approval 
of the Department of Agriculture). 
The following additional programs could b'e under­
taken by HEW upon Presidential determination that such 
action would contribute to the defense and security 
of the United States or advance its foreign policy 
interests: scholarship grants for students; loans for 
vocational training anywhere in the United States; an 
expanded training program similar to a G. I. Bill of 
Rights, in the United States and/or abroad. The cost 
of these. additional programs, assuming an expenditure 
of $2,500 per person per year would be about $2.5 million.
