you accomplish it? 
Mr. Phillips. I don't know. I have had my memory 
refreshed· by looking at some documents now, and I know 
104 
that someone came and gave me the piece of paper in this book 
that has been signed by General Philpott. which was a message 
to 
1
saying, cooperate with the CIA. What the process 
was for getting that approval, or who went to see Philpott,, 
I wasn't involved with that, I just don't recall. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see Philpott? 
Mr. Phillips. I never did. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see 
Mr. Phillips. I may have seen Philpott in some large 
meeting or something like that, but I don't recall any 
meeting with any of the generals. I was relatively too junior 
to have attended these meetings. This would have been Mr. 
Broe, Mr. Karamessines, and so forth. And I would have been 
lef,t back in the shop, sort of, I think. 
Mr. Schwarz. And did you ever see or talk to Bennett? 
Mr. Phillips. Not to my recollection. I think not. 
Mr. Schwarz. I asked you if you ever saw General Phil-
pott, or did you ever talk to• General Philpott? 
Mr. Phillips. I don't recall such a talk. During this 
entire period, for instance, I never went outside of our build­
ing.I was there sort of in the shop. And other people would do 
that sort of thing.
