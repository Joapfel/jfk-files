Mr. Bundy. That.he did~'t aay to me, and I have no way 
of .commenting on it. 
The Chairman. I think we must carefully review the 
record on that score. 
Senator Baker. It may be necessary to ask him to come 
back for that purpose. 
May I ask a question there? 
Mr. Bundy, do you have any recollection of any specific 
covert plans that would involve poisons, hypdermic syringes, 
or other potentially lethal devices in conjunction with acti­
vities against Cuba? 
Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection of any specific plan. 
I do have a very vague, essentially refreshed recollection 
that I heard the word poison at some point in connection with 
a possibility of action in Cuba. But that is as far as I 
have been able to take it in my own memory. 
Senator Baker. Can you remember who may have men-
tioned it to you and what the purposes of the poison may have 
been? 
Mr. Bundy. Nothing at all about it in detail. 
Senator Baker. A poison pen? 
Mr. Bundy. No, some kind of poison about which -- one 
thing that does stick in my mind is that it seems totally 
TOP SECRET
