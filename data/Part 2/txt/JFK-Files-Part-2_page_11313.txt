Physical surveillances 
I. Intelligence information and admi~sible evidence obtained 
ttrough the use of physical surveillances in these 
investigations are of extreme value. Physical sur­
veillances should be used whenevei, in the opin5on of 
the SAC, information of sufficient ~alue might be ob- ~ ~~ tained to justify their use in light of the existing i 
circurnstRnces and available manpower. ~ 
"),.a: 
II. When information is received through oth~~ sources , 
indicating that un~t or mass meetings of subversive ·organ--~ 
izations are to take place, or clandestina meetings of 
certain individuals ih a subversive movement are to be 
held with other unidentified individual::, pllysical sur--' 
veillances should be used when practical io corroborate 
such information and further dev~lop det~ils concerning 
such meetings; that is, de·tails of actio11 taken at the 
meetings, identification of individuals in·attendance, 
and extent of participation.of tho various individuals 
present. 
J 
+II. Proper and vrell-coordinated physical surveillances of 
various individuals in le2.dership or underground capacities 
of a subversive mo-vement will develop a cha 0in of aqti·rity '"' 
within the movement, which not only establishes the ~. 
importance and position of those individuals directly. 
involved but will also serve to i_dentify others \'fho 
may not yet be identified with the movement. 
IV. The success of physic~l surveillances depends upon 
the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the Agen~s assigned 
to them. The Agents must at all times -exercis.e sound 
.judgment and discretion in the performance of &uch 
duties to avoid embarrassment to the Bureau. • They must 
be alert at all times not only to observe the specific 
activity of the subject but to ob~erve countersur­
veillances which may be 1.tsed to :i:dentify the .Agents 
and thereafter embarrass the.Bureau. 
Photographic surveillances 
·r. Photographic evidence which establishes meetings bet~een 
individuals involved in these investigations and vrhich 
establishes that subjects ente~ or leave certain buildings, 
etc,, at the time it is known that meetings of subversive 
organizations are taking place therein is i~valuable ~ 
in establishing a; complete 9hain of e:v~dence. Photographs- , 
o~ such activities add convincing,·admissible, physical l 
.evidence in establishing the subversive activities ~ 
of individuals. .j 
~ II. Photographic surveillanc~s must be properly.correlated 
with other investigative techniques to assure tha.-t :} 
maximum of ev-iclence is being obtained. They rm.t;,t be .ii 
well plan~ed and conducted in a discreet manner. Care ~ 
should be taken to conceal properly tha equipment used ~-
to avoid detection of the _s1.,rveillance~ not only by the jl;· 
subject but ~1so oy any other individuals in the proximity ·1 
of the surveillance. . . • . ~:-~--.. ;&
