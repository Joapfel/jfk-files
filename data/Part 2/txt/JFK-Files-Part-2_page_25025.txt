TOP SECRET 
development of a generalized assassination capability at the 
CIA -- that such a capa6ility could be developed ~ithout 
specific authorization from authority outside the CIA? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I would think so. 
Mr. Baron. But it is clear to you that the discussion at 
the meeting at the Pentagon that you attended would not in 
itself have served as an authorization for an actual assassi-
nation effort against Lumumba? 
Mr. Dillon. Not at all. 
Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear the phrase "Executive Action' 
during your entire tenure in Government? 
Mr. Dillon. No. The first time I ever heard it, I was 
on the Rockefeller Commission. 
Mr. Baron. Were you aware that the CIA undertook a proJec 
which was run under the crytonum ZR RIFLE to develop the means 
for carrying off an assassination if required? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I didn't. 
Mr. Baron. And your first knowledge of any such project 
was during your service on the Rockefeller Commission? 
Mr. Dillon. That is right. 
Mr. Baron. Earlier today we discussed Robert Johnson, 
who was a member of .the NSC Staff in the late fifties and 
serving until ea·rly 1962. Do you recall whether Robert 
Johnson participated in this meetingat the Pentagon? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't recall. I wouldn't think so,
