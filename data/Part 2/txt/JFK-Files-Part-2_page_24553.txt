The minutes of the i1ay 3, 1962, Special Groµp Augmented meeting make no 
i I mention of Harvey's above-related plot activities. The minutes of that meet-
f '\ 
\.J 
ing show that on his return from Miami, Harvey gave a progress report to the 
Special Group Augmented on '"agent teams" and the "general field of intelli­
gence". (Harvey, Ex. 3, Memorandum of Special Group Augmented Meeting, May 
1962, p. 1.) Harvey reported that three agent teams had been infiltrated and 
that 72 actual or potential reporting sources were also in place. (Harvey Ex. 3, 
p. 1.) 
Shortly after the i1ay 3 meeting, General Taylor went to see the President to 
give him what he called a "routine briefing" (Taylor Tr. __ , p. 
General Taylor's memorandum of his briefing of the President similarly makes 
no reference to Harvey's contacts with Roselli or the delivery of pills and 
guns. (Memorandum for Record May 7, 1962, by General Taylor.) Taylor testified 
that he had never heard of Harvey delivering pills to poison Castro, or of any 
assassination attempts. (Taylor Tr. ---- , p. 42.)
