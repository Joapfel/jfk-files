After the l3AY OP PIGS, Gray called President EISEJ,H-!O\'iER and 
offered to show him all of the memos that Gray had prepared on PrcsiJential 
meetings on Cuba. Gray said that JOHN EISENHOWER obtained the memos and 
· brought them to Gettysburg. Gray and President EISEJ\Jl-!OWER reviewed the 
memos. Gray said that the President obj cc ted to the 1.;ord "plani1ing" in 
reference to a Cuban invasion, on the basis that there was no actual military 
planning. EISENlfO\\'ER suggested that the p~ge should be retyped to change 
the word "planning". Gray said they did retype the page. 
Gray said that although in his mind and EISENHOWER's, there was no 
military "plo.nning", def initcly ElSEN1l01'lER ki7.ew that Cuban exiles were being 
trained for cm amphibious landing in Cuba. 
President EISG\Jl-fOWER went so far in contingency plo.nning, said Gray, as to 
advocate to Allen DULLES the forn1ation of a government in exile among the 
Cuban corrnnunity. But, Gray said, the Cubans could never settle among them­
selves who would constitute the leaJ.ership of such a government. 
Referring to the minutes of Spec.ial Group meeting of ~ugust 12, 1960, 
Gray remembers the presentation by Richard BISSELL of a budget f~r Cuban 
operations over. 13 million dollars, with a heavy emphasis on paramilitary 
operations. Gray said that the reference at the end of the memo to laying 
this budget before "higher authorities" for approval clearly referred to 
President EISEi\Jl-fOWER. 
Referring to the minutes of the Special Group meeting of November 3, 1960, 
at which MEROLt\.hi"I' asked a question about whether there had been planning "for 
taking direct positive action against FIDEL, R\UL, and CHE QJEVARA,
