Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt 
or Harass the· Republican National C?nvention 
. • 
There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to 
inspire, support, inJ1ucnce. or exploit activities designeci to disrupt or 
bm-nss the Republican National Convention in Miami. Florida, 21-24 August 
1972. Although meetings have been held recently in Paris., France, between 
American anthvar acfrvists and representatives of the Dc:~ocratic Republic 
of North Vietnam (DRV) and the Proyisional Revolutionary Govcrn"mcnt of 
South Vietnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the 
DRV /PRG officials made no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the 
American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National 
Convention. Private discussions, scp~r~te from the meetings with the entire 
Artierican deleGatio11, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials; 
. Rt present, v,e have no information regarciing the substance of these private 
exchanges. A second group of actb:ists, considered more ir.1portant th<'-n 
the !fr st delegation. is ~chedulcd to travd to Pa:ds on or about 1 .August 1972 
!or further consultations with the PRG and DRV rcprescntath;es. 
In recent meetings in Paris. France, with members of an American 
dcl\:gation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (A\'lU), representatives of 
i 
the Democratic Rc;:,ublrc of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provi:3ional "Revolutio!1<'.ry 
Government of South Vietnam (PRG) ·were very guarded with respect to dis­
cu~sing activities at the Rcpublica.n National Convention. Although the Vietnam­
ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar 
movement in the United States, they made no direct refo~ence to the Repub-
lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen 
Van TIEN ac·cused President Nixon of using the private ,.:.nd public sessi~ns 
of the Paris peace talks as a propaganda for the Republic~n Convention. :i 
TIEN then urged the Americans to p!"omotc and propagar:.dize the Seven 
Point Plan offered by the PRG.- The Americans, too, for the most part, 
1·efrained from discussing the Convention, other than tb estimate that dcmon­
s~ators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.
