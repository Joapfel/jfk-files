SECTION 107 •• ECURITY INFORMll.NTS .AND CONFID.AL SOURCES 
Instruct each interested Bureau office which has made further dis­
semination of such information to follow the instructions set forth 
aboveo · 
107S - T 
Also set up a control file regarding this corrective action, and upon 
comnletion of same submit to the Bureau a final letter under the in­
for~ant's caption identifying eaoh case by title, character, Bureau file, 
where known, and date of communication. 
This letter will be used to check all pertinent Bureau files to see 
that necessary corrective action has been taken in each instance. 
If necessary, other field offices which ~ave received information from 
the informant should also be requested to submit summary letters show­
ing what corrections have been madeo 
It is imperative that all information from the in~ormant be correctly 
labeled and great care must be taken to see_ that this is done. 
Occasionally, an ex-informant throug~ his speech, writings, or actions 
raises a. doubt as to his reliability subsequent to the time he was an 
informant. It is not necessary to go back and ch•nge the evaluation of 
the information attributed to that individual in the absence of a 
definite i~dication that the informant furnished unreliable informat~on 
to the Bureau while he was an informant. 
Dissemination of information from sources of questionable reliability 
and known unreliability should be made in accordance with part II, 
section 5, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.
