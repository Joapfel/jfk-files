(c) denial of overflights and transit rights to Soviet air-
craft on Bloc-Cuba runs. • 
(d) a call upon other Free World nations to take similar 
actions. 
Rationale 
- The steps I recommend would start movement forward towards our 
objective, carrying the OAS with us, without committing us to any 
further action . 
• liter these initial measures are in effect, we should assess 
the situation and determine the feasibility of moving forward with 
any_of the remaining courses of action, or any new courses which 
may be opened to us by events. 
I believe we should develop our pressures steadily a~d gradu-. 
ally, bringing the OAS along with us, arid keeping the situation 
under constant review for the optimum opportunity to initiate 
additional measures. • 
I d.onot'believe we should take·a track now which will break 
hemispheric. unity~ We may need unity later in an emergency. 
Neithe.r _ cio I· believe we should push the OAS irito probable 
acute confrontation with the USSR at this time. 
Both of ,these prices the U. s. miy find it necessary to pay_.
