1 Bill re Sta"B:Ons: \ \ 
No problem with release of CAS {Controlled American Source), 
j. fact we have overseas locations, CIA representatives in 
··1 specific countries - - the problem comes with officially 
i acknowledging the stations thereby putting the host 
f t. government and service in a position of explaining why it is 
t 
I allowing a foreign espionage unit to operate in the country. 
\ \ This may become a serious political issue for the 
government, especially in countries where the government 
\ 
does not acknowledge its own service. Also can be perceived 
as "rubbing their nose in it" and can affect the trust 
between the Agency and the host service {violated agreement 
of confidentially) . 
Marwell pointed out that this information was 30 years old 
and asked what was the impact of acknowledging a station 
presence in 1963 on current operations or relations. 
Bill responded "opened up old sores" and cited Rome and the 
sensitivity to our involvement in past election. Mentioned 
the reaction to the announcement on covert actions by DCI. 
Gunn asked if stations= liaison relationship; Bill said the 
other service can not say it did not know the CIA was -
operating in its own country -- would look incompetent. 
Mary asked about changes in government; Bill responded that 
intell types tend to stay own or its revolving door where 
the group that leaves when a neww government comes into 
power will be back in power at some point. 
Bill comments on specific stations 
If important to the story such as Mexico City and the 
surrounding stations which were involved in the cable 
exchanges re Oswald, then will release.
