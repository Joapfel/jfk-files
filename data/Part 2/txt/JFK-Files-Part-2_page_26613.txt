NOTES 
A. South Vietnam Plans are now afoot to shuffle 
South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General 
Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best 
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta {IV 
Corps) area. General Dinh, the ambitious Minister 
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin­
quish command of the III Corps area,. and is not in­
volved in the current shuffle. 
B~ Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba, 
5,000 of these military, according to a bloc offi­
cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana, The 
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to 
7,000. Some withdrawals continue, 
C. Cambodia-Vietnam Sihanouk seems to feel that cut­
ting off his nose to spite his face was not enough. 
Now he says he will formally recognize North Vietnam 
if the US does not silence the Khmer Serei radio, 
South Vietnam will cut Cambodia's primary access to 
international markets via the Mekong river if he 
does. • { INTERCEPT)
