3. Section 1400.5 Requirement that assassination records 
be released in their entirety 
The introductory paragraph specifies that "no portions 
of any assassination record shall be withheld--solely on 
grounds of non-relevance." This appears to open the door 
for access to entire documents that contain information on 
sensitive activities even when the documents contain, 
information that is only incidental to the assassination, 
such as a passing reference to a name. There is a potential 
risk that sensitive, non-relevant sources and methods would 
be compromised. 
We suggest that the Board consider adding wording to this 
section that accommodates those instances when there is a 
need to release ample information from a document to 
disclose assassination-related material, while still 
protecting obviously unrelated, sensitive information. The 
Board, of course, would continue to have access to the 
entire record. 
4. Section 1400.7 Additional guidance 
Paragraph (d) states "any records identified with 
respect to a particular person also includes any records for 
that person by any other name, pseudonym, codeword," etc. 
This appears to require that all records on any individuals 
who are merely mentioned in an assassination record be made 
available. Is the objective really to assure that all files 
on an individual or activity be made available regardless of 
the labels on the files? If so, we suggest that the text be 
modified to reflect this.
