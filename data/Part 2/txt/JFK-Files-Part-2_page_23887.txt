CIA prohibition" and you see the words "proposed" and 
"statutory" are in brackets, reflecting_uncertainty on our part 
as to whether it was the intention of the Committee that this 
prohibition simply be a CIA regulation or embodied in the 
statute, which is recommended in the recommendation of procedur s. 
The Chairman. Senator Huddleston, do you have any comment 
on this? 
Senator Huddleston. I have .a personal feeling that when 
we go too far statutorily in dealing with th~ press, that we 
sometimes get on thin ice~ I don't know whether it· would be 
, 
appropriate to make some suggestion here that the press itself 
initiate certain standards and methods. Many of them in the 
press believe they ought to have anyhow. 
I think the recommendation for the CIA is probably 
I 
sufficient. i 
The Chairman. And!let that be handled as a matter of 
CIA regulations. 
' 
Senator Huddleston. Rather than by statute. 
The Chairman. Rather than by statute. 
Is that acceptable to the Committee? 
Senator Tower.· I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. ,-1ould you 
2 2 r~peat the proposition?' 
23 The Chairman. The proposition is·that the Committee 
i 
24 recommend that the CIA,jby regulation, handle this matter 
I 
25 rather than make it statutory.
