And as I point.out in my rev'iew of his book, I said, "You don't take an. 
artillery officer and make a submarine captain out of him. Or vice versa. 
Sure, you can do it 9ver a period of training, but if a guy wants to be a sub 
captain, _he goes into the sub service. He doesn't join the artillery. And 
vice versa." And I said, "You know, people are not that changeable." 
INTERVIEWER: Were you surprised when Colby tried· to do this? 
MR. HALPERN: No. Not -really. I am never surprised at anything Bill Colby 
wants to do. Never. 
INTERVIEWER: And that dates back to 
1
56? 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah. That dates back to '56. And I wasn't the only FE officer 
who saw it in 1 56. Believe me. 
INTERVIEWER: Is that right? That early on? 
MR. HALPERN: You could spot it. We did. I am not unique in this. Talk to 
sqme of the old FE hands and see what they te 11 you. _ Just don't take it from 
me. 
INTERVIEWER: How about the, we will come back to that later, how about, did 
you have much of anything to do with the Rockefeller Commission? 
MR. HALPERN: No. I didn't have anything at all. None of it. I read their 
· report. I' 11 ·show you my copy. It's a 11 marked up. They've got so much 
misinformation in there, it"s 'not even funny. I mean, even they're screwed 
up. I mean the nature of the business. It's like Robin Winks, he's got a lot 
of misinformation in there, Ranelagh got a lot of misinformation. People just 
can't get ... If I wrote a book, I'd have ·a ·lot of things wrong if I 
started to go outside of th·i ngs I personally know about. You know, a 11 you 
can do is conjecture. And how do you sort the wheat from the chaff? You are 
going to have a hell of a job.
