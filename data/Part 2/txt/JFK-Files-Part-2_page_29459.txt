City.378/ Within an hqur 1 >r two, ·Ms. Scaleti_ had 
located the photograph of •lswald visiting the Soviet· 
Embassy in Mexico City.379' Mr. Agee·went on to 
say: 
I don't know, don
1
t .rec~ll in fact 1 how she 
had been able to re:onclle or how they were 
able to reconcile i~ Mexico City the photo­
graph with ~he name, unless someone had 
known the face. Re:ause the problem with 
these observation pJsts is that you can get 
a lot of photographs from them, but to find 
out the exact identity of the people is not 
alwajs an easy ~hing to do. And it may be· 
that as they were listening to the telephones 
-of the Soviet Embassy, and also the Cuban 
Embas·sy, that she remembered the name. Oswald..)(_ 
or Lee Harvey Oswald from the telephone tap, 
if.in fact he had identified himself over the 
telephorie, and tried to make an appointment 
. with the cons~l or whoever. And then they 
were able somehow to reconcile the telephone 
conversation ~ith the photograph that -was 
takeri from the observation post the same day 
or more or less ~henever the app6intment wa~ 
made. On the other hand it may be that this 
photograph had not been identified until the 
time· of the assassination but that she had 
heard or recalled perhaps either reading the 
transcript from the telephone tapping or 
getting a condensed report perha~s ~ we~kly 
report or something of· the take from the 
telephone tap that ihe remembefed the name 
1 Lee Harvey Oswald and then went back into 
the files of all the photographs and looked 
through all th~.photographs until eventually 
she faun~ a photograph that was similaj to 
all the photographs .of Oswald ·that immediately 
began to come over the television and the news 
-services~ So those details I don't remember
