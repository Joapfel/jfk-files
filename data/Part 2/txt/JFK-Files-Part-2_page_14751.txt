OBSERVATION: 
The extent to which foreign groups, such as the 
SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit 
the United States and their continuing'propaganda barrage 
aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have 
· firsthand information regarding future plans of this ·group. 
We will also be in a position to identify other United States 
citizens in attendance. For these reasons it is felt we 
should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the 
informant's services as noted above. An airtel to Washington 
Field Office auth6ri~ing this informant to travel to Sweden 
is attached. Washington Field Office is being instructed 
to immediately debrief the informant up9n her return and to 
obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

forwarded to Washington Field Office.
