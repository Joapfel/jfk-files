Q Here these people on whom nane t::::-aces were requested. 
all foreign nationals? 
A All for~ign nationals. 
Q ~vas there any check made to deternine whether 
any of the~ were A.~erican citizens? 
A We levied on the S~cret Service as a requirement 
that they have identified these people by nationality before 
we would run a, na~e trace. Inadvertently, at one time 
I 
I 
they did submit a list, a rather long list of American cit•ze~~ 
sent back to them and told them we could~ ·1 which we promptly 
not trace. 
Q And this practice was followed both in 1968 and 
1972? 
A That is right. 
Q And where were these names traced? 
A. They were traced back here and also in Miami. The 
Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check 
here. In the case pf Cubans, probably the ~iarni Station had 
more information on the Cubans than we would have back here. 
Q But the nru~es were traced through Agency files?
