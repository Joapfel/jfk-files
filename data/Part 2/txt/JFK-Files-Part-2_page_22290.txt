they operate and the difference between a contact at a pro-
prietary firm, like Air America Incorporated or the 
Mullen Company would contact, you deal with contact men, some 
of whom were military who are cleared, but others are agency 
who are in there. 
Like Gil Greenaway was in the Pentagon, he was an 
Agency employee, he was not a military man. So when air lines 
contacted Greenaway they thought they were contacting a militar 
man, but he was really an employee of the Agency, for other 
reasons. But he was a contact man. So there was an array of 
different contact men. 
Now, in that elaborate context Schorr approached the 
subject, and he said, were there contacts in the White House? 
And I said, well, sure. Being the senior members of NSC 
we had contact for our Forty Committee work, and then 54/12 
Committee, and we knew who to deal with in the White House. 
And he said, well, were there ever any otherkind of 
contacts? 
And I said, the only POW contact was a very slight thing 
tied up with the Mullen Company, and then went on into the 
story. 
And the only way that I heard about the contact was, 
not that I was able to say that Butterfield was the 
contact, but that they brought up the name of Butterfield, and 
they said, we will get this business done --
