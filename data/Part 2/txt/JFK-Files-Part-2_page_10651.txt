On 6/20/75, we were advised that CIA had in 1973 
prepared a 693-page document citing instances wherein CIA 
operations may have exceeded its mandate. This document, in 
sanitized form, was reviewed by Intelligence Division personnel 
,and was found to contain many references to this Bureau, some 
of which dealt with operations of an extremely sensitive 
nature. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities 
(SSC) has had access to this document. At the specific request 
of this Bureau, CIA on 7/15/75 made available 190 pages of 
the document believed to be of interest to this Bureau. These 
pages are submitted as enclosuresto this memorandum, which 
highlights some of the contents thereof. Items so highlighted 
include various technical support CIA has provided this ) :
