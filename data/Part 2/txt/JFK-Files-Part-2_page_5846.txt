Records Relating to Oswald or the Assassination known to 
have been destroyed or removed. 
In November 1997, the Information Management Officer of 
the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) advised that he 
had discovered a record which indicated a file that r~ferred 
to the Kennedy assassination had been destroyed on "5/1/95". 
A search for information on this document revealed that the 
document had been created in 1977 and was described as 
"allegations regarding the Lee Harvey Oswald file." It was 
included with other documents grouped under the description: 
"Individual Case Files - Consists of documents 
accumulated in investigating complaints, suggestions, 
or problems of individuals which are brought to the 
attention of the IG. Filed numerically by case number. 
Potential cases filed alphabetically." 
It has been confirmed that copies of the documents were 
made available to the HSCA and are in the sequestered 
collection. The OIG has reconstructed the file and will 
maintain it as~ permanent record. Documentation is 
provided at Tab • 1 .
