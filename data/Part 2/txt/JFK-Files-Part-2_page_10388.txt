·1. • This memorandum is for your information only 
and confirms a report I made to you by telephone ea~lier 
today. 
2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on 
American proposals relative to the SALT talks in The New 
York Times over the bv-qne of Iden 181. It was 
devastati~gly accurate and contained direct quotes from 
a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had 
sent to Mr. Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control and 
Disarmanent Agency, a few days earlier. The President 
was alleged to be furious with this unauthori:ed dis­
closure of classified inforaation and directed~ sweeping 
investigation within the United States Government to 
determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation 
was conducted un~er the direction of ~Ir. Egil Krogh. and 
Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to ~ir. John Ehrlichman, 
Counsel to the.President for Domestic Affairs. 
·3. On the basis of investigations conducted by 
State Security and Defense officials, four individuals--
·one individual in the Department of Defense and three 
individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency-­
were tabbed as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted 
me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph 
the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation would be asked to polygraph the one suspect 
in the Department of Defense.
