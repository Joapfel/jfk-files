ne pract1.ce of counterintelligence (CI) -- and hence the 
ssue of damage to national security -- proceeds from four 
basic questions: 
• what information was compromised? 
• what foreign intelligence service(s) received the 
information? 
• what understanding of the. information did the receiving 
intelligence service(s) have? 
• what information did the receiving intelligence 
service(s) believe and thus act on to its benefit and 
to the detriment of the other party? 
• The first two questions are largely factual and can be 
acquired through a combination of confessions, polygraph 
interviews, and/or assumptions based on access. 
• Questions three and four, however, are the most difficult and 
the most important for both the acquiring intelligence service 
and the target intelligence service. 
• Question 3 is imP,ortant (e.g., Boyce Lee case) but is not 
really an issue here since the US fully undecstood the 
information presented.

Question 4, however, is the quintessential factor for 
exploitation.
