Dear Mr. Sprague: 
Sari Mordana has told me of her interest.in 
working on the legal staff you are assembling as Chief 
Counsel to the Select Committee on Assassinations. I 
am writing this letter to recommend Miss Mordana for 
such a position. 
Miss ·Mordana has worked as my·· law clerk for 
over a year, and I am highly impressed with-her ability. 
She is extremely bright and capable, and her superior 
work has made a significant contribution to the cases 
on which she has assisted. She has a great deal of in­
itiative in taking on responsibility, and has handled 
the-legal research and writing in several phases of com­
plex litigation with a minimum of supervision, and a high 
degree of professionalism. 
In addition to her practical legal ability, s'.b.e 
is articulate in the law, and her writing is of an ex­
tremely-high caliber. As to her personal qualities, she 
is'an unusually alert and hard-working individual, who 
delights in tackling a difficult project, and pursuing 
it to a' successful resolution.
