The charge-out record is temporary in nature and 
is destroyed five days after the file has been retµrned to 
the Files and Communications Division. 
WHY THE FBI" RETAINS INFORMATION' REGARDING' CONGRESSMEN: 
The information regarding Congressmen and Senators 
that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three 
major categories: 
(1) The results of •investigations (criminal-, 
security-, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman -or 
Senator as a subject or victim; 
{2) Information regarding a Congressman or Senator-­
in addition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the 
lawmaker involved--which the FBI has disseminated to other 
Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for 
example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to 
state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police 
department covering the lawmaker's home cbmmunity if, for example, 
the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker's 
house or other property) i and ~ 
(3) Other information that.the FBI receives from, 
or receives about, a Congressman or Senator that is included 
in the FBI' s files::--without having been either i"rrvestigated 
or disseminated by the FBI. 
The reasons this information is retained in FBI 
files can be explained in legal and administrative terms, 
as w~ll as in practical terms. 
Legal and Administrative Reasons 
All investigative files and other records of the 
FBI involving Congressmen.or Senators are within a class 
of records which--under the FBI Records Retention Plan 
developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records 
Service of the General Services Administration'--are con­
sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser­
vation. 
~rhis FBI Records Retention Plan w.as prepared under 
the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950, 
which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code.·
