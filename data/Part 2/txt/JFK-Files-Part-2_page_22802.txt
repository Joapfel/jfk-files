for the use of diffe~ent kinds of gases -- an operational plan 
for the invasion of Cuba these were uncertainties as to 
whether there would have to be military landings in Laos. In 
the context of 1961 -- and I am not in any sense trying to un­
derstate the seriousness of the context of 1975-- this was a 
hypothetical kind of a thing with two strong locks between 
it and any decision. And r•si~ply 0 didn't pay it the attention 
then that we are paying to it now. We are right to pay 
that attention now. 
The Chairman. I understand that very well. /\nd this 
Committee is endeavoring in every way it can to place this 
whole issue within the context of the time. Nevertheless, we 
are faced with a very real dilemma. We know that at the very 
time you were being briefed the Agency was not only interested 
in developing a capability, but was in fact engaged i~ a 
series of attempts to assassinate Castro, and had been in­
volved in other murder plots and murder attempts against the 
leaders of certain foreign governments. 
The question we are endeavoring to answer is whether 
the /\¢ency had been authorized by the policy makers of the 
government to engage in this activity, or whether it was 
operating fast and loose on a wild gambit of its own in an 
area of extreme sensitivity that could have the most serious 
repercussions upon the government of the U.S. and i½s 
reputation in the world.
