Within the Department of Defense, we have taken a number of steps to 
attack these problems. A formal five-year cost reduction program has been\ 
',! 
launched, which should produce savings of at least $3 billion per year by the 
end of fiscal year 1965·. It has already produced savings that should amount 
to $1.4 billion per year. We are shifting from cost-plus-fixed-fee to fixed 
price and incentive .contracts. We are studying ways to improve program

At my request the problem of how we select contractors has been under 
study for several months by a subcommittee of the recently established Defense 
Industry Advisory Council, which represents a cross-section of America's 
business and industrial leaders. Both the Council and we are convinced that our 
current source selection procedures can be improved. 
One way to reduce costs {and to increase reliability) is to insist that 
weapon systems be developed that can be used by more than one Service, where 
.this can be accomplished without degradation of essential military requirements. 
The advantages of one weapon system over two are obvious. They result in 
substantial savings not only in the development, test and production stages, but

observed in the Navy and in the Air Force today. The Navy currently has a
