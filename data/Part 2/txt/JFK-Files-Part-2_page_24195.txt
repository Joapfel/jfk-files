several non-profit organizations under Agency 
control. An unwritten condition of the sale was 
that the Agency would contract with the,new organizi­
ation for scientific research of intere·st to the 
Agency in the amount of ab.out $900,000 over an 
eighteen month period. Only about $770,000 wai so

This media type proprietary provided cover for 
an Agency employee who arranged for a foreign 
motion picture firm run by an American to produce 
and distribute .foreign language films throughout 
Latin America. For funding purposes, the proprie­
tary borrowed working capital from another prop-. 
rietary, LPBERRY/A, and paid production and. 
• distribution costs in anticipation of a return 
on the proceeds of film distribwtion. The prop­
rietary was dissolved in 1961, and all rights to 
the net profits of distribution were assigned

and the Agency negotiated a settlement which pro­

would render no further claims against each other,

Board of International Broadcasters for continued 
operation with Congressional support. ~\ •
