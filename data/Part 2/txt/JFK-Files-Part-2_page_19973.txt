.?r0sident, refuse to listen to our call for an end to wnr, for 
decent homes, a future for our childr5n, and a brighter tomorrow for 
a.11 families everywhere. 
Year, after year, more an~ more of our sons a.re sacrificed for wars. 
that never cease. Our lives become more and more dominated by the ~ 
mili tui,y-industrial complex. We face the horror of bringing up our 
f~~:liss in a. crisis-ridden -society in which:

Yo"u.tr~ ::.1·e jobless 01, drafted--
Children are proV'ided medioc-:re education in antiqm:i.~~d buildings-- / 
fumilies lack adequate medical care--

hc::..ve been subjected to the wors·e kinds of indign1 ties, simply 
oecause some of us are black. •
