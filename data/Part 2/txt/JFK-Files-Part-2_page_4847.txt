take on this kind of stuff. You've got to play games with 
these guys on the Hfll. You've got to wine them and dine them 
and breakfast them, or what~ver the phrase is. I think the 
DCI, whoever he is, has got to be able to work with a select 
group of people on the Hill who have got to have the confidence 
of the rest of their colleagues, whom they can trust and who 
can understand, like Huddleston says, that not everybody in 
Congress is going to know everything that .these guys are going 
to know. These guys in turn are going to have to understand 
that they can't know ~verythJng lither. Ther~ are some things 
that you just don't·talk about. And.I'm not talking about 
these big covert action bperations and what have you. They'll 
hear about those when it comes to passing the money for .a 
particular political action operation or a paramilitary­
operation. Those things take lots of dough. It's like in the 
o 1 d days the Radio Free Europe and Radio L1 berty took 1 ot s of 
money to run those radios. And Congress knew what the hell was 
going on. And Congress knew that RFE and RL were advertising 
in this country from the very beginning for American donations 
by.American citizens to fight Communism via the radio 
airwaves. And I don't know if that.was legal or not to this 
day, but I guess nobody objected. And they didn't object in 
the Church Committee to this thing. Except that now that it is 
run by another part of the US Gove.rnment. that makes it okay. 
It's the same thing.
