and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up 
a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose 
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern­
ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate 
into the government. This activity would take place first in the 
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend th:t;oughout the c·ountry until
