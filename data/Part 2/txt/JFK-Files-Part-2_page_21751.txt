opportuzrlty, .for the allegations had gained wide credence while IQ' own 
dela,yed nspc1u1e appeared anl.7 incompletely in the presa. Still, nothing 
was heard from the Committee. 
In December 197S John Crewdaon ot the Nev Yoric: Times interviewed. 
me in prison. He asked if' I knew anything about "CU assassination eapa .. 
bill ties", and I related to hi.a 1111' encounter w1 th Col. Boris T. Pash. Mr. 
Crewdson then inquired whether the Church Comittee had interviewed me. 
I responded in terms of tbe fore going, noting that I would have testi.fied 
about the Pash encounter had I been given the publicized opportmiitiEUle 
My' interview w1 th Mr. Crewdson was published and shortly thereafter IQ" 
attorney wu contacted by a representative of' the Ccmd.ttee. 
I consider it highly diacriDd.natory that the Cc:an:ittee is 
miwill.ing to have me testify 1n Washington u a furloughed w1 tnes1111e 
Further, the CCllll!llld.ttee • s nfuw to postpone intenievi.ng me in prisc:m 
mitil one ot two counsel fad.liar vi th IQ" career and affairs is available 
places M 1n a difficult position with regard to repreaentation by informed 
legal eomsel. And, u during the Enin Coad ttee hearings ( whose cost in 
legal fees to• approacbed $100,000) I aut again pa7 legal tees occasioned
