Comments re the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 
1. In general there is not much in the regulation to cause the DA undo concern except for Sec. 1400.2 Interpretation of 
additional records and infonnation; specificaliy (el, (1), (21, & (3). The schedules are classified in the agregate, filing systems and 
organization structures are classified in toto, and the storage facirrty is an Agency Records Center at a classified location. I know this 
may not be a lot of help, but I have little or no argument/comment concerning the other sections. 
2. If you have any questions/comments, please call me on@068:j}or note.
