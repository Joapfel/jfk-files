in Leopoldville (CIA Cable IN 38052, Leopold~ille to Director, 
11/"4/ 60) . Chief of Station Hedgman testified that he had been 
made aware by cable that O'Donnell was corning to the Congo 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 40). Hedgman said it was ":very possible" 
that as a new Chief of.Station he took the dispatch to the Congo 
of a senior officer like O'Donnell as a signal that CIA headquarters· 
was "dissatisfied with my handling" of Gottlieb's instructions 
(Hedgman, 8/ 21/ 7 5, p. 42) . 
Hedgrnan had a general p~cture of O'Donnell's mission: 
I understood it to be that -- similar to 
mine, tha.t is, the removal or neutrali­
zation of Lumumba . . . I have no clear 
recollection of his discussing th~ asiassi­
nation. (Hedgrnan, 8/21/75, p. 54.) 
Hedgrnan said that he had no reco.llect.ion of ,0 'Donnell indicating 
one.way or the other whether he was considering assassination as 
a means of "neutralizing" Lumurnba (Hedgrnan, 8/21/75, p. 55). 
Hedgman said, "in view of my instructions, I may have assumed that 
he was'' considering assassination (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55). Gen­
erally, however, Hedgman perceived O'Donnell as being unenthusiastic 
about his mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 56, 88-89). 
When O.'Donnell arrived in the Congo, he met with the Chief of 
Station, who informed him that there was "a virus in the safe" 
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 7-A; 6/9/75, p. 16). O'Donnell said he 
assumed it was a "lethal agent" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 37), although 
Hedgman was not explicit: 
r·knew it wasn't for somebody to get his polio 
shot up to date. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 16.)
