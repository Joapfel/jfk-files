was that was in it, and I just don't know. 
I have no reason to impugn his integrity. 
On the other hand, I don't understand how 
it was he didn't hear about some of these 
things that he claims 1;:hat he didn't.

I honestly di<ln't recall that Hr. McCone 
was-not informed and when I was told that 
there was evidence that he wasn't informed, 
I was trying to scratch my head as to why I 
didn't tell him at the time and my surmises 
are the best I can .come up with. I am really 
surprised I did not discuss it with him at 
the time. My relations wicti him were good, 
and so my surmises are just the best I am 
able to do in 1975 over an episode that took 
place that many years ago. (Helms, 6/13/75, 
p. 90) 
Several other Agency officials who were aware of the 
assassination plots testified that they had not told McCone 
of the plots. William Harvey testified that he never spoke 
with McCone about the operation involving underworld figures 
or assassination and that, to the best of his knowledge, 
McCone had not been told about the project.

(Harvey, 6/25/75, 
Sheffield Edwards, when asked whether he had informed 
McCone .about the plot, replied: 
Edwards: No, I did not inform Mr. McCone. 
Q.: Was there a reason for why you did not 
inform Hr. McCone?
