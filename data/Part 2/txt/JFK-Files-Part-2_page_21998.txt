This will confirm our conversation concerning obtaining proof 
with respect to the alleged peace talks with Castro in October and 
November 1963. Box 45 "Cuba-William Attwood," reviewed by Susan 
Pitts in the Kennedy Library, is said to contain "correspondence 
concerning arrangements for negotiations for U.S./Castro talks, 
10-11/63!' We have also heard stories about French journalist Jean 
Daniel being an emissary from Kennedy to Castro at that time. As 
you know, during October and November assassination devices were 
being prepared and were offered to AMLASH. 
You ought to at least see from the documents and from taking 
some single-Senator testimony from Attwood whether there was a 
genuine effort to make peace; if so, was that communicated to the 
Agency1 Was the AMLASH assassination effort consistent? 
In the telephone conversation I had with Arthur Schlesinger 
he said he thought Bill Attwood was more important than Daniel. 
Schlesinger will be here in Washington on July 9 and 10 and plans 
to come see us at 9:00 a.m. on July 10. 
Would you take care of all of the above.
