PURPOSE 
To collect intelligence required for the 
operations, to identify and earmark in­
telligence assets as refugees arrive, 
and to provide security against Com­
munist agent operations. 
To up-date NIE 85--62, so that current 
estimates can be considered at national 
policy levels. 
To cripple Cuba's rail transportation. 
16 .. 31 March 1962 
To collect intelligence. 
CON SID ERA TIONS 
This operation, in response to early recommendation 
as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at 
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 1vfa rch, with 
a new building co1npleted and occupied, anC: with a 
staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February 
and, as of 9 March, 33 peo_ple were active at the Center. 
(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice, 
State, USIA.) 
As the operations develop, there will be both increased 
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In­
telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully. 
It is likely that a more.informal method of producing an 
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than 
now governing t_he issuance of NIE's) may have to be 
followed. CIA is now publishing daily intelligence sum­
maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly 
report summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CIA 
responsibility, with support of others as required.)

It is expected that a minimum of 3 months 
is required before locomotives in Cuba start breaking 
down, once the contaminant is introduced.
