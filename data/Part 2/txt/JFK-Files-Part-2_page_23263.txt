Mr. Daron . Again, why are you ■o aure that this would 
not have been connected in any way to the as ■ ansination 
mission? 
Hr. Tweedy. I thought I made that clear because 
this man went out up to a point through what I would call 
the open channel, it was developed by the Division, giving 
training by the Division and was sent out. Thie had· nothing 
to do whatsoever with the other thing and wouldn't have been 
handled that way. 
Mr. Daron. Could he have been instructed by Mr. 
Hedqman, after he got to the Congo, that he was to undcrt.<1tt• 
recruitment of a~aets for participation in an assassination 
mission ~s part of his qcneral duties in the Congo? 
Mr. T\.'cc<ly. It ie purely a speculative queetion. He 
could have been but Hedgman would also have been required 
and would have told headquarters what he was doing with him. 
That was not the purpose for his being· sent. The purpose for 
which he was sent out w~s un~}lCCif_i~ at the time, qencrally 
in the PM field. 
~r. R3ron. Oid thi~ report create a flaµ at headquart~r~ 
at thf! time when the cable was sent? 
Mr. Tweedy. No, not at all. 
Mr. Uaron. lt woulrl have hccn considered a fftirly 
usual 
Mr. Tweedy. Jt is not.
