disclosure of certain classified information, including the JFK Assassination Records. 
Collection Act (P.L. 102-526) and legislation concerning the State Department's . 
Foreign Relations of the United States series (P.L. 102-138). In addition, Congress has 
granted itself the authority to declassify any information in its possession. 7 
Today, several more bills mandating declassification are pending before 
Congress, including: S. 1220, ''The Human Rights Information Act',s; S. 1232, a bill to 
declassify the private journal of Dr. Glenn Seaborg9; and S. 1379, ''The Nazi War 
Crimes Disclosure Act. "10 Each of these bills was introduced because the public had 
no choice but to tum to Congress in order to correct the failings of executive branch 
classification and declassification policies. If the Justice Department position were to 
be taken at face value, all of these bills- as well as the Freedom of Information Act 
= itself- would be unconstitutional, and executive branch officials would have completely 
; unchecked power to withhold whatever information they chose. 
_ In short, while the executive branch is entitled to advise Congress to stay out of 
national security information policy, Congress must be guided by the larger national 
interest and has every right to reject that advice, as it has in the past._ 
4. The secrecy J,ystem is not as bad as it could be. 
A statutory secrecy system should be conceived as a means, not an end in itself. 
In considering le.gislative changes to secrecy policy, Congress should aim to fix what 
needs fixing, but also to preserve what warrants preserving. 
In particular; the Committee should recognize the changes that were 
inaugurated with President Clinton's executive order 12958, and which have already 
produced some impressive results. 
Most important, from my point of view, is the order's automatic declassification 
provision (section 3.4) which requires the declassification of most historically valuable 
25 year old documents by April 2000. This provision has generated an unprecedented 
surge in declassification, reported at nearly 200 million pages in FY 1996 alone. 11
