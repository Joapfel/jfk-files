Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which 
the pr~sentation was made. 
Mr. Halley. This was a meeting with President Kennedy and 
other members of the_ then-Cabinet were present at that particula 
meeting. 
Mr. Baron. Was that a Ca~inet meeting or.was it a Special 
Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council? 
Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is 
1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was 
10 a meeting of the Cabinet or whether:it·was a meeting of the 
11 National Security Council, or whether it was a meeting of the 
12 Sp&cial Group. 
13 Mr. Baron. That:is perfectly understandable. Do you recal 
14 which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mr. Halley •.. Yes .. My recollection of that was that Mr. 
McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk ~as present, Mr. Kennedy, the 
Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now 
at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in 
my memory as being present. 
Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present? 
Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a 
portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave 
the other portion of the presentation. 
Mr. Baron. Who at that point replaced William Harvey as 
Chief of Task Force W?
