Bissell further stated that although he believed that Dulles 
"probably" talked with President Eisenhower: 
"the Mafia operation was not regarded as of enormous importance 
and there were much more important matters to talk about with 
the President." (Bissell, 7 /17, p. 25.) 
Bissell said he was "guessing" that Dulles informed Eisenhower. 
(Bissell 7/17, pp. 38-39.) He said, however, that he based his assumption 
on his knowledge of "command relationship, of'" Allen Dulles as an individual, 
and of his [Dulles'] mode of operations". (Bissell, 6/11, p. 6.) As 
_Bissell explained, his guess that Dulles informed President Eisenhower "is 
not based on hard evidence" but is "pure personal opinion". (Bissell, 
6/9, p. 61.) Nevertheless,he believed it to be so, and that the Presi­
dent thereupon gave his authorization "perhaps only tacitly". (Bissell, 
6/11, p. '6.) As Bissell explained, 
"My guess is that indeed whoever informed him, that is Dulles 
directly or Dulles through a staff member, would have had the 
same desire ... to shield the President and to shield him in 
the sense of intimating or making clear that something of the 
sort was going forward, but giving the President as little in­
formation about it as possible, and the purpose of itwould have 
been to give the President an opportunity, if he so elected, to 
cancel it, to order it cancelled, or to allow it to continue but 
without, in effect, extracting from him an explicit endorsement 
of the detailed specific plan.
