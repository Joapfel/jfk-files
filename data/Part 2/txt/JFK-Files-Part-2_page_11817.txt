informants when possible. Careful consideration should be given to

names and not under names of persons who may be listed in post 
office directory. More than one informant may send statements to 
a post office box, but consideration shguld be gi-ven to obtaining

suspicion on part of postal employees.

confidential post office box obtained under fictitious name.

card should be prepared to follow informant and take other logical 
steps to obtain additional identifying data. Restrict tickler cards 
to information which would warrant investigation if identity 
established. If no identification is made after reasonable effort, 
prepare memorandum for informant's subfile. 
5. Handling documentary material furnished by informants 
a. Pamphlets and similar documentary material furnished by informants 
sho~ld have placed thereon informant's code name. 
b. Informant should affix date he received m?terial. If informant can­
not recall date of receipt, date he furnished material should be 
affixed. 
c. No additional markings of any kind, such as initials, date received, 
permanent symbol number of informant, file numbers, indexing symbols, 
etc., should be placed on documentary material.
