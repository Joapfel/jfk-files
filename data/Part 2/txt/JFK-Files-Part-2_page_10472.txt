MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA Manage!Uent 
Com.mittee 
SUBJECT : Reported . Identity 61 Burglary 
1. Attached is a report summarizing what -....ve know about the 
reported break-in of Identity 61. .An investigative report 
by an officer of the Executive Protective Service slates that the 
offices were ransacked and a nun1ber of personal items stolen. 
2. The attached s tunmary also des.cribes a separate audio 
operation conducted against Identity 61 . by the FBI, at the 
Agency's behest and with its technical support. This presents a 
related question that ~hould be noted. James McCord 1 s· testimony 
indicates that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and IclentHy 
61. He says he picked the nwnbers at random, hoping 
that if his phone was tapped his attorneys -....vould be able to challenge 
the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulfield, 
says 1v1cCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he 11was sure" 
they "were subjects of national security wiretaps. 11 
3. In fact, there has been a long- standing telephone tap on the 
Identity 75 , run by the FBI, about \vhich CI Staff believes ::vfcCor<l 
knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation 
agc?'·~nst Identity 61 ·, and assumed that it v:as als.o a telephone 
tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping 
that both his telephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and 
that one way or another his case \vould be dismissed or dropped 
because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive 
operations. At this point, given the publicity of the Iden b 1 break-in, 
and the testimony of l\-lcCord and Caulfield, t~1e current investigations 
may lead lo exposure of the operations. •
