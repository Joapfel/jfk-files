There was also an envy known as the· Civil Air Transport-"to further 
complicate the picture, at this time Chennault and Willauer were 
also negotiating with the Chinese CNAC, . for the takeover of their 
planes and equipment." Chennault and Willauer came to the Agency 
in connection with that operation in the Spring of 1949. At that 
point the Nationalist Chinese were being "squeezed down south by 
the Communists and they were really bac_king down toward Shanghi, 
restricting their area of operation and consequently the produc-

go out of business. 
The agency held a series of meetings in which it was determined 
that it had a need for some air transport for some of its operations 
particularly involving arms and ammunition and consequently the 
Agency needed a c.ontract with someone. 
And so we entered into an arrangement, I think in 
about September of 1949 whereby· we would advance

planes at an agreed on rate .... And we did draw 
down, I think, all the flying time and expended the 
$750,000 between September and about January, at which 
time we suspended any further payments or draw-downs. 
I think the money was exhausted. 
Chennault and Willauer came to Washington about January or 
February of 1950 and through a series of negotiations, the Agency 
agreed to advance them more funds, taking at the same time an option 
to purchase the assets of Civil Air Transport,_ with the· liabilities 
left to their account. Any unused portion of the advances were to 
be credited to the purchase price. They then operated through the
