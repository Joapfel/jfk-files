E. Australia - Communist China Peiping has signed con­
tracts for Just over one nullion tons of Australian 
grain to be delivered early next year. We had been 
expecting the Chinese Communists to enter the market; 
since they had another mediocre grain crop this year. 
Peiping has been buying close to five miliion tons 
of grain for the past several years. 
F. Congo We hear that the Soviet Embassy in Leopold­
vill~ had bo~ked 75 places on a flight to Brussels 
last Saturday. There is still no information on 
whether any Sov~et Embassy officials have actually 
departed, however. 
G. Berlin There was no new harassment of Allied ac­
cess routes to Berlin over the weekend. A total of 
16 flares were fired last evening near Tempelhof 
Airfield, but we connect these with Communist ef­
forts to prevent escapes from East Berlin. East 
German police were observed stringing barbed wire 
in the same area a short time later. 
H. Laos The neutralists claim to have made significant 
gains in their limited offensive in the Vang Vieng 
area. They have not, however, been able to dislodge 
the Pathet Lao from po~itions within artillery range 
of the town's airport.
