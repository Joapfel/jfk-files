3. 
President, by Executive Order 10450, dated 4-27-53, established govern­
ment-wide employee security program, based on authority and approach set 
forth by Congress in Public Law 733, enacted on 8-26~50. 
Section 8(a} of EO 10450 p~ovides that investigations conducted pursuant 
• to this order shall be designed to develop infor~ation as to wh.ethcr em­
ployment or retention in employment in Federal service of person being 
investigated is clearly consistent with interests of national security. 
Such information relates, among other things, to following: 
nMembersh_ip in, or affiliation or sympathetic association with, 
any foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, 
group, or combination of persons which is totalitarian, Fascist, 
communist, or subversive, or which has adopted, or shows, a. 
• policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of 
force or violence to deny other persons their rights under the 
Constitution of the United States, or which seeks to alter th& 
form of. ~overnment of the United States by unconstitutional 
means. n 
Attorney General's part of employee security program consists of making 
full field investigations through FBI; maintaining list of totalitarian, 
fascist, communist, or subversive organizations; and giving agencies 
advice in establishing and maintaining their security programs.

of not more than $20,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than 20 yea.rs

~y Supreme Court on 6-7-57 and 6-5-61 establis~ed new evidentiary st~nd­
ards, such as proof of incitement to action, which must be met by Govern­

organizations; amends obstruction of justice statute; implement~ espionage 
and sabotage statutes and various immigration and naturalization regula­
tions ;·[and ]pro hi bi ts contributing to establishment of totalitarian di c­
tatorship. Act was amended 1-2-68 to delete requirement that communi::;1t 
organizations and their members register with Attorney General, a pro­
cedure ruled unconstitutional by Supreme Court because it violated
