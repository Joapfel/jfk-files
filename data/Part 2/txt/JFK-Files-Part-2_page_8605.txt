oblivious of the dangers involved in secretly flying near a Chinese missile 2 
instal lat ton and dropping an object 1n an action· that could quite easily appear 
to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear 
attack. Development of the eoatly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The 
technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device

[A thi_rd system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird, @ 
such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which 
coul~ be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well 
over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble 
on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once 
over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny telev!sion cameras 
would be turned on to record activities below and relay the infonnation either 
to its lauoch site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated· 
C!1inese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the 
CIA in research on this "baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in·
