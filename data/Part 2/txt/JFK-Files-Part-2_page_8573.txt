the proposed agreement, he raised some questions with the CIA sta~ion chief that 'J 
blossomed into an inter-agency_ dispute. At this point Meyer cabled the State (. 
Department for instructions and advice. 
In the way of background, it should be understood that CIA communications 
clerks handle nearly all classified cables between American embassies overseas 
and Washington -- for both the CIA and the State Department. To have a separate lt 
code roo.~ for each agency in every embassy would be a wasteful procedure, so a· // 
senior CIA communications expert is regularly assigned to the administrative 12 
part of the State Department in order to oversee CIA's communicators who wor-k 
under State cover. In theory, CIA code clerks are not supposed to read the !'/-
messages they send for State, but any code clerk who wants to have a successful J $'" 
career quickly realize~ that his promotions depend on the CIA and that he is I~ 
well advised to show the CIA station chief cppies of all important State 17 
messages. The State Department long ago implicitly recognized that its most J? 
secret cables are not secure from CIA inspection by setting up special ,q 
· communications channels which sppposedly cannot be deciphered by the CIA. Zc
