OTHERS 
1. There have been about 40 legal travelers 
from British Guiana to Cuba. Some Latin American 
travelers could be carried without much chance of 
detection on Cuban freighters hauling rice. Local 
papers and oppositio~ parties have-charged that 
some of the students sent to Cuba did not have 
proper academic qualifications for their studies, 
implying their travel, was for other purposes. 
There are no reliable reports, however, that any 
Guianese have received subversive training in Cuba. 
Any Cuban training for British Guianese would pre­
sumably be designed to support rather than sub-
vert the government of Premier Cheddi Jagan. There 
have been no arrests for subversive activity, and 
no incidents of terrorism, sabotage, or subversion. 
There have been riots, but no·t Cuban-connnected. 
2. Jamaica sent 593 legal travelers to Cuba 
in 1962, probably accounted for largely by the 20-
25,000 Jamaicans resident in -Cuba. There is no 
evidence of guerrilla training for any Jamaicans, 
and th~re have been no arrests for guerrilla, 
sabotage, or terrorist activity. Subversion is con­
fined largely to public oratory defying the Jamaican 
authorities. A British Guianese Communist studying 
in Jamaica, who is believed to have received train­
ing in Cuba, instigated a demonstration in front of 
the U.S. Embassy in October, 1962, by six members 
of the "Friends of Cuba Committee;" one Communist 
was arrested, fined, and released as a result for 
"obstructing traffic." Two university instructors 
and two other teachers are believed to have re­
ceived indoctrination in Cuba. 
3. Surinam and Trinidad report no subversive 
incidents, no arrests, and no evidence of Cuban 
subversive training for any of their nationals. 
Trinidad listed two legal travelers in Cuba in 
1962.
