recalled that the question of a Castro assassination was raised) declared 
that the discussion was not related to his assassination activity with Ro­
selli. (Harvey, i/11, pp. 48-50)~ Harvey further testified that he did not 
view the August 10, 1962, discussion of a Castro assassination as authoriza­
tion for the Roselli operation because "the authority, as I understood it, 
for this particular operation went back long before the formation" of the 
Special Group Augmented. (Harvey, 7/11, p. 49); 
1. The Contemporaneous Documents / 
a. Lansda1e's Auo;ust 13, 1011?. Memorandwn 
Following the August 10, 1962 meeting, Lansdale sent a memorandum on 
August 13, 1962, to Harvey and the other member-s of Lansdale's interagency 
working group.~/ (Lansdale Ex. 15, Memorandum from Lansdale, August 13, 1962). 
The Memorandum began by stating: "In compliance with the desires and guidance 
expressed in the August 10 policy meeting on Operation Mongoose, we will 
(''~ 
, __ J produce an outline of an alternate Course B for submission." (Lansdale 
Ex. 15, p. 1) . 
Lansdale further.set out his concept of what was required: "I be­
lieve the paper need contain only a statement of objective& and a list of 
implementing activities .. The list of activities will be under the heading 
of: Intelligence, Political, Economic, Psychological, Paramilitary, and 
Military." (Lansdale Ex. 15, p. 1). 
* In addition to Harvey, copies of Lans<lale's August 13, 1962, memorandum were 
sent to Robert Hurwitch (State Dept), Gen. Benjmnin Harris (Defense Dept) and 
Don Wilson (U.S. Infonnation Agency). (Lansdale Ex. 15.) 
In his testimony, Gen Harris identified a document drafted hy the Mongoose Work­
ing Group in the Defense Dept shortly before the August 10 meeting. TI1e document 
listed a number of steps that could be taken in the event of an intensified Mon­
goose program that might involve U.S. military intervention. One such step was 
, "assassinate Castro and his handful of top men." (Harris Ex. 4.) Gen. Harris 
\ ... ,/ stated that this was "not out of the ordinary in tenns of contingency planning ... 
it's one of the things you look at. (Harris, p. 37 .) TI1ere was no evidence that 
this document was distributed outside the Defense Dept's Mongoose working group.
