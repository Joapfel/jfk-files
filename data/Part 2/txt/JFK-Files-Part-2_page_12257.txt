[ 12. Dur;i_ng initial stag es of development and on occasion active inforrnants 
[ may raise a personal question concerning their own position if it 
[ becomes known publicly that they are affiliated with a subversive { 
[ organization. In ·(;he event a potcnt.ial informant or informant inquires 
[ as to what can be done for him in such a case, he may be told that 
[ his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
[ a~ises concerning his loyalty we will consider making the facts of his 
[ cooperation with the FBI known to his employer or to the responsiqle 
[ individuals. It should be pointed out that this actfon may make it 
[ impossible for him to continue on behalf of the FBI and the service 
[ which he is performing for his country may be, terminated. Before 
[ taking steps to a,dvise anyone of a potenti2l informantf s o-.:- informant's 
[ coopuration,. prior Bureau authority must be obtained. 
[ 13. Spec:tfically advise. each potential informant that he is not an<l cannot 
[ consider hims elf a Bureau employee or "undercover .Agen·!;11 of the FBI.

[ must be impressed upon the informant, • • 
[ 14 . .Advise potential informant that his cooperation must be strictly confi-
[ dential at all times and if he should feel he cannot maintain this· 
[ confidence he should so advise. There should be no doubt left in the· 
[ mind of the informant that ·his relationship must remain on a confidential 
[ basis and if he violates the confidence he will .be of no value and by 
[ so doing the Bureau 1 s investigative activity may be jeopardi¼ed. This 
[ mus·b be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you aCC(';pt him 
[ as such. If the informant has a special problem which would rf\quire 
[ his revealing his relationship to his wife, etc., 'chis shoulcl be lea:r:i.,,,5. 
[ from him during the initial interview·and a recommendation made to U 
[ Bureau when the results of the interview are furnished. The special 
[ oiroums·tances will be taken into corisideratlon by the '.Burea:u .. 
[ 15, If a prospective informant is connected in any manner with a labor 
[ union$ inform him ·!;hat the Bureau is not interes·bed in employer-
[ employee rela:Honships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
[ information on the infil·bra·tion in labol' unions by subversive elements. 
[ 16. "If the potential informant is a student, tea.cher, or has any similar 
[ relations with a school, college, or university, in his initial inte ew 
[ and subsequent handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern-
[ ing investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities. 
[ 17. From the first interview with a potential informant through his develop-
[ ment and until he is discontinued, extreme caution should be used at 
[ all times to be certain he is not a plant. 
[ 18. When potential informant begins to furnish current information and 
( otherwise qualifies for designation as informant, assign permanen·!;; 
[ symbol number and advise Bureau. This cow..municatiori must be personally 
[ initialed by SAC or .ASAC acting in his absence; individual's background 
[ must also be thoroughly reviewed at this time, keeping in mind possibility 
[ of using informant as a potential witness. If individual has any 
[ weaknesses, set forth safeguards being followed to insure security and 
[ to prevent embarrassment to Bureau.)
