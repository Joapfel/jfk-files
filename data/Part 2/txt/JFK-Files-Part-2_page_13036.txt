Dear Mr. Shaheen: ~l, 
I want you to know how much I appreciated. the •. 
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other 
day abo11t the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most 
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-· 
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you 
that ·we will do everything poss·ible to avoid jo(~pardizing . 
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations~ 
I do want to reiterate bur need for the specific 
items set forth in earlier doclh"Ilent reque-sts which -ivould 
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusi9n 
as of_various dates in 1962, 1963 and'1964 that Stanley 
Levison was a 
11
secret member of the Cornmunist Party, USA. 
11 
Of course in the,..event that the·re is no particular docuraent 
in any of those years where.in Levison "t;•Jas so-identified to 
the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know 
so that we may consider ou:!:' 6uts·tanding requests in that . 
context. Finally, of course~ ·we still need :une.zcised copies _ 
• of the Febrii'a:-y ··22 and Ju112 12, 1962 c,:,rn:."l1unicati.cns from 
New York "t;,-=-hich appear to hive beer1 th~ articulated predicates

I look forward

again, I ·wa:1 c to t:1.ank you for your time. and
