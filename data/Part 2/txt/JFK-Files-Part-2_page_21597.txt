Office of Security, although that office had an 
excellent relationship with FBI. Allan Dulles 
would not have condoned it since he had great 
respect for the FBI. Papich believes the same 
is true of McCone ahd Helms. Papich also con­
cedes the possibility of entries by the CIA,

some thought a new FBI would be needed 
for it. The FBI as con did not have 
trained personnel or c to develop foreign 
targets. The CIA had his capability. Papich 
proposed that FBI permit CIA to recruit in the 
United States. CIA would advise FBI of its interest 
in a target, the purposes of the contact, and any 
results. If the FBI had no interest in the target, 
that is, an interest in a KGB contact for example, 
it,would OK the CIA contact. FBI required that 
CIA furnish it any information relevant to its 
needs, that is regarding KGB contacts (the New Left 
was handled separately from the memorandum of under-
standing procedures). 6 
Alan Belmont headed the FBI Intelligence Division 
before Sullivan. A capable administrator, he 
operated behind the scene, stayed out of politics, 
had good rapport with agents, and was able to 
handle Hoover. When Belmont retired, the FBI·"lost 
a rudder". This was a crucial point in FBI history, 
with Hoover getting old. Belmont stressed to his 
subordinates the need to develop a strong case for 
any proposal going to Hoover. Once that case was 
ready, Belmont would push it hard, but Papich and 
Belmont did disagree on such matters as counter­
intelligence operations against the KGB.
