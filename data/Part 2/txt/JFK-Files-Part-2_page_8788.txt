Part of the net, a major PM operation consisting of 
nlllllerous sabotage operations against on-island targets, 
was wrapped up by CASTRO in November 1962. Through 
captured agents, CASTRO learned that the operations 
were approved at the highest levels of the U.S. 
Govenunent and that the major sabotage operations were 
approved by President Kennedy. The captured agents 
appeared on TV. The Olbans referred to operation OJPID 
(true) and to Robert Wall (CI Staff.) /We wonder how 
the agent lmew the operational crypt. The Olbans

agent's case officer phoned him once in the agent's 
presence, and referred to Wall by true name.!
