there was dissidence within the coup group, the people who 
.~ were going to pull the coup and one general didn't like the other general. The best way I 
~ can describe it, if you had three Vietnarrese generals sitting and talking to you, one genera:! 
~ would talk, walk out of the room to go to the "john", two would tell you., don't trust that 
~ one, and finally the one who had,?ut-waited the other two, there would be one left, and he 
would say, don't trust those two. p. 31

OCCURHENC~;: COLBY stated that llI would say that the embassy's position, the political 
sectic:, and the arrbassador, was much rrore syrrpathetic to the prcr;:,,osition that the war couJ, 
not successfully be conducted with President DIEM stlll in power without a major change in 
his style of Oi)eration. However, there is an additional factor, this which was the publJ,; 
nressure on the policy levels of our gove:r:1rrent in Washmgton, and the Ur.1.ited States, and 
thinJ,c this public pressure was felt particular by the people in the NATIONAL SECURITY COUi-:' 
and by the people in the srrNI'E DEPfu'1'.I'IVENT. rt p. 61
