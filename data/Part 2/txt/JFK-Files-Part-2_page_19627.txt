According to information received from the-Wa-shington' FielcT". 
Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, thet-'April Tenth Women's Committee'' 
.._Qf New York City, a recently formed group of women 1 s protest organizations, 
plans a }'March on the P~nt~gs:m" on Saturday, 4/10/Jl, as an anti-war protest. 
Plans call for the protesters, who mai-iiuintier as many as 5,000, to assemble 
at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets, 
Northwest, between 11:00 a. m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon 
via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled, 
to end around 5:00 p. m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses _J. 
l
capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washingtm. The .-;+-·· 
busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported th~ 
women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point 
for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesterc: 
are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another 
demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon. 
General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security 
officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street 
Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday. 
Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces­
sary.
