Coups involve varying degrees of risk of assassination. 
The possibility of assassination in coup attempts raises 
questions concerning the propriety of United States involve­
ment in coups, particularly in those where the assassination 
of. a foreign leader is a likely prospect. 
This country was created by violent revolt against a 
regime believed to be tyrannous, and our founding fathers. 
(the local dissidents of that era) received aid from foreign 
countries. Given that history, we should not today rule 
out support for dissident groups seeking to·overthrow tyrants. 
But passing beyond that principle, there remain serious 
questions: for example, whether the national interest of 
the United States is genuinely involved; whether any such 
support should be overt rather than covert; what tactics 
should be used; and how such actions should be authorized 
and controlled by the coordinate branches of go.vernment. 
The Committee. believes that its recommendation on the question 
of covertactions·-in support of coups.must·await the Collll'littee's 
final report which will be issued after a full review of 
covert action in general.
