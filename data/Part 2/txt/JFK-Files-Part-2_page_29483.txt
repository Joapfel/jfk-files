1 ) the_ caller spoke broke11 Spanish; 2) the caller did not 
have the number of the Con!ulate; ·3) the·caller did not know 
that visas were issued at 1he Cons~late; and 4) the caller 
states that he is seeking l visa, not that he is. checking on 
an application already madE. The majority of the evidence 
indicates that lee Harvey (swald could not speak Spanish. 476/ 
In- light of Delgado's assertions, it is possible that 
O~wald had at least a li~ited knowledge of Spanish. It should 
.. 
be noted that the.1~/_3/J D~.anscript listed above indicates th·at 
. the caller spok~Ay,:;~ Spanish. 477/ The fact that this • 
conversation was in Spanish, should not by itself rule out the 
pos~ibility that Oswald made the phone call. T~is is especially 
true in lighi of Oelgado's allegations and the 9/27 10:30, 
9/27 10:37 and 9/27 l :25 cans which were also in Spanish. 473 1

entered the numbers in the 1titebo~k. Since Osw~ld ·had previously
