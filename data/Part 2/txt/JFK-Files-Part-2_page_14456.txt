MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN 
RE: COVERAG~ OF:MAIL TO THE~.s.s.~ 
. . 
·11 and in view of the .volume of materiai being sent from the U.S., their coverag 
is an extensive. and e}..rp~nsive operation. He indicated that they had to set up 
elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition 
a complicated indexing procedure was involved, ~s well as complex scientif-'~c 
l 
examination~ of the material. 1 He said· ~9....Q£JJ\t~.!Lhl.IDQr~ . ..QM:~m_pJo_y~~~ ar

th~-?o~iden_tial nature of his ~ormation and stated that while othe_r _officials::?­
CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a V1S1t from th

. It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in 
New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question 
immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York 
has inv~1.~ed our jurisdictio~. In. _t.11is regard, it is believed that they have a • 
!egitimate rigp.t in the objective~ for which the ..coverage was set up, namely, . 
\the development of contacts and _sources of information behind the Iron·Curtain 
-and~a:ccording to Angleton they have had ~ome success: in this ~egard. At the 
1 
. same time, there is an internal security .objective here in which, because of . 
ou, responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of 
illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States~ While recognizing • • 
• this interest, it is not believed tllat the Bureau should assume this coverage . 
Ill 
because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity, 
size and expenseD rt is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by· t • 
pointing out to CIA our intern~! s.ecurity obje.ctives and holding them responsib e , 
• to share their coverage with us.·. Of course, we are not interested in the f 
identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding f
