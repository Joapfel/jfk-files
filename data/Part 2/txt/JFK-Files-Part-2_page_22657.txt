Byetkov, gave us information which we would now regard as 
private, which would tend to absolve the Soviets of any 
implication with Oswald . 
Mr. Schwarz. When you acquired from a number of sources 
the information that the KGB had spent some six months 
Mr. Angleton. We only acquired the hard stuff of six 
months and what they did from one man who was very high in the 
KGB. 
Mr. Schwarz. Without getting into what his name was, 
when did you acquire the information? 
Mr . Ang le ton. 
Mr. Schwarz. 
1967, or thereabouts. 
So it was after the Warren Commission had 
reached its conclusions? 
Mr. Angleton. Did you have any such information during 
the life of the Warren ~ommission? 
Mr. Ang le ton. I think the only thinq was the Nosenko --
Senator Baker. Which was suppressed by whom? 
Mr. Angleton. We suppressed it, because Nosenko arrived 
at a very brief time after the assassination as a KGB defector. 
Senator □ aker. And he is the one that you think now as 
a planted agent? 
Mr. Ar,gleton. Yes. They thought he was sent on a 
mission. 
Mr. Schwarz. Suprressed by whom? 
Mr. Angleton. Suppressed from the Warren Com.mission.
