(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's Secret· 
Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean ·Wa'r was 
winding down, the CIA began sending intelligence agents 
into Tibet to assess the situation and see what could be 
done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the 
offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched 
by air and made contact with the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, giving 
him a channel of communication with the West.· . . . 
"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to 
avoid capture by the Chinese forces in 1959, • he was 
accompanied on his flight bf a CIA-trained radio operitor 
who was able to keep Washington posted on his often 
hazardous progress." • 
(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA 
"close relationship"·with the Dalai Lama and his being 
"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different 
from Rositzke's statement about CIA train~d radio operators 
being with the Dalai Lama. These are two different • 
comments with.the first being properly classifiable and 
classified.
