B.tlMuch of the above effort as noted will be primarily 
directed towards devel~ping all possible evidences of stress 
or strain within the regime and between the regime and other 
nations, particularly the Bloc. An intensive program will 
be continued to take advantage of any possible opportunity 
to weaken, subvert, or split the regime in any possible 
fashion. This is basically a long term effort. A great deal 
of work already has gone into this and the current 
status of this program and the proposed further expldtation 
of the numerous leads we have developed is being made, in 
the interests of brevity in this memorandum, the subje·ct of 
a separate compilation. The effectiveness of assets aimed at 
actually splitting the regime, i.e., a palace revolt, will of 
course depend, to an extent, on th-e willingness of.the United 
States Government to support them and it is entirely possible 
that any such effort might fail unless supported with military 
forces which on the basis of th-e assumptions in Paragraph I 
above would appear unlikely. 
C. Sabotage: On the basis of the assumptions set out 
above, commando type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other 
acts of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve little 
purpose and should not be undertaken except in the rare 
instances where an opportunity is presented with acceptable 
risk to do major damage to the Cuban economy. It is proposed 
to ·continue searching for such limited opportunities, but 
no active or wide scale program is contemplated.
