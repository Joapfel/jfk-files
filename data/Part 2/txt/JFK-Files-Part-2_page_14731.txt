Congress, iii providing this. important added tool in the 
evidence gathering process, intended that such a restriction 
applied. We also noted that the draft suggested that in all 
cases when an application for an oider is denied, those named 
in the application would be informed .that the Government 
intended to subject them to electronic surveillance. With 
regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice 
requ~rement pertains only to those situations where emergency 
·intercepts have been made withou:t court order, and thereafter 
the court has denied the application and not· to all applications 
which might be denied in the, normal_. course of business pursuant 
to the main body of regulations in Title III •. 
We concluded our observations to the Attorney 
General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of 
guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems, 
it was believed that for the Government's ultimate success in 
making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions 
must not apply which will create more limitations on law 
enforcement than the statute itself prescribes.
