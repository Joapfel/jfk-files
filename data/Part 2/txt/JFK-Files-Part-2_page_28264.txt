near Dick: 
I've been following the progress of the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations and its chief counsel as well as 
newspaper and wire service stories permit. 
I gather, at least from a Newhouse News Service report, 
that the committee unanimously has agreed to support your 
request for a staff of 170 but that the actual funding will not 
follow until after January 1. 
If that's the case, and you can use me now, I'd like 
to come to Washington and get involved as early as possible. 
I think I can be more effective in the role of press 
liaison officer if I arrive on the scene before the great 
bulk of the staff. 
I have received a formal letter from Bulletin management 
confirming an extended leave of absence. But this does not 
preclude a short-term leave. Even if Congress ultimately 
refuses to fund the investigations _fully and they are cut 
short, I feel I could return to the Bulletin without loss 
of face or funds. The experience of working for even a few 
weeks or'months with the committee would be worth the effort. 
Also, even though I would move to Washington immediately, 
Shirley and Sharon would remain in Philadelphia to June 30. 
I , therefore, would not get involved with a long-term e lease 
until the summer. So, if the investigations are terminated 
early, there would be little financial hardship on mi part.
