had debriefed ~o~tli~~ upon his return from the Congo (CIA Cable 
&uT 7833~, Tweedy to (chief of)Stacion, 10/7/60). T~eedy was also

Tweedy testified, however, without benefit of reviewing these 
cables, that he had no knowledge of the plot to poi.son Lum_umba: 
~- Do you have any knowledge of a messenger 
from CIA headqu~rters ~aving to go to the Congo 
to provide the ~hief 09station in the Congo 
with instructions to carry out the assassination 
of Lumumba, if possible, and also provide him 
with the tools to carry out such an assassination, 
namely, poisons and medical equipment for admin­
istering them?
