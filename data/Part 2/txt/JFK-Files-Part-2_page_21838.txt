1. Introduction 
TOP ScCRET 
For Internal Committee 
Use Only 
The Committee has received solid evidence of a CIA 
plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. The plot proceeded to 
the point where lethal substances and instruments specifically 
intended for use in an assassination were placed in the hands 
of the CIA lhief oDStation in Leopoldville by an Agency 
scientist. 
Although these instruments of assassination were never 
used, a number of questions are presented by the Lumumba case 
which reflect general issues that run throughout the Committee's 
assassination inquiry. First, did CIA officers arid operatives 
(¥ in the Congo take steps to attempt the assassination of Lumumba? 
C 
Second, how high in the United States government was the 
source of authorization for the CIA assassination plot? Finally, 
was the CIA connected in any way to the events that actually led 
to the death of Lumumba while in Congolese -custody? 
A thread of historical background is necessary to weave these 
broad questions together with the documents and testimony re­
ceived by the Committee.
