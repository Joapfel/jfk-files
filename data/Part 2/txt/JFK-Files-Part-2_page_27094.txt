RE.I/ARKS: 
Phil: 
Attached is the interim report on the problem 
you and I have discussed recently. I stress 
the term interim since we have received • 
new information from Defense as recently as 
yesterday and have not exhausted our own 
search for information within CIA. 
Recognizing your concern that the investigation 
be conducted with the participation of some 
outside person or group -- and also the fact 
that we were unable to find a satisfactory 
solution -- let me briefly outline the approach 
I followed. 
I stressed objectivity and tried to assure 
that no persons who were potentially a· party 
to the activities in question had any 
opportunity to destroy information or material 
which might be related, 
My Associate Deputy Director, Dr. Sayre Stevens, 
was the prime investigator with technical 
advice from ··Db .. •:•Tom,:NeVHon, an MD· with an 
outstanding research background but hired by 
PhotoCO!IY 
from
