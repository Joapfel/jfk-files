this impression was derived solely from Gbttlieb's meetings 
with Bissell and Tweedy. Neither Gottlieb nor the Chief of 
Station had first-hand knowledge of Allen Dulles' statements 
abou~ Presidential authorization. Richard Bissell assumed 
that such authorization had be~n conveyed to him by Dulles, 
but Bissell had no specific recollection of any event when 
this occurre.d. 
The evidence leads us to conclude that DDP Bissell and 
DCI Dulles knew about and authorized the plot to assassinate 
Lumumba. However, we are unable to make a finding that 
President Eisenhower intentionally authorized an assassination 
effort against Luwumca because of the lack of absolute certainty 
in the evidence.
