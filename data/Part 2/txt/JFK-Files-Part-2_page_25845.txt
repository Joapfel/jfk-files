10. Rockefeller Commission Inquiry 
Rocca served as CIA liaison to the Rockefeller Commission 
in regard to Warren Commission allegations. Belin and Robert Olsen 
were involved in the investigation. Belin wanted Rocca to review 
documentation regarding the 1 photo of the unidentified individual 
in Mexico City. Belin told Rocca that the Warren Commission was not 
clued in on Cuban emigrecissues and Operation MONGOOSE. Rocca de­
veloped the impression that the Rockefeller Commission was looking 
into CIA's operations aimed;at Castro. Belin asked Rocca for the 
Castro comments of September 7, 1963. Belin was not aware of the 
statements during the Warren Commission. (Slawson, however, was but 
only at the conclusion of the WC.)· 
Rocca also said that Belin is writing another book on Oswald 
and the President's assassination.
