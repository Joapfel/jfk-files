· Dear Dr. Gunn: 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

CSI 97-536 
CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS 
RELEASE AS SANITIZED 
2000 
Thank you for your letter of 28 October in which you 
outline the Assassination Records Review Board's goals for 
the coming year. I appreciate the complimentary remarks you 
made about the "excellent cooperation" that CIA has been 
providing to the Board. 
You raised a concern that the Agency may not be able to 
increase sufficiently the pace of the review process to meet 
the 1 September 1998 deadline for completing the transfer of 
records to the National Archives. You also expressed the 
view that if any records are not reviewed by the deadline, 
the Board will vote to release them in full and mandate that 
custody be trans.ferred to the National Archives. 
You can be assured that we are committed to taking all 
necessary steps to meet our statutory obligation to review 
all of the Agency's assassination-related materials. It is 
important that a .proper review of all relevant records be 
done. This will allow us to recommend to the Board what 
information warrants continued ·protection. 
We appreciate the great responsibility that Congress 
and the President ~ave given to the Board to infonn the 
American people about the assassination. We ·share the 
Board's goal of declassifying and releasing the relevant 
records to the fullest extent possible.· • 
Please convey my regards to Chairman·Tunheim and the 
other Board members, and assure them of our continued 
cooperation. 
Sincerely, 
~l)_t ~
