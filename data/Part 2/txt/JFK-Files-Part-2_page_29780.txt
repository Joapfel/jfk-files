MEXICO CITY -- CIA E
Q 
. 
A review of notes taken from interviews with David 
Phillips indicates that there are a several areas 
which our witness may be questioned about. 
Organization & Personnel 
Personnel in Mexico City Station: 
David Phillips: 
In 1963 Phillips was in charge of Cuban affairs 
for the CIA in Mexico City. As such, he was 
responsible for the monitoring of the Cuban 
Embassy. 
He was in Mexico City from September 1961 
to early 1965, succeeding Tom Hazlett. 
He originally comes from Ft. Worth and joined the 
CIA in 1950. 
He l'.'ecalls the Oswald .t<:lipe .as an \Interc,ept';between 
the Soviet and Cuban embassies .. ·Herbert Manel, head 
of Russian affairs at Mexico City Station would 
have been primarily responsible for information 
derived from this intercept. 
Phillips was never in the intercept unit, which 
was staffed mainly by Mexican nationals. 
His immediate superior was Warren Dean, but he 
answered to Winston Scott. 
Winston Scott: 
Station Chief for the Mexi~o City CIA Station in 1963. 
Supervisor for Phillips in practice, although the 
deputy Chief of Station would normally have been 
the person to whom Phillips was to report. 
Scott was known for his almost photog_rap:11_;ic memory 
and a strong personality. He did no·t like. to--dele·g-ate --:.-·c:i 
authority. -
Scott was the person who made final determination 
as to whether information coming in over an 
intercept was to be forwarded to Washington or not. 
Scott is now deceased. He died of a heart attack 
around 1972. His name was not previously known publicly. 
Warren Dean: 
Deputy Station Chief under Scott in Mexico City. 
Phillips was not sure whether it was Dean or Allen 
White who held this office at the time of Oswald's 
visit, but he feels fairly positive that it was 
Dean.
