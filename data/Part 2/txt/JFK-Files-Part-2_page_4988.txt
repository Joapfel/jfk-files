SANCHEZ BY PASSING AROUND STORIES THAT HE HAD BEEN WITHHOLDING 
ORGANIZATIONAL FUNDS, INTENDED.FOR THE SOCIALIST CURRENT, FOR HIS 
PERSONAL USE. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS RUMOR CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE 
*CONTRIBUTED TO SANCHEZ' REPORTED RESIGNATION FROM THE<EXECUTIVE> 
COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST CURRENT.) 
E. REPORTING ON RADIO MARTI FROM MIAMI AROUND MID 1995 
ALLEGEDLY REFERRED TO VLADIMIRO ROCA AS AN AGENT OF CUBAN STATE 
SECURITY. ROCA HIMSELF WAS REPORTED IN CUBAN DISSIDENT CIRCLES TO 
HAVE STATED THAT HE WAS A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF MAJOR GENERAL FABIAN 
((ESCALANTE)) FONT, WHO WAS REPORTEDLY THE CHIEF OF THE MININT 
DIRECTORATE OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (DCI). (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: 
ESCALANTE FONT NOW HEADS THE MINISTRY'S HISTORY COMMISSION AND IS

5. GUILLERMO FERNANDEZ DONATES IS A CIVIL ENGINEER WHO WAS 
CLOSE TO GUSTAVO ((ARCOS)) BERGNES OF THE CUBAN COMMITTEE FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS (COMITE CUBANO PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS). HE WAS 
SUSPECTED OF BEING A MININT SOURCE AND A PROVOCATEUR BY THE CCC 
LEADERSHIP. HE JOINED THE CCC ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF ARCOS 
BECAUSE FERNANDEZ WAS A MEMBER OF THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS. (SOURCE 
COMMENT: MANY MEMBERS OF THE CCC ARE PROFESSIONALS.) THE CCC 
INITIALLY BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ BECAUSE HE HAD A HISTORY 
OF ARRESTS IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED WITH VARIOUS GROUPS OF 
POLITICAL PRISONERS. IN PRISON HE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE A FIGHT 
WITH A GUARD OR COMMIT AN INFRACTION OF REGULATIONS AND BE REMOVED 
BY THE AUTHORITIES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION. EACH TIME HE EMERGED 
FROM PRISON HE SEEMED TO BE IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND WELL FED. 
6. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OTHER ANOMALIES HAVE CAUSED THE 
CCC LEADERSHIP TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ: 
A. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, FERNANDEZ HAS BEEN ASKED BY 
THE CCC TO COMMUNICATE ITEMS OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ARCOS. 
SUBSEQUENT ELICITATION OF ARCOS BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CCC LED 
THEM TO BELIEVE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FERNANDEZ TO ARCOS 
WAS OFTEN GROSSLY INACCURATE. WHEN APPRISED OF THIS SITUATION, 
ARCOS DISMISSED CCC COMMENTS AS BEING SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDINGS. 
B. IT HAS BEEN NOTED BY THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT 
FERNANDEZ WAS FRIENDLY WITH JORGE GONZALEZ AND WITH VLADIMIRO 
ROCA. FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO THE ACTIVITIES PLANNED BY SOCIALIST 
CURRENT, THE GROUP TO WHICH ROCA BELONGED, BY HIS ASSOCIATION WITH 
ROCA. REINALDO ROQUE, A MEMBER OF THE CCC, WHO WORKED WITH 
SOCIALIST CURRENT, NOTED THAT WHEN THE GROUP WAS SCHEDULED TO 
MEET, IT WAS CHALLENGED BY CUBAN AUTHORITIES SO OFTEN THAT THE 
AUTHORITIES MUST HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF ITS SCHEDULE. EITHER 
FERNANDEZ OR ROCA (OR BOTH) COULD HAVE BEEN PASSING SUCH 
INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES. 
C. ON ONE OCCASION, TO THE SURPRISE OF THE CCC, 
FERNANDEZ, A KARATE PRACTITIONER, INVITED THE ENTIRE CCC 
MEMBERSHIP TO GO TO THE CIUDAD DEPORTIVA (SPORTS CITY) TO AN
