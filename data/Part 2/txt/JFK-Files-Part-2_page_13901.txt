The Attorney General 
NOTE: 
By memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams 
dated 6/3/75 captioned nsenate Select Committee on Intelligence 
Activities>" Legal Counsel Division transmitted an "Eyes Only" 
communication, dated 5/30/75, from the Executive Secretary 
of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group~ In its communication, 
the USIB Group requested that recipients furnish Mr. James A. 
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, with 
suggestions for administrative or legislative action relative 
to United States intelligence programs. 
In response to USIB's request on behalf of 
Mr. Wilderotter, INTD Supervisors have been canvassed for 
suggestions and results obtained incorporated in communication 
being attached for Attorney General's approval. Since USIB's 
.communication was marked "Eyes Only, 11 we have not specifically 
referenced this document in our response to Mr. Wilderotter. 
We are, however, providing .copies of the USIB letter and our 
response for the Attorney General's records and for the Office 
of the Deputy Attorney General. The latter action would 
appear appropriate, since the Department of Justice was 
included among the recipients of the USIB letter, although 
Inspector John B. Hotis of tne Legal counsel Division was 
erroneously designated as the Departmental addressee by USIB.
