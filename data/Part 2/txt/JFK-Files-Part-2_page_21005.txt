desires some sort of compact equipment with whicn he can 
possibly eliminate CASTRO; however, CIA keeps offering 
him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.

According tof.rEPEDINo] there is now under discussio{~GAJ 
some plan to kill FIDEt-t!A.STRO, in which CUBEI.A will figure. .'CJ 
CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however, 
inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no 
part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been 
brought up again for consideration. President JOHNSON 
allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it. 
If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime 
before the elections in November. 
. [!EPEDIN2Jtold the informant he has not bee_n abld ~ uj 
to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that~­
CUBEI.A is supposed to participate, that it is to be 
accomplished by men in Cuba,,,and possibly someone from 
Europe.

indicate how he had acquired this information; however, the V 
informant presumed from his manner of spea~ing that he had 
obtained it from CUBELA. 
The above is for the information of the Bureau, 
and is not being submitted in form suitable for disseminatio 
since, ·both(i,EPEDINQ\and CUBEI.A are apparently of operational 
interest to CIA. Dissemination would also lead to the 
disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely, 
MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further detailsc
