Areas of Inquir~ for Goodwin 
i . I 
What, if anything, does Goodwin remember of the August 
10, 1962, meeting of the Sp~cia1 Group which he attended? 
' Is this meeting different than the meeting he refers to 
in his initial interview where McNamara broached the sub­
ject of assassinating Castro? Or has he simply confused 
them and are they one and t~e same? 
I 
: 
How does he explain McCone•~ recollection of having given 
an oration on the immorality of assassinating Castro when 
it was brought up at the August 10 meeting? 
Was McNamara the person who brought up the subject at 
that meeting? 
What discussion, if any, followed?
