When reporting changes in residence and/or employment concerning. 
Chinese and Cuban aliens on the security index, in addition to 
dissemination to Secret Ser,;ice, also advise the Immi1:ration and 
lfaturali_zc:.t.i.on Serv:ice (INf;) J.ocally, ,ancl furnish four .copies of 
the letterhead memorandum to the Bureau for disseminatlon at the 
SOG. Bear in mind in filling out the reference that somc[lettcrhead} 
memoranda have been expressly prepared for dissemination ~o 
Secret. Ser-rice only and have not been furnished to the • 
Department or I1IS; therefore, the copy furnishecl INS J.ocally 
·and two· o·f the copies furnished the Bureau should rcferen9e 
the last ·communication to IHS. 
Fo~ instruc~ions pertaining to dissemination to Secret Service 
in other than security index cases~ refer to ~ection 83K, 
volume III, of this manual. 
Upon transfer of office of origin in one of these cases, the 
old office of origin is to turnish Secret Service locally with 
the· subject's new residence and business ad(lress and advise the 
Bureau that such has been done by the submis sio'n of two copies 
of the letterhead memorandum disseminated locally. The new 
off~ce of origin need take no action regarding dissemination to 
Secret Service until such time as further changes occur with 
respect to the subject 1 s status[or until prepar~tion of the next 
periodic report in the case.]. 
·(10) Dissemination at the Bureau 
There are some situaiions in which disseminat~on is made at the 
Bureau instead of in the field. In the ·majority of instances, 
information received by the FBI should properly be furnished 
immediately to some other agenc·y within the executive branch of 
the Government so that the responsibilitic.s of the other agency 
might be fulfilled properly. Ca:re mus.t be taken, how.ever, not 
to disseminate information to any .. fieid b_ranch of "a_nother 
Government· agency where such a proceo.ure is deemed i.rrn.dvisa ble 
because of the inadequacy of security measures in that branch. 
In these instances the data should be brought to the immediate 
attention of the Bureau for dissemination at the SOG. An 
example of the latter is, of course, the Atomic Energy Connission, 
which receive~ reports only through the Bureau, as note~ in 
section 87D 7c (3) of this manual. Information relating to 
foreign travel plans of security sub,jects is disseminated 
·to interested agencies, indluding the State Department, only 
at_the SOG, as set out in 87D 6b (4). Dissemination is also 
··•f!!ade at the SOG to the State Department, unless ·it _appears 
. ~ndesirable, in those cases in which subiects have been 
"indicted for violations grounded on subv~rsive ,cti~ities. 
Dissemination 5n these cases is 6ade to preclude thes~ subjects 
from utilizing the fact they obtained a passport to refute 
allegations of subversive connections. The State rjepar~ment, 
therefore, wilJ. be in possession of data concerning a defendant 
should he attemnt to utilize this tactic in such a~ action,
