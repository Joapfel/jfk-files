ytJSK stressed the immediate need for direct contact between LODJE and DII,JVI. BUNDY pointed out 
he necessity of advisin,c; LODJE not to have a real show-down with DIEM over NHU at this forth­
qgiin,c; meetir}[!:, as one of 10.IX;E' s cables indicated he was headed very much in this direction. 
Lf->K apreed to do this. 'l'he PRESIDENT ar;reed with the desirability of silencinp; MADAME NHU but 
XlJressed some doubt that NHU's participation was as fatal as STATE seemed to say it was. RUSK 
c:m-nnented that the COUN'I'RY TEAM ha.ct stated its feeling that Nf-TIJ must go, to which the PRESIDENT 
·eplied that they may have been operating under directives received from here." (16)
