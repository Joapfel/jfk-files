c. Papadakis is probably ask­
ing the same price for its action as 
Basil Mavrolean did recently--removal 
of its ships from the US blacklist. 
Papadakis operates 19 ships totalling 
more than 200,000 tons. 
d. Ma.vrolean's vessels account 
for almost half the present British 
tonnage calling at Cuban ports and 
are the largest single element of 
free world shipping to Cuba. 
e. The outcome of Mavrolean's 
offer is not yet clear.
