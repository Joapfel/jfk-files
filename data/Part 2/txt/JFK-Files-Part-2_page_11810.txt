erage for Bureau's work. 
11. Action by informant when uncovered

fend himself vigorously and demand proof of his informant activity. 
b. Suspicion in many cases is directed to an informant without facts to 
back it up and by bluffing informant may confuse issue to point where 
his services may not be lost.

charges of deviation from strict discipline of organization. involved, 
and thus cast off suspicion. •

in preparation of defense in subversive-type cases or handle assign­
ment where such information is readily available, informant should 
tactfully decline. 
b. Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent and 
made matter of record.

any in:formation pertaining to defense plans or strategy.

individual under criminal indictment, he should immediately leave. 
If he is unable to do so and inadvertently learns of defense plans 
or strategy, he is not to report the substance of any such 
conversation to the FBI. Additionally, the informant is not to 
engage in or report the substance of a conversation with a criminal 
defendant dealing with the offense for which the defendant is 
under indictment. 
13. Preparation for testifying 
Contacting Agent must condition informant to fact that someday knowledge 
he possesses may be needed as evidence in court. Psychologically prepare

of informant is essential as Bureau must provide witnesses whenever 
Department initiates prosecutions in security cases.
