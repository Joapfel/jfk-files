Initially called the ''!•.ction Fae ti on,'' li'Jeathe-rman 
t cam~ into being immediately before the .. 1unc, 1969, Students 
~br a L>emocratic Society (SDS} Ua·tional Convention (NC). 
At this UC Weatherman won all three national -Officer positions 
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well. 
Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO) 
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national 
records. Although internal struggle existed until l'ate 1969, 
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally 
from June, 1969, until its 1:0 closed in February, 1970. At 
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS. 
The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological 
paper prepared by its l,~aders entitled "You Don I t i-Jeec1 a 
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" ("New Left 
Notes" June 18, 1969). This stateroent·outlined the basic 
stance of Weatherman: r1arxist:-u,ninist in content but with 
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring aLout 
revolution in the United States. This posture was complemonted 
with an international identification to the Cuban revolution 
and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is 
to make revolution. 
During October, 1969, WeatherMan riots in 
Chicago resulted in more than 2 GO arrests for n~ob a·ction 
and related charges. A program of armcJ struggle was 
finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein 
te~rorist tactics and political assassination were 
contemplated. The basic strength of Weatherman was then 
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically 
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and sornc Northwest. 
. As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman 
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground 
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization 
would be submerged; "affinity groups" of threE:" - five members 
would function independently. In February, 1970, Weatherman 
leaders announced a program 0f ''strategic sabotage" with 
police and military installations as primary targets.
