I~•ation sug1estive o'f additio~~-eads and inforwation 
of particular significance in showir.g :;u~).ject' s knowledge 
of and adherence to revolutionary aims of organization or 
organiz~tions ~itb which he is associated should be fully 
and carefully reported. 
Each report is to ir-clude all information having any· 
pertinency as to whether o~ not there i~ justification for 
security ind.ex car{l. This :i,ncludes per-t.inent infor:nation 
concerning backgroun•l ::i.nd sub,ersi vc activities o 
When previous summary reports v,hich have been prepared 
are no~ suitable for dissemination because of disclosure 
of sources, information contained therein should be 
included in current surr.maTy t'P.port:i with sources fully 
proteotcd. Each office must be certain that all pertinent 
information has been incorporated in either a past or 
currP-nt disseminatiYe s1,,rnary reporto 
Frequently infqrmai;ion ;,'11 have bee\1, obtai.ned(rcporti·ng] 
;; 'r'hject rs presence a·I.; numerous me.etings of subversi ;-e 
c,·r;::mizations over a period of years. In ma?ly instances 
these facts will have been reported by only one informant. 
In others, two or three info:rnants will have reported 
subject's attendance at meetings. The question o~ 
pertinency of all such items is dependent upon the weight 
of all of the evidence obtained against the sub jec,; •. 
Such repeti tiou.s and cumula,ti ve items to be speci.fically 
set forth in renor,;s may be reduced in number to the"uoint 
where ·they wi.Ll. be lim:i. ted to a· representat: ve number· of 
such items. Each such item speoifica.lly set forth must be 
~- fully documented. ~ 
{h) The number of such i_tems to be included in each instance 
will be dependent upon the preponderance of other 
eviaence available for inclusion in the repo1·t which 
{ i) . 
will lend weight to our case a.ga.inst the subj.eat. 
Selection of such items with regard to period of time 
will be dependent upon all facts devclope·d a!r2.inst . 
subject. Selection should be based upon thefobjective 
of s.pecifically repo:'!'ting da.t3, sufficient to justify 
continued det~ntion of each subject if apprehended. 
When selection of re::.>r~sentative number of such i·~ems is 
made~ they ~hould be followed by a: general statement 
summarizing any other items furnished by source. The 
summarizing statement shoul~ indicate that source advised 
during a. spocifie~ period of tim~ that subject also ~ttan~ed 
a certain number of other meetings during a. certain perio.d.
