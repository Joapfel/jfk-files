Soviet Ambassador to Havana, and a man named Leontov, who was 
the Soviet KGB operational man in Mexico. When the Mexican 
police arrested Castro as a student, they found in his note­

Now, we had a double agent after the assassination, 
who made a number of allegations that he acquired from the 
Chief of KGB, Mexico, Yatskov and he was a superior of Leontov.

And I can multiply that. Those cases, those leads have 
never been followed up. One is because of lack of· manpower. 
Two, the general problem in Washington and the government
