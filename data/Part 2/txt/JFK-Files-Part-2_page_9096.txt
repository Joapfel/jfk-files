BLACK PANTHER P.ARTY 
FORMER~Y KNOWN AS THE .BLACK P,ANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE 
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZ/~TION 
EXTRE..l'1IST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY 
The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December, 
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George 
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black 
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of 
the black connnunity. The Party, operating the Black Panther 
Interconnnunal News Service, publishes a newspaper calied 
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the 
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program 
to end the oppression of the black people but since early 
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution. 
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California. 
While openly advocating direct overthrow of the 
U. s. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders 
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling 
for action within the established order. Newton, in an 
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy" 
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change 
the American Government by any means necessary but that 
ultimately such change will be t~rough armed violence. 
Despite its claimed dedication to connnunity service, 
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist. 
Since Ju_ly, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested 
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers, 
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of 
Ne~on's tailor. New-ton failed to appear on these charges and 
is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three 
were wounded as a result of a shooting at a EPP-sponsored 
dance in Oa~l~d, California, in October, 1974.
