Cll - 7 - Review of CIA Histories 
(S) ARRB staffers Jeremy Gunn and Michelle Combs 
have reviewed all of the requested histories except one 
still under pre-review by the component because of 
sensitive information -- we expect this to be resolved 
in the near future. They were gr~nted access to 
identify any relevance to the assassination of 
President Kennedy. They selected a number of pages to 
be included within the materials to be declassified and 
released to the National Archives. The histories 
reviewed were as follows:

Government of Cuba, written by Colonel J. Hawkins, 
USMC, on 5 May 1961, and controlled by WH division.
