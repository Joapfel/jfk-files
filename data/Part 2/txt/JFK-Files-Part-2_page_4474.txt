8. Communications Intelligence: We will continue 
our present CIA Close Support coverage from the KOLA 
station in Miami at the same level and will continue 
to press NBA for additional coverage of Cuban communica­
tions. As the current situation "normalizes" it should 
be possible for NSA to reinstitute and perhaps even 
increase their~eabor~)intercept coverage of Cuban 
communications. ~~ 
9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey 
has been made world--wide of all Communist Party 
penetration operations and wherever any such penetration 
can be directed against Cuba either by dispatching the· 
agent to Cuba or by pointing the agent against Cuban 
targets, this will be done, except in those cases where 
such action would result in unacceptabl7Prejudice to 
the operations in the area where the agent is now based. 
It is believed that the most lucrative field for the 
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target will 
be Latin America where there are@5)1lnetrations of 
l~ various communist parties. Of this {95\ the survey 
we have conducted indicates tha·~ ~3) have some direct

pertinent access to Cuban targets. All of these~~will 
be directed against these targets unless in any case 
there are overriding reasons to the contrary. The 
remaining cases in the total ofC6sJi~ bein individually 
examined to see if they can be diverted to Cuban targets.
