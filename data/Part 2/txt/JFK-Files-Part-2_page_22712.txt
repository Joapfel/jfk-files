Sen,1tor llart of Colorado, Gentlemen, let's go ahead and 
be sworn and get under way if you don't mind. 
Do you swear the testimony you're about to give will be 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help 
you God? 
Mr. Angleton. I do, 
Hr. Milar. I do. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Angleton at least has been before us before, and 
routinely we remind all witnesses that they preserve all of 
their constitutional rights, including the right to counsel, 
the right to remain silent and so forth and so on, and to have 
a member of the Committee present during all of the testimony. 
It is my understanding we have no prepared statements to 
I 
start with, so I think I '11 just open it up to staff questions 
and interject some of my own, and I understand that the general 
subject matter to be discussed here today -- and we are interesUcd 
in your expertise regarding the question of counterintelligence: 
So, we'll just '.iavc the staff members start.
