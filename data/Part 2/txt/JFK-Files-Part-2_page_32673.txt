Photographic reconnaissance, however, does have limitations. It is only 
a part of the total intelligence collection means, although a most important Ont 
It did not reveal the presence of ballistic missiles in Cuba during the period 
of at least a month between their introduction into the Island and their deploy­
ment on sites. The absence of photographic confirmation of human source and 
other reports, therefore, does not of itself disprove the accuracy of the other 
( 
sources. 
The responsible agencies of the intelligence community appear to have 
done a creditable job in gathering and collecting quantities of data and infor­
mation. The deficiency in the :performance of the intelligence community appeari 
to have been in the evaluation and assessment of the accumulated data. Moreove· 
there seems to have been a disinclination on the part -of the intelligence com­
munity to accept and believe the ominous portent of the information which had 
been gathered. 
In addition, the intelligence people apparently invariably adopted the 
most optimistic estimate possible with respect to the information-available. 
This is in sharp contrast to the customary military practice of emphasizing the 
worst situation which might be established by the accumulation of evidence. 
There also appeared to be a tendency on the part of the intelligence 
people to discredit and downgrade refugee and exile reports; This was based on 
the general lack of experience and training of the refugees and exiles as mili• 
tary observers, their frequent inclusion of items not reasonably credible 
among those things which were within their power of observation as to time, 
place and comprehension, and on the consideration of the obvious self-interest 
of the Cuban sources.
