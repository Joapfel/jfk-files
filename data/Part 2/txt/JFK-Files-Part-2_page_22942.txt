some time, six months, comes in, 
I believe, in July after he completes his Bay of Pigs examina­
tion, General Lansdale is appointed by the President at the end 
of November. 
Do you have any present recollection of the circumstances 
surrounding that appointment? 
Mr. Bundy. None that goes beyond what I discussed earlier./ 
I 
Mr. Smothers. To tho b8st of your knowledge or recollectit, 
did the appointment of this Chief of Staff or Chief of Operatior,s 
reflect any lack of confidence in General Taylor on the part of I 
either the Attorney General or the President? I 
I 
Mr. Bundy. No, the opposite. General Taylor had heavy ! 
responsibilities in his general responsibility as military 
representative of the President. He was made Chairman of the 
Committee to keep oversight on this. It was inappropriate 
•ntirely in terms of his rank and his other duties that he 
should be the day to day action officer. 
Mr. Smothers. Are you familiar with the degree of General 
Taylor's .involvement with th'! development of the Special 
Group (Augmented) agendas? Was this done by General Taylor? 
Was it really General Lansdale's responsibility? 
Mr. Bundy. I don't have any knowledge of the details of 
the operations of the staff. It was clear to me, and I think 
to everyone else, that the man in charge of that oper~tion, of 
that Committee, was General Taylor.
