(SI Ttiis follows our telephone conversation of 22 October 1997. I have discussed the decision of the JFK Board to release the 
true name of Jose Marie Mankel with~f OGC/Litigation Division. Linda is of the opinion that we have a very weak case 
were we to pursue an appeal to the President, because we are unable to articulate specific current harm that would ensue when the 
Board releases Mankel's name. This is because the program with which he was linked, as well as the crypt, already have been officially 
released to the public via the SSCI hearings in 1975. In addition, I have been advised that the activity with which Mr. Mankel was 
associated has no link with any current DS&T program. Moreover, Mr. Mankel's name is in the public domain (in Oliver Stone's 
manuscript for the film "Nixon"), although it has not--up to now-~been officiatly acknowledged; ·we·do not know Mr. Malikel's 
whereabouts, or even if he is still alive; the last contact the CIA had with him was in 1964, when he was living in Luxembourg. 
(SI The chilling effect of publicly releasing the names of persons to whom we have promised confidentiality, thereby harming 
our ability to recruit in the future, was unsuccessfully argued to the Board at its 14 October meeting. Because we are unable to 
articulate specific current harin, beyond the general chilling effect, I believe an appeal would be unsuccessful. Therefore, unless we are 
able to unearth additional information ln the seven days allotted to us following formal notification of the Board's decision--which is 
unlikely--the DS&T will not appeal the release of this name.
