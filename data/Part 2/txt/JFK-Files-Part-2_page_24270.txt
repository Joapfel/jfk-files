kinds realized in 1975 ($4 million), the total gross income would 
have aggregated $116 million. Actually, the CIA reports that 
for· this for this period gross income aggregated at $1,606 million. 
By this measure, CIA's biggest proprietaries are shadows of their 
former selves; their annual gross income of $4 million is about 
one-fourteenth of the average gross annual income of $55 million 
during the 29-year span. Shrinkage would be even greater if these 
figures were adjusted for the effect of inflation. 
The chief impact is decline of the bigger air proprietaries. 
The Agency estimates that of some $761 million of outside income, 
at least $658 million was generated by Air America ($559 million) 
and Southern Air Transport ($99 million), in the period from incep­
to 1975. As late as 1974, these two ·airlines were garnering some 
$50 million in outside contracts. With their disposal, total CIA 
proprietary annual outside income in 1975 therefore shrinks to 
the'cited $4 million level. Most of this residual is represented 
by MHMUTUAL, the insurance investment complex, where Agency invest­
ment are generating an outside income of about $3.5 million annually. 
In programmatic terms, this contrast of today and yesterday 
reflects the decline of paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia. 
Large volumes of outside orders by Defense and AID, along with 
sizable levies by CIA components and some maintenance and passenger 
income from commercial operations, had been generated by a covert 
war. In turn, these operations had their echoes in Agency air· 
support for the Congo, Cuba, and other areas. Looking toward the 
future, will new air proprietaries he established? The CIA thinks
