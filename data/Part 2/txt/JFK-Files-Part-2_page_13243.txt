writer explained to Siedel that following his telephone conversation, 5/9/75,

currently sensitive to the Bureau. Accordingly the Atlanta Office was con­
tacted and subsequently the writer was contacted by Robert Olmert of the Bureau. 
Mr. Olmert advised that if it was desired the Bureau would make available a 
representative not for the purpose of participating in the interview but to be 
available for advice. The writer stated he was interested in obtaining such 
assistance. Accordingly during the morning of 5/12/75 Mr. Seymor Phillips 
contacted the writer.
