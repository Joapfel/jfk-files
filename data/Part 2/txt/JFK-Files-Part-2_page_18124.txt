Labor Day weekend to suit his personal convenience 
or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant, 
low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I 
had the impression that he learned nothing during the 
interview that he had not known before. I told him 
on several occasions during the interview that my memory 
of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should 
rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate 
account. 
"I also had the impression that he is pursuing 
leads based on material furnished to him by Sullivan." J
