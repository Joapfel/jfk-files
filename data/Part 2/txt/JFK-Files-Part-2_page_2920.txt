Castro. McCone added, h6wever, that many individuals felt that more 
dynamic actions were called for, including mass landings and military 
activity. McCone did not agree. Our· intelligence, he said, did not 
support this point of view, and any such ~ttempts would face disaster 
. 
unless the United States-was prepared to commit large military forces 
to support them. 
In the meantime, Castro had officially cast his lot with the 
Soviet Union, and indications were increasing that the USSR was 
willing to invest substantial amounts of money, not only to keep the 
Cuban leader afloat, but to enhance his capability to create mischief 
for the United States. After 1 February 1962, our U-2 flights over 
Cuba increased from one to two per month, and intelligence reports 
revealed steady Soviet shipments of military as well as economic aid. 
On August 4, McCone learned that eleven Soviet ships believed to 
be carrying arms were bound for Cuba. McCone asked for further 
details. On August 5, he received a breakdown on the ships, and he 
directed immediate U-2 coverage (which began the following day). 
According to reports, up to 5,000 Soviet technicians had arrived, in 
addition to military communications equipment. The preliminary U-2 
readout, however, was not very helpful, and another flight was 
planned for August 11.
