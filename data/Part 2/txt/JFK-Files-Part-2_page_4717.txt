Embassy. It didn't even have one at the time. The only one that was in town 
was the one on G-2 under General McGarr. And what the hell was the G-2 
officer, Colonel someone, I can't remember. Anyway, so I built a war room for 
Bill so we could plot and have handy our own operations <we were running into 
the North at that time and none of them worked but we tried) and at the same 
time decided to take a look at what the hell the target was, what the enemy 
was. And I bui 1 t a second war room or had bui 1 t rather a seco.nd war room in 
the Embassy where ma and my military friends, the head of the ASA team. the 
SSO in Saigon, I forget his name, Major something or other, and we got sent 
down to us from Japan, from the Army in Japan, an order of battle specialist 
whose specialty was actually the Chinese Communist. the PRC army. a military 
breakdown. and he came down to go over the order of battle aspects of the VC. 
And I had put up on the wall, all four walls in this room that we built in the 
Embassy, a 1-50,000 set of maps of South Vietnam only_~ And then we took all 
of the information, from any source whatsoever, good, bad, or indifferent. 
including COMINT, and all the Maison junk we were getting from the South 
Vietnamese government. any of our own reporting, the US, all agencies and we 
actually physically plotted every piece of information on maps. And the order 
of battle specialist made his usual 5X8 order of battle cards and correlated 
to the maps. So that you could look at the map and go to the card or take the 
card and go to the map. And we came up with a figure of VC effectives in the 
field of over 18,000. That doesn't sound like much today, but this was the 
summer of 
1
61. And the agreed-upon figure was 10,000. Everybody in the US 
Government used the figure of 10,000. I think they've been using it ever 
since the war began with the French. But anyway, 10,000 was the figure. AnEI ·~
