:SEIZI,IBE POV/ERS IN N!:.1.ITRALITY CASES 
The Department has been attempting to have 
issued,an Executive Order which would give us power 
under Title 22, Section 401, United States Code, to 
seize arms, munitions of war and other articles about 
to be exported in violation of law and follow throup)1 
to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality 
cases. The Departraent advised on Dece~ber 23, 1959, 
) 
that the proposed Executive Order had been sent by the 
Attorney General to the fresident throurrh the director 
of the Bureau of the Budget by letter dated December 16, 
1959. 
Pursuant to our inquiries, the Department 
determined that the proposed.Executive Order had been 
sent by the Bureau of the Budget to the Defense, Commerce 
and State Departments and to the Office of Civil and 
Defense Hobilization. It had been previously cleared with 
Treasury by the Department. This matter has·been clos~ly 
followed with the Departr.ient and on February 3, 1960, we 
ascertained that the Budget Bureau has received replies 
from all these agencies offerinz no objection to the 
issuance of _the Order e Conunerce, however, in its letter 
to the Budget Bureau on February 1, 1960, a copy of which 
.,was furnished us by the Department on February 3, 1960, 
asked for assurances from the Department and the FBI that 
we understood Commerce has jurisdiction under the E..-"'port 
Control Act of 1949 and would keep the Conunerce Department 
advised of any information developed of interest to that 
agency. 
A letter was sent to the Department on February 5, 
I 
1960, suggesting that the Department sertd Commerce a 
letter similar to the one it previously furnished Treasury 
assuring that these seizure powers would be used only in 
neutrality cases and that, of course, the FBI would 
furnish Commerce any pertinent infonnation developed. _ 
l 
It is ~ssumed that upon the receipt of that letter by 
Commerce the matter will then be cleared for the fresident's 
signature.
