MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Executive Director 
VIA: 
FROM: 
Director of Information Management 
Lee S. Strickland 
Chief, Information Review Group/OIM 
SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
1. (AIUO) Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly 
meeting, we have summarized below the significant issues which 
are under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our 
approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step: 
• First, with the staff, we argue relevance although the statute and 
implementing regulations define "assassination records" very 
broadly as including 
• any records related to the assassination or Oswald, 
• any records concerning the various conspiracy theories', and 
• any records within the scope of previous investigations 
including the Church Committee, Pike Committee, Warren 
Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations 
(HSCA), 1 
• Second, with the staff, we argue that release would cause current 
. damage although the exemptions under the JFK statute are much 
narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and 
• Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more 
detailed and formal presentation to the Board. 
1 (AIUO) It is the materials collected by the HSCA which are the most 
numerous and often the most troublesome in terms of sensitive equities. They 
are generally referred to as the "sequestered collection."
