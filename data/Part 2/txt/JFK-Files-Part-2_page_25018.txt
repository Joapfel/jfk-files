came. We hoped to see him and see what we could do to come to 
better understanding with him. 
Mr. Baron. Why did he strike you as being impossible to 
deal with in any way? 
Mr. Dillon. Well, what I really recall was the impression 
he made rather than the individual things he said. When he wa 
in the State Department meeting, either with me or with the 
Secretary in my presence, he spoke in a mannter that seemed 
almost messianic in quality. And he would never look you in 
the eye. Ee looked up at the sky. And a tremendous flow of 
words came out. He spoke in French, and he spoke it very 
fluently. And his words didn't ever have any relation to the 
particular things that we wanted to discuss. And it was just 
like ships passing in the night. You had a feeling that he 
was a person that was gripped by this fervor that I can only 
characterize as messianic. And he was just not a rational 
being. 
Mr. Baron. When we talked earlier I believe you 
charaterized his personal power almost as psychotic, is that 
right? 
Mr. Dillon. That is right. 
Mr. Baron. So that after he departed from the US you 
and others at a high·level in the State Department were, 
extremely con~erned about this man continuing in a position 
in the Congo?
