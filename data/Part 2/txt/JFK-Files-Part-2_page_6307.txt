Post Board Tasks (some examples) 
Duplicates from the Sequestered Collection, Russ 
Holmes, and other working files. 
Referrals received in last two months of project (We 
will try to review as many as possible by end of 
September) 
Other documents/material that it is not feasible to 
review by 30 Sept. or extremely time-consuming for 
both staffs and marginal to the story (examples: 
Mexico City tapes, card files that duplicate 
information in the file) 
Other Topics for Discussion 
Final Declaration -- "Who signs" may come up. 
Transfer of Oswald classified files to NARA by 30 Sept. 
Transfer of all Release In Full documents to NARA by 30 
Sept. 
[Laura changed procedures -- we no longer have to send 
through ARRB staff; send directly to NARA.] 
Next Meeting - 25 Aug.- Possible Issues 
Mexico City Tapes (200+) 
Board leaving toward declaring as Assassination Records; 
DO's initial response is to object. I have advised DO that 
we will need a "defense" for Aug. 25 meeting. 
@}DECANTER 
Although the release of DECANTER was delayed at last 
meeting, I understand the Board still leans toward release.
