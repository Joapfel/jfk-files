b. A WCUUJ:!1 tube modified in such a manner as to cause a short 
circuit. This is.poBBible by inducing siJ,icon carbide (?) into the base of the 
tube. When the tube becomes hot the sUicon carbide liquifies and becomes 
a conductor; whea,the tube cools the matter returns to a solid non-co_riductive
