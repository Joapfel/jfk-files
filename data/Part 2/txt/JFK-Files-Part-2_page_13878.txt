As to 0-FBI public statement - no interest. 
) 
. As· to P (the overall FBI recommendation), he 
• would like personal access e • • 
I discussed as an alternative, access to the 
initiating documents in the COINTELPRO matters; and 
that I would attempt to obtain those as an alternative 
solution to his inquiry. He said that he might be 
interested in those doctL~ents, but they were far less 
important to him than access to.A-E. He reiterated 
his sensitivity to the question of raw files> anq . 
indicated a strong inclination to avoid· the raw files , 
question, proceeding by the proposed expanded summaries! i 
route if necessary, with expanded su..l'll.!uaries to be pre- 1 
pared only in the event of specific questions being 
r~ised after staff access to A-E. 
• He then went on to state that he perceived a 
significance in the recommendation and proposals of the 
Petersen Report; and that he felt FBI and DOJ policies 
might be perceived as at loggerheads, although this was 
muted in the prose. He said that he felt sure that, at 
an appropriate time, the Corrw"1ittee would wish to explo!'e, 
by AG test~nony at SSC, the actions of the DOJ on the 
recommendation reflected in the reDort. I said that I 
und~rstood his interest in that process. 
My recommendation is that, in view of·the retrench­
ment regarding rrraw files' 1 , A-E be. made available, under 
the ·conditions outlined above; I am furnishing a copy of 
this memorandum to Mr. Daly for dissemination to appro­
priate Executives of the Bureau, and to.Mr. Maroney of 
the Criminal Division. 
I believe a prompt decision as to A-E would be 
most helpful.
