Could Rosselli Have .Linked_-
Castro Plot to J ( Death? 
By RON LaBRECQUE 
. Herold St•ff Wrilor • 
In 1960, when the CIA was try­
: ing to set up a delicate attempt on 
. the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to 
a man once· described as "the big-
• g~st flag-waving SOB in the coun-
• try" - West Coast underworld 
: figure Johnny Rosselli. 
Rosselli - a seemingly improba­
: ble conspirator in a government 
• plot - got the "flag-waving" label 
. from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana, 
·then Chicago's top crime boss and 
a man Rosselli brought into that 
:same plot. . 
Now both are dead, murdered in 
the past year, and investigators are 
wondering whether their plotting 
led to their deaths and whether the 
CIA plots against Castro - only 
recently made public and even kept 
from the Warren Commission -
are vital clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy as'iassination. • 
The aeaths of Giancana, in June 
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer, 
have aroused a renewed concern in 
Washington, where on Friday the 
House of Representives voted to re­
open the investigation of the Ken­
nedy murder. 
•• REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D., 
Va.), who will be chairman of the 
panel, said he is "convinced"· a con-' 
spiracy was involved· in -Kennedy's: 
death. 
Now, in the aftermath of the vi-. 
olent • deaths of Giancana and Ros-· 
selli, the question arises of what 
• role, if ·any, the Kennedy White 
House played in the early 1960s 
"deal'' the CIA made with the two 
underworld figures to have Castro 
murdered. • 
Whether ,. the Kennedy I White' 1 House knew 'about about the. CIA's 
plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found : 
out after the contacts were ended), 
the CIA's use of the underworld

•seems ironic in retrospect. 
/ Robert Kennedy's passionate ef­
forts to disable organized crime are 
• well docum~nted. 
lN 1960 when Robert Kennedy 
wrote about what he had learned 
of organized crime in America 
from his years as chief counsel to 
the Senate Rackets Committee, he 
too quoted Giancana to make a 
point. 
He told about Giancana's inter­
view at his local draft board at the 
outbreak of World War II, when 
lie was asked what he did for a Jiv• 
jng. 
"f steal." Giancana is said to 
~ave replied. 
; So Sam Giancana didn't go to 
war and years later would boast to 
'Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that 
ne stayed out of the Army - la­
'.beled unfit - by telling the truth. 
; "What's wrong with the syndi­
•cate?" Kennedy, ·quoted Giancana. 
:"Two or three of us get together 
'on a business deal and everybody 
'.says it's a bad thing. Businessmen 
;do it all the time and nobody 
;squawks:" 
; A Senate committee began stu•, 
!dying the Kennedy questions more 
'than a year ago as it looked at co..: 
lvert CIA activities. 
I 
'. lN AN addendum to the Senate 
:Jnt_elligence Committee's interim 
,report last November, Sen. Howard 
'Baker (R., Tenn.) said, "It is my 
;personal view that on balance the 
:likelihood that presidents (the re­
port dealt with Dwight Eisenhower 
and Ken·nedy) knew of the (Castro) 
assassination plots is greater than 
the likelihood that they did not." 
.lust to trace Rosselli's history 
:with the CIA is mind-boggling fo·r 
the investigators. Yet, it is just one 
':,lspect of the search for his killer. 
:_: Johnny Rosselli - horn on the 
fourth of July in Esperia. Italy, and 
:71 when he died - was not first 
and forPmost a CIA operative. ----
;· His greater role as evidenced by . 
two convictions, his associations 
and to some extent his own com­
ments, was as an influential, if 
publicly lesser known, organized: 
:crime figure . .... ~·. 
,,· HIS ASSOCIATION with other · 
~dentified underworld members . 
was monitored by law enforcement 
agencies as recently as several: 
:weeks • before nis July 28 disap- • 
,pearance. , 
~--• By all accounts, Rosselli was a , 
charming man, dressing in expen- . 
:sive clothes, married for only two· 
(years in the early 1940s and 
iknown most of his life as one who 
leasify· attracted women. 
I He Wa!,i an ·immigrant who told , 
[in a short autubiography written •• 
'.about 1967 that his "life of crime" " 
/began as a teenager in Boston, at• • 
:tempting arson for his stepfather 
~nd stealing $50 on his own. As he-, 
! raveled west, finally to settle. in·, 
,California, his attention turned to.: 
tbootlegging, gambling and di;Lb• 
~ling in the movie business. . 
' t IT ·IS said that Rosselli guarded , 
~he West Coast gambling interests . 
• ;tor Giancana's Chicago syndicate. 
1 Why Rosselli was chosen by the 
;CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un­
~lear, although CIA officials have 
'since testified that they wanted the 
'.kind of contacts in Cuba which or­
'ganized crime had made during the 
~re-Castro days when Havana was 
·a. gamblers' haven.: 
! Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence with · 
'Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid- • 
ered the key underworld gambling 
figure in Havana. 
The unraveling of CIA and un- : 
derworld conspiracies, an awesome .. 
web spanning ctecact·es. is left to a ' 
~eam of nine in the, Metro Homicide 
Division. It is a team now clearly 
consumed bv the task which has 
been a full-time operation since 
Rosselli's body was pulled from 
Dumfoundling Bay on Aug. 7.
