Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating.Their Activities 
Orthodox Communists in Paru are apparently putting 
aside their differences e.nd moving toward closer 
co-operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction,• 
believed to be leading the recent outbreak of 
disorders. The groups are reportedly co-ordinating 
previously random plans to carry out extensive 
destruction of industrial and agricultural 
installations and to provoke uprisi~gs. Cubans and 
other Latin American national~ as well as Havana 
and Moscow-trained Peruvians ~re said to be 
instrumental in this latest development. 
Members of the Peruvian junta have·~xpressed 
serious concern over the internal situation 
and hinted that they favor strong action. Although 
constitutional guarantees have been suspended,in a 
fourth department.and several Army units have been 
moved into the areas of disorders, the junta has 
taken no further action. It has reauested riot 
con t::ro l equipment from the US and says it is 
Teajy to embark on an anti-Communist program upon 
assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.
