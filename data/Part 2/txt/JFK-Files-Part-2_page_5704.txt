SUBJECT: (S) Required Protection of Warrenton Training Center 
as CIA Facility 
impact on our_ credibility and will create an_ "open 
season" for the local media and others as they quite 
naturally attempt to learn any and all aspects of our 
mission -- those clandestine officers who could come and 
go previously with little notice will now be a highly 
visible target. 12 
• (S) Endangerment of Department of State Officers and 
Loss of WTC as Training Site for DoS: As the Department 
of State is an integral part of WTC, their concerns must 
also be taken into consideration. They have advised of 
their significant concerns that a loss of WTC cover wi_ll 
lead to the mis-identification of DoS communicators 
overseas as CIA officers. They have stated that Lt is 
the fact of the current WTC cover which permits them to 
train Dos communicators alongside Agency communicators at 
a very efficient cost. The only solution to the loss of 
cover would be to move the Dos communications school to 
another location, a very costly endeavor in both time and 
money. 
8. (S) In summary_, it is my considered judgment that the 
release of the term "Warrenton Records-Center", which will create 
an affiliation of WTC and the CIA; would ~ause,.major disruptions 
to CIA operations, possible physical harm to CIA facilities and 
personnel, and hence identifiable· and serious damage to the 
national security of the United States. Accordingly, I 
respectfully request that the Board defer release of such 
information. In doing so, I am mindful of the Board's mission 
12 (S) It is not unreasonable to believe that the loss of cover for WTC would 
require a five fold increase in physical security personnel at WTC and even 
then security could not be ensured given the proximity of the facility to 
public spaces and roads.
