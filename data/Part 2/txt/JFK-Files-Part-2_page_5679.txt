SUBJECT: JFK Meeting today 
After speaking with you tonight about the results of the meeting today, Jeremy Gunn called me and relayed his concerns about the 
Board's understandings (or misunderstandings) of CIA's position. @b]au~lj:snd I discussed what happened at the JFK meeting and 
the following is our impression of what resulted. Basically~did not commit himself on any specifics on these issues, but expressed 
his willingness to cooperate with the Board: 
1. (Jerusale]fl,Station ~was more willing to negotiate this one, but does not agree to its release. CIA wants to present more 
information.~as not under the impression that this station was to be discussed today so he did not come prepared to present new 
information on it. CIA should do this for the Board at the next possible opportunity. 
2. Open Period for Stations ~greed that the staffs of the Board and HRG should work out the exact time period. He had 
no problem with theti;~period and opening it up t~n the Oswald file. He did not make any firm commitment on the dates to 
the Board, saying that the staffs should come to an agreement on this. 
3. Substitutions for or ~: tations • Although~uggested "~tation" as a substitution, he clearly prefered 
something less revealing like NO:rit ~r uropean station 1, 2, etc.)". Using the former term has far less plausible deniability. The latter 
option basically gives up what we want to protect. 
• Once HRG hears fro~as to what his understandings are, then someone needs to speak with Jeremy Gunn ASAP on Tuesday 
morning before the B~aves. Jeremy said that unless we correct the Board on its mistaken ImpressIon about the above, they will 
leave assuming we have come to·an agreement and will refuse to revisit this at a latter date. 
Let me know if you need me to help out in any way on this. FYI, I will be in meetings at 1 OAJv1 and 2pm (Win Scott settlement 
discussions!!!) tomorrow.
