Please pass to Asst. Sec. Mann from .Ambassador Telles: "I saw President 
Orlich and Minister Quiros Sasso on 18 November and conveyed reference position. 
The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government was not in-
volved. in this arms shipment .. !l..fter some discussion with Minister Quiros, 
?resident Orlich req_uested. tl:.at we not issue license for .:UvIDANG-1 shipment. 
President Orlich made clear he would be happy at any time to undertake 
action such as this if US government wanted him to. While he does wish 
see Guba free he inclined. to agree with US position Re Hit and Run raids 
undertaken principally for publicity sake. President Orlich's decision 
based on (1) relaization that he would not be doing us a favor and, (2) 
further realization that CRG would be hard pressed to explain such a 
$70,000 purchase Of arms if it became a campaign issue in 1965.
