In an effort to provide Mr. Wiley 111ith a more substan­
tial mechanism for operations to increase his jdJrnalistic 
reputation, it was decided thit he would set up !d news­
gathering service based in New York City and seciJre, where 
possible, the services of writers or journalistJ 'who would 
feed him news storeis from various points in the world. This 
would have the advantage of being a legitimate news-gathering 
service and at the same time possibly being later used as an 
information-gathering organization for intelligence purposes. 
Acting under instructions, Wiley, in 1959 or 1960, founded 
World News Analysis, opened an office in Flushing, New York, 
had press credentials made and conducted business to acer­
tain extent in the name of this organization. Wiley has 
pretty much maintained this cover ever since.
