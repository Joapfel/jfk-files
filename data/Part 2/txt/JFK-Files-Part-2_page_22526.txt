An April 16, 1965, note from Mendoza to ri~SRS 
advised that C~ Staff (Covert Action Staff of the DD/P) 
is definitely planning to send an American grq4p to the 
9th WYF in Algiers, 27 July - 6 August 1965 and some of 
the DDP area divisions also plan to infiltrate some of 
the foreign country groups. 
A 21 June 1965 memo from Wiley reflects the status 
of his fund raising activities for the 9th WYF 
1
\project 
and some data regarding the project. Funds rai~ed to 
that date were some $1,485 or more under auspic~s of 
"Christianform, Inc." Wiley said the goal is tp send 
6 delegates, S young men and a girl with a sevehth 
person in Algiers outside the delegation. He w~ll take 
no active part in the project than to keep in tpuch 
through the coordinator cuts ide the d_elega tion. i Among 
other things, each delegate is to get as much ihformation 
as possible about the U.S. delegation, including photos. 
On return, all information on domestic leftistslwill be 
given to the FBI directly by the delegates. Wiiey said 
there is ~ood hope that the projected budget of $3,000 
will be fulfilled and that none of the money raised for

Although the WYF was belatedly cancelled in late 
June, Wiley did follow through ·:ith the So. Ame¼ican 
phase of his planned travel. Expense and travel vouchers 
reflect that Wiley was in the U.S. in July and in the 
U.S. and South America in August and September 1965.
