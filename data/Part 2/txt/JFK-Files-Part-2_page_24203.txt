THE SALE 
In ·1972 it became apparent that the Agency's air capabilities· 
were becoming excess to its needs, and that political realities 
and future operational requirements in the post-war era of Southeast 
Asia would not require large air proprietary assets. On April 21, 
1972, the Director of Central Intelligence approved in principle 
the divestiture of CIA ownership and control of the Air America 
complex and Southern Air Transport. He approved recommendations 
calling for Air America to be retained until the end of the war in 
Southeast Asia, the immediate elimination of the Pacific Division 
of SAT, the sale of the two 727 aircraft leased to SAT by Air America, 
and subsequent divestiture of Agency ownership and control of the 
remainder of SAT.* Specific note was made that conflict of interest 
should be avoided and that no employee should receive a windfall 
~ benefit as a result of these transactions,**

In May 1972, Agency officials (Charles Kane and Lawrence Houston) 
met with the Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, Secor D. Browne, 
and his Administrative Assistant, Edwin _Rector, to seek informal 
advice as to ·the best way to disengage from SAT. Three alternatives 
were discussed: (1) dissolve the company and sell the assets; 
(2) sell the assets to_ the current operators of the company; (3) sell 
SAT to, or merge SAT into, one of the other supplemental carriers. 
* The Director determined that"we no longer should retain air proprie­
taries purely for contingent requirements and that on the record, there­
fore, the Agency should divest itself of the Southern Air Transport • 
complex entirely. He stated the opinion that the desirable course of 
action would be dissolution, although he realized that the problems 
were many and complex. Also, he did not rule out other solutions 
which might achieve the end and yet better satisfy the interests of 
al 1 concerned:' 
-J,:* A condition imposed by the DCI was that "in the disposition of any 
of the assets involved nothing inure to the benefit of Agency employees 
or former employees or persons whose relationship with the Agency has 
~een or is of such a nature as might raise a question of conflici of interest!' NW 5095.5 Jfocid: :J2423.532 Page 97
