SENSIND: EO RYBAT 
HEADQUARTERS OF THE KURDISH WORKERS' PARTY (PKK), THE ANARCHIST 
PARTY, AND A BAR WHERE MANY MIDDLE EASTERNERS WOULD CONGREGATE. 
HE THEN POINTED OUT THESE PLACES TO IDENS WHEN WE WENT TO HIS 
APARTMENT. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD DEFEND 
HIMSELF FROM ANY ATTACK. 
WHITTEN ALSO STATED THAT HE HAS BEEN RETIRED FOR ALMOST AS 
LONG AS HE WORKED FOR THE CIA, AND THAT HE HAS A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT LIFE NOW IN VIENNA. HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE LIVED IN 
VIENNA APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS. HE IS A MEMBER OF VARIOUS MUSICAL 
AND ART SOCIETIES. HE SINGS IN A PROMINENT VIENNA MEN'S CHOIR. 
HE HAS PUBLISHED VARIOUS ARTICLES ON MUSIC (HIS SPECIALITY IS 
JOHANN STRAUSS) .• HE HAS RECEIVED MANY MEDALS FOR HIS WORK IN THE 
ARTS IN VIENNA WHICH WE SAW WHEN WE WENT TO HIS APARTMENT. 
WHITTEN IS ALSO GREATLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE 
COMMITTED PERJURY WHEN APPLYING FOR AUSTRIAN RESIDENCY BY STATING 
HE WORKED FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT. HE BELIEVES THIS. COULD 
SUBJECT HIM TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN AUSTRIA. HE STATED ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS, SHOULD HIS AFFILIATION BECOME KNOWN, HE WOULD 
HAVE TO LEAVE AUSTRIA. ON OTHER OCCASIONS, HE STATED THAT HE 
WOULD TURN HIMSELF IN TO THE.VIENNESE AUTHORITIES AND OFFER HIS 
SERVICES AS A CONSULTANT TO THE POLICE OR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. 
HE OBV.IOUSLY WAS EXTREMELY DISTRAUGHT AND WAS VOICING WHAT HE 
BELIEVED WERE HIS OPTIONS SHOULD HIS NAME BE RELEASED BY THE 
BOARD, ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT DECIDED ON A PARTICULAR COURSE OF 
ACTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHITTEN WAS ADAMANT THAT NO MATTER. 
WHAT HAPPENS HE WOULD NEVER BETRAY THE CIA BY TELLING ANYONE. ABOUT 
HIS WORK AS AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. 
BY THE END OF.THE EVENING, WHITTEN STATED THAT HE FELT MUCH 
BETTER ABOUT THE STATE OF EVENTS .• ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, IDEN B 
HAD ASSURED HIM THAT CIA WAS DOING EVERYTHING TO PROTECT HIM AND 
IDEN A STATED HE WOULD ARGUE FOR HIS PROTECTION TO THE BOARD. HE 
CLEARLY LOOKED UPON IDENS AS HIS ALLIES IN THIS PROCESS AND EVEN 
STATED THAT HE HAD A "WONDERFUL" DAY TALKING TO IDENS. IDENS 
LEFT HIM, THEY BELIEVE, FEELING HAPPY AND CONFIDENT ALL WOULD TURN 
OUT WELL. 
AFTER THE MEETING, IDENS SPOKE ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE WOULD BE 
HANDLED BY THE B()ARD. IDEN A BELIEVED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN 
LIKELY THAT THE BOARD.WOULD AGREE TO PROTECT HIM AND THAT HE WOULD 
MAKE THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT HE COULD TO THEM. THE BOARD WILL MAKE 
ITS DECISION IN IT'S NEXT MEETING IN MID-MAY. IDEN B DID NOT 
THINK IT WOULD BE NECESSARY.FOR ANYONE FROM CIA TO COME DOWN TO 
THAT .MEETING. WE. AGREED THAT SHOULD THE BOARD MAKE THE 
REPREHENSIBLE DECISION OF RELEASING WHITTEN'S NAME, THAT WE COULD 
NOT IMAGINE A STRONGER CASE ON WHICH TO BRING AN APPEAL TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
3. IDEN B EXTENDS. HER THANKS TO THE STATION FOR ARRANGING 
THE INTERVIEW AND HER HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS. SHE SAID EVERYTHING 
WENT EXTREMELY SMOOTHLY. HQS WILL APPRISE STATION OF BOARD'S 
DECISION REGARDING WHITTEN. (PROBABLY MID-MAY). REGARDS.
