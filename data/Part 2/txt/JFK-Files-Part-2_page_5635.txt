SUBJECT: Interview with John Whitten (S) 
could subject him to criminal penalties in lAust:,::J.~.) He stated on 
several occasions, should his affiliation become-known, he would 
have to leave lAustria.i,. On other_o_cca_sions, he stated that he 
would turn himseTf-rn· to the LViennese 1authorities and offer his 
services as a consuitant to tfie po~ic~ or intelligence service. 
He obviously was extremely distrau$ht and was voicing what he 
believed were his options should his name be released by the 
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of 
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no 
matter what ha~pens he would never betray the CIA by telling 
anyone about his work as an intelligence officer. (S)

By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he 
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions, 
: I had assured him that CIA was doing everything. to protect him 
and Gunn had stated he would argue for his protection to the 
Board. He clearly looked upon Gunn and I as his allies in this 
process and even stated that he had a ''wonderful" day talking to 
us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident all would 
turn out well~ (S) 
6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn 
about how this issue would be handled by the Board. Gunn 
believed that it was more than likely that the Board would agree 
to protect him and that he would make the strongest argument he 
could to them. The Board will make its decision in it's next 
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for 
anyone from CIA to come down to that meetin$. We agreed that 
should the Board make the reprehensible decision of releasing 
Whitten's name, that we could not imagine a stronger case on 
which to bring an appeal to the President. (S)
