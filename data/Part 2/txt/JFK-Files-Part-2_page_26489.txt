~- There have been an estimated 60 incidents, 
ranging from the almost daily explosion of homemade 
bombs in some periods to the assassination of the 
judici·a.1 police chief, dynamiting of a water reservoir, 
and sabotage of a gasoline storage tank. The govern­
ment has attributed almost all such acts to "Castro-
Communists~'' Cuban trainees were very probably in-
volved, but there is no good evidence of identity. 
7. On)l2 March 1962 Guatemalan troops en­
countered a group of 20 Communist guerrillas near 
Salama, and killed 18. Members of this group may 
possibly have been trained in Cuba. On 27 March 1962 
the army captured 10 guerrillas infiltrated from Mexico, 
where they had been organized and supplie'd by Guate­
malan Communist exiles with the knowledge of the Cuban 
embassy. This group was held for military court mar­
tial, and there has been no further word of disposi­
tion. 
8. Five Communists arrested in early December 
in the act of posting propaganda were released after 
several days of detention. On 14 February 1963, 13 
Communists, including two members of the central com­
mittee, were arrested on charges of subversion and 
planning an insurrection, and are still held. Several 
of these had traveled to Cuba, but there is no evi­
dence of any training. 
9. The reported leader of the Guatemalans known 
to have received guerrilla warfare training in Cuba, 
Ricardo Ramirez de Leon, returned to Guatemala alone 
on 17 April 1962 and went underground. He was most 
recently reported scouting the.Salama area for pos­
sible arms cache sites. The Guatemalan Communists 
recently formed a "military commission," divided into 
secret cells, to direct insurrectional activity, pos­
sibly due to begin in June or July'.
