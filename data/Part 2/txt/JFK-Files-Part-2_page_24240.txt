ment. The IG looked at the investments from a security (i.e. 
cover) point of view in terms of MHMUTUAL's operational support 
function. His concern was that each time MHMUTUAL bought a 
safehouse, for example, there was the possibility that audio 
surveillance of the house by the Soviets would lead to ·a dis­
covery of the purchase mechanism used by the Agency. He rea­
soned that, therefore, the purchase of such items by the com­
plex was operationally unsound because it exposed the entire 
complex to compromise if a foreign intelligence agency tracked 
back the transactions through various corporations. Accor~ing 
to the Inspector General, no funds of MHMUTUAL were used for 
specific projects. What would occur, however, was that a project 
would transfer funds to the complex which would then disburse 
them as needed through an appropriate entity. This method left 
him with major reservations about MHMUTUAL security when it sup­
ported sensitive.clandestine operations. Thus, MHMUTUAL
1
s pro­
vision of cover, funding for active operations, and record owner­
ship acquired for sensitive operations was deemed inappropriate 
and, accordingly, the IG proposed separating operational sup-
port activities of MHANVIL from the instrumentalities of MHMUTUAL. 
It was to be restrained to the purposes for which it had been 
established in 1962* 
* During the course of the IG inquiry no instances were discovered 
where MHMUTUAL or its funds were used to influence foreign stock 
markets or currencies. The Committee has also found no such 
instances.
