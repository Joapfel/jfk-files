B. Nonoperating Proprietaries 
Nonoperating proprietaries vary in complexity a~cording to their 
Agency task, are, for the most part, either corporate shells or less 
that facilitate foreign operations, and clearly pose no competitive 
threat to bona fide businesses. The most elaborate are legally 
licensed and established to conduct bona fide business. They have 
nominee stockholders, directors, and officers and are generally 
directed by one of four Agency proprietary management companies. 
The company address may be a Post Office Box, a legitimate address 
provided by a cleared and witting company official or attorney, or in 
a few cases the address of a proprietary management company. They 
maintain bank accounts, generate business correspondence, keep books 
of account which can withstand commercial and tax audit, file State 
and Federal tax returns, and perform normal business reporting to 
regulatory authorities in order to backstop fully their Agency tasks. 
They are moderately capitalized, generally around $5,000, and their 
net worth at any one ~ime varies according to the Agency task they 
are performing. As of 31 December 1973, 38 of these companies had 
a combined net worth of appro~imately $325,000. Of this amount, 
almost $200,000 was operating·capital for three companies which 
provide cover for several Agency personnel. Examples of two non­
operating companies which are commercially managed, keep books of 
account, and can withstand commercial and tax audit are: 
A Florida corporation capitalized at $7,000 and whose legal 
address is the office of a cleared and witting attorney. 
Under the auspices of the Florida corporation, an Agency 
officer established a branch office in a Central American 
country and conducts a sporting goods business which provides 
him cover. Administration of the corporation, including 
purchase of inventory for the branch office, is handled by 
a proprietary management company.
