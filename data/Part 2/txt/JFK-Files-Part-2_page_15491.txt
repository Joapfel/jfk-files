State Department "Secret" Research Memorandum RFE-36, dated 
6-17-64 on ''Core.munist China's Policy for Establishing Diplomatic Relations," 
reports that Peiping's interest in expanding its network of diplomatic 
ties has significantly increased in past three years. Communist China now 
has.diplomatic relations with 48 countries and,~ because of its recent 
successes and continued intensive efforts, it may soon overtake 
Nationalist China which has recognized 60 countries. According to the 
memoranduni, this is liable to have immense· effect on Chinese representation 
in international organizations, particularly the United Nations {iJN). .
