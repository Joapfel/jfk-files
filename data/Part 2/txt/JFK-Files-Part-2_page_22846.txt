Mr. Smothers. This quite frankly,·Mr. Bundy, this 
related to an ancillary matter that is of concern to the 
Committee. 
You mentioned conversations with Mr. Schlesinger. Again, 
were those initiated by you? 
Mr. Dundy. The most recent one, he called me. And I 
think there were earlier ones, but I don't know. I can't be 
precise. I must say I don't know that I understand the line 
of questioning. Th~se are very important matters, and 
people closely involved in them should he trying to get a 
clear sense of what each other remembers after this many 
years, it seems to me ~his would be entirely natural. 
Mr. Smothers. I don't question the fact that it is 
natural, Mr. Bundy. I think one of the difficult things 
for this Committee to do is to separate out, if you will, 
the independent recollections from the documentary evidence 
we have shown you, and from conversations with others --
Mr. Bundy. You are quite right. And I have tried 
quite carefully to tell you my recollection. 
Mr. Smothers. We are merely trying now to establish 
those relationships so that when we get the point in the 
record there is some question regarding the nature of the 
recollection that might be of some assistance to us. That 
is not an attack on your veracity, it is not an attempt to 
TOP SECRET
