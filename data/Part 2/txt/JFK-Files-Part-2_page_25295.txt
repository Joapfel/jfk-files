MEMORANDUM 
TO: RECORD 
FROM: HOWARD S. LIEBENGOOD 
SUBJECT: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION OF JANUARY 19, 1977 
I called Larry Callahan at 2:00 p.m. to advise him that 
the Commiteee desired to interview Mr. Gene A._Boren, of 
the IRS, at the earliest available opportunity and requested 
his advice and assistance to accomplish this. Callahan was 
nervous about the Committee's eagerness to proceed in response 
to the memorandum for fear that we would be interfering with 
an on-going criminal investigation. He noted the FBI was looking 
into this and he would have to check with the Bureau to 
ascertain the feasibility ·of proceeding unilaterally. I told 
Callahan we did not want to interfere with a criminal investi­
gation and that I did not feel that our interview of the IRS 
employee ·would fall into that category. Callahan referred to 
a possible obstruction of justice _on the part of that employee 
in that the information had been withheld for approximately 
five years. 
At 2:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from Paul Daly 
urging Committee restraint in unilaterally investigating 
subject matter. • Daly noted the Bureau had just received this 
information and was intending to interview the IRS employee
