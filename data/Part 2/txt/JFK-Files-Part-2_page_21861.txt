This series of cables sent during, and after 
(Gottlieb)'s visit to the Congo demonstrated a clear intent at CIA 
_r- ' . -
headquarters to authorize and support rapid progress on the assassi­
nation mission. The cables also show an intent to severely re­
strict knowledge of the assassination operation among officers in 
CIA's Africa Division and among United States personnel in the 
Congo, including those who were aware of and involved in other 
covert activities. 
(e) The(ehief oi)Station Moves Forward With Assassination 
Plot' 
The testimony of the fhief of} Station, taken fifteen 
years after the events in question and without benefit of review-
of the cables discussed above, was compatible with the picture 
derived from the cables of a fully authorized and tightly restricted 
assassination operation. Hedgman's testimony is at variance from 
the cables only with respect to the lack of vigor with which he 
claims to have pursued the assignment which he dealt with in an 
affirmative, aggressive manner in the cables.

Hedgman testified that, after receiving ~ottlie~' s 
instructions, he cablJd CIA headquarters seeking confirmation that 
he was to carry out ie,tt{i~bJ's instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 36). Hedgman did not recall whether he identified ~ottlie~ by 
name, and he doubted that he "would have" mentioned the President 
in such a cable (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 36, 43).
