block on the form, Casasin said he does not know what it stood for. 
I asked him if he understood why some of the notations were crossed ,. 
out and new notations had been made; he said he could not explain that. 
He said,he thought the Permanent Charge notation meant that the file 
would stay in the Office of Registry and that the file therefore had no 
operational significance. In this file he said he thought it would be 
.routine to open a file on defectors such as Oswald, so it may have had ,. 
some other office charge because of that. He said Branch 6 did not 
have an interest in the Oswald file. 
·I asked how he would have come across the State Department commu- ' 
nications on Oswald. He said the normal distribution of such State 
Department information would mean that the dispatches would be circu­
lated for information and then routed back to registry where they would 
be kept on file as Third Agency documents. He said he believes from 
the dispatches he saw on Oswald that they were in a consecutive series' 
as received from the State Department. He believes from the memo that 
he must have seen several such dispatches with information about Os-
wald. 
Casasin explained the operational interest various divisions d 
within the agency might have in this way: ' 
Foreign 
DDO~ 
Count~ Psychological 
intelligence Political 
. \. . . Line Divisions 
Paramilitary' 
He said he believes the 201 Personality form in Oswald's file is 
passive and not operational and sees nothing to indicate operational ' 
interest. He said the above scheme means that only the line divisions 
would carry the operations, and he does not see any indication of such 
an interest on the form. The fact that only Counterintelligence is 
indicated on the form seems to preclude any operations. 
Casasin talked furth~r about suspicions about Oswald. He expressed~ 
the feeling the Oswald and Marina got their visas to leave the Soviet , 
Union too easily. He ·exp'a],ined the "unusual behavior" of Oswald as 
being his defection: his reasons were unknown, he seemed disoriented, 
he married a Russian. Casasin said that while he does not believe Os- ' 
wald was sent back to the United States by the Soviets, he cannot pre­
clude that possibility. 
I asked if the Americans were able to follow Oswald's activities
