SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE 
OF "KISSINGER-17" 
NOTE: 
The above agreement referred to in referenced 
Department letter states that material in FBI files 
relating to the "Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made 
available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These 
personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which 
notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during 
the time the SSC study was in progress. When the study 
was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the 
information considered appropriate for Committee use. The 
summary would be checked to ensure the protection of 
national security matters, protection of confidential 
sources of information and observation of privacy consider­
ations. Thereafter, the approved summary would be 
furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed. 
Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material 
relating to the 11Kissinger-17" and left his notes in 
possession of Bureau personnel. On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick 
requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the 
above notes and prepare his summary which he did on 
2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed 
into two categories: (a) Political or personal information 
obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to 
individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the 
targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for 
each target comprising the "Kissinger-17." Review of 
this summary indicates that no confidential sources of 
this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no 
jeopardy to national security matters. Regarding the 
latter, however, it is felt that the llhite House would be 
in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter. 
It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coYerage 
of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in 
litigation.
