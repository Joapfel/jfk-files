4. Did any of these records originate with any other 
Federal, foreign, state, or local agency? If so, please 
describe which agencies and the approximate numbers. 
A small number of CIA's records pertaining to the 
assassination of JFK, probably less than 5%, originated with 
the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. Another small number of records, also less than 5%, 
~ are original HSCA records stating Committee requests to CIA. 
5. How many of these records have been reviewed for 
release under the Freedom of Information Act(FOIA)? How many 
of these records have been released pursuant to such requests? 
CIA has released 7,432 pages of records pertaining to the 
assassination of JFK, representing 1,969 documents, under the 
FOIA. There is no documentation of how many JFK assassination 
records CIA has reviewed under FOIA. 
6. In the estimation of the CIA, approximately how many 
records would be released under the standards contained in 
House Joint Resolution 454? 
It is very difficult to estimate the number of documents 
that would be released if the Joint Resolution passed because 
consideration for protection of classified information and 
other sensitive categories of information would be required on 
a document by document basis. We would review our holdings 
carefully to ensure that the maximum amount of information is 
released, consistent with the DCI's responsibility to protect 
intelligence sources·and methods and with privacy interests of 
individuals involved.
