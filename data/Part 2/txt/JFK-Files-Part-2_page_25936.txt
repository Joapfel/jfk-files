operation for a number of years, however, and their names nnd amounts 
of gross and net collections appear in mnch of the evidence that we

pmbling. L

C'-0unty into all of central Florida and into the southern State of 
Georgl a.

flat Santo Trafficnnte, ,Tr., and his brother, Henry, personally were 
ririting9rlando and supervising the checkup houses that were con-
iactingthe lottery. • · • • •• •
