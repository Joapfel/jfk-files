DEMCON 
At 9':15 AM today, the Director telephonically 
contacted me to advise that he had ,just been in touch 
with the Vice President of the United States and had 
just gotten off the phone with the ~.ce President's 
Executive Assistant, Ah":,. '\'l~IJ-!}ii_!f~.-Q9.l::YrE1=1~~ i Mr. HOOVER 
stated that the. Vice Presidei.it has rt~ur~sted that we 
furnish the same type of service in connection with 
the Democratic ~~~i~nal Convention in Chicago as was 
furnished to the President during -the Ii.tlantic City 
Convention four years ago. This, of course, refers to 
intelligence information which will be of value to 
the Vice President and specifically relates to the· 
po·ssibility of demonstrations, violence and related 
matters. Mr. HOOVER stated that he had advised the 
Vice President and Mr. CONNELL that this service 
v,ould be performed and that Mr. CONNELL should contact 
me for the necessary arrangements. 
Mr. HOOVER advised me that Mr. CON.NELL is 
presently in New York and it is not known w1Hm he will 
arrive in Chicago. I advj.sed Mr. HOOVER that his 
instructions would be followed, that we had set up 
appropriate arrangements so that we would be in a position 
to furnish valuable intelligenc.e and that upon Mr. CONNELL' s 
arrival in Chicago, I would iuh~ediately contact him 
and perfect the neqessary arrangements.
