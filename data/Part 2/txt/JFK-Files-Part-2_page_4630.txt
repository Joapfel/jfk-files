President Kennedy took up only a small portion of the time 
spent in debriefing KITTY HAWK. You may wish to inform 
Chairman Stokes that in 1966 KITTY HAWK volunte.ered his 
impression that Kennedy's assassination "was planned and 
carried out by VIP's, possibly due to Kennedy's opposition 
to Texas oil interests." He added that he believed that the 
KGB was embarking on a "disinformation!' campaign to have 
the assassination blamed on President Johnson, but he had no 
specific details of this campaign. KITTY HAWK also said. that 
he wa:s "personally well acquainted" with Lee Harvey Oswald's 
background because he had helped prepare the file on Oswald 
which was turned over to the United States Government by 
the Soviet Government. KITTY HAWK was not questioned further 
on this point, and there is no further reference in the 
KITTY HAWK file to any KGB or Soviet Government activity with 
respect to the assassination. 
4. Although strictly speaking it is not relevant to this 
inquiry, you should be aware of the fact that KITTY HAWK supported 
N'osenko' s bona £ides by reporting that No.senko had done the 
KGB considerable damage (more than Golitsyn) and that the KGB 
was looking for Nosenko and intended to kill him if they found 
him. This is pertirient because those who hold to the theory 
that Nosenko was a plant tend also to subscribe to the belief 
that any KGB source or defector ,~ho supported Nosenko' s bona 
£ides wa.3 also KGB-controlled. Introduction of KITTY HAWK 
into the assassination controversy can only serve the purpose 
of obfuscation.
