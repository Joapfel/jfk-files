SUBJECT, 
Assista_nt Dlrcctor/Spccial Oper<1tions 
Security ,Officer 
O'NEAL, Birch D. 
Refe re nee to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject 
sometime prior to 1 Decemb~r 1951, this office will endeavor to comply 
with your proposals. I might say that Mr. O 1Neal has done a su;Jerior Job 
as Alien Affairs Officer for the Agency. There has been some thought 
given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate 
office o{ Mr. Dulles, and it is Impossible to give a positive guarantee o{ 
his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles' 
decision. 
I {eel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the 
line o{ your proposal. The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDT, in 
making Mr. 0 1Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.
