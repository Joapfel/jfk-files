In view of lLurphy's willingness to cooperate with us on 
this we have studied our system to see if we can streamline our 
"]-step" procedure to el imi7?,Q.te unnecessary paperwork for him and 
for Bureau and to reduce 1 iaison contact with him- on s-uch matters to 
minimwn so as not to tie up procedure with "red tape."- "!Ye feel we can 
best do this, and still give us.adequate safeguard of.State clearance, 
by following procedure: (1) when·we select country a"B' logical target 
we will write memo outlining reasons _and have lia.ison orally discuss 
with Murphy to determine if he agrees and at same time to secure his . 
clearance for very discreet inµestigations of potential sources uiiich 
we will, thereafter, select (liaison _notation on memo will constitute 
Bureau record of clearance of country and individual investigations); 
(2) uiiere we desi're to interview a potential source we will prepare 
a letterhead·memo which liaison will del'iver to Murphy._ This memo 
will indicate we propose to conduct interview under suitable pret_ext 
and will concisely summarize identity, background, citizenship, 
position occupied, and other pertinent factors disclosed during 
investigationo· Liaison in delivering ·this memo will then note on 
yellow 7Bureau copy) vhether Murphy· clears interviews or-not and .· 
this will serve as Bureau record. If-Murphy declines an individua.l 
clearano.e 1 iaison will determine· uiiether· declination is strictly 
governed by facts relating to that case or whether Murphy feels 
foreign policy situation has chqnged to such extent we should stop· 
our efforts concerning that particular country. This will. eliminate 
needless effort. _ . _
