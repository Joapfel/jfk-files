3 . "Custody of CIA Assassination Records to be Released in 
2017." 
The CIA proposes that the classified versions of Lee 
Harvey Oswald's Security File and "A" File along with Marina 
Os_wald' s original 201 be transferred to the protected 
(secure) portion of the JFK Collection At NARA by 30 
September 1998. The CIA will need to retain custody of the 
classified version of the original Oswald 201 and the CIA­
HSCA sequestered collection to complete the review of 
duplicate documents by September 1999. 
In September 1999, the classified versions of the 
Oswald 201 (original and microfilm from the sequestered 
collection) will be transferred to NARA. Due to the 
sensitive nature of the information in the remaining 
sequestered collection, particularly the NBR material, CIA 
proposes that the Agency and National Archives work out a 
joint custody arrangement that would allow these record to 
remain in CIA physical custody until 2017.
