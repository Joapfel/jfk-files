don't recall. But there were those problems down around the 
copper mines, and Katanga, there was a revolution down there 
of sorts, And there were many difficulties in the Congo at 
that time. 
Mr. Baron. Do you recall anything else about the language 
that was used in raising the question of assassination at the 
meeting? 
Mr. Dillon. No, I am sorry, I don't recall really anythin 
but what is in the affidavit, but just the subject came up 
generally as a question, and it was turned off by the CIA. 
Mr. Baron. Would the manner in which the question of 
assassinating Lumurnba was raised at that meeting have served 
as sufficient authorization foY the CIA to proceed to develop 
the capability to assassinate Lumumba after that meeting? 
Mr. Dillon. Well, I don't think they really needed any 
authorization to develop the capabilities if they didn't use 
them. And certainly it would not have been enough authoriza­
tion by a long shot for them to start doing that. But I thin 
they could have decided they wanted to develop the capability 
in this area irrespective of this, just by knowing the cancer 
that everyone had about Lumumba in the area. That they could 
have done. They wouldn't have to tell anyone about that. 
That is just developing their own internal capability, and 
then they would have to come and get permission. 
Mr. Baron. ~voulcl the same thing hold true for the
