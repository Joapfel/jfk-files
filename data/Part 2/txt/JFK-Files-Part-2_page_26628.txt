d. The coup group has not 
thrown all Baathists out of the 
government; there are party members 
in the new cabinet. 
e. Syrian Baathists have wel­
comed this retention of their Iraqi 
brothers. Their attitude springs 
from the recognition that the Baath 
in Syria cannot stay afloat without 
support from Iraq. Even so, we hear 
talk of coup plotting in Damascus. 
f. The reaction of Nasir's 
Egypt, which passionately desires 
to see the Baath go under, has been 
exactly the opposite. Cairo has been 
backing off its all-out support for 
the coup ever since the new cabinet 
was announced.
