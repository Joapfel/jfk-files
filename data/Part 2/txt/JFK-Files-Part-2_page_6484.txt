d. The US wculd have the option of replying to a formal call for 
help by either publicly announcing illunediately its iJJt;ention to support 
the Provisional Gover1~ent and initiating overt military operations, or 
responding by establishing a blockade without admitting other support 
for the coup. In t~ latter case, 1he US vculd, between the time of the 
Presidential announcement of the blockade and public announcement of the 
other forms of support, employ small groups of intelligence and recon­
naissance units, thereby providing visibl,~ evid~nce. to .the insurgents 
that su;PP(>l't is forthcoming and yet providing a facade of non-itrtervention 
while the US _consults with its allies to gain their political support. 
At the same· time, the US would be generating and positioning forces re-
- quired for significant overt military operations~ Upon publicly announc­
ing US intent to support the Provisiona1 Government, the US vould initiate 
overt logistical and air support to the insurgents. There is a possibility 
that this level of assistance end demonstrated US intent would be suffi­
cient to bring dovn the Castro-regime, if the coup carried with it a 
' significant element of the Cuban armed forces. . However, it is probable 
that the US vould have to introduce conventional forces incrementally as 
required to sustain t~ uprising and. should be prepared to and would im­
plement portions or all of CIMCLANT OPLANS 312 end 316, as required.
