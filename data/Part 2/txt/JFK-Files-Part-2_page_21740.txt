If your targets are foreign, then where are they? They 
don't all necessarily read English, and we ha~ a· 
So unless the book goes into a lot of languages or it ~s 
I 
p;ublished ~n· I'!ldia, ;for example r wh.ere Enqlish_ is a lingua franca, 
then you have some basic problems. And I think the way this 
was rationalized by the project review board that looked over 
the ~operation, and the 
and things like that was that the ultimate target was

formed, which was true, but how much of the utput 
actually got abroad for any impact I think is highly arguable. 
Now, in the case of he material was 
physically mailed from Washington to foreign targets, the 
-newspapers, I think particularly the 
Agency was a client~ The mere fact that the project was 
rooted in the United States gave it sort of a credibility 
lustre abroad in that particular era. If it came out of 
Washington then it was probably okay. 
But I - ad no domestic U.S. papers 
as clients. What I'm trying to get at· is that DOD handled 
operations which were based domestically in the United States, 
the commercial operations, and this includes proprietary 
airlines and things like that, whose ultimate target was 
~broad. The principal target or even a tangential target was 
not the United States citizen.
