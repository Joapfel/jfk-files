INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY 
The 1955 Report ef the California Committee on 
Un-American Activities, page 46, stated, "The Independent 
Progressive Party in California was quickly captured by 
the communists, and by the time the Wallace for President 
campaign had swung into high gear was being operated lock, 
stock, and oarrel by the Communist Party of California. 
Time after time the committee in questioning witnesses 
threughout the State discovered that the leaders of the 
Communist Parties in various localities were identical 
with the leaders of the Independent Pr~gressive Party in 
the same area. It is true, of cou~se, that in the Inde­
pendent Progressive Party there were many sincere liberals 
who, because of dissatisfaction with the two major polit­
ical orgaru.zations registered as Independent Progressives 
and continued their affiliation until the true control of 
the I. P. P. became obvious. These people !~variably re­
signed, many of them having given the benefit of their ex­
perience to various official agencies interested in the 
exposure t;jf subversive activities."
