Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: -Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
• 
upon this Bureau to make the above information available at 
the earliest logical time and in the most complete form 
possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church 
and John G. Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by 
Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate, 
would appear desirable before initiating any action on the 
basis of information received to date. 
I • 
Additi~nally, it is not known at this time whether 
or not the document reportedly Xeroxed py O'Flaherty is 
class.ified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter, 
attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether 
it contains classified information and ascertain whether or 
not a violation of Federal statutes exists. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. That contact,be maintained with the Philadelphia 
Office to insure that the desired information concerning 
Thweat~s niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to 
cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent 
information obtained . furnished, via established liaison 
channels,to the Department, CIA, and Sen~tors Church and Tower. 
Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct 
necessary investigation to corroborat$ the information and 
to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has 
been committed.
