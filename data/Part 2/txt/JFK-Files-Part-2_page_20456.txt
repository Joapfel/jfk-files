I.1d i:1ns opposes .:nis dis tore ion of his .:ory. Beat inGs and niurd~r of Indians 
La i~inc go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land 
1·ec:;ervations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established 
i:ribal cotirts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities 
111ore or,portunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties 
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land. 
It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier 
in Viet Nam. In i:he three years before 19~7, more Indian children below the 
ace of lC had died in this country than the 6,628 u. s. combat casualties of 
tl e entix-e Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Mo$t of these were children 
belot-1 the age of six. 
The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in 
school, over television, in·cartoons; the Indian has become a jo~e. to white 
Americans_. We pay because we don't know our own history. 
The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history 
of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go 
deep into their history in.finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some 
Ne3ro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as havin3 raised the sa1ne is~ue cf 
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived. 
This strug~le has gone on for .400 years. 
The Indian people have been sendint spo!tesmen to brin 0 their srievances 
and their positions before the. power structure of this country for two hundred 
years. They have fou&ht in the courts since at least 1G30 when the case of 
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georsia tested the ability and the willin~jness of the 
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination. 
The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have. 
wa2,ed a~~ainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understandin;;:. 
the Viet Nam var. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet 
the Indian people have. suffered from the same policy of extermination and 
destruction of thelr identity. 
We must unite with "the strivint;s of those who have had to deal with 
United States' genocide for 200 years! 
We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations 
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct 
the history and policy of genicide a~ainst the Indian veople. Today this 
refers to the desi.:ruction of their identity as· a people and lln!~a with the 
struggles of people for their identity all ove-r the world. To stop the policy 
of ~enocide, of racis1n, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of 
ti1e crimes a~ainst the Ind~_an ~E!!ople,. to re1novc the oppression _o~, t:,he Indiar_i.
