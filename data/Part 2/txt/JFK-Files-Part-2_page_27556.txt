As you probably know, I am retiring at the end 
of the 94th Congress after spending eighteen years 
in the House. For the entire period of my service I 
have been blessed by having a wonderful staff to assist 
me. I am making whatever effort I can to assist them 
in obtaining employment on the Hill. 
One ~f the finest people on my staff is Nancy S. 
Jenkins. She has been with me continuously for the 
past fourteen years. She now handles all military and 
veterans casework and makes my nominations to the U.S. 
Military Academies, but she has such a varied experience 
that she can handle almost any matter that comes up in 
a Congressional office. I have no hesitancy whatsoever 
in enthusiastically endorsing her for your consideration 
if you should have a vacancy in your office. She is an 
outstanding young lady whose intelligence, dedication 
and loyalty are unquestioned. Nancy is extremely congenial, 
affable and has the ability to promote and foster constit­
uent appeal for her Congressman. 
If you or your assistant should decide to interview 
her, please call my office, x54261; and if you desire any 
further information about her, please do not hesitate to 
contact me. My home number in NewportNews, Virginia is 
804 596-2188. 
Sincerely,
