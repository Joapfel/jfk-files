27 March 1963 
EL SALVADOR 
1. Approximately 100 Salvadorans traveled 
to Cuba in 1962, and eight more have gone in 1963. 
Most of them attended party meetings or celebrations 
for one or two weeks. About 20 continued to Bloc 
countries. There is no evidence that any received 
guerrilla training or extensive political indoctri­
nation. 
2. Since passage of a new law in September, 
1962, Salvadoran authorities have been arresting 
returning Salvadorans suspected of having gone 
to Cuba. Several now are in jail awaiting trial. 
Almost all Salvadoran travel to Cuba is through 
Mexico with detachable Cuban visa. A number of 
Salvadorans have remained in Cuba because of the 
police crackdown in El Salvador. 
3. There are no known paramilitary units or 
related activity. 
4. There have been 196 recorded arrests since 
the beginning of 1962 for terrorist or subversive 
activities. None of those arrested has been con­
victed or even tried, but 66 were held for an ap­
preciable time--about 15 for as long as nine months. 
We believe that three of those arrested had had 
some type of training in Cuba. There is no record 
of any arrests for guerrilla or sabotage activ'i ty. 
_J 
5. Records show a total of 25 subversion inci­
dents: eight by unknown persons; three involving 
individuals believed to have received training in_ 
·cuba; and 14 involving persons not believed or 
known to have had any Cuban training. 
6. Other than two prominent Communist labor 
leaders, Luis Felipe Cativo and Jose Delfino Perez, 
Cuban trainees are not known to have any positions 
of influence in El Salvador.
