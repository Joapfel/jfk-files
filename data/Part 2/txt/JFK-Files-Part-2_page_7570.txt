2. Moskalev's paper concerned the results of a series of experiments utilizing 
an unusually large number of.rats and mice. The numbers he used were far in 
excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory~ These figures 
were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates. The data he pre­
sented was primarily on Strontium 90. His findings indicated that Strontium 
90 was much more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature 
and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His 
technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control 
he had on his animals was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He 
claims to.have been able to induce cancer in laboratory animals at permissible 
exposure levels for atomic workers in the US. The animals were not examined 
for radioactivity, only-for the existence of cancer. A respected US scien-
