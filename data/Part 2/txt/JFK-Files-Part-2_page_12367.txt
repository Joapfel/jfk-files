10. Transfer of informants to other areas 
a. Keep alert to possibility of transferring informants to areas needing 
coverage through change _in residence or employment. 
b. Keep in mind overall coverage of organizations. If informant becomes 
prominent and may be able to expand his field of activity beyond your 
field division, encourage him to do so in order to prqvide wider cov­
erage for Bureau's work. 
11 .. Action by informant· when uncovered 
a. If informant is uncovered by subversive elements, instruct ~im to de­
fend himself vigorously and demand proof of his informant activi t.y: 
b. Suspicion in many cases is directed to an informant without facts ~o 
back it up and by bluffing informant may confuse issue to point where 
his services may not be lost. 
c. In some cases. it may be necessary for informant to acquiesce- to 
charges of deviation from strict discipline of organization· involved, 
and thus cast off suspicion. 
12. Requests of informant to help defend others . 
a. If requested by Communist Party, or other interested parties 'to assis·t;· 
in preparation of defense in subversive-type cases or handle assign­
ment where such information is readily available, informant should -
tactfully decline. 
b. Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent and 
made matter of record. 
c. If informant cannot avoid becoming involved, instruct him not to repor~ 
any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy. 
d. Promptly report any such incident to Bureau. 
e. [If an informant is present in conversation between an attorney and 
indi'iidual under criminal indictment, ·he should immediately leave. 
If he is unable to do so and inadvertently learns of defense plans 
or strategy, he is not to report the substance of any such 
conversation to the FBI. Additionally, the informant is not to 
engage in or report the substance of a conversation with a criminal 
defendant dealing with the offense for which the defendant is 
under indictment.] 
13. Preparation for testifying 
Contacting Agent must condition informant to fact that someday knowledge 
he possesses may be needed as evidence in court. Psychologically prepare 
informant for fact that he may at future date be called upon to testify to 
information he has furnished on security matters. Proper indoctrination 
Qf informant is essential as Bureau must provide witnesses whenever 
Department initiates prosecutions in security cases. 
G. INFORMANTS' INFORYiA.TION 
1. General instructions re oral and written information 
a. These instructions apply to security informants, potential security 
informants, panel sources, security confidential sources, and 
security sources of information. 
b. Specific instructions must be given to informants concerning -prepara­
tion of statements containing their information. 
c. They should be submitted as quickly as possible after meeting or 
activity. 
d. Written statements should be submitted when possible." In espionage 
and foreign nationality matters written statements are usually 
necessary only in those instances involving possible future-prosecu­
tion. {In the majority of cases diplomats or offioials who are not 
subject to prosecution are involved.)· 
e. Carefully scrutinize each, bearing in mind that if informant is called 
upon to testify at a later date his statements will very likely be 
introduced in court.

recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, and all necessary action· 
taken. Form FD-306 may be used in lieu of channelizing memorandum if 
desired. If so, prepare copies of FD-306 as needed for channelizing 
and staple one copy to each copy of informant's statement _being 
( 
(

on all copies. When informant's statement contains references to . 
large number of indiYiduals and/or organizations, and exceeds two 
pages, consider channelizing to substantive case file only thuse· por-
