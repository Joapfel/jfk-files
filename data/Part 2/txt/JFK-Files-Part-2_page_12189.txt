Investigation of communist petition signers who are acquainted with 
·Communist Party functionaries 
Be alert to receive any suggestions of plant executives and hi.ghly placed 
personnel who are reliable and friendly to the Bureau concerning members 
of subversive organizations who might coopera·~e vd th t'he Bureau or employ­
ees who might be willing to infiltrate a subversi-ve organization. In the 
past suoh contacts· have on occasion resulted in the plant's m&.king avail­
able the ser-vices of an employee who already is an informant of the manage­
ment. 
Personnel directors in plants f-requently are able ·l;o advise of members of 
communis·t-domlnated unions ;-rho retain their n:enbe:-:·ship raere1y to hold 
their positions. . 
With regard to both 10 and 11 above, if possible, the offi~ial should 
sug~est to the potential inform~nt that he contact the Bircau rather 
than have an Agent origini>.te the contact. 
After ·!;he ·Bureau has notified the armed forces of a communi8t in an indus­
trial plant having armed forces contracts, the communist frequently recants 
when he is informed o:f the charges and is facing the possibD5.ty of dis­
mi_ssal or transfer to a nonrestricted position in the same plant. At 
such a time, officers friendly to the Bureau sometimes suggest that 
the person advise the Bureau of his past activities .. Be alert to take 
ad-vantage of such cooperation when offered,
