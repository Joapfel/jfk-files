MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 19 November 1960 
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant and Mann; Douglas and Gen. Lansdale; 
Gray; Dulles and Bissell 
/ 2 Cuba 
Mr. Merchant began by stating that in his opinion we are putting 
more .burden on the Guatemalan government with our training base than 
that government can support for very long. He noted that Mr. Mann 
believes the solution is to move our training activities to the U.S., . 
but Mr. Merchant does not think we can get away with this, particularly 
if an increase in numbers is contemplated: Therefore, the only solution. 
would seem to be to move to another base or bases in other countries; 
this would involve the same burden on the other countries as now exists 
with respect to Guatemala. Although he has not discussed this point 
with Secretary Herter, Mr. Merchant believes that it is time to take 
another look at Cuba and if the U.S. attitude toward Castro remains· 
unchanged then we should consider shifting our entire posture. This 
would involve a break in diplomatic relations, the support of a govern­
ment in exile,· and other activities mostly overt, including some 
training in the U.S.
