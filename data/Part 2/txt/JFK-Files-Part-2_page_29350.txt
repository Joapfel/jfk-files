he remembers that a Mexican would often come to the second floor and 
ask him to come and listen to the conversation. 
Mr. Arehart was questioned about whether there was a process 
whereby transcription of important conversations in English or Russian 
could be expedited. He explained that there would not be such a 
process for a Russian conversation since they could not judge the 
importance of the conversation due to the fact that no one in the 
base understood Russian. He said that there was.such a procedure for 
English conversations. He siad that after listening to the conversation 
and deeming it important .. he would Mark the tape "Urgent" and would 
put it in a box and deliver it. 
Mr. Arehart said that when he worked with Tarasoff that he 
would pick up the tapes to reuse as well as drop them off for trans­
cription. He said that he did not pick up the transcripts from Tarasoff 
and has no idea about what happened to them. Mr. Arehart said that 
he did not receive all of the tapes back and just assumed that they 
_had been retained because of interest in the conversations contained on 
them. He said this was routine. After getting the tapes back, either 
from Tarasoff or Goodpasture depending on the time period, he would 
put them back into the working order. The tapes were not retained after 
they were returned to the base. 
Mr Arehart said that the tape machines were activated at 
approximately 7:00 a.m. They were turned off at 11:00 p.m. 
Mr. Arehart said that the Russian tapes were taken off the 
machines on a daily basis for delivery to Goodpasture or Tarasoff. 
The Cuban tapes were left on the 'machines until. the reel was full. 
They were then removed and transcribed.
