He staged the robbery ond immedi­

claims, because he hod refused · lo kill

• Two moior magazines intimated that 
Nagell had been insane. 
New Orleans district attorney Jim Gar­
rison allegedly interviewed Nogell three 
times in liis controversial probe of what 
he called the fJlot to kill Kennedy, 
However, despite all the publicity 
about Nogell, no public mention has 
been mode of his charges that: 
- ► FBI 1peciol agents who questioned 
Mrs. Nagell about her husband while he 
was in prison said they didn't kl'OW 
where he was; • • • .

ident Kennedy.

ICHARD CASE 
Nagell first went 
to work for the . 
CIA as an In• 
formant in Au• 
gust 1962. 
During a subsequent tour In 
. the Far East with the CIC and 
FOi, Nagell met and married 
his Japanese wife In the liprlng 
of 1959. Being married to a 
foreign national meant . an 
automatic removal from Intel• 
llgence· work so Nagell ·decided 
to leave the Army. . . . 
Oswald. He told him he waa an 
Intelligence man, not a killer, 
and he couldn't kill Oswald, 
"'Threats ·were made· to Na• 
gell which Indicated to him that 
he had better do what he had 
be arre1ted. He expected to be 
held brlefiy for discharging a 
.firearm on Federally Insured 
property. "By that time the u~.

In Waahln,ton. Hoover didn't 
reply, but Nagell didn't expect 
he'd be safe. • 
Apparently Nagell lelt police 
custody would keep him aafe 
from the CIA and from the 
aaasalna. He •:feared the CIA 
because he didn't "take care
