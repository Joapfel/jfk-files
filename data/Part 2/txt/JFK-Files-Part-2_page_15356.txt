Anti-U. Se feelings and' de·monstrations were exhibited zn Brazil.\ 
during the S~th Amen·can trip of Vice President and Mrs. Nixon and 
although the demonstrations did. not a~tain the violence exhibited in some 
of the other South American countries, the demonstrations indicated the 
work of well-organized group _or groups opposed to the Uo. So 
• On ?-8-58, V/ilson Velloso, Press Attache, Brazi 1 tan Embassy, . 
who admitted former membership in the Communist Party of Brazil, upon· 
interview at his request, stated ·that he had attempted to discuss . ·, -.. 
Co_mmunist Party activities with Brazilian officials but they indicc··cltd 
indifference to such information in 1951. :: .. l. ,· 
• Ve lloso supposed the reason for the ind iffe,rence was tlu:i't· '7rts 
information was common lmowledge;' however, another explanation would be 
sanction of the Communist Party on the ·part of Brazilian officials, even 
though the Communist Party has been outlawed there. Velloso stated he 
knew of no communist influence at·'the Brazilian Embassy but stated that 
it was the tendency of Latin Ame'rican countries at this time to play 
l 
communist countries against noncommun_ ist countries in, an effort to 
obtain _all they could in the nature of aid and_ assistance, inferring 
that the Brazilian Embassy would also atte~pt this practice. Velloso 
commented that he did not believe that such negotiatipns on the part 9f·
