revision for circulation to the NSC members for approval. 
6. If extremely sensitive matters were discussed at an NSC 
meeting, it was sometimes the practice that the official NSC 
minutes would record only the general subject discussed without 
identifying the specially sensitive subject or the discussion. 
In highly sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would be 
made in the NSC minutes. 
According to my recollection at.this time, there was no 
fixed pr6cedure for recording the discussions of these sensitive 
matters which were usually discussed in a very limited attendance. 
Some of these discussions were of a general nature _which did not 
need to be recorded. Others were of such importance that a full 
//' record was drafted by me and my deputy, a-s- he attended, and circu-
lated by highly classified memorandum to each of the NSC members 
for approval. In some cases, only a record of the conclusions and 
decisions, if any,_ were similarly drafted and approved. As approved 
by the NSC members and finally the President, the recOrd of these 
extremely sensitive matters ,,,ere circulated on a very strictly con­
trolled _dist~ibution.
