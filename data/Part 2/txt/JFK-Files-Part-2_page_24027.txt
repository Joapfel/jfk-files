October 20 
A cable to the Station indicated that "while awaiting word on whatever 
events may have occurred 19 October, please let us know what you can on 
interim basis .... Headquarters must respond duri.ng morning 20 October to 
queries from high levels." (Headquarters 883, 20 October 1970) Karamessines 
testified t~at the referen·ces to "high leve.ls" in the .cable of the 20th 
meant White House officials, probably Kissinger. He felt quite certain 
that Kissinger would have been briefed in advance about Valenzuela's plan 
for the 19th and so would have been expected to ask what happened on the 
morning of the 20th. (Karamessines testimony, p. 73) In contrast, -Kissinger 
interpreted that cable in precisely the opposite light. He· felt it indicated 
that he had not been informed of the Valenzuela plan in advance, When 
news of the Schneider kidnap reached the White House, Kissinger believed 
he would have had "somebody pick up a telephone and say, 'What is this 
all about?·"' (Kissinger transcript, p. 68)-
October 22 
Karamessines met with Haig at the White House. (Karamessines calendar) 
General Haig remembered that word of the shooting of Schneider came as

a great sli'ock

to him, and he believed that Karamessines had told him 
about it in their meeting on the 22nd. He thought that Kissinger either 
was present at the meeting or that he, Haig, had gone immediately int~ 
Kissinger's office to relate what Karamessines' liad:'to1d him:·. (Haig
