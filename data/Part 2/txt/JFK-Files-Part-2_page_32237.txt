eventually become impossible to conceal .. If properly 
handled, the overt aspects of this policy may serve not 
only to mitigate any unfavorable reactions from other 
oouttfrias. but also to gain. particularly in Latin 
Am,srieaio increasing appreciation of the threat of Castro/ 
Coil'lll!Unist Cuba .. 
The active pursuit of our objective will make it clear 
that the U .. S. will not permit the maintenance of a 
comm.uni.at base in the hemisphere~ From the standpoint of 
military posture, the more active approach may be 
subjected to counteractions from the Sino-Soviet Bloc 
elsewhere. As we increase the pressures on Cas:tlZo/Communist 
Cuba and the extent of our commitment to overthrow the regime, 
U .. S .. prestige becomegmore deeply involved.. The further 
we progress along this route, the more significant will be 
the loss of U .. S .. prestige if we alter or abandon it. 
The succe$sful execution of this policy will require 
careful timing and coordination of our actions and the 
development of detailed plans.. While such plans would be 
designed to bring abou.t the overthrow of th.e Castro regime 
within a given time frame for planning purposes, thay 
would have to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate 
cha.nges to the international situation .. 
In any casue. at eYUcial points along the way, it will 
be necessary for the highe.st levels of our Government to 
review the actions already taken and those contemplated and 
to assess the advantages of <::ontinued and escalated 
activity against the disadvantages and dangers of such 
activity. 
Commitment to this course of action does not exclude 
the possibility of actively pursuing the isolation of the 
Castro regime from the Bloc.
