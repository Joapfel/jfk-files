that he believed Caitro's assassination was within the sco~e of the CIA's 
authority. _{(Helms, 9/12/75, pp. 11-12)_'._/ As in the case of the 1962 plots, 
Helms based this on the vigor of the Administration's policy towards Cuba 
_Land his perception that there were no limits put on the means that could 
.be used in the effort against Castro. (Helms, 9/12/75, pp. 11-12). Thus..!../ 
Helms testified that after the missile crisis the U.S. continued to conduct 
covert actions whose purpose was "to overthrow Castro." (Helms, 6/13/75, 
P• 24.) /Helms was asked whether it was his opinion that the offer of the poison 
pen to AM/LASH was authorized because it came within the scope of_the 1963 pro­

/"I think the only way I know how to answer that is that I 
do not recall when things got cranked up in 1963 any dramatic 
changes or limitations being put on this operation. There 
was still an effort by whatever device, and perhaps only 
slightly_differently oriented at this time, to try to get rid 
of Castro ... But I do not r~call specific things being said, 
now, (we are not) going t6 do this, we're not going to do that, 
and we're not _g_oing to do the other thing, and we will do just 
these things.'.:_/ 
(b) Testimony of Administration Officials

they were not informed about any assassination plot and that there was no order that 
Castro be assassinated. Again, they disagreed with Helms' ppsition that an assassi-
nation plot could be undertaken without express authority. The only added part 
relating to the AM/LASH plot was certain testimony which asse_rted that it was in­
conceivable that the President would have approved art assassination plot at the very 
same time he had authorized talks to explore the possibility of improved relations 
with Castro.*/
