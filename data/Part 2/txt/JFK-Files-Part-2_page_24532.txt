Bundy, speaking to the Group, 
II made it clear that this did not constitute 
a blanket approval of every item in the paper and 
that sensitive ones such as sabotaGe, for example, 
will have to be prese~ted in more detail on a case 
by case basis." (Memo of Special Group Augmented 
meeting, September 14, 1962, p. ) . 
Helms and the members of the Special Group Aur:;mented differed on 
whether or not these control requirements were consistent with Helms' per­
ception that assassination was permissible without a direct order. We 
discuss that testimony below at 
7. 'l'he Pattern of Mongoose Action. The documentary evidence and the 
.... 
testimony reveal that the Kennedy Administration pressed the Mongoose opera-
tion with vigorous language and although the collection of intelligence 
infonnation was the central objective of Mongoose up until August 1962!1

sabotage operations. As Lansdale described them in his testimony, the

blowing up certain production plants11 (Lansdale, p. 36). And quring 
the Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962, sabotage was increasingly urged. 
_:_/ In early March, 1962, the SGA recognized the need fo be~in "preliminary 
actions .... involvine· such things as spotting, assessinr, and training 
action-type ae;ents" but the Group agreed that it must "keep its hand 
tightly" on these actions. The Group saw, however, that such control 
mir,ht not be completely effective and reco~nized "that many of the 
• agents infiltrated would be of an all-purpose type; that is, they would 
be trained in paramilitary skills, as well as those of exclusively 
intelligence conce~n. It was noted that once the agents are within the 
country, they cannot be effectively controlled from the U.S., although 
·every effort will be made to attempt such control." (Minutes of 
Special Group meeting, March 5, 1962).
