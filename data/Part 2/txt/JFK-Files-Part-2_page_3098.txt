In mid-April of 1960 WH/4 made the first presen­
tation for the DCI since the basic program had been 
approved by President Eisenhower in mid-March. In 
attendance in addition to the DCI were: Gen. Cabell, 
Mr. Helms (C/OPS), Herman Horton (CI Staff), and C. 
Tracy Barnes, Mr. Bissell's Deputy. This high level 
group was informed that broadcasting activity from 
Swan Island was scheduled to begin on 17 May 1960 and 
that very special operations were being carried out 
in order to provide stories for propaganda use. Ac­
cording to Dave Phillips who made the presentation 
apparently was paid to Mr. Oberst's proposals. 
About the' same time that Oberst's memorandum 
was going forward, the DDP was ca"iling for WH/4 to 
prepare daily progress reports as one way of eliminat­
ing the need for crash-type responses or actions. 
In discussing the contents of such reports,.it was 
indicated that: • 
The Progress Report should generally 
not exceed one page in length, and that 
we should not hesitate to include it in 
items which we~e not favorable to our 
progress, in other words, setbacks or 
handicaps which we might have encountered. 63/ 
Also, by way of keeping informed about develop-·· 
ments related to the operation, Chief WH/4 instituted 
a series of weekly meetin~~ with the operational ele­
ments of the DDP "for the purpose of insuring opera­
tional .coordination similar to that achieved by the 
meeting of support elements every Tuesday morning." 6.4/
