FROM ,i 
The Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Co­
ordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intel­
ligence Community identified ten issues likely to grow 
out of the Select Committee's deliberations. The 
Executive Committee asked the FBI to prepare a paper 
on one of these topics, Intelligence Files and Privacy. 
Specifically, the request was for a brief paper which 
rais~s the issues observed by the intelligence agencies 
when intelligence files and privacy are viewed together 
without,suggesting or recommending how the questions 
should be resolved. 
Director Soc'y _ 
J. D. Milier drafted an outline which was 
discussed on April 16, 1975, with.representatives of the 
CIA and Departments of Defense and Treasury. On April 21, 
this outline was presented by Mr. Hotis to the Executive 
Committee which received it without comment. Mr. Miller 
then prepared a rough draft which was discussed at a 
meeting on April 22, with the representatives of t~e CIA 
and Department of Treasury . 
. Mr. Miller's final draft is attached. It 
discusses both intelligence files and the concept of 
privacy in general terms before focusing on the issues 
which present themselves when an effort is made to 
establish the proper relationship between the two.
