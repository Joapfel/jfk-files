(2) Contact With The Syndicate 
In early September 1960, Maheu met Roselli 
at the Brown Derby in Beverly Hills, told him that "high govern­
ment officials" needed his cooperation in getting rid of Castro, 
and asked him to help recurit Cubans to do the job (Roselli, p. 8). 
Maheu recalled that Roselli was at first reluctant to participate 
in the project and insisted on meeting with a representative of 
the government (Maheu, 7/29, ~p. 10-li; Roselli, p. 9). A meeting 
with O'Connell was arranged in New York City at the Plaza Hotel 
during the week of September 14, 1960 (Roselli, pp. 10-11; I.G., 
p. 16). O'Connell testified that he was introduced to Roselli. 
as a business associate of Maheu, and that Maheu told Roselli 
that he represented international business interests which were 
pooling money to pay for the assassination of Castro (O'Connell, 
p. 26). Roselli claimed that Maheu told him at that time that 
O'Connell was with the CIA** (Roselli, pp. 11, 85). 
* The I.G. Report places the amount at $150,000; O'Connell 
thought it might have been $100,000 (O'Connell, p. 16), Roselli 
recalled $250,000 (Roselli, p. 25) and Edwards confirmed the 
$150,000 figure (Edwards, p. 9). Maheu could recall no "price 
tag" for Castro's assassination (Maheu, p. 34). 
** The weight of the testimony indicates that Roselli realized 
the CIA was behind the assassination attempt at an early stage.
