(a) Dulles Cables Again for "Elimination" of Lumumba, 
and a Messenger is Sent to Congo With a Highly 
Sensitive Assignment 
On September 19, 1960, several days after Lumumba placed him­
self in the protective custody of the United Nations peacekeeping 
force in Leopoldville, Richard Bissell and Bronson Tweedy signed 
a cryptic cable to Leopoldville to arrange a clandestine meeting 
between the(Chief of)Station and "(idney) Braun," who was traveling 
to the Congo on an unspecified assignment: 
[ •'6 I~"] SHOULD ARRIVE APPROX 2 7 SEPT. . WILL 
ANNOUNCE HIMSELF AS '~ID/c Fl(OM PARIS". . IT 
URGENT YOU SHOULD SEE (\_SI~"] SOONEST POSSIBLE 
AFTER HE PHONES YOU. HE WILL FULLY IDENTIFY 
HIMSELF AND ~XPLAIN HIS ASS IGm1ENT TO YOU. 
(CIA Cable, OUT 71464~ Bissell/Tweedy to Chief 
of St~tion, /19/60.) • 
The cable bore a highly unusual sensitivity indicator 
"PROP" -- that restricted circulation at CIA headquarters to the 
Chief of the Africa Division.* 
( 
,·, In a letter of September 23, 1975, the Chief of the CIA Review 
Staff informed the Co=ittee that "PROP" was normally used "to 
denote sensitive personnel matters" (Seymour R. Bolton to Frederick 
. A. 0. Schwarz and Frederick D. Baron, 9/23/75. It appears that this 
sensitivity indicator, while created for other purposes, was utilized 
by Bissell, Tweedy, and the Chief .of Station to restrict distribution 
of their corrnnunications about an assassination operation. The cable 
traffic cited in· this report that was sent through the PROP channel 
did not touch upon personnel matters except in terms of recruitinr. 
additional CIA officers and agents for the assassination operation.
