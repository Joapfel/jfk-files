Dear Mike: 
On February 23, 24, and March 3, 1976, Mr. William 
Cregar of the FBI reviewed the Select Committee's draft 
report entitled "National,...Security, Civil Liberties, and 
the Collection of Intellige"!ice,:· A Report on the Huston Plan" 
for security problems. Loch Johnson, of the Committee staff, 
revised the draft to meet all security problems which were 
raised and discussed the revisions with Mr. Cregar to make 
certain that their concerns were met. 
This letter is intended to confirm the fact that, un­
less I receive word to the contrary from you, the Department 
of Justice has no objection, on security grounds, to the 
publication of this report. 
Thanks very much for your help throughout the inquiry 
into this subject.
