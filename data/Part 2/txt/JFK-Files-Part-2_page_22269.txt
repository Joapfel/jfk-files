in the Special Group, and one or more at least ;in other very 
small groups with representation from State, thje White House 
and the Agency. And I am clear -- I do recolle[ct. that the 
I

discussion was clear that weapons so supplied might very well 
be used against Trujillo or other senior supporters of his.

at the CIA has the US Government supplied arms t.o dissident 
groups within the country?
