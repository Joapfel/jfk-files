Mr. Angleton. He knew, because even before I went into 
this I told him what I was going to do, and he agreed, and 
so on . 
And also I wanted a person, because there was a radio 
going to be put into Havana, and let somebody say we need a 
radio in Havana, or drop some men in. And then the point is, 
I get the radio to Tel Aviv, and to Havana and then put it 
someplace, and then tell him, you go to such and such a place 
and find the radio, and then have some men come in and call 
some men to make contact, with the view that I couldn't trust 
the whole setup.

This individual established his cover, They only had two or 
three people in the Embassy there. He would go to a 
Hungarian res~aurant where the Soviet officers would also go.

Soviets come out with the statement, is Bill Harvey on the 
TOP SECRET
