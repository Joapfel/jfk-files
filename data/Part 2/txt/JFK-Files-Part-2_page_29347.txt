He said that there were 6 to 8 Mexicans who monitored the conversations 
and transcribed the tapes. As the Mexicans monitored the conversations 
they would make summaries of the important conversations. It was up to 
the monitors to decide which conversations were important enough to 
summarize. Arehart was not aware of any instruction that was provided 
the Mexican monitors on which conversations should be deemed important. 
In addition tQ the summaries, the tapes from the Cuban taps and the 
Spanish language portions of the tapes from the Soviet taps were 
transcribed in the base. Arehart turned the summaries, Cuban transcripts, 
Russian (Spanish) transcripts, and the Russian tapes, over to his contact. 
He stated that his routine contact was Anne Goodpasture and that he just 
assumed that she was the case officer for the project.even though he 
claims that he received his orders directly from Win Scott by telephone. 
Summaries were always delivered very early in the morning the day after 
a conversation occured. The transcripts were literal transcriptions. 
Mr. Arehart said that sometimes, if the Mexican monitors felt something 
was really important, tapes and transcripts were passed immediately
