~ 
SUBJECT . Activity Related to Dorn~stic Events . 
1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism 
in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on 
black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean 
and as a threat to the security of the Caribbe~n states. 
Two DDI rr.cmoranda were produced on the subject: 
11
rnack 
Radicalism in -the Car:i.bbean
11 
(6 August 1969), and 
11
Black 
Radicalism in the Caribbe~n--Anot~or Look" (12 June 1970). 
·1n each a single paragraph was devoted to tics with the 
US bl~ck pm-.·er movement; the discussio:i primarily concQrned 
visits of Stokely Carmicha0l anc.l other US black power 
activists to the Caribbean and other overt contacts. 
2. In June 19 7 0 , Archer Rush of OCI ·was asked to 
write a memorandum with special attention to links be­
tween black. ·radicalism in the Carihbean and advocntes of 
black pm•:er in the US. 'rhG record is not clear \vherc 
this request originated, but it came through channels 
from the DCI. The paper was to be treated as especially 
sensitive and was to include material provided by the 
Special Operations group of the CI Staff. The CI Staff 
material was voluminous but did not provide meaningful 
evidence of importu.nt links between militant blacks in 
the US and the Caribbean. This, in fact, was one of 
the conclusions of the paper. The memo·randum was produced 
in typescript form and given to the DCI.
