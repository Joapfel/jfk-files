The SIM report is nothing more than 
a summary of allegations and accusations 
made against Fidel Castro during the 
period i948-1950. This summary has 
apparently been slanted in an effort to 
make Castro a "Rojo," but the result 
is a rather poor one. 2/ 
The Department of State reporter refuted, on a 
paragraph by paragraph basis, all of the allegations 
which indicated that Castro had been tied in with 
Communists, ·or Communist sympathizers, ever since 
his university days; and in forwarding the report to 
.. 
Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, the COS Havana 
indicated that he was furnishing the information be­
cause of renewed interest by the State Department in 
Fidel Castro. 3/ 
The tenor of State reporting continued in a 
similar vein well into 1957. Charges that Castro 
' • 
was a Communist could not be s_ubstantiated, but State 
r 
did note that in his student days, he ''was invoJ,ved 
in gangster-type activities." 4/ Havana Embassy 
reporting also reflected another of the problems of 
continuing concern to the US Intelligence Community 
would Castro _have sufficient force to oust Batista, 
and were his basic feelings toward the US friendly. 5/
