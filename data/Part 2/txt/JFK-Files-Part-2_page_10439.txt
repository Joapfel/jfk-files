1. In late 1967 OCI participated in the preparation 
of several short intelligence mcraoranc1a dealing with the 
foreign connections of US or~anizations and ac~ivists in­
volved in :~he anti-- 1;-;ur movc:.1ent. 'rhe main purpose of 
those rep~rts, Frcparcd at the request of the ~nite House, 
_was to detc,,rmine \•.1~1ether any links existed bct<.·1een inter­
national Corrununist e_lcments or forcig:1 -governrr,cnts and the 
Americc:i.n peace mov~mcnt. 'l'he conclusion roached ·was that 
there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts bct~een- anti­
war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of 
direction or form~l coordination. 
2. In October 1967 President Johnson expressed 
interest in this subject and ordered a high l~vcl intcr­
departcental survey. In response to his personal request 
to the DCI, Mr. Helms asked the CI Staff to collect what­
ever information \·ms availu.ble through our m•m sources and 
through liaison with the FBI and to pass it to OCI, .,:,hich • 
was di:r.ected to prepare a memorandum from the DCI to the 
President. 
3. A book message requirement was sent to all stations 
to report whatever information was on hand relevant to this 
subject.· Although agent reports on Communist front opera­
tions ovcr~eas were ·of some value, the primary source of 
information on the activities of US activists--and that was 
qUiie limitcd--was sensitive intercepts produced by NSA, 
which had been similarly tasked by the White irouse.
