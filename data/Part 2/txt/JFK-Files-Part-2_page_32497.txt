Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence 
As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan 
Communist Party reportedly plans to mark the fourth 
anniversary of Betancourt's presidency on 13, February 
by guerrilla bombings in the Caracas area. Other 
Communists are to see to it that the capit~l is 
flooded with propaganda that day. According to un­
confirmed reports, Venezuelan authorities have 
cha~ged the Castro government with ordering the recent 
terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an 
extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity 
in both countries. Colombian military authorities 
have reportedly drawn up a plan to prevent terrorism 
in Colombia's cities.
