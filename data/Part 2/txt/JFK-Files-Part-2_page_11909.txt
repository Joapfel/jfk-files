SECTION 107 
(4) Separate statements should be prepared for each meeting or 
separate activity in which informants engage and should be 
dictated by Agent as if informant were preparing thorn himself. 
{5) Information, after being reduced to writing, should be read 
promptly by informant and acknowledged by affixing his code 
name on each page. In espionage and foreign nationality 
matters, such authentication is necessary only where future 
prosecution is possible. • 
(6) After informant authenticates statement, contacting Agent 
should prepare cover sheet, form FD-306, which should be stapled 
to it. Thereafter statement should be handled as written one. 
(7) Oral information furnished by informant purely of lead yalue 
should be included in office memorandum by Agent and should· 
not.be initialed by informant or exhibited to him or treated 
as evidence. 
Transmission of information . 
a. Statements should be personally delivered to contacting Agent by 
informants when possible. Careful consideration should be given to 
full security of all such contacts. They should never be mailed to 
field office or resident agency. If they cannot be obtained per­
sonally by contacting Agent, obtain confidential post office boxes 
f9r their receipt. 
b. Confidential post office boxes should be obtained under fictitious 
names and not under names of persons who may be listed in post 
office directory. More than one informant may send statements to 
a post office box, but consideration should be given to obtaining 
post office boxes in different post office stations to prevent 
suspicion on part of postal employees. 
c. Envelope enclosing statement should have return address of another 
confidential post office box obtained under fictitious name. 
d. Statements should be collected at post office boxes regularly, but 
time o:f pickup should be varied. Work out system of rotation where­
by same Agent or Agents will not appear at same post office box for 
extended period of time. • 
e. When informant receives information of vital and immedia'te interest, 
he should furnish it as promptly as possible to contacting Agent or 
office by most appropriate means of communication. 
Handling of lead information 
a. All lead information obtained from informant must be run out to 
logical conclusion. . 
b. If there is insufficient information to warrant opening case, tickler 
card should be prepared to follow informant and take other logical 
steps to obtain additional identifying data. Restrict tickler cards 
to information which would warrant i_nvestigation if identity 
established~ If no identification is made after reasonable effort, 
prepare I'.!emorandum for informant's subfile. 
Handling documentary material furnished by informants 
a. Pamphlets and similar documentary material furnished by informa.nts 
should have placed thereon informant's code name. 
b. Informant should affix date he received material. If informant can­
not recall date of receipt, date he furnished material should be 
affixed. 
c. lfo additional markings of any kind, such as initials, date received, 
permanent symbol number of informant, file numbers, indexing symbols, 
etc., should be placed on documentary material. 
d. Receipt of such material should be recorded on form FD-306 or on a 
channelizing memorandum containing all applicable items. See section 
107K for filing instructions .• •
