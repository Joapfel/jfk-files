plots to assassinate Castro; (3) Helms' report to Rusk that CIA was not in-
volved with Af-1/LASH in a Castro assassination plot; and (4) Helms' briefing 
of Pre'Sident Johnson on the 1967 IG Report on alleged CIA assassination plots. 
3. The Covert Action Program Against Cuba in 1964-1965. According to the 
minutes of a Special Group meeting on April 7, 1964, which he chaired, President 
Johnson decided to discontinue the use of CIA-controlled sabotage raids against 
Cuba.* (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, p. _.) A memoran­
dum by McCone indicated that in deciding this question, President Johnson abandoned 
the objective of Castro's overthrow.** 
At the April 7, Special Group meeting, Rusk had emphasized his opposition to 
the use of sabotage raids, stating his belief that they were unproductive, and 
had a "high noise level" that called attention to them. In addition, Rusk stated 
that "he suspects the Cuban exiles who actually conduct the raids of possible 
wishing to leave fingerprints pointing to U.S. involvement in order to increase 
that involvement." (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, page.2.) 
*A memorandt.nn by Bundy on April 7, 1964, listed seven aspects of the covert action 
program which had been in ef feet.. These were: (1) collection of intelligence; 
(2) covert propaganda to encourage low risk forms of active and passive resistance; 
(3) cooperation with other agencies in economic denial; (4) attempts to identify 
and establish contact with potential dissident .elements inside Cuba; (5) indirect 
economic sabotage; (6) CIA-controlled sabotage raiding; and (7) autonomous opera­
tions. (Memorandum for the Record of the Special Group, April 7 , .1964, p. 1-2.) 
**At the April 7, 1964, meeting Rusk and13undy opposed continuation of sabotage 
actions by CIA-controlled assets as "unproductive" and.impractical. McCone dis­
agreed, noting that the covert action program relied on a "well-planned series 
of sabotage efforts". (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, p. 3.) 
In this connection, Bundy noted that since the approval of the current sabotage 
in June 1963 "policymakers .. ~had turned sabotage operations on and off to such 
an extent that (the sabotage program)' simply does not, in the nature of things, 
appear feasible". (Id., p. 2.)
