The CIA refused. The Board then, as an alternative, asked the highest officials of the Agency - - the 
Executive Director and General Counsel - - to certify that CIA had met its obligations under the JFK Act 
and that no records on Oswald or assassination were withheld. The CIA refused. Instead, the CIA 
designated its Director of Information Management to sign CIA 's Declaration of Compliance. In the 
Board's view, CIA 's highest officials should have been willing to certify, under oath, that the Agency has 
complied with all the requirements of the JFK Act. The CIA 's failure to do so raises serious concerns for 
the Board that the CIA has in fact fully complied with the JFK Act."
