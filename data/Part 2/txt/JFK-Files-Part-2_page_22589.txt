JAf.IES McCORD 
. ' I James McCord was the first representative
1
0f the Office 
of Security to have contact with Wiley and was undoubtedly 
the driving force behind the Agency's funding of the Daily 
Worker index. McCord was Wiley's primary case officer tram 
1956 through January 1962 and during this period, guided and 
was more or less responsible for \Viley's direction and con­
trol. 
The nature of McCord's tontacts with Wiley after 1962 
are not exactly known since McCord left SRS in January 1962 
for other positions within the Office of Security. The files 
do, however, contain the following information which indicate 
some contact between McCord and Wiley after 1969. The exact 
nature of these contac-ts is not definitely known, especially 
those i11 May - June 1969; however, the presumption is that 
Wiley at the direction of McCord may have reported on and 
photographed anti-Viet Nam War demonstrations in Washington, 
D. C., d.:.1-:-i~g that pe:ricd. 8.T'~ci za,rP T_fle resul1:s of 11~.s \-..·v.l~ ~v 
McC6rd who retired from C!A on 31 August 1970. 
On 30 May 1969, Cecil Tighe of SRS recorded, "Jim 
McCord notified me today that Wiley would arrive in Washing­
ton, D. C., tonight for a meeting with McCord concerning 
some Mayday Project that has been assigned to Wiley." 
On 5 June 1969, Tighe recorded, "Wiley telephoned 
from New York City on 4 June 1969 to request that I turn 
over to Jim McCord the light meter which we drew from 
Logistics for his use last month in connection with his 
photography work. Wiley said that Jim McCord planned to 
meet him in New York City over the week-end." Tighe then 
called McCord's office and instructed them that •Tighe had 
the meter and it would be available in a package for trans­
mittal to Wiley if someone would come by and pick it up. 
As of June 1969, no one had called or inquired further 
into the matter.
