V. Openness and Secrecy - FOIA 
For more than 190 years, che American public did not have a legal right to gain • 
ac:c:ess to information about its government. nllS Jµl of that changed, however, 
in 1966 when President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA nll6 and thereby altered the 
historical relationship becween the federal government and the public. n117 FOIA 
presumes that government inforl'llation is public information and is implemented by 
',the judicially enforceable requirement that all federal agency records be made 
available prompt:ly upon request, subject only to nine exemptions, which are to 
.r 
be narrowly construed. n11a ,

nllS. The issue of openness. in government has historically been• framed in • j 
terms of t:he right of the government to keep secrets, ra.ther than the right of 
t:he public to have access to governmental records. See Seth P. Kreimer, Sunlight 
Secrets and Scarlet Letters: The Tension Between Privacy and Disclosure in 
Constitutional Law, 140 u. Pa. L. Rev. l (1991). The movement towards great:er 
openness in the post-World war II period has been part of a broader movemenc in 
the twentieth century to hold government accountable for its actions. See id. As 
a result, since the progressive era of the early twentieth century, we have seen 
the institution of public records, open meetings, and •sunshine laws." See id.

nll7. The Act: has come under crit:icism from bot:h advocates of openness and 
P.roponents of secrecy. See, e.g., Carome & Susman, supra note 98, at 2~3 
(criticizing the Act because the cost of implementation outweighs the benefits 
it is suppos.ed to provide) ;. Non-Denial: How Attitudes and Inertia Combine to 
Subvert the Freedom of Information Act, Kiplinger Program Rep. 1-32 (Summer 
1994) (discussing the success of POIA·in providing Americans with a means of 
acquiring information about their government).

Critics of FOIA seldom doubt ice good inteneions, but: they do doubt its 
effectiveness, complaining t:hat t:he cost: of implement:ing it (•19) far 
outweighs its supposed benefit:&. nll9 The argument against FOIA was perhaps best 
summed up by Juscice Antonin Scalia, who described the statute as "the Taj Mahal 
of the Doctrine of unanticipated consequences, the Sistine Chapel of 
Cost-Benefit Analysis ignored.• n120 critics like Justice Scalia charge that 
FOIA harms the government'& and t:he public's legitimate need for secrecy. n121
