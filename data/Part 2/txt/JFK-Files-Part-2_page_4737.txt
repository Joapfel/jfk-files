MR. HALPERN: No. No. The one next to the -- it's on the corner. Big 
building, before they built the Hart Building. Well, I forget. It was the 
guy who came up with that -- from Indiana, I think it was, or Illinois -- but 
anyway, they had taken over the auditorium in that building and they were a 
so-called secure area. They had safes and what have you all over the place 
and they had taken the seats out and what have you. And I was in there, I 
went in there, talking to Schwarz and some of his cohorts, then suddenly out 
of the clear blue sky he says, "Well, let's walk over to the Capitol 
Building. The Committee is going to go into session and they want to talk to 
you." And I said, "You mean just like that?" He said, "Yeah, you got nothing 
to hide, have you?" And I said, "No, I got nothing to hide." He said, "Yeah, 
I was thinking you might as well go and talk to them directly.II So after 
spending a couple of hours with Schwarz and company, I was ushered across the 
street and we walked all the way over to the Capitol Building and went up to 
the fourth floor or whatever it was and .testified that night. I was told to 
stand up, and sworn in, and we went to town. 
INTERVIEWER: And you didn't know that you were going to do that before? Oh 
my. 
MR. HALPERN: I had no chance to talk to a lawyer or anything like that. Not 
that I cared. It didn't bother me. But it was a lousy way to do business, 
and it wasn't according to the rules at the time, because I had the rule book, 
procedures, and what have you and it wasn't what I was supposed to be able to 
do. And they were supposed to give me a notice for that and that kind of 
stuff. But I didn't want t6 stop the proceedings. 
INTERVIEWER: Was it a very long session that you were in? 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, it was all day.
