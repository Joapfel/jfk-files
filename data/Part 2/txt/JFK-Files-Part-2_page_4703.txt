in terms of trying to get the job done and stay within the bounds of the 
• Agency .. ·. 
INTERVIEWER: And if somebody came up for retirJment, and they might need 
some. . . 
MR. HALPERN: I think, we'd try to, well, in the early days when you didn't 
have the bulk of people suddenly coming out, you'd even try to help them find 
a job. Pick up the phone, call friends, connections, what have you. And it 
was done. Now later, when it came into the hundreds, you couldn't do it, 
obviously. An~ then everybody fell by the wayside~ But it was a totally 
different attitude; instilled right away when Schlesinger came along. Some of 
his l~nguage is even being quoted in the newspapers and magazines. I don't 
know if he said the words that way but anyway things like: "I am not 
interested in people, I am interested in the United States taxpayer." Hell, 
we were interested in the taxpayer too, but that didn't come first. Maybe 
that was wrong but at least we didn't think so. Considering the time and 
effort most of us put into that place, I don"t think Uncle Sam was ever on the 
short end of the stick. 
INTERVIEWER: And so someone being separated might not know he was being 
separated unti 1 . 
MR. HALPERN: Un,til it hit him. 
INTERVIEWER: Unti 1 it hit him. 
'MR. HALPERN: Yeah. I remember Colby, for example, taking home with him, 
which he shouldn't have done but he did, stacks of personnel folders to, you 
know, be the great decider.· This guy goes, this guy stays. 
INTERVIEWER: ·so the morale was not very good?
