Harvey was queried on whether the reasons he had given for not 
briefing McCone were actually "reasons.why he should [have been] 
briefed forthwith". Harvey replied: 
Well, Senator Huddleston, it.will be quite 
easy in looking at it now to say, well, I can 
see your argument. 
All I can say to you in answer is at that 
time I didn't feel that it was necessary or 
advisable. I did not make this decision except 
in consultation, and had I been disagreed with, 
that would have been it. And I am not off­
loading this on Richard Helms or attempting to 
at all. It isn't all. that "'easy for me to go 
back this many years and sort of·recast all of 
the reasoning and be sure I am accurate. And 
I don't·also want to evade it by saying, well, 
it seemed like a good idea at the time. But 
actually it did. 
In other wordsi this was not something 
that either Helms or myself felt that at that 
stage there was any point in attempting to 
brief the Director on it until, at least, we 
had a somewhat better handle on it .. 
And I might also add, if I may, .. but as 
far as either one of us knew at that point he. 
might have been or should have been briefed, 
if you want it that way, by either Allen Dulles 
or Richard Bissell. (Harvey, 7/11/75., pp. 67-71) 
The 1967 Report prepared by the Inspector General for 
Helms states that Harvey said: "When he-briefed Helms on 
Roselli, he obtained Helms' approval not to brief the 
Director." (I.G., p. 41)
