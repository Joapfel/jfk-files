Casasin said it was normal to not make a check for a 201 file 
on a person like Oswald, meaning that it was not unusual that he did 
not check for Oswald's 201. He said this was emecially not unusual 
since they had made the decision not to use Oswald. It's possible 
that a colleague of Casasin's might have checked, but Casasin said 
he doesn't recall any such ~heck. 
Casasin said his subordinates in th_e ;3ranch 6. wer~ 1 Balaban, id 
a man named Richard, last name possibly[_Wink.J and(Charres Cox'-;/ who , 
was the liaison with the Technical Supports Divistt>n (i.e., ct>ncealment 
devices). He said deputies in the branch were David Chachavadze (in 
1960 fo·r· three or four months), A.T. Stewart (possibly Averill); Stewarl 
stayed on in the branch and Casasin believe he could be of more help 
in remebering details about the branch; also, Becky Balaban, who is 
married' to Rudolf Balaban. 
Casasin said that the purpose of a 201 is to indicate that a ' 
request had been made for provisional operational approval. He said 
the file would indicate operational interest and would then refer one 
to the specific office with the interest in the individual. He said 
he doesn't know tha-t actual criteria for opening 20l's. He said also ' 
that after initial interest was shown in an individual by the opening 
of a 201, the number might remain with the individual without the 
persen actually being developed as an asset. 
Casasin mentioned that agency people were assigned to the military~ 
base at Atsugi. , 
Casasin referred agin to the "Harvey Story" reference in his memo. 
He sated that "Whatever I meant by Harvey had nothing to do with him 
(Oswald) . " 
I showed Casasin the Personality (201) File Request form from 
Oswald's 201 file. He said he had never seen it before and did not know 
there actually existed a 201 file on Oswald. Referring to the source 
of the form, CI/SIG, Casasin said Ci stood for Counterintelligence. 
He said he thought SIG stood for Signal Intelligence, but he was not 
sure. He said that notation would mean that NSA or the military had 
picked up Oswald's name in some type of transmission. He asked if Oswald 
had access to any type of radio transmissions. He said he thought the ' 
201 section of the Registry Office could answer questions about the 
notations on the form.
