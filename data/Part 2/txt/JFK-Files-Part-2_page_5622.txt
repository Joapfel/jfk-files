The LI CALLA observation post in the back is the cl~fC::t 
houses ~rdering the Embassy property - all five are owned

cover th~ con_versations were unsuccessful. From one of the 
front. OP s, rad10 contact is maintained with the LIEMBa 
surveillance team for signalling when a particular Soviet s~ 
lance target leaves the Embassy, his route and other data. Photos 
are regu~~ly taken from all the OP's of Soviets and their families 
and all visitors to the Embassy. When visitors use vehicles photo­
graphs are taken or their licence plates for tracing. ~ionaUy 
the LICALLA OP JS used for electronic monitoring, since it is 
close to t~e Embassy, but so far attempts to pick up radiations 
~~m Soviet Cryptographic equipment have been unsuccess. 
In addition to the LlEMBRACE survei1Jance team ~veraJ other 
support operations include coverage of the Soviets: Through the 
cS!Nv~Y:<>peration, Soviet telephones~ constantly monitored, 
and through the LIFIRE travel-control operation photographs of 
travel documen~ ~ obtained aJong with data on arrivals and

revea~ requ~ts for !"f exica.n visas by Soviet officials, including 
the d1pJomatic counezs. In addition, NSA is also monitoring 
several communications Sl'Stems involving 'burst' transmissions

:as been on the prowl for a Jover - or so he _said t~ LICO~L-1 -
die station decided to recruit a young MCXJcan girl as bait; An

Although promiscuity amon1 Soviets is not ab?o"!1al, rela~on­
ships with local girls are forbidden. Eventually 1t wdl be d~ded 
whether to try blackmail against Silnikov or to provoke disruP­
tion by sending tapes and ph~tos to the Embassy if the blackmail 
is refused. . 
LIOVAL-lt is not as interesting a case but is more important. 
The agent is an American who teaches English in Mexico Oty 
and is an ardent fisherman. Through fishing he became acquain­
led with Pavel Yatskov, the Soviet Consul and a kno~ senior 
IGB officer - possibly the Mexico aty rezldent (Ko a chief). Ya~­
kov and the agent spend one or two week-ends per month off ID 
the mountains fishing and have developed a very close friendship.
