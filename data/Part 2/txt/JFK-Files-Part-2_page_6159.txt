The value of confidential FBI and CIA sources to the Warren Commission's 
work is underscored by the documents released thus far by the Board. For 
example, Exhibit Four is a letter dated June 17, 1964 frc;,m FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover co J. Lee Rankin, then General Counsel·to the Warren Commission. nl76 The 
letter details what the .FBI knew about Fidel Castro's assessment of the 
assassination. nl77 Originally classified as nTop Secret," this document _ 
indicates that the united States had a source sufficiently close to Castro to 
gauge the Cuban leader's evaluation of Oswald and the circumstances surrounding 
hi·s visit to the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. nl 78 The FBI wished· to redact 
much of this material~ The FBI was concerned that Castro's tests were at 
variance with the PBI's test results. The Board decided that the information 
contained in the letter was critical to the assassinatio~ story; ,n179 therefore, 
. the entire document was made available to the American public, illuminating:"..t:]le,, 
thinking of Castro and che credibility of the American intelligence communify to j 
assess the cuban leader. •·

In matters of informants and agents, the JPK statute directs the agencies to 
provide the Board wich •clear and convincing evidencen that disclosure will 
result in harm, eieher co an individual or to current operations. nl80 If the 
FBI, for example, .is unable .co find a former informant. and thus does not know 
whe~her she is alive or dead, what i's tpe Board's duty?The Board faces the 
dilemma of either erring on the side of protecting the individual's identity, 
even though there is no evidence that the person is alive and living.under a 
current threat, or enriching the histo~ical record by revealing the individual's 
identity while running the risk of causing'unnecessary harm.

There is also the related.question of how to creat the names of persons 
• described in the reports of'informants as being engaged in·some illicit conduct 
when there is nc> proof, ocher. than the informant's word~ to support the 
accusa~ion. Is that individual owed a right [•29) co know that he or she was 
so identified, or is it Che Board's duty to redact'the person's name? W~uld 
disclo~ing false information be more damaging than retaining it in government
