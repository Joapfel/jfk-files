Mr. Baron. Would this kind ot dispatch have been 
written by the Chief of Staff D without consultation with the 
Chief of the African Division? 
Mr. Tweedy. He did consult, that is to eay, he wrote

from this -- you eee there_iB -also ~.rofe~ence here. I don't 
know what the reference is about. But I gather that Dakar is 
brought into this activity because they wanted to act in a 
support capacitY to this headquarters activity. 
Mr. Baron. You don't hnvc any recollection of a mission 
in Dakar Senegal about this time that headquarters was con­
cerned with? 
Mr. Tweedy. No, I surely don't. On the contrary.
