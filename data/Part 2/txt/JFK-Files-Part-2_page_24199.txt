income producing securities. At the time the Agency 
withdrew its support, the assets of the entity 
were given td its witting Board of Directors with 
the understanding that approximately 60% of the 
portfolio of investments would be retained ·by the 
organization to sustain its continued operation 
without Agency support, and 40% of the proceeds 
of the portfolio would be immediately granted to 
other organizations and activities which fostered 
the objectives of the QKOPERA project. 
This small proprietary provided cover for one 
individual overseas. In 1972, the employee 
resigned and expressed a desire to continue the 
business without Agency support. Accordingly, 
the meager assets of the entity were sold to 
the resigned employee. Payment for the entity 
took the form of offset against funds due the 
employee on separation, lump sum leave payment, 
return travel, etc: The Agency has had no further 
interest in the entity. 
This proprietary travel Agency provided cover for 
an Agency employee overseas. When the employee 
was reassigned in 1966, all assets·were converted 
to cash and turned back to the Agency. Neverthe­
less, an indigenous employee of·the entity~ and 
a contact of the Agency Station in the country 
involved, was allowed to take over the name and 
clientele and continue the business. No commit­
ments or agreements were made for continued 
use of the business, and no support was sub­
sequently provid_ed or sought from the business. 
This proprietary, which produced economic and 
sociological reports in support of Cu~an opera­
tions, was dissolved in 1973 and its assets 
turned over to another proprietary, SLIGO. SLIGO 
was subsequently dissolved in 1975 (see list of 
dissolved entities.)
