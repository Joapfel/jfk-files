INTELLIGENCE THAT A LOW-RANKING.AUSTRIAN DIPLOMAT SERVING AS THEIR 
INFORMANT.IN BUDAPEST HAD. ALSO BEEN RECRUITED BY US AND WAS REPORTI 
NG. TO US. I REFUSED TO CARRY.OUT THIS ORDER AND OFFERED MY 
RESIGNATION.. TO ME; IT. WAS DISHONORABLE TO. ·BETRAY A. YOUNG AGENT WHO 
HAD ACCEPTED ··ouR •RECRUITMENT·ANI>·.·PUT·.FAITH IN OUR PROMISE OF 
SECRECY. .TO .MY MIND AN AGENCY WITHOUT PRINCIPLES CANNOT SURVIVE AND 
INDEED SHOULD NOT SURVIVE. TOM KAllAMISSINIS, PERHAPS ONE OF THE 
LAST HONORABLE MEN TO SERVE WITH US IN HIGH PO$ITION, FIRED A STRONG 
CABLE BACK AND THE SHAMEFUL ORDER WAS RETRACTED. 
9. I HAVE INVESTED ABOUT. $50,000 IN MY APARTMENT, IN KEY MONEY AND 
IMPROVEMENTS. IF I LEAVE, I WILL LOSE ALL OR MOST OF THIS. OUR 
LAS~ MOVE TO·VIENNA COST ME ABOUT $15,000 IN SEA FREIGHT AND 
INSURANCE. I WILL NEVER,GET ON MY KNEES AND ASK TO BE MADE WHOLE IF 
YOU EXPOSE. ME, BUT I MAY REPORT TO'THE COURTS .. I AM A RETIRED 
MEMBER OF THE· VIRGINIA BAR. • • 
iO. LET ME REGALE YOU WITH AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE HISTORIANS I 
MINDLESS DRIVE .TO KNOW EVERYTHING CAN LEAD TO A PROUD COUNTRY'S 
DISGRACING ITSELF. DURING WWII WHEN WE WERE INTERROGATING GERMAN 
POW'S,·WE PROMIS~D THEM NO ONE WOULD EVER LEARN THEY HAD "SPILLED 
THEIR GUTS,"·AND WE ALL BELIEVED WE WERE BEING HONEST. BUT ALMOST 
25 YEARS AFTER WWII THE BRITISH DECLASSIFIED ALL THE ADI(K) REPORTS 
(THAT'S WHAT TIIEY WERE CALLED, AND EVEN THE "ROOM CONVERSATIONS," 
~SCRIPTS OF THE CONVERSATIONS POWS HAD IN THEIR ROOMS, EVEN 
INCLUDING THE EXTREMELY VALUABLE SPEECHES MADE BY HIGH-RANKING 
LUFTWAFFE OFFICERS TO THEIR HIGH-RANKING FELLOW POW'S AT 
"COCKFOSTERS" MANSION. NEWCOMERS WERE VISITED BY THE OLD HANDS FOR 
A MONTH TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T STOOL PIGEONS, BEFORE THEY WERE 
GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON SOME. 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WAR. THE EXCELLENT BRITISH MIKES PICKED IT 
ALL UP. 
IN RECENT YEARS, AT LEAST ONE.LUFTWAFFE VETERAN ASSOCIATION, 
THAT OF J.G.2, THE RICHTHOFEN GESCHWADER, SENT PEOPLE. TO LONDON TO 
GET COPIES OF THE INTERROGATION REPORTS OF THEIR PILOTS. THEY DID 
IT CHRONOLOGICALLY AND WERE SO SHOCKED AT THE VAST AMOUNT OF VITAL 
DATA REVEALED BY THEIR BUDDIES.THAT, IN ACUTE REVULSION, THEY 
STOPPED LOOKING. I ASSUMED THEN THAT "EVERYONE" HAD "TALKED," WHICH 
IS TRUE. 
11. I AM 75 YEARS OLD PARTLY PARALYZED ON MY LEFT SIDE FROM A . 
STROKE IN DEC. 1993. I WAS NEARLY FULLY REHABILITATED WHEN, IN MAY 
1994, I WAS HIT BY CONSTANT MUSCLE SPASMS ALL UP AND DOWN MY LEFT 
SIDE .. THIS RATHE:R RARE CONDITION, BASICALLY A SUDDEN SUPER-HUMAN 
TIGHTENING ()F ALL THE MUS.CLES, WITH AFTER EFFECTS LASTING UNTIL THE 
NEXT SPASM, HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO STAND UP, 
WALK, OR EVEN SIT UP FOR VERY LONG. IN A FEW DAYS, WHEN ALL THE 
MANY MEDICINES ARE HERE, WILL BEGIN A 20-WEEK HOMEOPATHIC CURE FOR 
THE SPASMS UNDER' DR. SCHRAMM, A LEADING SPECIALIST HERE. I CAN'T 
VERY WELL LEAVE FOR 20 WEEKS. 
YOU WILL BE.CONTACTED MOMENTARILY BY ONE OF MY ATTORNEYS. I 
WILL ALSO BE IN TOUCH WITH MY CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS.
