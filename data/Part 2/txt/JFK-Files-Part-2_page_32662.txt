Soviet bloc advisory personnel were then in Cuba. 
By the beginning of 1962, the Cuban Air Force had benefitted by the 
acquisition of MIG aircraft and the return of a number of people trained in 
bloc countries. It had some 40 MIG 15 1s, 17's and 19 1s as well as about 40

the amount of heavy and more complicated weapons introduced into Cuba at this 
time was not more than ample to supply the needs of the Cuban forces as then 
constituted.

refugees, exiles, and other human sources. 
For sometime prior to 1962, U-2 aircraft operated by the Central Intelli­
gence Agency flew one mission a month at high altitudes over the Island of 
Cuba itself for reconnaissance purposes. Commencing in early;l962, two flights
