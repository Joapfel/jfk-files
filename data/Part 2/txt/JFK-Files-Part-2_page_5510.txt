the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved. 
DCID 1/10-1. 
7. (U) National Security Considerations: The importance of 
such coordination with foreign governments prior to the release 
of their information cannot be overemphasized. Should CIA, or 
for that matter any (USG) agency fail to coordinate where 
required, not only would it be a violation of the aforementioned 
E.O. and directives, but it would chill relationships it has 
developed with foreign services over the years. If such lack of 
coordination became known, foreign services would hesitate to 
share crucial intelligence information with CIA if they believed 
it would be released, in spite of any agreements or U.S. laws to 
the contrary, without their consent. Furthermore, the U.S. could 
not expect foreign services to safeguard U.S. government 
information that it shares with its liaison partners in order to 
pursue authorized intelligence and foreign policy objectives. 
8. (S) According to its legal obligations described herein, 
CIA coordinates the dissemination and/or release of foreign 
government information. Its.obligation to do so is similar to 
its obligation to coordinate declassification efforts with 
another USG agency should the CIA possess any of that agency's 
documents. For example, CIA could not declassify and release to 
the public FBI information located in CIA files without 
coordinating with that agency. Similarly, CIA has no authority 
to unilaterally declassify foreign government documents or • 
information in its files.

Tat issue here are letters from the Australian service ( 104._10009-
10224, 104-10012..:.10080), CIA is legally obligated by E.O. and 
agreement with the Australians to seek the consent of .the 
Australians prior to their release, even in redacted form. The 
\issue of coordinating with the Australian service is a timely 
one. In most cases, CIA would not have an objection to going to 
!
the foreign government and seeking their consent for declas­
sification. However, several events that have occurred in the • 
\1ast few months depict just how seriously Australia considers any 
jindication that the U.S. is unable to protect from release their 
1classified information. Based on the incident.s described 
below, it is CIA's position that even asking the Australians for' 
bonsent to release would threaten the current relationship. 
\· 
Within the last year, a demarche was made by the Australian 
government expressing strong concern that U.S. declas­
sification legislation expressly spell out that no information 
provided to the USG by the Australian service be declassified 
without its permissio~. A copy of thi,s demarche is provided 
for the Board's review. (See attached.) It is worth noting
