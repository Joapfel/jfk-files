agency or it might come about because of a standard 
operating p~ocedur~; 
For·example, we had an agre~ment with the 
FBI that we would follow up leads on any American 
citizen in Mexico City who appeared around the 
Soviet Embassies, and ·so on, -br anybody who was 
down there appearing to defect, which we might 
learn through our telephone intercepts. 
We. could_just as well have sent this cable 
out wi~hout Mr. Karmessines rel~asing it. I do 
not know why we did it. 
Q: Iri fact, you pcinted to something which I was 
goirlg to ask ycu about. I ~~s ~ondering ~hy 
soinebody as hi~h up in the Agency as Mr. Kara­
messines was tte rele~sing offi~er. • 
A: I would have bEen because of the U.S. citizen 
aspect, becausE so many -other U.S. Government 
agencies were ~nvolved, .State Department, FBI 
and the Navy. I suppose :one ·of these things 
is the Navy. (1ne of them could be the Immigra­
tion and .Natur,,lization Service. 
Q: Let me attempt to summarize ~gain. 'Karamessines 
would be respo11sible for signing off ·on this 
because operat· anal action pertaining to an 
American was ti, ken?· 
A: -Yes. 
Q: Either pursuan'. to the req~est of another go­
vernment agenc_1 or pursuant to some standard 
operati.ng proc,~dure of the Agency itself. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Any other reas)n that you can think of? 
A: No ..
