VIII. MISCELLANEOUS 
In a December 21, 1972 edition of the "Detroit 
Free Press", a Detroit daily newspaper, an article appeared 
entitled "Black Panthers Charge Police with Harassment". 
LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader, charged the Detroit Police 
Department with harassing Panthers while they were selling 
the Party newspaper at the corner of State and Woodward 
in Detroit. DARDEN charged that Party members had been 
ticketed more than 25 times in the past year for loitering 
and interfering with pedestrian· traffic. DARDEN went on 
to state that members of ihe Party are being harassed 
because they are black. DARDEN stated that the police 
are attempting to stop the selling of the Party newspaper 
because the BPP is involved in various programs to 
serve the people of the community. 
DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973, that the BPP's 
lease on 2228 Bewick expires on September 15, 1973, and 
that the Panthers must vacate the premises on or before 
that date. Source further advised that LONNIE DARDEN 
is currently seeking suitable office space for the P,arty's 
headquarters.
