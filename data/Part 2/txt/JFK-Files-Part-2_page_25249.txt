OCCURRENCE: 
DATES: CATEGORIES: 
In a Presidential ~eting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONJ;:, HELMS, AND COLBY 
in.attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested 
that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHARI', and DAVID SJVIITH act as a 
corrmittee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that SMITH should 
not be involved :in such a policy making function, although he would be in a position to 
provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHARI' as well as carry out their instructions 
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not 
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General 
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy evidence. The OCI stated his view 
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might 
only be solved by a second or third coup.
