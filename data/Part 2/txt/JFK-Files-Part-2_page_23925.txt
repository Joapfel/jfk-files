"presumably would be used against key members of the Trujillo 
regime." The memorandum recommended that the arms be provided,

and therefore U.S. relations with the opposition should be as 
close as possible. "Providing the arms as requested would

Specifically, the recommendation was to deliver to dissidents 
in the Dominican Republic 12 sterile* ri:':les with teles-
copic sights, together with 500 rounds of ammunition. 
Paragraph 4 of the memorandum stated: 
"4. Approval for delivery of these arms has 
been given by Assistant Secretary of State 
Roy Rubottom, who requests that the arms be 
placed in hands of the opposition at the earliest 
possible moment." (Id.) 
Gomez's recor:tmendation was concurred in by Richard 
Helms, as Acting DDP, ~nd approved by General Cabell, 
(I.G. Report, p. 26). 
The kind of arms approved, sterile rifles witi 
telescopi<; sights-; together with the- statement that they would 
be presumably used against key members of the Trujillo regime 
clearly indicat:_ed the "targeted use" for which the weapons were 
intended. (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 77).
