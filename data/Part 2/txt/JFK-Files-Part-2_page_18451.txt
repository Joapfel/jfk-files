f

tain purposes without a·prior judicial warrant. 
This power has been exercised by succeeding 
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit 
directive of the President. The Supreme Court 
has ruled t~at this power does not extend to 
purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope 
of the Attorney General's authority remains un­
definedbY the Supreme Court.
