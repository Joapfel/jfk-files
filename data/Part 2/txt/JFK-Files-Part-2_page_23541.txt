sabotai:;e operations are rn.ore difficult a1~c.l inevitably more costly in 
terms of loss of 1nen. Nevertheless, it lould be possible, otarting

in the near future, to attempt lirnited sa~otage with a view to detcnnining

might be developed. 
A capability also exists for types of

under-v.ater sabotage of shipµing and srn.Jll raider operations. Under

a very limited scale and, in all likelihood,/ raider operations should not

be attempted until more information rega1rding feasibility has been 
obtained. 
The Agency also has a s1nall air arrn including some transport 
aircraft (C-54 and C-46 types) plus attack bomber aircraft (B-26). 
Although it is not absolutely certain, thc~c is reason to suppose that 
I 
Cuban crews also are available fo_r operafional flights. At the moment, 
I 
air operations should be substantially eliijiinated with the possible

survive without such support. Even with respect to such operations,

however, it should be retn.ernbered that tne percentage of successful

to justify the risk. B-26 strikes could, o( cours_e, be flown against
