eport or: Kent, William M. 
Section D (continued) 
healthy skepticism enables him to contribute materially to the 
smooth, still on-going, transition from the old to the new way. 
In this context he has made invaluable suggestions on how we 
shall proceed in order to improve the operational efficacy of 
a NOC officer, as well as to ease the burdens imposed on the 
private life of a NOC officer. 
3. Worthy of special note is the systematic and orderly fashion 
in which he tackled each new problem. These attributes re~ulted 
in his solving many of the thorny personnel problems which have 
confronted us of late. Mr. Kent's industriousness -- on the 
avP,rage he spends 10 hours a day in the office -- together with 
his legendary meticulousness have enabled him to set up an 
effective referral sy~tem through which we control the flow­
through of both traditional and new NOC officers -- a most 
difficult and at times frustrating task. 
4. As a deputy and acting branch chief he has been a firm 
and stern supervisor who exacts precision and perfection from 
his subordinates. The firmness and sterness, however, are 
tempered by a judicious applicaticn of human understanding 
or compa~sion in cases of "hard-to-place" NOC officers. His 
advice in solving many of these cases to the satisfaction of 
both the officer and the operational component involved was 
most welcome. 
5. In sum, Mr. Kent has been a most effective deputy. As 
noted above, he has many outstanding traits and his overall 
performance has been a solid strong.
