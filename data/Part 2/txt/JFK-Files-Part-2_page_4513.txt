1. AMLILAC/33 obtained the following information f.rom 
IDEN A and IDEN B, former members of the AMWORLD Group. The 
date of the information is mid-july 1964. 
' a. IDEN A was an instructor in a commando section 
headed by IDEN C, in a camp located near IDEN D. He was 
given the job of instruction in the AR-15 and AR-10 rifles. 
Since no manuals were available he had to use the book, 
Small Arms of the World. The men in IDEN C's command are 
unhappy because they do not trust the planning judgemertt of 
, IDEN C. The second in command, IDEN E, is so hated by the 
men that when IDEN Cleaves the camp he has to take IDEN E 
with him. 
b. The Intelligence 1 Chief of AMWORLD is IDEN F. He 
. maintains that the prerequis-,te for men in the INTEL section 
is personal loyalty to AMBID Y/1. At one time a PBPRIMER, 
who works with AMBIDDY/1, pr sented IDEN F with a list of 
men for duty in the Intel section. IDEN F accepted the 
list and the men but after the PBPRIMER left he transferred 
the men to other sections. Recently IDEN F arrested a man 
in the Group and charged him as a spy for AMBANG/1. The 
man was physically beaten and jailed. Later IDEN F admitted 
he made a mistake, released the man, gave him several hundred 
dollars and told him to forget the incident.
