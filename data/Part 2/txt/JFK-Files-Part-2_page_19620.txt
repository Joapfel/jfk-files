Initially called the ''!,.ction Factj on," Weatherman 
; earn<:! into being immE'::diatcly Lefore the June, 1969, Students 
~or a !Jemocratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC). 
At this r;c Weatherman wnn all three national officer positions 
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well. 
Subsequently, they took over the SOS National Office (NO) 
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and nat~onal 
records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969, 
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally 
from June, 1969, until its 1:0 closed in February, 1970. At 
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS . 
'fhe term Weatherman emerged from an ideological 
paper prepared by its l~aders entitled "You Don't Need a 
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" {"New Left 
Notes" June 18, 1969). This staternent·outlined the basic 
stance of Weatherman: narxist-L{~ninist. in content but with 
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about 
revolution in the United States. '1';1is 1)osturc> v.:as cornolemented 
with an international identification to· the Cuban revoiution 
and CASTRO's statement that the <luty of a revolutionary is 
to make revolution. 
During October, 1969, WeatherMan riots in 
Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for n~ob a·ction 
and related charges. A program of ar~Qd struggle was 
finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein 
terrorist tactics and political assassination were 
contempla te<l. The basic strength of h'eatherrnan was then 
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically 
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest. 
As its rhetoric of violence escalntec1, Weatherman 
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground 
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization 
would be submergedi "aff1.nity groups
11 
of three - five members 
would function independently. In FeLruary, 1970, Weatherman 
leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with 
police and military installations as primary targets.
