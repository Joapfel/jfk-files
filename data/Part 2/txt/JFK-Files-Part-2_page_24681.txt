Alter Ego 
After Justin O'Donnell arrived in .the Congo, he formu­
lated a plan for "neutralizing" Lumumba by drawing him away from 
the custody of the UN force. which was guarding his· residence:· 
O'Donnell: [W]hat I .want~d to do ~as to 
get him out, to trick llim out,·· if I could, • 
and then turn him over . . . to the legal • 
authorities and.let him stand trial.· Be­
cause he had atrocity attributed to him for 
which he could very well stand trial. 
Q: And for ·which he • could very wel 1 have 
received capital punishment? 
O'Donnell: Yes. An.d I am not opposed to 
capital punishment. • (0 'Donnell, 9 / 11/ 7 5, 
pp. 20-21.) * 
To implement his plan, O'Donnell made arrangements.to rent "an ob­
servation post over the palace in which L.umumba was safely ensconced" 
·k According to an earlier report from the Chief of Station, it 
was the view of the Special Representative of the Secretary General 
of the United Nations that arrest by Congolese authorities was "JUST 
.A TRICK TO ASSASSIUATE LUMUMBA" (CIA Cable Leap Chief 
of Station to Director, 10/11/60). The Chief of Station proceeded 
to reconrrnend Lumumba's arrest in the same cable: 
STATION HAS CONSISTENTLY URGED [CONGOLESE] LEADERS 
ARREST LUMIB1BA IN BELIEF LUMUMBA WILL CONTINUE BE 
THREAT TO STABILITY CONGO UNTIL REMOVED FROM 
SCENE (CIA Cable, 10/11/60).
