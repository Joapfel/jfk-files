SECRET SF.t~SITIVE 
derived therefrom are misleading with regard to the events 
in Portugal, Vietnam and other areas where we are in com­
petition with the Soviets and the Bloc. A more accurate 
picture could be obtained if the structure of the 
' 
Intelligence Community, in its processing bf information, 
were less concerned with public or overt data regarding 
the Soviet Bloc intentions, such as the reporting of 
Ambassadors and other representatives, and instead give 
full faith and credit to secret information from bona fide 
sources who are or were within the Soviet Bloc system and 
whose warnings regarding disinformation have been uni­
versally ignored. To repeat, it is the opinion of these 
sources that the bulk of information available to the 
West through Soviet Bloc contacts, regarding the strategy 
and aims of the Eastern Bloc, is, on the whole, spurious 
and represents little more than coordinated handouts which 
advance the interests of Soviet Bloc strategic disinformation 
at many levels of communications. 
The remainder of this report represents the status, as 
of March 1975, of U.S. counterintelligence, primarily within 
the CIA, but also, as the perspective requires, at the na­
tional level. The discussion consists of fou·r parts; 
The authority under which CIA conducts 
counterintelligence activities. 
The n~ture of those activities.
