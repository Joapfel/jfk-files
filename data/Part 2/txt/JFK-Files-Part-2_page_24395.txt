We have divided the facts with respect to Cuba into three 
broad sections. 
The first discusses the plots against Fidel Castro's life 
without attempting to confront the question of authorization. 
The second deals with the evidence concerning whether or not 
the successive Directors of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles and John 
McCone, authorized or knew about the various plots. (Although we have 
organizationally divided the evidence relating to the DCI's from the 
proof relating to other high administration officials, it is important 
to remember that the Director of Central Intelligence is the principal 
advisor to the President on intelligence matters, a member of major 
administrative policy-making councils as well as head of the Central 
Intelligence Agency.) 
The third section covers the evidence concerning whether or 
not other high officials--including the various.Presidents--authorized 
or knew about the plots. This section also considers the evidence relating 
to whether or not the CIA officials who were involved with the plots believed 
them to be consistent with the general policy objectives -of the various 
( 
administrations even if they had no personal knowledge as to whether the 
plots were or were not specifically authorized by higher authority.
