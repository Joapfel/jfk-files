Q And those were run out of the United States? 
A Oh, yes. 
Q Can you think of anything, any other type of para-
military activity other than maritime operations. 
A No. I really can't, no. 
Q Am I correct'that those operations were manned 
by CIA contract employees? 
A Right. 
Q Which would include Cuban refugees. 
A Right. 
Q. And some-·CIA officers? 
A Right. 
Q Any other branches of the services, Armed Services, 
involved? This, of· course, is posted Bay of Pigs. 
A Yes. No, not to my knowledge. You have got to rememb r 
that probably down at our Domestic Training Station we 
probably have people on:detail from other -- from the military 
branches in the Government, but other than that I don'. t think 
that -- of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also 
had people detailed into the Agency. 
Q Now, the training of persons involved in maritime 
operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the 
United States and in part outside of the United States. Is 
that correct?
