I am very pleased to appear before you today to report on our progress in implementing 
' 
the recently established system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying 
national security information. On April 17, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 
12958, entitled "Classified National Security Information. a This Order took effect on 
October 14, 1995, only two .and one-half years ago. While still in its early stages of 
implementation, the Order clearly attempts to strike an ijppropriate balance.

implementation of the security programs under Executive Order 12958, •classified National Security 
Information,• and Executive Order 12829, "National Industrial Security Program.• ISOO is also 
responsible for reporting annually to the President on the status of those programs. Created in 1978, 
ISOO became a component of the National Archives and Records Administration in November 1995. In 
addition to reporting to the Archivist of the United States, the Director of ISOO receives policy guidance 
from the National Security Council. 
Among its functions, ISOO: (1) develops implementing directives and instructions; (2) maintains liaison 
with all agencies that create or handle classified information; (3) inspects agency programs and reviews 
their classified records; (4) receives and responds to public complaints, appeals and suggestions;

classification program, including data about its costs; (6) serves as a spokesperson for information about 
the security classification program; (7) provides program and administrative support for the lnteragency 
Security Classification Appeals Panel and the Information Security Policy Advisory Council; and
