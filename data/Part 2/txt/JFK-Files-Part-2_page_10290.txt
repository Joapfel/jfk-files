Sometime in 1972, a representative·of the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Adr.linistration (LE . .\..\)-r·equested 
that the Agency give consideration to our publjshing, at 
. hl LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volur.1e. It 
_ ~ was the 'inte:nt of'. LE.AA to make broac-scale distribution

41':(.Z to Police Departments t.hroughout the country. The D.irector 
'T'-. of Security and I consulted on this ma ttcr and jointly 
• dcterr:1ined th:it the LEAA request should not be-honored be­
cause[the Agenc.i)should not put its elf in the position of . 
publishing law enforcement material for general and tin-• 
classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print­
i~g facili tie's. 
b. On S January 1~71, the Director of Security re­
quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven·motor 
vehicles for use in connection with a special support 
operation which would last approxinately 3 months. The 
Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memo­
randum of 5. January 1971, that "This support .activity has 
been undertaken at the spe~ific instruction of the Director 
• and has his personal approval. 11 The r_eques t was approved. 
c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has 
requisitioned· from this Office a considerable aoaunt of 
materiel which ~e unde~stand w~s to be given or loaned by 
them to local Police Departments. In certai~ cases some 
of this materiel "-·as issued fromUgency stocki} and·, in 
other cases, dirett prbcurement of ·the ~ateriel was made 
· by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete
