SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE 
Expulsion of Jaffe from Sovj_et Union 
1 
Jaffe advised that after receiving the 
"exclusive" from "Slava" concerning the Khrushchev- ouster, 
he continued to meet with "Slava" non and off" until 
Jaffe was expell~d from the Soviet Union in October, 1965. 
In explaining the expulsion, J"affe said that without 
advising him, John Scali of the American Broadcasting 
Company (ABC) wrote a story which Jaffe thinks was a "trial 
\baloontt, intimating that Leonid Brezhnev and Al0ksei Kosygin 
were about to be ousted. Jaffe got a call from ABC in New 
I
;· York asking what he thou.ght about Scali' s story. Jaffe stated 
he did not believe the story was true and he asked 11Slava" for 
his opinion. "Slava" indicated that although he would like 
to see it happen, he did not believe it would occm.~ "because 
they were too new" as Soviet Heads of State. Jaffe continued: 
"The next morning,_;Henr_y-4~Iiu:o called· me, asking why I had :ff~--·· 
written such a s~ory.n Jaffe denied knowing anything about it~ 
He explained that it was later that he learned that the story I 
l 
i bad been writte'n by John Scali. . 0 F •r-2 has identified Shapiro 
and his wife ,~yudmyp..- N~ko.layevn~ . Sh.iPi.ro, as_,I~G,B_ggep1.~...!J

At the time Scali' s stor-y broke, Jaffe· and his 
wife were in the.process of packing in preparation for their 
departure from Russia for· Hong Kong and Jaffe' s ABC successor·· 
in Moscow already had been named. The first indication Jaffe 
.received o~_gj.s expulsion was a call from ABC in New York asking 
what Jaffe h,d 'done to cause the Soviets to recall the visa for 
Jaffe' s sucessor. Jaffe said he ·1~e-plieaf "Did you ever think 
:if."c·oui~ be John Scali' s story?" • -
Later Jaffe was caliea into the Soviet Foreign 
Office and told he had to leave the Soviet Union in ten days 
and that the ABC office in Moscow was being closed. Jaffe 
said he inquired: "Are you holding this (story) against me?u 
Jaffe was told that the Soviets were not, and that "we know 
exactly what you said about us for four years." Jaffe indicated 
this was the first indication he had that the Soviets had tech­
nical coverag.e __ on .. him. Jaffe said he did not want to leave the 
Soviet Union unde~_these conditions .. He said the Soviets told 
him, "We are not holding thi~ against you but it has to be." 
Jaffe was told not to worry about the deadline for his departl1re 
and that he could get additional time. Jaffe also was told he 
would be able to return to Russia. He continued: "After that, 
~--evei•.yth:hig-went smoothly. They only opened one box a.t tha Customs 
~-Office. No problems at all. I -~-o~'t- recall that I saw Slava 
againu (after his expulsion was announced).
