~ \ He indicated he could live with opening the stations for 
I short windows if important to story, but also said it 
I created a problem about protecting other activities in that 
\ window

, projects

appeal (governments currently under fire for cooperation 
with US/very sensitive operation under way

·Northern Europe -- Bill responded with Western Europe/ said 
southern Europe for Rome, Madrid etc. "ok" 
London: dO' not want to acknowledge but could live with 
Australia - very sensitive 
Berlin - is open in 1955; 1963 (?) Bill may have been having 
second thoughts about previous statement "to release", but I 
think it still stands -- there was a discussion of why 
Berlin important to story.

South American stations 
Bill did not have specific on other stations put made a 
couple of comments 
Bonn and Hague - no problem
