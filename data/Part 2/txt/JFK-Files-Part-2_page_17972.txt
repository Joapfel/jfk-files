RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES; 
lJ).;C~~bJ,.SASSOCIATE 
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT 
furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been 
prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's 
needs. He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was 
our feeling that we should not furnish the raw material but 
summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and 
if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath 
and attest to the correctness of the summaries. Wilderotter 
said that this was a matter which he would afford further 
consideration. 
As during the conference with Buchen and Hills, 
it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter 
that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught 
by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way 
might be considered questionable. The White House is making 
every effort possible _to become cognizant of any such situation 
prior to the Committee hearings. 
Classified "T~p Secret" to protect highly sensitive 
investigative techniquelJ:' and matters relating to foreign 
relations. 
ACTION: 
For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter 
or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.
