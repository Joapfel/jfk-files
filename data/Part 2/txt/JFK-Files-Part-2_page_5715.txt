David G. Marwell 
Harrelson directly. As usual, they will provide you with 
the specific information you need as quickly as possible to 
continue to record CIA's compliance with the JPX Act. 
As to your request for a complete description of the 
steps en has taken to respond to specific requests, ~ 
understand that there are several outstanding requests. HRG 
has assured me that these requests have been discussed with 
your staff and respon•es will be provided to you as quickly 
as possible. Given the number and breadth of the requests 
that are being made by the Review Board and the limited 
staff resources ava~labJe to CIA to process such requests, I 
ask that the Review·sda:t'd:contin~e co prioritize all its 
requests for information or·· documents.; • With the Review 
Board's priorities established in chis way, the Agency can 
ilmnediately work on those requests that are most important 
to the Review Board. Of course, as C:IA responds to these 
requests, HRG will provide any information the Review Board 
needs as to how the searches were conducted. :r believe that 
this method will best meet the needs of the Review Board and 
will allocate CIA's limited resources in the most efficient 
manner possible. 
Finally, as to your requests to interview CIA officials 
responsible for this Agency's compliance with the JFX Act, 
Mr. Pereira has always been available to the Review Board 
for informal discussions as well as for giving sworn­
testimony including depositions. CIA has never objected to 
the Review Board deposing or interviewing informally any of 
its current or former employees and has, in fact, 
facilitated such interviews. You will also recall that, on 
6 August 1996, Messrs. Pereira and Harrelson gave sworn 
testimony at an open hearing of the Review Board. 
I trust that this·, responds to the concerns raised in 
your letter. Of course·,·.--·.if you should have any questions 
regarding this matter, 1;:>'lease do not hesitate to contact 
CLinda__C.~ clP-fiaiilJ an attorney in the Office of General 
Counsel, at (703) 874-3124. 
With every good wish, I am
