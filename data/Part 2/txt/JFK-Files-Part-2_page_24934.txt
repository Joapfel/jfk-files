involved themselves in political assassinations, but under 
their system they at least have a better prospect of keep­
ing.it coricealed. Since we do like a free society and 
since these secrets are going to come out in due co~rse, the 
revelation will then do serious injury to the good name and : 
reputation of the United States. 
Would you agree with that? 
Mr. Helms. Yes, I would. 
The Chairman. And finally, if we were to reserve to our.-:­
selves thi prerogative tci assassin~te foreign leaders, we may in­
vite reciprocal action from foreign governments who assume 
that if it's .our prerogative to do so, it is their prero-
gative as well, and that is another danier th~t we at least 
invite with this kind of action, wouldn't you agree? 
Mr. Helms. Yes, sir. (6/13/75, pp. 76-78) 
Similarly, John McCone said he was opposed to assassinations 
because: 
I didn't think it was proper from the standpoint of the U.S. 
Government and the Central Intelligence Agency. (6/6/7 5, p. • 15) 
B. CIA Directives Banning Assassination. In 1972 and 1973, Helms and 
then Colby issued internal CIA orders banning assassination. In his ord~r, Helms 
said: 
It has recently again been alleged in the press that CIA 
engages in assassination.: As you are well aware, this is not 
the case, a'nd Agency policy has lon~ been clear on this issue. 
To underline it, however,· I direct that no such activity or 
operation be undertaken, assisted or suggested by any of our. 
personnel .... (Memorandum, Helms to Deputy Directors, 3/6/72) 
Colby, in one of a series of orders in August 1973 arising out of the Agency's 
own review of prior "questionable activity," issued an order which stated: 
CIA will not engage in assassination nor induce. assist or 
suggest to others that assassination be employed. (Memo r:;rndum, Colby 
to Dep0ty Directors, 8/29/73)
