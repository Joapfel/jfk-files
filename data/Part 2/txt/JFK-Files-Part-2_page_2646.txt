1. !laving 4een a,ppointed to my present position on 23 May 1977, this 
report covers se~en months. In this time I have learned to appreciate 
Mr. Kent's excellent performance in supporting and guiding the mission 
of this branch. Considering the outstanding evaluation he received from 
my predecessor, it must have been a great disappointment to Mr. Kent 
that he was not advanced to become branch chief, I make this observa­
tion because Mr. Kent has never demonstrated his obvious disappointment 
to me. On the contrary, from the first moment he has shown extraordi­
nary and enthusiastic willingness in providing the needed continuity to 
run this brancl1 which controls the career progression of the NOC officer 
complement consisting of between 275 and 300 officers at any given time. 
No doubt the reader is aware of the intricate, complicated and at times 
confusing bureaucratic machinery which governs the NOC officer program. 
Mr. Kent has done a superb job in helping me understand and cope with 
this maze.

I have not had the Ppportunity to observe Hr. Kent's performance as closely as 
the rating officer, However, the rater's comments strike me as bein3 eminently fair 
and accurate. Mr. Kent has certainly performed well and his thorough and accurate 
presentations have indeed been impressive, Despite my somewhat limited association 
with Mr. Kent, but having full confidence in the rating officer's judgment, I have 
no hesitation in concurring in the overall rating of Strong.
