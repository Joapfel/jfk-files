the Australian Ambassador to the National Security Council and 
to the U~S- Ambassador to Australia. The manner in which the • 
Australians treated the demarche demonstrates that the \ 
protection of classified information is receiving top priority 
in the Australian government and is not just a concern of 
their intelligence community. 
• On two recent but separate occasions the Australian service 
passed to CIA information indicating that there would be 
assassination attempts on two non-U.S. citizens. CIA 
requested that it pass this information on to the targets, but 
the Australians refused. They argued that the information was

the Australians to be asked for their consent in light of the 
above events which have al;!. occurred in the last year.· The 
Australians would not only be extremely upset with CIA, but would 
certainly deny their consent. Should the Australians deny their 
consent, ·CIA would have no authority to agree to the release of
