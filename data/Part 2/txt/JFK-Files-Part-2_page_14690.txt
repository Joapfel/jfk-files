On January 9, . 1967, a let-ter. was forwarded ·to 
•'the Acting Attorney General advising him that in view of 
the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal 
G~vernment into the rights of defendants in criminal 
trials and in order to assure that future requests for 
jury panel investj_gations -would be made only in tr_uly 
exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should 
not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific 
written request of the•Attorney General or.the Deputy
