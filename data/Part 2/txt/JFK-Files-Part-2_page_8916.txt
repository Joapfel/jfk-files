a sensit~e sourc.e-vladimir SHUSTOV, who[ii:) f ,_ aad NOSENKO both 
identified as a "clean" Soviet diplomat at the 
Geneva Disaimament Conference. 
Noting the publicity accompanying the defection of KGB 
officer NOSENKU in Sw~tzerland, COLITSYN recalled that 
NOSENKO had been a Second Chief Directorate cfficer working 
against American citizens. 
Comment: Rout:!11ely, GOLITSYN had reviewed in March 1962 
(before NOSENKO contacted CIA) a list of 
Soviet dtlegates to the Disarmament Conference. 
NOSENKO's name, which was on the list, did not 
at that time prompt any comment from GOLITSYN.
