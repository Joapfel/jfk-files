ARRB staff plans to recommend to the Board that monthly summaries be considered ARs and the remaining material be designated NBR. 
Samples of these documents have been provided • to DA. DO, and DCIRRO. . If you have any convnents or objections, please forward them 
to me by COB Wednesday.

staffers. (FYI • -no action required at this time) 
The ARRB staff will ask the Board to delay processing of such documents and, in some cases, declare them NBR. The staff considers 
them marginal to the story and believes that they are not worth the time involved.

andto,&tate Cover.) Written evidence is due. to ARRB staff by COB 13 November (Thursday). They need at least one day to review the
