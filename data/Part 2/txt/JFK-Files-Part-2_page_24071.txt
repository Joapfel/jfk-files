Helms, who had considerable experience as a covert operator, 
gave precisely the opposite meaning to the same words, interpret­
ing them as conveying authority for assassination. 
Helms repeatedly testified that he felt that explicit 
authorization was unnecessary for the assassination of 
Castro in the early 1960 1 s, but he said he did not construe 
the int~nse pressure from President Nixoh in 1970 as pro­
viding authority to assassinate anyone. As Helms testified, 
the differehce was not that the pressure to prevent .Allende 
from assurriing office· was any less than the .pressure to remove 
the Castro regime, but rather that "I had already made up my 
mind that we weren't going to have any of that business when 
I was Director." 
Certain CIA contemporaries of Helms whci were subjected 
to similar pressures in the Castro case rejected the thesis 
that implicit authority to assassinate Castro der.ived from 
·the strong language of the policymakers. Bissell testified 
that he had believed that "formal and explicit approval" -. , -- ---
would be required for assassination, and McManus tes.tified 
director or by anybody else as presidential authorization to 
go forward? 
"Mr. Helms: That is right. But in imswe:r: to that, I 
realize that one sort of grows up in tradition of the time 
and I think that any of us would have found it very difficult 
to discuss assassinations with a President of the U.S. I 
just think we all had the feeling that we were hired out to 
keep those things out of the oval.office."
