SYMBOI,S 
1. As-signing numbers 
a. .A.11-informants should be designated by a permanent symbol number· of 
which the Bureau must be advised. Once a number is assigned, it 
must not be subsequently reassigned to any other informant, source, 
or confidential technique,[regardless of type or designation.] 
b. Potential security informants and confidential sources whose identity 
must be protected may be assigned permanent symbol numbers if they 
are producing sufficient information to warrant the use of such 
designations. 
c. Individuals to whom permanent symbols assigned are not to be _advised 
of such symbols. 
d . .An additional cover name should be used by informant in signing his 
statements and in communications between the informant and the field 
office. 
e. Bureau should be advised of this cover name Ln addition to the per­
manent symbol. 
[f. The prefix of a symbol number is made up of the appropriate field 
office teletype abbreviation followed by the appropriate assigned 
number. 
g. The suffix of the symbol number will consist of the letter 11S 11 to 
designate a security informant; the letters 11PSI 11 to designate a 
potential securi~y informant, 
h. Although an individual, confidential technique, or source may 
subsequentiy furnish information requiring a change in designation 
(e.g., from security to criminal or to racial, etc.), the number 
previously assigned will remain the same; however, the suffix is to 
be chan~ed to the appropriate letter ·or letters indicating this 
change lNY 000-S to NY 000-C or to NY 000-R).J
