SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
ISSUE 7 Certain Files of CIA Officials 
14. (S) This is a major request encompassing " ... the

during the period 1959-1964." 
• The Office of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence 
• General Charles Cabell, 1953-1962 
• General Marshall Carter, 1962-1965 
• The Office of the Deputy Director for Plans 
• Richard Bissell, 1958-1965

This request will by its very breadth require significant time on 
the part of the directorate (and DCI) IROs. While it may appear 
overly broad, we have developed a methodology with the ARRB staff 
which provides the access required by the Board but guarantees 
that their review is focused. In sum, we work from shelf lists 
to narrow the selection and then conduct file review sessions 
with the ARRB staff; if material requested is particularly 
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive Director 
or members of the Board. This effort will continue for some 
time. 
Conclusion 
15. (AIUO) At the present time, 32 persons are involved in 
the JFK records review and we anticipate that this level of 
effort will increase to 37 by May and to 40 thereafter as we near 
the statutory end of the Board (30 September 1998). However, 
even if the Board is not extended (and it has been extended 
previously), there are statutory tasks for CIA which will e~tend 
12-18 months beyond the end of the Board's existence. Your 
continued sµpport is critical.
