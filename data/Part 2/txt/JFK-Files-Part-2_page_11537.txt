·• ·• The above is not all-inclusive. Facts developed in each case 
.will produce information which vtill be indicat•ive of the necessity 
for conducting further investigation along lines which will 1 
necessitate the use of various investigative techniques to develop 
th_e case fully. The successful investigation <:Jf an individual 
will depend upon the resourcefulness of the investigating Agents 
in developing techniques which will further establish the sub­
versive activity of a subject. 
~iscretion must· be used in those instances in which contact 
with persons known to the su.oject is believed desi:i;-ahle. 
Where such contact is contemplated, the Agent should assure 
himself of the character, loyalty, and reliability of the person 
to be contacted concerning the subject by reviewing the office 
indices and in some instances conducting preliminary inquiry, 
••• • ✓ p~ssibly _unde~ __ prete~t, __ wi th o_tl:}.~rs to_ a.scertain the character, 
,: .. :·. reliabil.ity, and loya1ty of_ the person of whom inquiry co.ncern.;.. 
ing the subject is intended. 
In conducting security investigations the necessity of ob­
taining admissible evidence must be continually borne in mind. 
However, sources furnishing information of a confidential nature 
are valuable and should be continueg. and enlarged for the pur-
..... ;::•:.• •··- pose of· obtaining. infor~ation ·whi_c}:i._can be corroborated by .. __ 
• ··0th.er sources which can· be disclosed, thus rendering the ;infor­
mation admissible as evidence. 
The danger of relying ,,~ on evidence from only one confidential 
informant or other sou:-.-, G is obvious and every effort shou'ld be 
made to obtain evidence from various types of sources and through 
various investigative techniques. 
Information obtained from one source. should be corroborated 
by contacts with confidential inf ~rmants, public and private 
sources, through physical and photograph~c surveillances and 
mail covers, review of of£ice files; and other sourcos 0 Adequate 
coordination of information received :from confidential _sources 
with ac·!;ive investigation should be maintained at all times~ For 
example, when it is a.scerta.ined through one of these sources ·l:hat 
an important meeting is to .occur, the nature of the meeting should 
be confirmed if possible by independent sources which can furnish 
evidence of an admissible character. The meeting should be covered 
by arrangement for attendance by confidential informants to ob­
tain admissible evidence of the proceedings., The mee·&iugs should 
be placed under physical surveillance, licenses of automobiles 
parked near the meeting place noted,·and attendants ide~tified. 
If possible and advisable, photographic surveillances should 
be established. Other types of information received from confi­
dential sources should receive similar attention in order that 
verification may be made. and admiss·ible evidence developed. 
Preservation of ·avidence 
_(a) Identify, preserve, and maintain continuity of evidence ob­
tained with a view to its possible admission i~ Federal pro-. 
ceedings. Identify specifically as to source and date.
