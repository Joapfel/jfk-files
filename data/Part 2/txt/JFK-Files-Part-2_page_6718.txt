Re: _ Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for 
Additional Information and Records 
Dear John: 
I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious 
concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for 
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to 
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of 
requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two 
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be 
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now 
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct 
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the 
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (••)1 and we request 
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests 
be answered by Aprill, 1998. 
The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal 
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for 
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any ~f the 
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies. 
1As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material, 
CIA-6 C~bles and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03 
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude 
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Eiectronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-JR:..21 DRE 
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 "A" Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.
