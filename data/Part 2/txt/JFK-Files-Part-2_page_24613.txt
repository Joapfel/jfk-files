This is not very clear to me at this stage. A lot 
of the same officers were serving President Johnson 
as they served President Kennedy, and.;.I can't re­
call anymore whether there was any specific issue 
about whether this was taken up with President 
Johnson at any meeting or.any session. If it had 
been, I would have thought there would have been 
records someplace.'' (Helms, 6/13, p. 139.) 
When asked whether President Johnson had been infonned of or had authorized 
continuing efforts to assassinate Castro, Helms replied indirectly that "the 
Special Group would have continued to consider these,.matters, and I would have 
assumed that whoever was chairing the Special Group would have in turn reported 
to the President, which was the usual practice 11 • (Id.) 
But the records of the Special Group do not show any consideration of a 
Castro assassination or of the AM/LASH plot during the Johnson Administration 
(or earlier). And, as discussed above, there was no evidence that McCone or 
anyone above the Agency was infonned of or specifically authorized the AM/LASH 
plots.
