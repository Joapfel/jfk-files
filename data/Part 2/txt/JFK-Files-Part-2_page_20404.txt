NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD 
CHICAGO CHAPTER 
APPENDIX 
A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his 
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was 
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicag,.~ 
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the 
national group in New York, was formed shortly there~.f ter:, 
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers 
in protest against activities of the American Bar Association 
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive 
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters but 
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in 
literature.
