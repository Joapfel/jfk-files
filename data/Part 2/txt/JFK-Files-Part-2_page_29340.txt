Phillips, page 17. 
Mr. Phillips acknowledged that the FBI would manipulate 
their files on employees of the CIA at the Agency's behest. 
He also said that he would not be surprised if other catigories 
of files could be manipulated, including internal CIA files. 
Mr. Phillips was asked what factors would make him suspicious 
of a file. He said that missing references, pages that had 
half of them torn off, things like that would arouse his sus­
picion. He also listed a missing report from a sequentially 
numbered series of reports as one thing that would arouse his 
suspicion. In response to a direct question, Mr. Phillips said 
that, if what we had told him about Ms. Duran's file was true, 
then wer:could be fairly certain that her file had been "manip­
ulated." 
Mr. Phillips was asked about James Angleton. He said: 
"He didn't tell me anything about his operations. He kept 
promising to tell me, but he never did." He said that Angleton 
held his operation very tightly to his vest. Phillips said 
it is possible that J.C. King mignt have had some operations 
outside of the JMARC structure but that they could not have 
been funded without someone_knowing about them. A division 
chief does have access to operational and developmental funds 
but, Phillips said, he has never heard of a discretiona~y fund 
available to Division Chiefs. He said that the developmental 
fund usually had a lot of money in it but that it eventually 
had to be accounted for. "I can't remember having such a fund 
that I didn't account.for through the DDP. 11
