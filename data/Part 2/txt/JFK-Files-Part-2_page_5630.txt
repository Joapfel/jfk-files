One CIA employee who was involved in Cuban 
operations in Mexico City remembered that there were 
taps on the telephone of the Cuban Consulate.213/ ·It is 
p os·sible that the-employee, Mr. Phillips, wh"o ·wa-s·-s .. tatio·ned 
in Mexico City from 1961 to 1966, was incorrect, after 
a fifteen-year hiatus, in placing this tap in 1963.214/

files fails to suppo~t~ Mr. Phillip~• memory, 
although those files do show that the Consulate 
telephone·was tappe~ in 1964.
