!( Agency in Panama during 1947-49 and in Mexico City from \\

\ and contract agent). A prominent businessman, he was general • 
\ I manager of the Royal Crown Cola Company in Mexico and later 
1 was executive vice president of the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Mexico. During the JFK time frame, he was 
primary agent on a CA project (LIHUFF), initially set up to 
support a conservative front organization. He later became 
the sole focus of the project. In that role he also served 
as the cut-out for an unwitting individual, Manuel Calvillo 
(see above). Wichtrich's only link to the JFK story appears 
to be his relationship with Calvillo. A review of his files 
(OP, 201, C, Production) by the ARRB staff did not identify
