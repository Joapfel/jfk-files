Q. Mr. President, are you. prepareq 
I .lift the trade embargo 'against Cuba 
; one step toward normalizing rela-
Jns? • 
A,:. I think any ~ubstantial -_move in 
Jr :relationship with Cuba would havfi 
, await further discussions with them· 
.directly, and also .sor-ne tangible evi­
mce on our p·art that they are willing 
, restore basic -human rights in Cuba, 
valving the number· of prisoners who 
·e b'eing held, their attitude toward 
rerseas adventures such -as the one 
Angola, and other matters. So l can't 
1y_ what might come ,in the future. 
I'm willing, though. to discuss these 
a.tteis with the Cuban leader~. At ~his 
me we have :no direct relationships 
ith them, political. But through intPr~ 
ediarics comments are being ex-
1anged back and forth. Most of my

r. President, you said that you could-
t say whether ne,:t year's defense

~s. years. But as I understood your 
triter ·postion, you did want to achfove 
five to seven i>illion ·dollar savings •

that strll your goal and a col_llmit-
ent? • 
A. Yes. The analyses that -I've ri1ade

; you know has been limited to about· 
month's study just part-time-indi-
1te that that's a goal that will be

Ju will go about it? 
A. I don't know how I'll gO' • about

16. Keeping Campaign P1·omises 
Q. Mr. P-resident, you've had ,a month 
no~ to enJor the view from. the Oval 
Office. Do you think you'll be able to 
keep fully all the campaign promises 
you made? 
A. As you know, we have issued what 
I belie_ve is the complete book of my 
campaign_ promises, which is, I pre- • 
sume, bemg made available to a)) of 
you. My determination is to keep all 
_those promises. 
Obviously if circumstances should 
change I would hiive to reserve the 
right to go back to the American people 
and say "now that circumstances have 
cha~ged this a better approach to that 
particular problem." But I will do-mv· 
~•tmost to keep all the campaign prom·-
1ses that I made to the American peo-ple: • ·
