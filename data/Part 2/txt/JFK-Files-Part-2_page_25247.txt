Oct. 29, 
In c1 Pref3idential ~eting on Vietnam on October 29, J.963 with MCCONF,:, HELMS, AND COLBY 
in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLI3Y shows that: it was sur-:Zested 
that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, 'fRUEH/\J-n', and DAVID SMI'I'H act as a 
comnittee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE cow1tered with the vlew that 3MI'l'H should 
not be involved in such a policy nialdng function, although he would be in a position to 
provide technical advise to IWIB:INS and 'l'RUE.lffiRI' as \vell as cnrry out their instructions 
in the operations field. 'I'he Prcsldent stated that if the forces in Saigon were not 
clearly in favor of the c:oup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General 
felt the U.S. \'1as risking too much based on flimsy ev idence. The OCI stated his view 
that even a successful coup would create a period of interrcgmum, confusion l'lhich might 
only be solved by a second or third coup.

11 ••• charii~es of action with or \•1ithout our approval now so sigmificant that we should 
ure;ently consider our attitude and contingency plans. We believe our attitude to 
coup i;roup can still have decisive effect on itsdecision .... We must have assurance 
balance of forces clearly favorable ... CONJ.<:IN should express to OON that we do not nnd 
presently reveal plans to give clear prospect of qukk results ... we badly need some 
cmT6borative evidence of nen or others directly involved .... highest authority deslres 
it clearly understood that after your departure HARKINS should participate in all coup 
contacts supervision and the event coup begins he become head of country teain ... 11
