This pr grar:z has a twofold purpose, first, to acquire 
information concr ·ning tlie identities and activities of official pers0n.n[] 
of foreign qover ments in the U. S.; secondly, to produce intelligence 
injo,mation cone rning foreign countries which will assist the Bureau.. in 
its over-all int 11 igence responsibilities, the Departi:zent of S'-tc..te in 
form.ulat ing pol i0_y in the Ji eld o.l international rel at ions, an,d other 
agenczes in connection with their .foreign intelligence functions. To 
accomplish this purpose, three separa~e and dist·'inct facets are ut il izeci~

Agency. A copy was furnished to·~·!.ssistant ./:..ttorney General, In"ternal 
Security Division, o.f the Department to advise him of the Bureau's 
action. ·These letters pointed out that information had been received 
in a _nunzber o.f in'btances indicating that representat i vcs of so-cal 1 ed 
".friendly" nations had engaged in intelligence activities against the 
best interests of the U. S. The case involving Joseph Sidney 
Petersen, Jr., was cited as an e.xar:zpl e. It wa.s noted that representative 
o:f .friendly countries in some instances were stationed here to represent 
their governr;zentE officially in dealing with U. s. agencies and in e-thcr 
instances intelligence representatives of these foreign countries 
frequently visited our country to confer with representatives of various 
U. S. agencies. It was observed that frequently the Bureau was not 
of.ficially noti.fied of the arrivals of many of these foreign governr:zent 
representatives and the possibility e.xisted that such persons might 
while in this country engage in intelligence missions not known to the 
agencies of our Government"sponsoring their visits. 
In our letters of 11-18-54 we requested the si.x agencies 
involved to notify us when information u;as received that an intelligence 
representative o.f a foreign government was proceeding to the U. s. and 
also to let us know in the event any of these agencies set up a liaison 
arrangement with such foreign representativefJ. !7c pointed ou,t thi:.;
