and reported. Member or affiliate may be dangerous or . 
important because of his position, influence, or activities 
inside or outside organization, or both. ·

Member or affiliate may be highly dangerous although he 
takes no part in overt activities of organization .. Subject 
may have assignment in underground and is not to contact 
or'.associate openly with othe,rs in subversive movement. By 
virtue of this assignment in .secret operations, such. in­
dividuals must be considered most dangerous. Be continually 
alert that individual may be serving in underground capacity. 
All logical investigative techniques should be used to de­
velop fully individual's activities in underground; identities 
of other individuals engaged in underground operations; and 
method of operation, extent, and purposes of underground •.

of· subversive movement are known. Identities of individuals 
who are directing underground operations; location of hiding 
places of fugitives and underground leaders; and locations 
of secret printing presses, mimeograph machines, and large 
stationery supplies must be known at all times.

underground capacity, he can be classified as missing subject and 
should be included in unavailable section of[ADEX.] When FD-122 is 
submitted to Bureau, send cover letter advising of investigative steps 
taken to locate[subject.] • 
[e.] Investigations to locate missing[ADEX]subjects must be given 
preferential and continuous attention[and should]be handled as 
thoroughly as fugitive investigation. 
-[(1)] Advise Bureau each 45 days by letter of steps taken to locate 
missing[ADEX]subject. Do not submit reports which merely set 
forth negative results of investigation. . 
[(2)] If subject may have gone to Mexico or Canada, request Bureau to

seek verifying information through liaison channels. If subject 
is reported to have gone to any other foreign country·, request 
Washington Field Office (WFO) to check records of Passport Office 
of State Department for verification.
