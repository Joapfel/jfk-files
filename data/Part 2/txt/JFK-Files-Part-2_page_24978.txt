throughout 1960. My .summer address is Route 2, Box 273-A, Stanley, 
Virginia 22851. 
1. I am unable, after all these years as Executive Secretary' 
of the·NSC and subsequently of the United States Intelligence Board, 
to recollect the substance of discussions relating to the Congo in 
NSC meetings during 1960. My principal function at NSC meetings 
was as the official recorder of the minutes of these meetingi, and 
not as a policymaker. I cannot at this·time recall the substance 
of any specific discussions or decisions relating to Patrice Lumumba 
in NSC meetings during this period. 
2. I cannot recall whether there was any di~cussion of assas-
sinating Lumumba at any NSC meetings. 
3. I do not recall whether President Eisenhower ever made a 
remark at an NSC meeting that could have been construed as an order 
to assassinate Lumumba. 
4. I do not recollect whether any reference was made at any 
NSC meeting to an assassination plan'or attempt in which the United 
States was engaged. 
5. In 1960 Robert Johnson was a member of the NSC Staff as 
the notekeeper at NSC meetings in the absence of Deputy Executive 
Secretary Marian Boggs, who normally took the notes and prepared a 
first draft of the official NSC minutes subject to my review and
