Harvey testified that the "executive action!' capab-ility 
was intended t6 iriclude assassinations (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 35): 
His cryptic handwritten rtotes of the January 25/26 meetings; pre­
served at the CIA, contain phrases which susgest a discussion of 
' assassination--·and Harvey confirmed this interpretation: "last 
re rt be resort and a confession of weakness", "the 
(_m_~-~ic b-u n", and "never mention word assassination". (Harvey, 
Ex.- 1,- ff/25/75).·k· 
The Inspector General's Report did not mention these 
notes, or their dates. However_, in describing Richard Bissell's 
initial assignment of.the "executive action" project to Harvey, 
it referred to another set of Harvey's notes, which were destroyed 
after the preparation of the Report. The excerpt from these notes 
quoted Biss.ell as saying to Harvey, ''The White_ House had tw:Lce . . 
urged me· to create such a capability" (I. G. , P. 3 7). Harvey also: 
testified that this "urging" was mentioned in his. initial dis­
cussion of "executive action''° with Bissel 1 (Harvey, 6 / 25/ 7 5; 'P. 3?) . 
However, the testimony from Bissell and White House aides in the 
Kennedy and Eisenhower Administrations is in confl_ict with Harvey! s 
testimony· as to whether s.uch "urging'' had in fact been given to 
Bissell. 
·k Harvey's notes also contained a phrase which suggests his con­
cern that any U.S. assassination attempts might breed retaliation 
from· other governments: "dangers of RIS (Russian Intelligence 
Seivice) count~r~action and monitor if they ar~ blameJ~•• (Harvey, 
Ex._ 1, 6/25/75; Bissell, Ex. 1, 7/17/75).
