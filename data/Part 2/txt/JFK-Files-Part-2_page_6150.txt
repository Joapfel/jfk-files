wants to review for possible release, but it does not have the.resources to .do 
so. nll0 For more than fifty years, the Department followed a scheme of 
classification that might best be called nclassified at birth." nl3l Any 
document generated was presumed secret until proved otherwise. nl32 The 
Department and its civilian contractors have literally lost track of what needs 
to be kept quiet. nl33 Even more fundamental, what is genuinely in need of 
protection - the design of weapons and such - is lost in-an ocean of documents 
no longer worthy of classified status (if they ever were). nl34

or older. n137 Previously, documents had remained classified indefinitely·. nl38 
Now, unless i;he. documents fit into a group of narrow exceptions, they will 
automatically be open to the public. n139
