DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS AT WOODNER HOTEL 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
Hucks, chief telephone operator at the Woodner 
I 
Hotel, was indicted December 2, 1959,' along with her 
assistant, Davis, for having obstructed justice by 
destroying records of the Woodner Hotel (telephone to11· 
tickets concerning calls to and from Teamster officials) 
which had been subpoenaed by the McClellan Committee. 
The grand jury here in the District, which was hearing 
this case, has been recessed for several days and it is 
not expected to resume hearings until later this month. 
Upon resumption of the hearings, it is expected that 
additional testimony will be taken from co-defendant Davis, 
who appeared briefly at her own request before the grand 
jury during the week beginning February l, 1960. 
\ 
The additional hearings are aimed at developing 
further information showing that subject Hucks committed 
perjury before the McClellan Committee in denying ownership 
of a fur stole we located in Falls Church, Virginia. This 
stole allegedly was received by Hucks from James Hoffa 
and/or the Teamsters Union.
