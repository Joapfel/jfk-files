the Madrid Station cabled that AMLASH-1 would soon receive "one 
pistol with silencer and one FAL rifle with a silencer from B-l's 
secretary" ( I .G., p. 103). A subsequent cable reported that 
"B-1 had three packages of special items made up by his technical 
people and delivered to AMLASH-1 in Madrid" (LG., p., 103 
In June 1965, CI* terminated all contact with 
AMLASH-1 and his associates because of reports that his activities

"4. B-1 is.to be in Cuba one week before the elimination 
of Fidel, but no one, including AM/LASH-1 will know 
B-l's location. 
"5. B-1 is to arrange for recongition by at least five Latin 
American countries as soon as Fidel is neutralized and 
a junta is formed. This junta will be established even 
though Raul Castro and Che Guevara may still be alive 
and may still be in control of the part of the country. 
This is the reason AM/LASH-1 requested that B-1 be able 
to establish some control over one of the provinces so 
that the junta can be formed in that location. 
"6. One month to the day before the neutralization of Fidel, 
B-1 will increase the number of commando attacks.to a 
maximum in order to raise the spirit and morale of the 
people inside Cuba. In all communiques, in all radio 
messages, in all propaganda put out by B-1 he must relate 
that the raid was possible thanks to tne information 
received from clandestine sources inside Cuba and from 
the clandestine underground apparatus directed by "P". 
This will be AM/LASH-l's war name."
