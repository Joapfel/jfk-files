bothered by reporters once he had made it clear that he 
was not the talking kind. No decisions were taken, no 
actions directed alt.hough both Rusk and McNamara indi­

c. The President then reverted to Cuba and said that 
he questioned seriously whether these sabotage efforts were

policy was a hypocritical one in the light of a peace offensive 
although I did not feel we were trying to make peace with 
Castro. I also pointed out that sabotage activities in North
