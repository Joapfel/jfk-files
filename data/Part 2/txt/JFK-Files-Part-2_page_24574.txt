(Parrott, p. 35). 
The documents and testimony of Parrott suggest several possible in­
ferences with respect to the nature of the discussion of a Castro assassination 
at the August 10 meeting. First, as indicated by the Lansdale and Harvey 
memorandum, it is possible that a contingency plan was requested but that it 
was decided not to malre this "a matter of official record." (Lansdale 
Ex. 16, p. 1). However, if it had been decided to commission a written 
-contingency plan, as Lansdale requested Harvey prepare, it is difficult to 
see how this request could have been reconciled-with a decision to make to 
written record. 
Second, it is possible that, as Parrott'.s testimony indicated, 
subject was raised but quickly rejected. This inference is apparently con-
sistent with the fact that the subject did not appear in Parrott's minutes, 
and perhaps, although less so, with Harvey's August 14 Memorandum. Harvey's 
Memorandum.states that the Special Group Augmented "is not expecting any 
-----· 
written comments ol'.." study on this point." (Lansdale Ex. 16, p. 1).
