that kind of document to b•? retained in Agency files anywhere. 
You know, inter-departmental correspondence is firing paper in

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes. 
Mr. Tovar. Primarily yes, but not solely. We are 
concerned with Americans o:: counterintelligence interest. If 
an overseas station is informed by somebody that an American 
is contacting the Soviets and is apparently engaged in what 
~!: ~. looks like espionage,. we would become interested.
