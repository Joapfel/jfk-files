d. The nsUMMARY OF CONTENTS11 section should 
be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is 
being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for 
instance, whether your sample on the letterhead 
memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods~ 
The summary as written gives no indication as to 
the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the 
single sentence now used to describe all of them covers 
the waterfront. 
e. If the request for information comes officially 
from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered 
under 11REQUESTOR,tt but if the requestor is an individual 
member of the Staff, his name should be indicated. 
f. The last entry in the format, 11PROBLEM AREAS,n 
has particular ~ignificance since it is important to 
know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods, 
or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is 
the place to identify them. We are beginning to use 
the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to 
obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with 
the document for which another agency must concur in 
the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such 
other agency an idea as to whether we see any important 
reason why they should be concerned about release of 
the document. The entry in this final section of the 
format is expected to prove useful for this purpose. 
5. One copy of the document or its abstract is all 
that is needed by the registry. 
6. The mailing address of the registry is:
