CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES FLIGHT 967 
GUIF OF, Mm(ICO, NOV!:1\lBZR 16, 1959 
D~STRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR i,lOTOR ViHICLES 
INTERSTATE 1~ANSPORTATION OF ~TOWN MOTOR VEHICLt. 
On November 16, 1959, a plane with 42 persons aboard, 
owned by Delta Air Lines but staffed with a National Airline's 
crew, plunged into the Gulf of Mexico while on a flight from 
Tampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Only ten of the 
victims were identified and the other bodies have not been 
recovered. 
On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-§c~le 
investigation in this matter. It had been allcg~d that 
Dr. Robert V. Spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal • 
record who had been reported as a passenger on the plane, had 
induced his friend and form;:;r partner in crime, William Allen 
Taylor of Te1mpa, .Florida, to board the plane in his place.· 
Spears had over :~100,000 worth of. insuranc~ with his Y.1ii\~ as 
beneficiary and Taylor purchas~d $37,500 worth of flight 
insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.· 
From the first, our investigation was directed at 
finding Spears or Taylor sine~ this appeared to be a key point 
. in our investigation. Spears was located by Bureau Agents in 
Fhoenix, Arizona, on J~nuary 20~ 1960, _and charg~d wit~~~he Interstate Transportation of a ~tolen ~otor Vehicle (I1S~V). 
Spears admitted Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane 
and that following the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his 
identity. He took Taylor's car,with his ~lleged permissicin, 
but admitt~d he had no authority to take it to Arizona and 
that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the 
identification number from it and tried to get a fraudulent 
title for the car. Spears, with Tur ska, contacted f,lrs .• Spears 
in Dallas, Texas, about .January 7, 1960, and f,1rs. Spears 
admitted that h~r husband per~uaded her no~to reveal the 
fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could 
be paid to her as beneficiary. 
·j On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in fhoenix, Arizona, he was charged with the Interstate Transportation 
of a Stole,,. !,!otor Vehicl~ for t~king Taylor's car from Florida to 
) 
Arizona. He was taken to th~:: !J.~. Commissioner in l;hocnix on 
that date ~nd held on ~35,000 bond. On February 1, 1960, Spears 
was brought before the U.~. District Judge in r:hoenix and
