I am pleased to have the opportunity to recommend 
Carole Hansen Amato for a position on the Select Committee 
on Assassinations. 
I have known Carole since I came to Congress in 
1971. She was a member of Congressman John Davis' staff 
for seven years and was highly valued by him. Since that 
time she has held an executive position with Congressman 
Carroll Hubbard and presently works as the legislative 
secretary to Congressman Bob Jones. 
During her nine years on Capitol Hill, Carole has 
repeatedly proven herself as a reliable and competent 
worker. She has shown excellent abilities as executive 
secretary, press assistant and in a legislative capacity. 
I recommend her highly. 
If you should need additional information about 
Carole, please let me know. 
With best 
Dawson Mathis, M. C.
