~ LIND~ENNESS made a final plea for tfie indepen-
' 
dent women to.--reconsider. Th~ removal of the independents 
from WON~.AC has debilitated the organization and m~_st 
independent representatives will be going back to their •• 
own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations 
which have no connection with the SWP. • 
The concern still exists, however, that WOJ\1AAC will 
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform 
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be~ 
furthering abortion law reform. 
Independents vowed before leaving NY that they 
would try to publicize activities -from the SWP in an 
effort to prevent this. 
III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL 
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE 
When contacted under pretext on November 24, 
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National 
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report, 
related that she has been actLve in WONAAC since its 
inception. EATON, while ~verring she is definitely not a 
YSA, S~-iTP r or member of any 
11
radical group
11
, acknowledged 
there always have been SWP, YSA and 
11
radical 11 elements 
in WONAAC. She went _on to state, however, that WONAAC 
has never allied itself politically with any organization 
or individual, including any of the political candidates 
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse 
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership, 
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only 
to the objectives for which it was originally founded. 
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from 
whatever source offered.
