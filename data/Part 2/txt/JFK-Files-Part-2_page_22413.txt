Q I see. So so~e of these boats and personnel were 
actually stationed full-time 
Oh, yes. Oh, sure. 
Q Were there any op2rations run o~t of the United 
States which involved destruction of crops or poiso~ing of 
sugar or anything of that sort? 
. ! 
l\ What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the 
Puerto Rican thing? 
A Well, that is one of the things I had in mind. 
Would you describe that for me? 
A Well, this is, I guess you co~ld term i~ a target of 
opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar 
to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to 
it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or 
something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for .repairs. 
In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the 
drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and 
put it in the warehouse and at that time· I guess sor.iebody car10 
up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was 
a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to 
put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it 
acid, sour t.3:sting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the 
individual, and so~e of this was done. And then when it 
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar 
firm buy it back from the Soviets.
