does not know if SUBJECT uses alcoholic beverages at all because on the 
occasions that HE visited Source's home HE refused to have anything to 
drink. HE isinot known to use habit forming drugs, and has manifested 
no undesirable personal habits whatever. HIS main hobby is stamp collection. 
Source does not believe that SUBJECT has traveled abroad since His 
arrival in New York City, and Source has no knowledge of relatives or 
business interest HE might have abroad. Source unhesitatingly vouches for 
SUBJECT'S loyalty to the United States. Source was unable to suggest anyone 
who may have knowledge of SUBJECT. 
Todman highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for 
a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
