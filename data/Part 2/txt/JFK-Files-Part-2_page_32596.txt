The Honduran arm8d forces began to mvve ag91.nst a 
group of pro-Castro-guerrillas operating 2gainst the 
Nice.raguan Government and active in the vicinity of the 
Nicaraguan-Honduran border. The Nicaraguan National Guard 
has been conducting operations on its side of the border 
against the insurgents since July. The dense jungle and 
difficult terrain, however, will impede the efforts of 
both forces to eliminate the guerrillas. 
Information on the guerrilla fo~ce is scanty and 
conflicting. It is apparently composed of members of the 
National Liberation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated 
and Cuban-supported revolutionary organization active 
primarily in Honduras and Nicaragua since the fall of 
1962. The strength of the force is not known.

Nicaraguan group) confessed that he was a member of a 
group of 46 who entered Nicaragua from Honduras on 22 July.
