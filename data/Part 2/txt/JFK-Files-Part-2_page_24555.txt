McCone.pointed out that altfiougn tne ·cuban proo1em was aiscussea in -i:erms 
of "c.ispose of Castro," or "knock off Castro", these terms were meant to refer 
to· 11 the overthrow of the Communist Government in Cuba"-and not a Castro assassi­
nation. (McCone, p. 44; McCone Ex. 4, memorandlllTI April 14, 1967, to Helms.)

without consulting with the Special Group Augmented. (McCone, p. 52). 
b. • Testimony of Taylor . 
Taylor served as Chairman of the Special· Group Augmented 
during the Mongoose Operation (Taylor, 7/9, p. ). In addition, Taylor 
also served as President Kennedy's Military Representative and Intelligence 
Advisor after the Bay of Pi13s until his a"ppointment as Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff in November 1962 (Taylor, 7/9, p. Bundy, 7 /11, 
p. 25). 
Taylor testified that a Castro assassination plan was 
"never" submitted to the Special Group Augmented, either orally or in 
writing. (Taylor, p. 41). Taylor further testified that he and the 
Special Croup Augmented were never told of the passage of the poison 
pills to Roselli in April 1962, and that the passa13e of these pills 
without the knowledge of the Special Group Auvnented was "entirely, 
completely out of [thi}. context and character of the way the {§pecial 
Group AugmenteQ/ operated or the way it would accept" ·that an operation 
was properly authorized. (Taylor, p. 43). And Taylor testified that 
although the Special Group Augmented .was "certainly anxious for the 
downfall of Castro" an "assassination never came up" in the meetings 
and discussions of the Special Group Augmented. (Taylor, p. 62).
