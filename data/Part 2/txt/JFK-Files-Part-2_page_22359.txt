/ir1y investigaU.on and revies:1 of C.I.A., or any othcrelement 
cif th:.,t corri.muni.ty should be made i•1ithin that context. 
After many years of service in the security field, I 
can fully understand the extreme sense of frustration among 
the United States Government officials regarding unauthorized 
disclosure of classified inform·ation. It is devastating to 
read the contents of a highly classified document disseminated 
in the intelligence community and then a day or two later, to 
read the same information ad literatum in the press. I believe 
most firmly in freedom of the press, but I believe also tliat 
there should be a sense of responsibility accompanying such 
freedom; that sense of responsibility seems often tote buried 
or absent in the publication of classified information which 
could endanger our national security. 
I welcome the opportunity to appear before this Commissio~ 
and to assist it in acquiring facts relevant to its investigation. 
In the course of developing such facts, I am hopeful the Commission 
will look at the possible consequences of the Agency's failure to 
act even if the Commission should find fault with individual 
conclusions or judgments made by Agency officials. 
I shall endeavor to answer all of your questions and I 
shall put aside my citizen's s~hield against self-incrimination. 
Tint decision is based on my desire to assist the Commission to 
the full extent of my ability and for the equally cor;ent reason 
th~1t I do not believe that 8.DY action I performed was unlawful 
/ 
or in derogation of my duties to the United States Government.
