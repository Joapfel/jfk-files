Allen DULLES reported to the NSC that the 
Venezuelan government wants, the United States 
to lead the way in breaking relations with 
TRUJILLO. DULLES stated: The Venezuelan 
government was engaged in an all-out effort, 
through the OAS and otherwise, to isolate,. 
condemn and cause the downfall of TRUJILLO .. 
[Because] they have convincing evidence that 
TRUJILLO was res onsible for the assassination 
attempt on BETANCOURT President of Venezuela 
. . . BET.Al-ICOURT believes another attempt will 
be made momentarily and therefore it [his 
government] wants a showdown without delay~" 
(NSC Minutes) 
"Mr. DULLES stated that he believes, and the 
intelligence corilmunity agrees, that the 
problem of TRUJILLO must be settled before the 
problem of CASTRO can be dealt with, even 
though CASTRO is the greater threat." 
(NSC Minutes) 
The NSC Minutes further state that BETANCOURT 
was told that the U.S. cannot act without 
ascertaining TRUJILLO'S successor. The U.S. 
will work with BETANCOURT and FIGUERES of 
Costa Rica on suggestions for a successor to 
TRUJILLO. President EISENHOWER suggested that 
a government in exile should be ready to go 
into the Dominican Republic in the event of 
TRUJILLO'S downfall. (NSC Minutes) 
GRAY said "his associates" would favor the 
development of sabotage operations in CUBA.
