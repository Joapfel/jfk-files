at the White House with Kissinger. And he worked his way up, but anyway, that 
is another story. But he's been there as a pro, minding his P's and Q's~ He 
has a very small staff. I think there are a total of a dozen people, all 
told. They are all pros .. I mean, former professionals from one agency or 
another. Which is unlike the Senate committee which is still more or less 
beholden to each Senator and the staff guy really 1s a Senator's appointee . 
. And the staff director doesn't have much control over him. It's a different 
story. So it will give you something to watch. And maybe as a result of the 
Iran/Contra stuff:, they must be having a hell of a time coming up with their 
report. Oh God, they must be fighting like cats and dogs! 
INTERVIEWER: That's the impression I get from snippits in the newspaper 
column. 
MR. HALPERN: The. reports now are at least three weeks overdue. And you know, 
they could have had a minority or maj.ority report. T_hey must be having a real 
go through on that one. 
INTERVIEWER: I just happened to think when you were mentioning the earlier 
and, I'm not sure that it may be coming up a little bit later, were you 
surprised when Mr. Colby agonized for a-·time over Mr. Helms' testimony and the 
• decision to turn the testimony over? Were you surprised at that? 
MR. HALPERN: Uh huh. Really something. 
INTERVIEWER: You didn't think he would? 
MR. HALPERN: I didn't think he would. I didn't think he should. But I'm 
told by one of the principals involved~ namely John Warner, who was then Legal 
Counsel or General Counsel : 
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, General.
