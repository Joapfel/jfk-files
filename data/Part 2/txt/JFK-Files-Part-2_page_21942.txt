(with this message on, September 24. (Task Force Log, September 23)) 
Thomas·Karamessines, the Deputy Director for Plans, testified: 
i· 
So this was in a sense not Track II, but in a 
sense another aspect of a quiet and hopefully 
non-violent military coup .... This was abandoned 
when the military were reluctant to push Frei 
publicly.,.and, number two, Frei was reluctant 
to leave on his own in the absence of pressure 
from the military .... There was left as the only 
chance of success a straight military coup. 
(Karamessines testimony, Aug, 6, 1975, p. 6) 
At the same time, .the Station in Santiago reported: 
Strong reasons for thinking neither Frei nor 
Schneider will act. For that reason any scenario 
in which either has to play an active role now

memo, Helms to Kissinger, page 16) Thus, by the beginning of October, 
it was clear that a vehicle for a military solution would have to be 
found in the second echelon of Chilean officers, and that the top leader­
ship of the Armed Services, particularly General Rene Schneider, consti-
tuted a stumbling block. (Santiago 424, September 23, 1970; Santiago 439, 
September 30, 1970) The Agency's task was to cause a coup in a highly 
unpromising situation and to overcome the formidable obstacles represented 
by Frei's inaction, Schneider's strong constitutionalism, and the absence 
of organization and enthusiasm among those officers who were interested 
in a coup. 
A three-fold program was set into motion:
