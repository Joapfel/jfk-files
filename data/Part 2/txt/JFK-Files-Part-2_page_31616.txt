YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE 
The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist" ("YS"), 
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a 
national organization entitled 11Young Socialist Alliance" (YSA) 
was established at Philadelphia, Pen11sylvania. This issue stated 
this organization was formed by the nationwide supporter clubs 
of the publication "YS." 
The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declaration 
of YSA. This declaration stated YSA recognizes the Socialist 
~orkers Party (SWP) as the only existing politic~l leadership 
on class ·struggle principles, and that the supporters of the "YS" 
.have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP on the 
principles of revolutionary socialism. 
A source advised on May 7, 1965, tnat the original 
YSA was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York 
City~ by youth of va~ious left-socialist tendencies, particularly 
members and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were 
the guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization. 
The source further advised on May 7, 1965, YSA is dominated 
and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through having SWP 
members comprise exclusively the National Executive Committee (NEC) 
and through an official SWP representative at all YSA NEC meetings. 
The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training section of the SWP 
and the main source of new·swP members. 
The headquarters of the YSA is located in Room 631, 
41 Union Square Nest, New York City. 
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive Order 
104 5.0.
