~ informants.. The SSC Task Force he .is on is studying informant

the FBI. He state·d that .they had· .. found the FBI as so much· far 
superior to other agencies that .they considered -the FBI as the

such .as this one will· be. very help:ful to the SSC in its work1 
and promote·. friendly and businesslike relations betw.een the'
