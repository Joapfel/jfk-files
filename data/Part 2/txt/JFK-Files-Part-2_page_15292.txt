This program was initiatect··in 1954 ana. ~.xpanded in 
f 1955 arid 1958 to provide for the acquisition· of posi t·ive 
intelltgence data as well ~s other information which would· 
assist .FBI investigations through three·principal phases: (1) 
Regular notification from· u. s. intelligence agencies as to 
arfival- in U. SG of intellig~nce personnel from non-Soviet-bloc. 
~ountries; (2) Maintenance :of .telephone surveillance of official 
establishments of selected non-Soviet-bloc countries with·approva1· 
of. State Department; and (g)~Development of 1ive sources within

SCOPE AND COST: 
The fi,rst phase consists chiefly o·f file reviews ~.nd. 
\ indexing at .the ·se::i't of Government at nominai cost. 
· Under the sec~nd phase w~ are presently operatin~ 12 
telephone surveillances c~o'{Tering establishments of 11 ·non-Soviet--· 
bloc countries. The countries are: Algeria, Chiha, Dominican 
.Republic, France, India, Israel, Jordan., Panama, United Arab 
Republic, Venezuela and Vietnam. The cost of operating this .,.·. 
• pl3.Se of the program consists primarily of moni t.oring _the technical_ 
installations involved and the translation of. the intelligence •• • 
product. These costs are analyzed each time the telephone ~ 
surveillance i: justif~ed (on a quarterly basis af~er ~he f ~~( 2 _
