Instructions 3~~ ou~ below should be read. in conjunct~on 
with 67D 6b (7) (c) herein relating to interviews with 
security i~ie~ subjects.

Frequently, after a subject is included in the security index, 
information is received or investigation develops information 
indicating tha~ he is no longer a threat to the internal 
sec;rity by reason of[p~ysical condition,]defection or ex­
pulsion from the subversive mov:ment, m~rnber~hi~ in or affi~ia­
tion with which was tho reason ror placing him in the security 
index. Such defection may ~e shown by lack of ac~ivity 
and obvious clisinterest over an extended period of time 
or upon doclaratioi·~f op~osition to th~.principles 9f 
the subversive movement. '.i:he latter may manifest itself in 
declarations by a s~bject in the presence of confidential 
informants or .other sources, stater:!ents to the press, or 
actual contact with Bureau representatives and admission 
of previous subversive activityo 
When sufficient information is at hand regarding subject I s 
present sympathies to reach conclu.sion that he should no 
longer be scheduled for apprehen~ion as a dangerous subver­
sive, request authority to interview subject or advise 
Bureau of reasons why subject should not be interviewed 0 
Bureau will riot cancel security index card without consider­
~tion being given to interview of subject. See 87D 6b (7) 
( c) and ( d). 
If, upon interview,, subject _proves cooperative to- extent 
that his security index card should be canceled, advise 
Bureau by .. letter of results together with a· recommendation 
for cancellation which must be approved by Bureau. 
Subjects removed from security index solely upon basis of 
application of security in~ex criteria, with no affirmative 
indication of defection 
.As s ~curi ty index cu.s es arc reviewed upon reopen-ing in the 
field, there will be instance~ in which recioval will be re­
quired by application of the • ;ourity index criteria· sot ou·t 
in 87D 7b (3). With the pu.ss~ge ~f time, limits specified 
in criteri~ will operate to remove. certain subj~cts even 
though theie is no a£firmative 'indication of detection.
