The Bissell/Tweedy cable 'informed the Chief of Station th.at 
he was to continue to use this indicator for . .,, 
ALi [CABLE] TRAFFIC THIS OP, vrrIICH YOU 
INSTRUCTED HOLD ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF. 
(CIA Cable, 9/19/60.) 
The Chief of· Station -- referred to herei.n as "Hedgman"i, -­
testified to a clear, independent recollection bf receiving such 
a cable. Hedgman stated that in September of 1960. he received a 
"most unusual" cable from CIA headquarters {Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 11, 
43). The cable advi~ed, in his words, that: 
someone who I would have recognized would 
arrive with instructions £or me .... I 
believe. the message was also marked for my 
eyes only.,. and contained instructions 
that I was not to discuss·the message with 
anyone~ (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 12-13.) 
Hedgman said that the cable did not specify the kind of instruc­
tions he was to receive, and it "did not refer to Lurnurnba in any 
way" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 12). 
Three days after the Bissell/Tweedy message that Hedgman was 
to meet "Sid" in Leopoldville,·Bronson Tweedy uses the same sensi­
tivity indicator on a cable sent to Hedgman on an "Eyes Only" 
basis (CIA Cable, OUT 74837, · ~veedy to Leopoldville., 9/22/60). 
7' Due to fear of reprisal from Lurnumba 's followers, the Chief 
of Station for the Congo from mid-summer 1960 through 1961 testi~ 
fied under the alias "Hedgman" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 2; 8/25/75, 
p. 4).
