HALPERN, SAM 
Interview by Brian Latell, Michael Warner 
7 APRIL 1998 
MW: This is the interview with Sam Halpern, done by Brian 
Latell and Michael Warner in the spaces of the Center 
for the study of Intelligence on the 7th of April, 
1998. 
BL: Sam, you told me that you read recently the IG report 
on the Bay of Pigs. 
SH: I did, and the responses .... 
BL: Which were recently declassified by the Agency, and you 
told me that.you had never seen it before, and that had 
you seen it when you were running Oper~tion Mongoose 
you would have learned some critical l~ssons. You said 
that it·· was a shame that you • had not seen it . 
SH: That's right. Neither did Bissell; I mean, neither did 
Harvey and neither did Ted Shackley. Harvey's dead so 
I couldn't ask- him, but I asked Ted the other day 
whether he had ever seen the report, and he said no he 
had never seen it and nobody had ever talked to him 
about it. So here you have the man in charge of a new 
Cuban Bay of Pigs SIC Operation, although we weren't 
going to send in 1,000 troops. And you have the guy in 
charge of the whole thing, Bill Harvey, and of course 
the DDP himself, Dick Helms. Helms by that 
time .... When we were.doing Mongoose, none of the three 
people, none of the three senior people ever saw the 
damn thing. I think McCone was wrong not to let those 
three people, ~t least those three people, see the 
thing, betause the sections dealing with the 
organization and management of the whole Bay of Pigs 
Operation-had lessons for what we were doing in 
Mongoose, and we were running the same kind of 
operation in terms of trying to overthrow a foreign 
government. 
BL: What, in particular, would you have done differently? 
What specifically, what lesson specifically applied to 
Mongoose?
