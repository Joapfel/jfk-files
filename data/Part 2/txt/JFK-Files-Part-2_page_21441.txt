.RICHARD GIBSON 
INFORMATION CqNCERNING 
In June, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished 
reliableiriforrnation in the past, advised that at al) Executive 
Committee meeting of the Revolutionary Union (RU) held on June 8, 
1969; DAVIDA FINEMAN read a letter which she had received from 
RICHARD GIBSON, whom she described as a Negro who ·resides·in 
Europe and whom she knew while she was in France. This. letter C,. 
was a run-down on the Marxist-Leninist-Mao,.groups in various 
countries 'in Europe arid described some of·these groups as 
rev.isionists who support the new working class, e .g .--::'technicians 
and other highly skilled labor, ·and s·upport a broad~·tinited front 
w_hich would include various members of th~ bourgeo:i,.se. 
According· to this source, BRUCE FRANKLIN in no uncertain 
terms described GIBSON as a CIA agent who was exp9sed as.such 
and had to flee France. lest he be killed. • FRANKLIN stated that _ii 
he had.proof of GIBSON's affiliation with CIA. LEIBEL BERGMAN, 
'on the other hand, stated in no uncertain ternrs· that BRUCE ;, 
FRANKLIN's allegation was-completely untrue and that GIBSON 
! had been thoroughly _checkec;l qtit when BERGMAN, himself, was in ·•· • S 
Red.China and had been found to,be all right. BRUCE FRANKLIN 
continued the argument by stating that he ~ould prove that • 
GIBSON was. a c:t~ agent 'because some friends of his in France · ••• 
had been exposed and arrested shortly after their introduction·· 
to GIBSON. 
'At the E~ecutive Committee meeting, it was decided 
that LEIBEL BERGMAN and the FRANKLINs. were·_· to iron out. their 
differences-about.GIBSON amongst. themselves and it was 
further·decided_t11,at the RU maybe in contact-with GIBSON.
