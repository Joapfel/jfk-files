THE WHITE HOUSE 
. WASHINGTON 
February 3, 1977 
To Lillian Johnson 
I deeply appreciate your dedicated and 
untiring work on the 1977 inauguration. 
The inaugural program was a great suc­
cess, open to all of our citizens. This 
would not have been possible without the 
unselfish help, cheerful spirit and long 
hours freely given by volunteers such· 
as you. 
You have helped to set an example of what 
we Americans can accomplish by sharing 
our talents and energies with each other. 
Many thanks. 
Sincerely, 
-,,,-
