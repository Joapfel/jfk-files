officials who are required to testify before Congressional committees

Bundy recognized that this is a problem and said that in an attempt 
to alleviate it he has had several documents brought together. These 
include a compendium of the President's remarks on the subject; the 
DCI's report to the Killian Committee; a report by Assistant Secretary 
Martin; and most recently, the CIA-prepared paper on subversion in 
the hemisphere. He added that the basic responsibility for co­
ordinating public statements rests with the Secretary of State.
