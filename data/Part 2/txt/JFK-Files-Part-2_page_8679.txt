CHRONOLOGY OF FINDINGS 
Anti-Castro Activities - Cuba 19-9-9 
INCA 11020 dated 28 February 1964 
A Caracas Station asset reported an operation called 
"Plan Judas" being constructed at that time inside 
Cuba. The plan reportedly involved an internal 
uprising with the support of certain Cuban military 
figures conspiring against Fidel CASTRO. Key figures 
reportedly included Juan ALMEIDA, Efigenio AMEIJEIRAS 
Delgado, Pepin NARANJO, Regino BOTTI, and two COSSIO 
brothers. On 24 February 1964, Francisco SUAREZ 
Quinones, a JURE (Revolutionary Junta) member in 
Caracas, told U.S. Embassy officials that JURE was 
then sponsoring a plan to assassinate Fidel CASfRO and 
other high-ranking Cuban Govenunent officials as part 
of an operation designed to incite an internal rebellion 
in Cuba. The Station reported this plan, speculating 
that it may be connected in some way with Plan Judas.
