"Grant's Tomb", a community newspaper, upper west 
side, New York City (NYC), Me,rch, 1971, Number 2 Issue, page 
. 10, contained an article captioned, 11Women March on 
Washington~ This article reflected, in part; as follows: 
"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying 
force of the Ann Arbor conference, the wcmen1 s caucus decided 
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for 
a women's ma~ch on Washington, D.C. on Ai:ril 10. We all felt 
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same 
U.S. system that needs the dominance of ~en over women, white 
over black, brown n.nd,yellow,heterosexual over homoBexual, and 
over poor to suppo~t tre aggressive war policy that is killing 
our Vietnamese sisters and brothers.~-----
"We are making this march one step in showing the 
world our solidarity. as women with all our sis-ters in Vietnam 
who are fighting for their lives. The Cc-mmi ttee to Defend the 
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women1 s organization, has 
called for our support." 
The confidential source mentioned above on March 
15, 1971, furnished information that on ~arch 11, 1971, a 
11'\'mmen I s meeting" was held at Washington square Methodist 
Church, 135 West 4th Street, New York, New York (~Y). 
Approximately 70 people were present. It appears to the source 
that the Penta£on action April.10th is being led by the same 
.women, in the X1i1omen 's Union 11, who are planning the trip to 
_;/Toronto, ganada:~n-i:a'te~farch, 1971. The only decision arrived 
. .at during the meeting, according to the source, was that on
