Bissell said he "may have" given Tweedy specific instructions about 
steps he was to take to further an assassination plan, but he did 
not remember to do so (Bissell, 9/10,p.4). Bissell said that 
exploring access to Lumumba --"almost certainly" seeking information 
from the ~hief of) Station about access for poisoning -- would have 
been a "key part" of his "planning and preparatory activity" but 
he had no specific recollection of cable col!1111unications on this 
subject (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 6-8). Bissell remembered that he was 
aware .that the ~hief o~ Station had an a8ent thought to have direct 
access to Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10, p. 80). 
Bissell testified that he "most certainly" approved any cables 
that Tweedy sent to the fhief o~ Station seeking information about 
( gaining access to Lumumba but it was so sensitive a matter (B_issell, 
--- 9/10, p. 8) Bissell added: 
I think Mr. Tweedy, on the basis of an oral author­
ization from me, would have had the authority to 
send such a cable without my signing off on it. 
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 8) • 
Bissell believed that Tweedy would have known of ~-o~tli,e~• s trip 
to the Congo, although it was possible that Tweedy was "cut out of 
knowledge of the specific operation" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 21). 
Bissell's lack of recollection of discussing his assignment to 
(1us tin O' Donnel~\wi th Tweedy was the reason for his speculation that 
-J, Bissell's assignment to(o'Donnel~ is discussed in Sections S(a) 
', . 
(i) and S(a)(ii), infra.
