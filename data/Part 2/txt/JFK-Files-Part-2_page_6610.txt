RE: ARRB Additional Information Req.µest No,OA-2 
OearJohn: 
As you know, the ARRB Board at its May 19, 1995 meeting concluded that it required 
additional specific information before it could review the CIA records lU1der discussion 
at this meeting. Based upon my discussions with you and with Barry Harrelson, I 
understand that the Historical Review Group can respond only to questions t__hat draw 
upon information already on hand, and that any questions requiring further research 
will go to the components for a response. 
Since I understand from you and Barry that it will be faster if we divide those of our 
questions directed to the Historical Review Group from those directed to the 
components, we are submitting two separate lists for CIA's response. List 1, which we 
are submitting to the Historical Review Group, asks basic questions about documents, 
including the Mexico chronology, which HRG has not previously addressed. List 2 
asks for the answers to questions about names, pseudonyms, and crypts that go beyond 
what we understand is HRG's current available information. 
Since the ARRB Board will consider these documents at its June 7, 1995 meeting, we 
hope to have this information by then. Thank you for your continued cooperation, and 
we look forward to your response. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn 
for any clarification regarding these requests. 
Sincerely yours, 
~ 'vl.-J._
