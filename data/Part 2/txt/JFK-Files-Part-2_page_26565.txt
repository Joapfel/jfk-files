5. USSR-Berlin 
c. The USSR may repeat last 
year's performance of multiple fir­
ings from a prototype operational 
complex at Tyuratam. Three such 
launchings were attempted at five­
minute intervals in May 1963; two 
succeeded. 
d. We also do not rule out the 
possibility of firings from opera­
tional sites as opposed to the test 
center at Tyuratam. We observed 
the first such firing on 22 October 
from the Plesetsk site, roughly 400 
miles northeast of Moscow.

a. Embassy Bonn feels that 
the Soviet Union may be seeking at 
least a temporary modus vivendi on 
the autobahn without prejudicing 
its juridical position, which can 
be used to cause difficulties the~e 
in the future. 
b. The embassy bases this on 
the Soviet replies to the Western 
notification to the USSR on 29 
October regarding harmonized convoy 
procedures--two oral statements on 
16 November and _a note of 21 Novem­
ber.
