his cooperation is a matter of record in the ~'BI and if some question 
a~ises concerning his loyalty we will consider making the facts of his 
cooperation with the FBI known to his employer or to the responsible 
individuals. It should be pointed out that this action may make it 
impossible for him to continue on behalf of the FBI and the service 
which he is performing for his country may be terminated. Before • 
taking steps to advise anyone of a potential informant's or informant's 
cooperation, prior Bureau authority must be obtained. 
Specifically advis~ each potential informant that he is not and cannot 
consider hims elf a Bureau employee or "undercover .Agent" of the FBI. 
In this rega~~, the seriousness of violating the impersonation statutes 
must be :i.mpres sea upon the informant. ,. ••. 
·.Ad-vise potential informant that his cooperatio·n mu.st be strictly confi...; 
dential at all times and if he should feel he cannot maintain this • 
confidence he should so advise. There should be no doubt left in the 
mind of the informant that his relationship must remain on a confidential 
basis and if he violates the confidence he will ~e of no value and by 
so doing the Bureau 1 s investigative activity may be jeopardized. This 
roust be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you accept him 
as such, If the informant has a special problem which would require 
his revealing his relationship to his wife~ etc., this should be learned 
from him during the initial interview and a recommendation made to the 
Bureau when the results of the interview are furnished. The special 
circv.msJrnnces will be taken into consideration by the Bureau.· 
If a prospcoti vc informant is connected in any manner with a labor-. 
union, inform him that the Bureau is not interested in employer-.,. 
employee relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
information on the infiltration in labor unions by subversive elements. 
·If the potential informant is a student, teacher, or has any similar 
relations with a school, college, or university, in his initial interview 
and subsequent handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern­
ing investigations on the campuses of colleges and universities .... :• 
1-'rom the firat interview with a potent_ial informant -',;hrough his develop­
ment and until he is discontinued, extreme caution should be used at 
a~l times to be certain he is not a plant. 
When potential informant begins to furnish current information and 
other"'i,ise qualifies for designation as informant, assign permanent 
symbol number and advise B1.1reau. This communication must be personally 
initialed by SAC or ASAC acting in his absence; indi~idua1 1 s background 
must also be thoroughly re-viewed at i;his time, keeping in mind possibility 
of using informant as a. potential witness. If individual has any 
weaknessos, set forth safeguards being followed to insure security and 
to preY'::1t embarr2.s sment to Bureau.]
