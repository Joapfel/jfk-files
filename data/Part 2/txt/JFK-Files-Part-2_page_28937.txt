This will acknrf~ed,,e;e your inquiry regarding the check(s) for the 
month(s) of ~. /o/ 6 '7 ;:c,;;;, ~ ,,-,_e.-a,_,/ ~ ~-
The Treasury Department desires that each person promptly receive the 
amount due him but wishes to avoid unnecessary expense in recor~ search­
ing which results in many instances in finding the check was correctly 
paid. On a notice, such as you have furnished us, the Treasury Department 
must·necessarily search its payment records from the date of issuance of 
the check until the date that a substitute check will be issued. Because 
of the large volume of payments, the searching operation entails a ~eavy 
expense for each item. Accordingly, it is requested that you fill out 
the questionnaire on the reverse of this notice and RETURN IT IN THE 
ENCLOSED ENVELOPE. UNLESS THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS RErURNED NO FURTHER 
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. 
If you receive the check before hearing from the Treasury Department 
you should notify the social security district office shown above-. ~­
may use the enclosed post cara to notify us. After sending in this noti­
fication, you may cash the check. 
Upon receipt of this questionnaire, action if necessary, will be taken 
by the Treasury Department to place a stop payment on the check and to 
refer the case to the United States Secret Service for investigation and 
clearance so a duplicate check can be sent to you. The Treasury Depart­
ment will get in touch with you if it needs further information. 
Sincerely yours,_
