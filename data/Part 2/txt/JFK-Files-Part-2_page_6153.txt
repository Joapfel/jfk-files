In the case of che Kennedy assassination, how far are we willing to 
countenance secrecy when a fully illuminated rendition of the events surrounding 
cha President's murder could go a long way to restore trust in governmenc? At 
what point do the costs of concealing materials become sufficiently high to our 
government's credibility that they are no longer worth paying? At what point do 
the costs of disclosure become so great that we compromise our future security? 
Perhaps nowhere are these issues more acutely felt by the JFK Board than in 
those matters involving intelligence operations. •

The FBI literally asked all of its informants whether they could shed light on 
the murder. In addition, there were efforts to tap the FBI•s connection with 
organized crime to make certain ·chat its members, angry at the President and his 
brocher, had noe ordered the murder and that Ruby's killing of Oswald was not a 
classic mob hit. nl52 The resulting cables and ocher documents laid bare most of 
the Cold War intelligence capacity of the United States. nl53
