resolve uncertainties reflected your telegram of May 21 but your comments and 
requests for any necessary clarification' will be welcomed. 
2. Department appreciates valuable' work performed by Amb. Farland and your­
self and CAS in developing pro-US attitude among dissident elements. \'/ould hope 
this could be retained and strengthened but only if at a cost acceptabie from 
standpoint US national interest. If price tag for friendship of dissid~nts, • 
whose action capabilities and realistic prospects thus far remain unknown 
quantity, ,places too .great strain upon m.oral position and principles for which 
US stands or involves risis which in our considered judgment should not be accepted, 
feel sure you will agree we should stand.firm. 
3. While fully cognizant unique circumstances within Dominican Republic 
which precluded normal CAS operation, Department is nonetheless deeply concerned 
by degree to which covert activities this case have been forced to deviate from 
normal cover and cut-out safeguards with result USG too openly identified with 
what should be clandestine activities. 
4. Running through en tire dilemma has been conflict be't\-,reen two objec tivcs: 
(1) To be so associited with removal Trujillo regime as to derive 
crcdi t among Dlt dissidents and libcr al clements throu;;hou t La tin Amcric a; 
(2) To disassociate US from any obvious intervention in Dominican 
Republic and even more so from any political assassination which might occur.
