tional schedule for the initiation of an organized resistance move= 
• _,I ment inaide Cuba. The schedule will include the localities selected \ \ 
and the iu:uiessrru:int of some candidates. A full assessment will 
be completed in accordance with the schedule listed in para. 4, 
above, in conformance with Task 4. It should be noted, however, 
that this operational schedule (like the schedules called tor in 
Tasks 10, 26, and 30) will TH!cessarily be tentative and subject 
to later revision as the number of assets inside Cuba increases 
and as the flow of intelligence is augmented, Moreover, the 
development of a resistance movement w;n not remain controllable. 
so that operational timetables produced during the next four weeks 
can serve only as guides fo:r a proposed sequence o! actions.

t political action assets in the Caribbean a:rea and elsewhere in
