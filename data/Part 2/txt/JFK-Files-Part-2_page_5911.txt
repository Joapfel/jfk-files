Question 7 - Where are records~regarding operations that OS 
participated in or ran located? For example, where are the OS 
records on the Castro assassination attempts? 
~ecords on operations and/or projects in which the Office of 
Security was involved in the past have most likely been 
destroyed, unless they are maintained because of congressional 
directives or the records control schedules. The Office of 
Personnel Security has the capability of retrieving a listing of 
any current records with the pref::.x or "project" or "operation". 
If the title does not include these wc::::-ds, retrieveal would be 
more difficult unless an exact name er acronym is known for a 
parti=~lar operation or project. 
Question 8 - How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which QS. 
components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files 
on Oswald?
