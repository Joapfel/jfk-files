MEMORANDUM FOR: Assassination Records Review 
Board 
FROM: John F. Pereira 
Chief, Historical Review Group 
SUBJECT: Foreign Government Information 
• AustraTia-· 
(We request that this ~emorandum be returned to CIA once the 
Board has completed its deliberations on the issues discussed 
below.) 
1. (S) Issue: This memorandum will address CIA's position 
on the review and declassification of foreign government 
information that appears in the JFK collection. This issue has 
come to CIA's attention because of the recent review by the JFK 
Board of\ Australian Tiaisori~·documents. The Agency believes it is 
important to· address- th.l.s issue at this time because this is the 
first instance that this type of foreign liaison document has 
been reviewed by the Board and it is possible that such 
information will appear again in CIA's collection. This memo 
will, therefore, focus on the larger issue of a United States 
Government (USG) agency's legal obligations in the dissemination 
and declassification of foreign government information but will 
also address the specific issue of_the's1.x "Australian .. documents" 
(documents: rTcfo-iooi2-1oo·is, 1O4:::IQoi2-10079, 104-10012-10080, • 
:104-10012-10081, 104-10009-10222, 104-10009-10224).

2. (S) Conclusion: CIA does not object to the release of the 
information in these (~sixi documents, but is only concerned about 
protecting foreign government information. Therefore, the Agency 
does not object to the release of the four CIA documents in the 
redacted form proposed by the Board. With regards to the ,
1
two ·: 
:Australian letters_,~ the Agency has no authority to unilaterally 
'agree ·to 'their-release in any form. Pursuant to its legal 
obligations, CIA ordinarily seeks the consent of the foreign 
government prior to declassifying their information. 'However, 
1 for reasons described herein~ it isn<5t possible to even seek the 
consent of the Australians at this time, nor would it be likely 
. that the Australians would give it. Rather than going to the 
Australians against its better judgment or requ~~'tJng the
