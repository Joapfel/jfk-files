Presumably Mr. Hilsman was also acting in response to NSA.M 181. 
In any case, the paper he requested and the Board ·memorandum 
already requested by the DD/I were combined. Successive drafts 
of such a paper, prepared by the ONE sta"ff, were quickly over-
. taken by the photography which became available after 29 August. 
At the USIB meeting of 7 September, further attempts to write 
it were deferred until the new information could be digested. 
This estimate, SNIE 85-3-62, was in fact passed by USIB on 19 
September. Its substance will be discussed later. (See Paras. 
26-29) 
. 17. Also at the 29 August USIB. meeti1;1g, two other pert i- . 
nent subjects were discussed. First, General Carter and Mr. 
Cline raised the question of more rapid delivery from Turkey 
and Denmark of .Navy photography of outbound Soviet ships {see 
para. 6). Second, General Carter informed the Board that he 
had two days earlier asked General Lemnitzer about the possi­
bility of low-level photography using RF-101 or FSU aircraft 
and that Lernnitzer had replied that something "could be dug up." 
The conversation with Lemnitzer was the result of an instruction 
telephoned from out of town by the DCI, who was concerned over 
the long delay of the 29 August mission by weather. (The DCI 
departed Washington on leave.,0n 23 August, went first to the 
West Coast, left the country on 30 August for the Riviera, and 
returned to Washington on 23 Septe·mber.) On 30 August Lernni tzer 
told the Special Group of this discussion with General Carter. 
The Group agreed to take cognizance of the matter and reopen it 
"when specific targets and information needs could be identified."
