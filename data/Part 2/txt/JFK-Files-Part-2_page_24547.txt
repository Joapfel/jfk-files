"Mr. Helms: " ... killing was not part of the CIA's policy. 
It was not part of the CiA's armory ... but in this Castro 
operation ... I have testified as best I could about the 
atmosphere of the time, what I understood was desired (and) 
that this was getting rid of Castro, if he had been gotten 
rid of by this means that this would have been acceptable 
to certain individuals ... I was just doing my best to do 
what I thought I was supposed to do.'' (Helms, 6/13. pp.87-88). 
When asked why he did not seek clarification from the Special 
Group, its members, or Robert Kennedy whether it was ''in fact, the 
policy of the U.S. Government to actually kill Fidel Castro," Helms 
answered "I don't know ... " 
'' ... There is something about the whole chaih of episodes 
in conncection with this Roselli business that I am 
simply riot able to bring back in a coherent fashion. 
And there was something about the ineffectuality of all 
this, or the lack of convictio~ that anything ever 
happened, that I believe in the end made this thing 
simply collapse, disappear. And I don't recall what I 
was bri~fed on at the time. Maybe I was kept currently 
informed and maybe I wasn't, and today I don't remember 
it ... But I do not recall ever having been convinced 
that any attempt was really made on Castro's life. And 
since I didn't believe any attempt had been made on 
Castro's life, I saw no reason to pursue the matter 
further." (Helms, 7/18, pp.31-32). 
f. llelms' Perception of the Relevance of Special Group 
Controls to Assa~sination Activity 
The evidence concerning the control system established by the_ 
Special Group for the Mongoose Operation is discussed above (Seep. __ ). 
Helms stated, however, that the control system established by the 
Special Group for Mongoose was not intended to apply to assassination 
activity. (Helms, 7/18, p.21). Thus, with respect to the Special Group 
Augmented's decision on March 5, 1962 that major operations going beyond 
the collection of intelligence must receive ad;v~n,ce.-ilPP.liiovaJ,., ... H,eli;n~-~ i ··•-: h~ ·i'\ tlJ:, \V' re ll e:,\ 't
