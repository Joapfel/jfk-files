Muse and the FBI would be maintained by him a..l'ld would go 
no further. Muse's supervisor said he was cognizant of 
the im:porta:nce of Muse's cooperation with th~ FBI remaining 
confidential. 
The New-Orleans Divi~ion of the :FBI never conducted any il1vestigation regarding NOLAO and Muse 
never furnished information concerning its activities. 
. I hope this in_formatlon will clarify the issue 
... f'or· you. If I may be of fii.rther assistance in this matter,
