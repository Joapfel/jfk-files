Mr. Schwarz. These are minutes of the Special Group which 
you attended, and it states: "Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on 
progress to date with agent teams and in the general field of 
intelligence, including the Opa-locka interrogation center~­
He outlined 
various difficulties encountered and said that three agent teams 
had been infiltrated." 
Now did Mr. Harvey, at that meeting, state anything -- do 
you recollect Mr. Harvey making that report? 
General Lansdale. In general terms, yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did he state anything relating to the 
passage of pills to persotis to accomplish the assassination of 
Fidel Castro in the week prior to this meeting? 
General Lansdale. No. As a matter of fact, we were very 
proud that he had gotten these teams in, that they had been 
infiltrated, and so forth, and collecting intelligence. 
Mr. Schwarz. Were they the first teams? 
General Lansdale. Yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. Did he say anything at that meeting that 
you racall about the subject of assassinations? 
General Lansdale. Nothing. 
Mr. Schwarz. Would you give the witness the May 7th '62
