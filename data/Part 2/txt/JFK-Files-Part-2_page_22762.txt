From the counter-intelligen.ce rs't~ff standpoint, in 
particular what I was concerned with was an attempt to make 
sure that there was a full integration. rou see, under the 
operating procedures and the responsibilities, tho military 
services are required to advise the CIA of its activities, 
counter-intelligence and so forth abroad. In turn, they 
adviso the FDI of thoir counter-intelligence activities and 
so forth here in the United States. 
So you h~ve, wheri an activity here in the United States, 
the individual involved, the double agent, the controlled 
foreign asset transfers abroad, then there is a transfer of 
coordination and vice versa . 
Mr. Angleton, I'd like to inject this. There is 
concurrent jurisdiction sinca the double is usually an American 
citizen. So regardless of where he is, we would always 
the Army or whoever it is, to notify the Dureau through 
own chann~l hecause you're dealing with Americans, so 
geography is not really the important element ..

Mr. Miler. From a counter-intelligence standpoint, 
it has had, there have been some problems as a result of that 
in terms of the regular CIA representation abroad. There is 
a means of working together with the military services and 
so forth in terms of notifying each of the services, each of 
the agencies of the potcntial .for deception fee<ling and 
' go forth.
