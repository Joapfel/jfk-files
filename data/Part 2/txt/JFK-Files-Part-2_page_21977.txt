this impression was derived solely f:oml3o_t_tlieb-'·aj meetings 
with Bi_ssell and Tweedy. Neither @:g.ftlieb]nor the~hief oU 
Station had first-hand knowledge of Allen Dulles' statements 
about Presidential authorization. Richard Bissell assumed 
that such authorization had been conveyed to him by Dulles, 
but Bissell had no specific recollection of any event when 
this occurred. 
The evidence leads us to conclude that DDP Bissell and 
DCI Dulles knew about and authorized the plot to assassinate 
Lumumba. However, we are unable to make a finding that 
President Eisenhower intentionally authorized an assassination 
effort against Lu.uumca because of the lack of absolute certainty 
in the evidence.
