Harvey testified that the·"executive action" capab-ility• 
was intended to include assassinations (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 35). 
His cryptic handwritten notes of the January 25/26 meetings; pre­
served at the CIA, contain phrases which sucgest a discussion of 
assassination--and Harvey confirmed this ·interpretation:. "last 
resort beyond last resort and a confession of weakness"·, "the 
magic button"; and "never mention.word assassination'•'. (Harvey, 
Ex. 1, 6/25/75):* 
The Inspector General's Report did not mention these 
notes, or their dates. ·However, in describi.ng Richard llissell' s 
. initial assignment of _the "executive· ac·tion" project tb Harvey, 
it referred to another set _of Harvey's notes, which were destroyed 
after the preparation of the Report. The excerpt from these note~ 
quoted Bis.sell as saying to Harvey, • "The White House had twice 
urged me to create such a capability" (I. G:, P. 37) . . Harvey :also: 
testified that this "urging" was mentioned in his initial d:i,s­
c.ussion of "ixecutive action" with Bissell (Harvey, 6/25/75; 'P· 37). 
However, the· testimony from Bissell and White House aides ·in the 
• Kennedy and Eisenhower Administrations is in conflict with Harvey,' s 
testimony as ·to whether such ''urging" had in fact been given .to 
Bissell. 
-1, Harvey '--S notes .also contained a phrase which suggests his con­
cern that any U.S. assassiriation attempts n1ight breed retaliation 
from other governments_: "dangers of RIS (Russian Int:elU'r;ence 
Service) counter-action and monitor if.they are blameu." (Harvey, 
Ex. 1, 6/25/75; l:lissell, Ex, 1, 7/17/75).
