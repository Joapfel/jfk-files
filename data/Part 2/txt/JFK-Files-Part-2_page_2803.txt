SECTION C (Continued) NARRATIVE COMMENTS William M. Kent 
government's economic credibility both in Chile and abroad. These 
efforts undoubtedly have played a role in Chile's increasing dif­
ficulties in obtaining badly needed foreign financial assistance. 
In the course of his duties Mr. Kent was called upon to meet 
and handle several key Chileans concerning matters affecting covert 
operations in Chile. In one case he made the first Agency contact 
with an important Chilean business leader who will be taken over 
shortly by the Santiago Station. This individual is a leader of 
the Chilean private sector which has become of increasing interest 
to the Station's operations. 
Mr. X&nt ably supervisied the activities of the two other 
officers and secretary in his Section during the rating period. 
In addition to his regular duties, he has frequently been called 
upon to fill in for the Branch Chief and/or the Deputy Branch Chief 
during absences of the latter two officers. In all such cases he 
displayed sound judpent and a thorough grasp of both the FI and 
CA operations beins conducted in Chile. 
In conclusion, it should be noted that Mr. Kent has turned in 
an unusually strong across-the-board performance during the highly 
active period covered by this report. It has been a real pleasure 
to have worked with an individual of this high competence and 
dedication.
