I don't know that I would have taken that as a clearcut order 
as Mr. Johnson apparently did. And I think perhaps others 
present may have interpreted it other ways. But I am pretty 
sure that if the President had said you go and get rid of him, 
shoot him or something -- I just can't conceive of him 
doing that. But I can conceive of him saying, let's take 
action and get this situation rectified, which is moreorless 
along the lines of the various memoranda you have shown me. 
Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear the President make such a 
remark about Lumum,1::>a, let's get rid of him, or let's take 
action right away on this? 
Mr. Dillon. I don't remember that. But certainly this 
was the general feeling of Govern.ment at that time, and it 
wouldn't have been if the President hadn't agreed with it. 
Mr. Baron. So although you have no recollection of being 
present at the meeting that Robert Johnson recounts, you 
would find his testimohy at least plausible? 
Mr. Dillon. It is possible. But I would think anything 
like this was not a direct order to have an assassination, 
but let's take some.action to get rid of Lumumba, get him 
out of office.

tion? 
Mr. Dillon. It would have been up to the CIA as to what 
they thought. And they co~ld have well thought that. That
