The Rcso!utio:1 of the SccurityCouncil)''1ovcmbcr 22nd 1967, 
and :::.!l further proposals cxp!aining or m.)difying it, are inadequate 
and irrelevant from ,ur point of view, and therefore are totally 
ru.d categorically unacceptctb1c to us. 
All s•tch proposals skirt the rca! issue and avoid its core, 
namely: the right of the Palestinians to liberate their coun.tri;, to 
enjo)a ·.~~ and homes, anc to have the right to decide how they 
want-.un.1t. . 
·we, the people of ?ales~ine, are carrying on an armed revolu­
tion in order to re-establish pe:::.ce with jm:tice in the Holy Land. 
Vie v.ould like you to consider the magnitude of our problc111. 
For ·we arc facing a Zionist structure that ha~:t ~ts r9ots in 19th 
century Elfropc, at the heart of the imperi3.list n1ov~mcnt. Zio,1ism 
is one of the 1r..osl oppressive and :igr;-r.::ssivc forms_ of impcrlalism, 
o:ne t!1:it has as its m:-Jor goal the tot::.1 uprooting of one people 
fro.n a C0:lntry to replace thtm by another. 
The roots of the aggr.::ssion lie in the Zionist ideology itself, 
with its belief in the need to bring a select, chosen people without 
a lar:d, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people. 
. • methods 1'.sed to accomplish this objective arc terror, 
oppn:_ -~ and deceit. 
Let: me quote one of the original Jewish pioneers in Palestine, 
Nathan· Cho:shi, who wrote to the editor of the Jewish Newsletter 
in Fcbn~:1ry 1959: 
. "Ii 'yon rca11y wanted to know wh:,t happencd 1 we old Jewish 
settler- In P~!cstir:c who w.itneEscd the fight could tell you how 
and ~u wh~;,t :r:t3.n.ncr we Jews forced the Ar;,ibs to leave cities 
and ·vrllagcs ... Some of the,p were driven out by force of arms;

• Professor ErZeh Fromm, the noted Jewish writer and thinker, 
h3.cl this to add: "It is often said that the .r\rabs fled, that they left 
the country volunt:-,dy, 2.21d that they thc!"cfore bc:.,:r the respo:1Si­
bi!ity fer lcs:.ng {heir property and their land. But, in genera 
internu.tiona.l h:.w, the principl.::: holds trut: th,tt no citizen loses hi . 
property or his rights of citizer..ship, and the citizenship right is : . 
de facto right to which the Arabs in P.-.lcstiP..c bwe much more 
legitiraacy than the Je,vs. Just because the Arabs fled? "Professor 
Fro,rr, .. :n.1 asks. "Since when. is th<'-t um1.isl:ablc b)' confiscation of . . 
property and by bdng barred 11:om returning to the !and on whid1 
a people's forefrthcrs have lived for generations? The cbim of 
the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a realistic political chim. 
If all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their 
forefathers h~vc lived two thous:-:.nd years ago this wo:rld wquld 
be a mad.house." 
The Zionists went ahead colclbloodeclly with their sinister 
scheme to vacate P,1lc:::tinc of its people, by the use cf terror, 
J,1.assacrcs and frightening rumors. • 
Arthur Kocstlci·, the pro-Zionist author, described what 
happern:d at Deir Yassin 011 April 9th, 19·18, as the "blood bath 
that was the psychologically decisive factor in the Arabs' 
spccto.cular exodm." 
On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvci 
Leumi killed 250 m.:.:n, wonicn and childrt~n. After 1918 there 
were other mass killings in occupcd Palestine, e.g. Ikrit ( 1951 ), Al 
Tira (1953), ,-\bu Ghosh (1953), Kafr Kassem (1956), etc,, as 
p:rrt of the systematic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation 
cf the Palestinians, to be replaced by J cwish settlers frqm all 
over thi; world. 
These were the conditions that forced 'the Palcstirtians to leave 
theh· homeland. 
The Zionists did not·come to a ccuniry without oeople. There 
lived in Palestine a eo le with a civilization. The i·c~;ted 'to the
