ReAL letter to New York, dated 8/30/72, wherein 
Albany asked to be advised of any active investigation being 
conducted r.e WONAAC, or if any active investigation is 
warranted by Albany, FBI. 
For the information of the Albany Division, the 
New York Office is the office of origjn, concerning captioned 
organization. The Bureau has advised that as the Socialist 
Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play a major 
roll in WONAAC throughout the United States, and inasmuch . !· 
as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the 
most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/ 
Young Socialist Alliance, the activities of this aganization 
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the 
extent of influence and control~ by individuals who are 
members of Socialist Wori~ers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance, 
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations. 
Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of 
inf?_!.~ion set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning 
DIAN¥t'~RRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the 
Utica, Nen Y,o;d( area, and her reported communication with 
national headquarters of WONAAC in Ne~-J York City. It ~-Jould 
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such 
investigation, as it deems appropriate to ascertain the extent 
of Socialist Workers Party/Young Socialist Alliance activity 
in its division in connection \•1ith WONAAC.
