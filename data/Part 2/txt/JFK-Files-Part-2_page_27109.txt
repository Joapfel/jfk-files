mis interpreted. Upon informing Edgewood Arsena 1 of this decision, Bos ton 
was told that while Edge1,ood would dispose of chemical material for the CIA, 
it would not do so in the case of biological materials since that was not con­
sistent with the mission of the arsenal. No further efforts toward the disposal 
of the material have taken place, and it remains under guard in the OTS vault. 
Operational Uses of MKNAOMI Material. 
There is no record associating the project with actual operations. Dis­
cussions with those involved in the project indicate that hand-launchers with 
darts loaded with· dog incapacitant may have been delivered for use in 
S.E. Asia. They also indicate that some of the material or cropjspoilarits may 
have.been employed. While no direct connections to assassination planning have 
been found, there are some disturbing similarities between the agents being 
. investigated at Fort Detrick and some of the reported schemes for incapacitating 
or a·ssassinating Castro. For example, botulinum pills were reportedly provided 
fn February 1961 and again in April 1962 for use against Castro. Such pills 
were made for the.Agency at Fort Detrick and the record shows the delivery of 
some in the same time period as the 1962 attempt. Another scheme in 1960 · 
involved the treatment of cigars with botulinum toxin; the comparable treatment 
of cigarettes is reported in MKNAOMI files. Consideration was given to the 
administration of shellfish toxin with a pin device in late 1960. Both the 
toxin and pin delivery devices were developed at Fort Detrick. The diving 
suit scheme in 1963 involved dusting the inside of the suit with a fungus 
which would produce madura foot, a serious, non-specific, skin disease. Work
