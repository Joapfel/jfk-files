contractors that an aircraft of particular design can be built at a given cost 
within a specific time-frame. Next, we have the judgments of the Evaluation 
Group regarding feasibility, and the degree to which the designs would or 
would not satisfy the stated requirements. Then the Source Selection Board 1 
using factors weighted by judgment, made a recommendation which appeared 
to place greater emphasis on potential bonus factors in certain operational 
areas, rather than on dependability of development and predictability .of 
costs~ This recommendation, understandably, was seconded by the Navy 
and Air Staffs, since these officers are most vitally interested in obtaining 
the ultimate in performance in individual weapons systems. On occasion, 
this desire leads to the establishment of characteristics for weapons 
systems which cannot be met within the time or funds available, and it 
has frequently resulted in lowering operational effectiveness. 
There is only one way I know to minimize. the compounding of error 
that can occur through this pyramiding of judgment, and that way is to apply 
the judgment of the decision,-maker not only to the final recommendation 9 
but also to. the underlying recommendations and facts. This I did to the 
best of my ability. In doing so, I found it necessary to balance the promises 
held out by competing contractors, against the hopes and aspirations of 
military officers, and the limiting realities of economics and technology. 
That I attach great importance to the principle of free competition 
l 
is, I believe, demonstrated by my insistence that competition ·continue
