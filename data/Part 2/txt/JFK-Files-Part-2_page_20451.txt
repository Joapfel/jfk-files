RE: ·DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY 
IN VIETNAM; WASHINGTON, D~Co, JANUARY 15, 1968 
CONFIDENTIAL 
TAIMI HALOI~n; and THORUN ROBEL were mij_d:i.y self­
critical about not working for the programs the younger women 
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long 
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January 
20th at Mt~ Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the 
Seattle delegation would report, HALONEN made the observation, 
however, that the women working on the program were all very 
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a 
satisfactory programo • 
On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including 
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in 
Washington, DC. It was learned here that the instructions 
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were 
evidently for the California group only, because many California 
people had been bad:y beaten in previous demonstrations and 
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The 
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed 
"Jearre-tte Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were 
pass~d out and these appeared to be the official instructions. 
A reprcduction is a·ttached.

After the demonstra~!on, HEALY dnd RADER s~ent much 
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some­
thing about the sta~us of the American Indian. ELLA BAKE~ from
