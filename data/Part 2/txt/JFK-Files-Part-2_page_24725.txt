of "disposing of1' Lumumba. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 70.) .Bisiell 
was not preient at the NSC meeting (NSC Minutes, 9/21/60) ~ 
Bissell's opinion stands in opposition to that of Gordon 
Gray, the· President ,·s National Security Advisor,· who likewise 
testified that he could not remember the NSC discussion in which ·, 
he participated (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 57). When asked to interpret 
the reference to "disposing of'' Lumumba, Gray said he "put it. in 
' ' 
the same categoryas.' 'get rid of', 'eliminate'" (Gray, 7/9/75, 
p. 5 7). • Early in his testimony, Gray stated that "assassinati~:m 
could have been on the minds of some people when they used 
these words "'eliminate' or 'get rid of"' (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 17). 
Nonetheless, when asked to comment on the minutes of the NSC 
meeting of September 21, he said: "It was not my impression 
that we had in mind the assassination of Lumumba" (Gray, 7/9/75, 
?', John Eisenhower, who attended the .NSC meeting as Assistant 
White House Staff Secretary, said that he had no "direct 
recollection" of the discussion but he found the minutes of 
the meeting consonant with his "recollection of the atmosphere" 
at the time: "the U.S. position was very much anti-Lumumba" 
(Eisenhower, 7/18/75, p. 9). He said:- • 
I would not conjecture that the words "disposed of" 
meant an assassination, if for no other reason than 
if I had something as nasty as this to plot, I wouldn't 
do it in front of 21 people . . the number present 
[at]. the meeting. (Eisenhower, 7/18/75, p. 10.)
