MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT 
SUBJECT: ~r. William M. Kent, Period: 1 January - 20 May 1977 
I. As 1 depart from the assignment as Chief, Non­
official Cover Branch, Career Management Staff, I should 
like to make a final comment on the performance of Mr. Kent 
who has served with me during the entire period of my 
assignment and who, since March 1976, has been my deputy. 
More specifically, the period since I January 1977 has been 
a trying one for this component and has culminated with its 
sudden transfer from one component (CMS) to another (ADDO/D). 
2. During this most recent period, Mr. Kent has 
demonstrated his capacity for growth and leadership. He has 
himself handled virtually all of the transition aspects for 
the Branch, involving briefings and counsel for his new 
overall chief (the ADD0/0) and for hjs new branch chief. 
He has served in the past 30 days substantially as acti,g 
branch chief, given my fairly lengthy TOY absence abroad 
during that period. I can only reiterate my judgment in the 
last fitness report that Kent is a senior and mature supervjsory 
officer, very well organized in his work habits and capable 
of making measured judgments and decisions. His continuity 
in all aspects of nonofficial cover and its ramifications makes 
him a valued and valuable staff officer. I would say his 
..... future ccntribution __ lies in the entire area 9£ manaiin&._and 
.iiuid111Ji! .lU.I.£.c;;.~s;>,ra,t,e l?er~ounel.. I have noted the clear prog'ress 
lien'as made in the past year~in taking supervisory decisions 
involving personnel, firmly and crisply. 
3. Given his impressive field anJ Headquarters experience, 
Kent should be given an opportunity to display his ~orth in 
future Directorate assignments involving discretion, 
professionalism and maturity. I give him an unquestioned "Strong" 
for this final period he has served with me.
