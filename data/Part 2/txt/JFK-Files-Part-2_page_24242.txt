The Inspector General was invited in, according to Houston. In 
addition, the Finance Office kept its own books, in the proprietary

We were very conscious of the amount of money in­
volved and the possibilities of someone trying to,

b) THE CURRENT STATUS 
The project currently consists of twenty-six (26) companies 
of which five (5) are domestic. All of the clients of MHMUTUAL 
are under non-official cover.** The Office of Finance has indi­
cated that the current net worth of the project is $18 million 
which is the result of retaining earnings. It was originally 
capitalized in 1962 with $4 million. A Washington, D. C. lawyer 
(MHANVIL) is currently the investment manager and he provides day­
to-day direction. Ml-IANVIL is a sole proprietorship proprietary 
of the Office of General Counsel. Total assets are currently 
** MHMUTUAL itself is only for covert non-staff officers of the CIA. 
In essence, it only works for what would broadly be described as 
"agents," those not entitled to participate in the CIA retirement 
plan or in the Civil Service Reitrement Plan. They are primarily 
foreigners·, and usually DDO employees. Those individuals who were 
formerly known as contract agents and who are now known as independ­
ent contractors also participate in MHMUTUAL. In the case of most 
agents, the CIA contributes 7 percent and the agent contributes 
7 percent, in keeping with CIA practice for regular employee~. In 
cases where the agent is well along in years and contributions from 
the Agency and the agent would not provide enough funds to capital­
ize an annuity, the Agency provides the initial capitalization; how­
ever, approval of this must come from the DDO.
