Parrott that he prefered that the State Department, or Mr. 
Woodward in the State Department, not be told about the 
Presidential interest in the matter. First; was there a 
Presidentfal interest in the matter? Ygu have no reason to 
doubt that there was, I take it . 
Mr. Bundy. I am sorry, I was reading a note, and I 
didn't hear the last part of the question. 
Mr. Schwarz. I asked really two questions, the first 
of which is a direct question, was there a Presidential 
interest in the matter? 
Mr, Bundy. There was a Presidential -- there was no 
doubt in my mind that when I write in a National Security 
Action Memorandum a plan as desired, that the desire is not 
mine. 
Mr. Schwarz. 1\nd the desire is in fact the Presidents? 
Mr. Bundy. Yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, have you any other recollection of 
calling your attention to the fall of 1969? 
Mr. Bundy. Could I go back and comment on your earlier 
question. 
You correctly pointed out that there was concern to 
keep the President's name out of this process of request,
