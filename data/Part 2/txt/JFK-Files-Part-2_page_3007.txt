TOP SECRET 
Finally, the reader of this volume should gain 
-·some insights to the character of various of the 
principal actors -- Agency and non-Agency who were 
involved most closely with the Government's anti-Castro 
policy during the period from its inception through 
the close of the Eisenhower administration. Not all 
of these impressions are_flattering; but the author, 
who was in no way associated with the operation or 
the Directorate of Plans (now Operations), hopes that 
the presentation of the evidence has been as free from 
bias as possible. 
Again the author wishes to ackno~ledge the valu-. 
able contributions of the other two members of the CIA 
History Staff, Mrs. Eulalie Hammond and Mrs. Sharon 
Bond,·- to the completion of this volume. Witl:1out their 
unfailing willingness to perform either the 'substantive 
research or the grimly mechanical tasks required in 
' 
preparing a volume such as this, the task could have 
been interminable. 
For any errors of fact or questionable interpreta­
tions, the.author alone is responsible.
