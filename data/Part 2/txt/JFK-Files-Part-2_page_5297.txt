lS_L___, 5. ~IL-:-97 - - a CIA Penetration {pt the Cuban/ 
fEmba~¥,J. The identity of LITAMIL-9 was ingdvertentl 
released in 1993. He is now identified in true name as a 
CIA agent in John Newman's book, Oswald and the CIA. As of 
1993, LITAMIL-9Jwas -still alive, living i / M • o cit and 
he has family in/Cuba3 Up to now, the ARRB Board has agreed 
to protect his identity and crypt and delay the release of 
his 201 file until the Agency could make some judgments 
about the potential damage created by the release on 
additional documents with his name/crypt in them. 
Status and Issues: The ARRB has requested that we address 
{LI-9iissue at the May meeting. The DO has confirmed that 
~ is still alive and living in {Mexico City). The p!RP /DO 
JFK teams are currently reviewing the 201 and other/LI-9] 
material in the file. It is unlikely that the Board would 
agree to delay release until 2017, however, there is 
precedent for delaying release of records on individuals for 
shorter periods or until death.
