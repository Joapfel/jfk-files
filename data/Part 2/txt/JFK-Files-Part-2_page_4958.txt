SENSIND: EO PAGE: 
DENIALS OF CIA PRESENCE IN JAPAN WOULD BE USED AS A CLUB BY THE LEFT 
TO ATTACK LDP SUPPORT FOR THE US-JAPAN MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY AND THE 
PRESENCE OF US FORCES IN JAPAN. WITH A STATE VISIT BY THE US 
PRESIDENT FAST APPRO~CHING AND DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS OVER US BASES IN 
OKINAWA LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO 1997, THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY 
BAD TIME TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT US ACTIVITIES 
AND INTENTIONS IN JAPAN. 
4. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CIA PRESENCE WOULD ALSO REVIVE OLD 
CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE LARGELY RECEDED FROM THE HEADLINES. IN 1995, 
THE PRESS MADE A MAJOR ISSUE OF CIA FUNDING FOR THE LDP IN ITS 
FORMATIVE YEARS. ANYTHING THAT LENT CREDIBILITY TO THE STORY WOULD 
BE A SERIOUS POLITICAL LIABILITY FOR THE LDP .• THEN FOREIGN MINISTER 
AND LDP PRESIDENT KONO YOHE! PERSONALLY ASKED AMBASSADOR MONDALE THAT 
THE.US GOVERNMENT NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT. KONO 
EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADOR MONDALE THAT THE LDP CAN DEAL WITH RUMORS AND 
EVEN UNCONFIRMED LEAKS, BUT OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA ACTIVITY. IN 
JAPAN .WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AFFAIR, THREATENING TO DAMAGE 
BOTH THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE US-JAPAN 
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP. KONO EXPLICITLY IMPRESSED ON THE AMBASSADOR 
THE NEED FOR THE US GOVERNMENT TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST DISCLOSURE. 
5. IN THE FALL OF 1995, A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ALLEGED THAT 
THE CIA HAD WIRETAPPED HASHIMOTO.RYUTARO, WHO HAS SINCE BECOME PRIME 
MINISTER. IN RESPONS~ TO THE ENSUING PRESS QUERIES, JAPANESE 
OFFICIALS OF THE CONCERNED MINISTRY DISMISSED THE STORY AS 
IMPLAUSIBLE. IF THE US GOVERNMENT DECLASSIFIES A DOCUMENT THAT 
CONFIRMS CIA PRESENCE. IN JAPAN, IT WOULD HAND THE .::(APANESE PRESS NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES TO REOPEN THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND 
ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND ITS FRIENDS WITHIN THE JAPANESE 
GOVERNMENT. 
6. DISRUPTION OF LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS: THE JAPANESE .SERVICES 
GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES SECRET. , IN THE CASE.OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS, ALL CONTACT COULD BE SEVERED IN THE EVENT OF 
DISCLOSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT. SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP 
DEFIES EASY REPAIR. THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT 
KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO 
DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY. 
7. IMPACT ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS: OUR ONGOING COOPERATION 
WITH A JAPANESE LIAISON SERVICE IN PURSUIT OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST GROUP COULD BE TOTALLY DISRUPTED BY DISCLOSURE. EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT US LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE EQUITIES ARE AT,S~AKE 
IN THIS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR. THE TERRORIST GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT 
AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE 
THAT REMINDED THEM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF US-JAPANESE COOPERATION 
AGAINST THEM COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT 
INTELLIGENCE ON THE GROUP. 
8. IMPACT ON SOURCES: STATION'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AT LEAST ONE 
*SOURCE PREDATES THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.> PUBLICITY ABOUT CIA PRESENCE 
AND ACTIVITY, EVEN IN THE PAST, OFTEN CAUSES SOURCES TO WONDER ABOUT 
SECRET
