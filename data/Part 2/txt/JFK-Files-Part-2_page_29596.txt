The discovery that the Me~icans were also aware of 
the conversations would have·made holding back·the 
_transcripts perilo~s in that the Mexicans.could have 
. re·vealed their existence to the detriment of the 
Station. Hence, the full report followed very shortly· 
after the meeting between the Mexican Pres~_dent and 
Win Scott, and imrnedj.ately after Scott discussed the 
situation with his nominal superior in Washington 
by telephone. Scottis superior was asked aborit this . 
. He said that he did not remember the substance of 
his telephone call to Wir: Scott on the 23rd. (HSCA 
Deposition of John Scelsc, 5/16/78, p. 88) "I do 
not have any idea why (I called). I may have been 
ordered to call him on ary number of things." (Ibid., 
p. 87.) He was also asked about Scott's meetin_g_'_ 
with·the Mexican Presidert. 
You get a psychologiccl question. The Chief· 
-of Station is called jn·to speak to the Presi­
dent of Mexico. • There had been a big fight 
when the new Ambassadc-r got there--no, it wasn't 
that. It was a very I•eculiar situation in Mexi­
co whereby the Mexicar. President's primary con­
tact with the U.S. go,ernrnent was through our 
Chief of Station rathe·r • than through the Ambas­
sadors. :This caused 1,0 great problem with the 
then-.Ampassador whose n~me I have forgctte~. 
·o: Thomas Mann? 
A: Yes. He was aver~· fine guy and recognized 
the usefulness of .1:his arrangement. The next 
Ambassador, Mr. FrEieman, tried to cut Win 
Scott out of contact with the President of 
Mexico, whereupon i:he President of Mexico 
called in Win Scot;: and said, "I want you to 
send a cable to th1! White House· telling them 
I am not going to deal with this jackass,·! 
want to deal only Hith you." 
So, the result was. eventually, Winston 
Scott and Ambassadnr Freeman went to.the 
White House and talked to President Johnson.
