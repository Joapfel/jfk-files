For this and all subsequent messages intended for the Army Attache, 
the secret CIA communications channel was used. 
Both General Philpott and Thomas Karamessines testified that ini­
tially the Army Attache would be used only to "obtain or procure" in­
telligence on Chilean military officers.* (Philpott, p. 11; Karamessines, 
p. 6) The September 28, 1970 message to the Army Attache, however, did 
in fact trigger his deep involvement in the coup attempt. According to 
the Attache's testimony, he received day-to-day instructions from the 
,\---~Chief of Station, and on occasion, the COS would show him messages 
\ 
ostensibly from Generals Bennett and/or Philpott, directing him to 
take certain actions. The COS also transmitted messages from the Army 
Attache to these Generals. 
General Bennett testified that he never had knowledge of Track II 
and that he never received any communication relating thereto, nor did 
he ever authorize the transmission of any messages to the Army Attache. 
General Philpott also testified that he had no recollection of anything 
connected with Track II after his initial meeting with General Cushman 
on September 28. (Philpott, p. 16) 
U. S. Army Colonel Robert C. Roth, who in September and October 1970 
was the Chief of the Human Resources Division, Director of Collection, DIA, 
* In this connection it should be noted that when questioned about 
this letter, General Philpott testified that he recalled,signing 
an authorization such as that contained in the firstparagraph of
