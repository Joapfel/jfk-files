What this Resolution proposes is a comprehensive, government­
wide review of the Kennedy assassination records conducted under 
the auspices of an impartial, independent board. 
• It may be useful to state precisely what these records are. 
First, they encompass all of the records of the FBI, the CIA, 
Secret Service, military intelligence, and other Executive branch 
agencies which may pertain to the Kennedy assassination. They 
also include the records of the Warren commission, the Rockefeller 
commission, the Church committee, and the House Select Committee 
on Assassinations. Many of these records are now stored under 
seal at the National Archives, while many others remain in agency 
files. The Rockefeller Commission files were claimed by President 
,ord as part of his personal papers and then deeded by him to the 
Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There may be 
other relevant records at the Kennedy and Johnson presidential 
. libraries. These presidential li~rary records are administered by 
the National Archives, and thus we envision that they would be 
" subject to this Joint Resolution. 
I can report to you briefly on the status of one group ·of 
these records -- the Church committee files, which are now in the 
custody of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. All of 
the Church committee files are housed in some 500 boxes in a 
single small room at the National Archives. There is a 
rudimentary index,· but it is not always sufficiently descriptive,
