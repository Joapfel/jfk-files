Agency and staying with the.operation. Both of them 
said "This isn't going to work, it's useless." 
BL: This was exactly when Sam? 
SH: About a week before the invasion, I don't even know the 
date but it happened on a Sunday. 
BL: What was the precipitating issue that caused the~ to 
reach that? 
SH: Air. 
BL: The air strikes? 
SH: Yes, the cut on the _air support.

Plus, I think Bissell really thought he had a deal 
going on an assassination plot of some kind. It makes 
no sense that all of these things wouldn't bother him -
including not talking to the President again, in Rusk's
