"The committee• s acoustics experts tested a Dictabelt recording of radio 
traffic on Dallas police channels and said they were 95 percent certain there 
had been a fourth shot, therefore a second shooter and a conspiracy. 11 
A retest by the National Academy of Sciences discredited the cammittee•s 
experts, concluding that the recording was made a minute after the shooting, 
Posner said. 
Half of 
11
Case Closed.'1 is a meticulous examination of Oswald• s entire 11 fe, 
culminating in an almost day-by-day chronicle of his movements in the last two 
months before the assassination. 11l1any conspiracy books almost ignore Oswald. 
But he1 s the key, and it 1 s amazing how much is known about him,11 Posner said. 
0 It's certainly enough to disprove all the theories that he was a spy or a 
patsy. 
11Ny technique was to go to original sources. Too many books quote secondary 
sources, some of which are passing on misinformation, which means the garbage is 
disseminated again and again, becoming fact. 
•iHere•s an example. 1 JFK1 opens with Rose Cheramie, a prostitute, warning her 
doctors tliat the Kennedy assassination is going to, take place in Dallas and 
naming Ruby as involved. I_ found her doctor, who said she was psychotic and 
didn't mention the assassination until.the day after it happened or Ruby until 
the day after he killed Oswald.11 
Posner paused. 11 I can go on. 11
