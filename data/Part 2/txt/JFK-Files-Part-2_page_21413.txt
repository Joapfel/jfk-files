Just a hasty note to .let you 1-mow that R;1~~ arid 
Gilbert have r·ecently returned from Amman with news 
about the desperately critj_cal si tur:1.tion there. Never­
theless, we believe the situation is excellent for the 
revolutionary forces, despite the seemingly crushing 
weight of the reactionary, imperialist·forces. 
• Throughout Europe, initiatives are being made 
by comrades, especially in regard to Arab embassies, 
needling them or c9axin3; them to show solidarity with 
the Palestinians or demonstrating against the most 
reactionary (e.g. the· Jordan Embassy here iw.s occupied 
by students yesterday)~ Cables, letters and personal 
calls a1·e be'ing made to Arab governments and tl1eir • 
dlploma ts throughout Eu.rope, and the Irc\qi and Syrians 
sharnc<i for their in3.c ti vi ty, d.espi te all their past 
verbal support of the Palestinian Rc:;volut:Lon. It would 
be especially useful for you.comraaes in the States to 
inform Rene and me of any ac'cj_vity 'chat you are engaged 
in on Pal<::·stine and please send us for republication 
texts of any statements, cables, etc. 
, 
Manu and Diane send -you fratei-•nal greetings. They 
are now married, by- the way J and awa:U; • reinforcement in 
the revolutionary tanks in December! .., 
'I'hei-·c is a possibility I might malce i'c to the States ' 
sometime this fal_l. If so, I yi1ill tr·y 'co come to Chicago 
to give you a first-hand r.cport on the situation in these 
parts, as wel.l as the Middle· East ..
