know, you are not allowed to defend yourself together. I don't 
know, I'm just guessing. 
INTERVIEWER: Okay. How about the Congressional investigations 
-- affect Agency morale a lot or . 
MR. HALPERN: Well~ I can only assume again from the outside 
that they had to. I know people talked to me about it from 
people who were inside; talking to me on the outside, in terms 
of what its done in terms of morale. I think as I said before, 
the feelings of, if you guys who had been here before·hadn't 
done those nasty things, we wouldn't be under the gun. We are 
back to square one on that. 
INTERVIEWER: Sure. Okay. The issue of oversight. Do you 
.believe that oversight.by two select committees is preferable 
to the earlier oversight by six to eight committees?_ 
MR. HALPERN: We never had six to eight as such. There .were 
four committees of Congress which had oversight, two in the 
House and two in ·the Senate. There was under the Hughes-Ryan 
Amendment six to eight committees we reported to. I wasn't 
involved anymore. But anyway, the Agency had to report on 
covert action. It was a separate subject. 
INTERVIEWER: Right, good distinction. 
MR. HALPERN: So that there never were more than four oversight 
committees as such. And now we are down to two. A.nd I have 
been on public record and in print favoring one committee. As 
long as you are going to have committees, have one.- B"ut people
