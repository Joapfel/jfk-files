1. (S) The CIA Deputy Executive Director has asked that I 
respond to the Assassination Records Review Board ("ARRB" or 
"Board") regarding their current deliberations ?S to postponement 
of certain very limited information in one document ~- _ __ _ ___ -------, 
specifically, the actual cryptonym of a CIA source ({IJDECANTER) . 
It is our considered judgment that the release of thisfcryptonym, 
in the particular context of the given document (SX-59777 of 
15 December 1991), and juxtaposed with the Los Angeles Times 
article of 29 December 1997, would provide an identifiable 
benefit to the Russian counterintelligence effort and concomitant 
damage to US intelligence interests. 
2. (S) Mindful, however, of the Board's statutory purpose 
and objectives, this memorandum also proposes a substitution of a 
fictitious cryptonym (e.g., "TRUSTED") for the actual cryptonym 
fJDECANTER-in this or any other document where it appears and 
~would oth~iwise be releasable. 
3. (U) As a preliminary matter, I would respectfully ask 
the Board and staff to note the classified nature of this 
memorandum, to limit access to those individuals properly 
cleared, and to return it to Agency representatives at the 
conclusion of your deliberations. 
4. (S) As the Board is aware, the relevant document has 
been released almost in its entirety. The released version 
reports that a Soviet official (Boris ZHURAVLEV) had provided
