forget that even when you have only two now, we still have to 
-- remember the Ag~ncy still reports to Foreign Affairs, briefs 
them on foreign affairs. The House Armed Servi c.es Committee 
still gets special reporting. The Appropriations Committees in 
both the House and the Senate are always involved with 
everything. So you've got four committees right now anyway. 
Minimum. In practical daily life. You've got to go to 
Appropriations and nobody in Congress is ever going to keep 
Appropriations out of anything. And on top of that, then there 
is Government Operations. I could go on forever. So boiling 
it down to even one joint committee, it 1 ll help some, but it 
won't solve the problem. But it is better than having two, 
with two separate staffs. 
INTERVIEWER: Okay how about, do you think it is practical for 
the Congress to be informed of the covert activities of the 
Agency? 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, within limits, within reason. They are not, 
as I said before, they are not part of the Executive and they 
are not going to be -- I hope they are not going to be -- in 
charge of or as part of making the decision whether you are 
going to do something or not. And whether that is cover action 
or whether that is sending the Marines in, you can't have them 
sitting there telling you you can do it or you can't do it. 
Not if you are going to be a President.
