State clearance was obtained on 6/2/58 for the FBI to develop . ~ 
,sources and informants at Israeli diplomatic estnblishments.· Our·request o 
for this 6learance was based upon our need to combat the activities of ~ 
Israeli intelligence agents operating out of the Israeli Embassy, \::: 
JYashington, D. C~, and the Israeli United Nations Delegation, New York CitYrt 
At the sa.rae time, as a result of the Suez Crisis in 1957-1951, the • ·-:: 
possibility of war in the ·Middle East was prevalent and Israel. oct!up:led 2. ~-~ 
central position irt this-sensitive area. ,Our needs for sources were based,# 
therefore, upon· FBI investigative needs· and the need to obtai1:1 significan,t •• , 
.intelligence data for other U. s. Government agencies. • 
After instigating this-program, we developed an extremely valuable 
informant who was an America,i citizen and who wa.s employed at the Israeli 
Embn.s~y. This informant was used for several years and furnished v;rtlu.able 
information of assistance in our inveStigation of Israeli intellirgi'ince • • • 
matters and significant intelligence data~ She left the Israeli ~mbassy in 
1963. At the present time we have developed se'\:reral former employees of 
Israeli diplomatic establishments in ·the U. s. and persons who have 
operated in the past ·for the Israeli Intelligence Service. Some of these 
persons continue to have conta.cts with persons in Israeli establishments; 
however, we have no sources presently employed in Israeli diplomatic. • . 
establishments in the U. S. This is ~J!)aMy e~'l)lained by the sensitivity 
of the program; , the fact that the Israel Security St~rvice is extremely· 
thorough in.briefing its dipiomatic employees concerning possible recruit­
ment efforts by u. s. intelligence ·sarvicesand the employmen.t by the Israelis; 
of a very few u. s. citizens who would. be logical targets for recruitment. 
The risk of developing sources in Israeli establishments is • - _ ,. 
comparable witll similar efforts directed at Soviet dil.'>lomatic establishments.
