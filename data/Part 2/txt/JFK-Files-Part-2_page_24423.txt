(d) Plans in Early 1963 
Two plans to assassinate Castro were ex­
plored by Tfl.sk Force W, the section concerned with covert Cuban 
operations, in early 1963. Desmond Fitzgerald (now deceased), Chief 
of the Task Force, asked Samuel Halpern to determine whether an exotic 
seashell, rigged to explode, could be deposited in an area where Castro 
commonly went skin diving (Halpern, P: 28). The idea was explored by the 
Technicaxivision and discarded as impractical (Helms, 6/13, p. 135; I.G., p.77) 
A second plan involved having James Donovan

States under an assumed name unless he cooperated in an investigation of the 
Hafia. (Roselli, whose true. name is Filippo Saco, was born in Italy and 
allegedly brought illegally into the United States wl1ile still a child.) 
Roselli contacted Edwards, who informed the FBI that Roselli wanted to 
"keep square with the Bureau," but was afraid that gangsters might kill him 
for "talking" (CIA Justice File R-153, :Memorandum, Osborn to FBI, 5/27/66). 
After Roselli was arrested for fraudulent gambling activities at the Friars 
Club in Beverly Hills in 1967, he requested Harvey, who had left the Agency, 
'to represent him (CIA Justice File R-153, Memorandum for Record by Osborn, 
12/11/67). Ilarvey contacted the Agency and suggested that it prevent the 
prosecution (Osborn Memorandum, supra). Ros~lli was subsequentli convicted 
of violating United States interstate gambling laws. In 1971, the CIA 
approached the Immigration and Naturaliaation Service, Department of Just.ice, 
to "forestall public disclosure of Roselli' s past operatfonal activity 
with CIA "that might occur if deportation proceedings were brought. (CIA to 
Select Committee, 7/21/75). It was agreed that CIA would be kept informed 
of developments in that case. The deportation order is pr.esently being\ II d
