(2) The Operation is Reactivated 
In early April 1962, Harvey, who testi­
fied that he was acting on "explicit orders" from Helms (Harvey, 
7/11, p. 18), requested Edwards.to put him in touch with Roselli 
(CIA Justice File R-153; Edwards memorandum, 5/14/62). O'Connell 
first introduced Harvey to Roselli in Miami, where Harvey told 
Roselli to maintain his Cuban contacts, but not to deal with Maheu 
or Giancana (O'Connell, p; 50; Roselli, pp. 27-30), whom he had 
decided were "untrustworthy" and "surplus" (_Harvey, 6/25, p. 65). 
O'Connell recalled that Roselli did not initially trust Harvey, 
*When interviewed for the Inspector General's Report, Harvey 
stated that he briefed Helms on his first meeting with Roselli, 
and "thereafter he regularly briefed Helms on the status of the 
Castro operation" (I.G., p. 41); 
Helms' recollection was less certain. Helms did recall that 
he was briefed by Harvey when Harvey first contacted Roselli in 
April 1962. He remembered that he "reluctantly" had approved the_operation, 
but that he had no confidence that it would succeed (Helms, 7/17, 
p. 23). 
When asked if he authorized sending the poison pills to Florida, 
Helms testified: 
"I believe they were poison pills, and I don't recall 
necessarily approving them, but since Harvey alleges to 
have them and says that he took them to Miami, I must 
have, I must have authorized them in some fashion." 
(Helms, 6/13, P•. 44).
