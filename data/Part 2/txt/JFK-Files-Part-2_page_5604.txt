3. (S) As h-5!P~~~~escribed to the Board in previous 
briefings by th • f, Mexicans guard their 
sovereignty carefu y-:--Nothing will infuriate them more 
than allegations of CIA meddling in their internal politics. 
In fact, earlier this year, the Mexican Government postponed 
a visit to Mexic9 by _the DCI _for fe~r that it might be 
perceived (and exploited) by the Mexican media.and poiitical 
oppositio~ as the CIA being called in to assist with 
handling the problem of the Peoples' Revolutionary Army. 
4. (S) The fact that the CIA activity to which the 
Mexicans would object occurred more than 30 years ago will 
not lessen the reaction. Release of the Scelso comments 
would risk an adverse reaction from the Mexicans, which 
would likely include calls for an examination by the Mexican 
Government of current CIA activities. This could lead to 
increased scrutiny of Station oper~tions and personnel and 
could jeopardize our unilateral activities. It could also 
have a chilling effect on activities conducted jointly with 
the Mexican services, who will be reluctant to engage in 
programs that could become subject to public scrutiny and 
political debate. 
5. (S) Furthermore, the fact that these statements 
were made by Scelso amounts to an official confirmation of 
the underlying facts, making it very difficult for CIA to 
protect the same or similar information from further release 
in the future. Sp~culation in books, articles, and other 
publications, or disclosures by Congress are often perceived 
by the public as evidence that that information is in the 
\ 
public domain and therefore is no longer classified. The 
CIA has nevertheless been able to legally protect the 
\ information from unauthorized disclosure. The courts have 
,
l!\jL held that because there has been no official confirmation, 
(i.e. declassification by the appropriate CIA official) the 
CIA may continue to protect from release _t:.ae..
