SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. 
and 1968. Because these two documents are the subject 
of a FOIA request, they are not included in this 
response. 
D. Harold Weisberg - There is a 201 file on subject 
which contains very limited information. This file can 
be made available for review by an ARRB staff member. 
The DO retired records system, CARD, has a reference to 
an Agency dispatch (EGBA-87605, 1969) which indicates 
subject was in correspondence with Julius Mader. This 
document was in the files when it was reviewed by staff 
member Combs in August 1998. 
E. Sylvia Meagher - We found no DO information. 
CIA - IR-12 - Contacts with journalists or publishing 
houses 
(U) The DO provided both an unclassified and 
classified response about contacts with journalists or 
publishing houses, regarding whether CIA might have 
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers 
regarding public discussion of the assassination. 
Searches with generic terms such as "journalists," 
"publishers," "publishing houses," and "media" would 
not produce meaningful responses. This question 
required the research of crypts mentioned in various 
documents in the JFK "assassination records." These 
crypts referred to· projects managed under the overall 
guidance of a ~taff in the DO and in all instances were 
projects concerning press and propaganda programs 
designed to promote anti-communism and to counter 
Soviet press and propaganda initiatives worldwide. 
Specifically, the various projects were developed for 
the following reasons (Corresponding cryptonyms to 
these projects were provided in a classified document, 
and are not included below): 
A. to counter-Soviet activities in international 
intellectual organizations, in order to unite and 
promote anti-Communist intellectuals.
