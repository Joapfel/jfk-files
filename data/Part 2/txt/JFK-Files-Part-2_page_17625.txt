. RE: FBI AUTH01 ITY IN DOMESTIC 
INTELLIGENCE l\lAT':rERS • 
(_ 
And unliko the practice in criminal cases, our electronic surveillances in 
security n1atter·s are not submitted for prior court approval. For another, 
'the exclusionary rnie which provides the usual 1ncthod of judicial control 
over investigative procedures, is not often available in sectuit y cases. 
Since the goal.is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the 
courts.. As a result, the public, the cotu'ts, and the Congress have very 
little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters. 
and what we do with the information acquired. ., 
.. 
In response to this situatiqn, some n1e1nbcrs of the Congress have 
pressured for tigf1ter controls over the Bureau, pe~'haps in the form of a 
,vatchdog committee to oversee our operations. Senator Ervin, who chairs 
the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional lights has e:-..--pressed particular 
concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Governn1ent to 
gather information. In.an exchange of correspondence with the Department 
of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation o.f the 
Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic 
intelligence infor1nation. He has also suggested that legislation migi1i. ul:! 
enacted, requh~ing a showing of probable cause before an investigation c2.n 
be initiated by the Govermnent. It is doubtful that any such measure v:ould 
pa:s-s ,the ,G01,1g:r,es-s, ,but .the .proposal d0es shm,1{ the mood of the tilnes. 
. A P.arallcl trend may be developing in the co~rts. In several 
recent cases,. plaintiffs have made the ·clain1 that Government information 
gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects, 
may have a "chilling cffectu on the exercise of First Amendment rights. 
These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. Sills, 
56 N.J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Dulinp;, 330 F. Supp. ;jQ8 
(E.D. Va.. 1971); American Civil Liberties Union v. \Vestmorcbnd, 323 
F. Supp. 1153 (N. D. 111. 19·,1). 
The courts have generally 1;ecog-nizcd that one of tho principal 
functions of the Durcnu is to gather information law violato1·s, agitators of 
✓ violence and possible s.1bversives.. Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2cl 0'17, 957
