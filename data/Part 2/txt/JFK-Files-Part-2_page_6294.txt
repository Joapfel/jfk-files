TESTIMONY BEFORE JFK BOARD, 6 AUGUST 19 9 6 i----' 
INTRODUCTION 
~r 
Introduce CIA participants 
We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination 
Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy 
Assassination Records CoJlection Act. CIA is committed to full 
cooperation with the Board. 
Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection 
directly, I would iike to provide some background to help put 
the sequestered collection into some sort of context. 
In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK 
Assassination Records Act, then Director of Central 
Intelligence, Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing 
for declassification all records related to the assassination. 
The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the 
relevant records. Once this was done, the Historical Review 
Group took custody of these records and immediately began 
reviewing -them for declassification for -release to the National 
Archives.

Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our 
goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the 
22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately 
125,000 pages were transferred to the National Archives by that 
date. 
~- rwith subsequent releases, CIA has now declassified and 
transferred some 227,000 pages of material to the National 
Archives. Based on discussions with the Board, we are 
continuing to release additional information that had been 
redacted earlier. 
The remaining records are in various stages of review. 
Some require review by other agencies. Some is congressional 
material. Final decisions on other records are awaiting 
discussion with the Review Board.
