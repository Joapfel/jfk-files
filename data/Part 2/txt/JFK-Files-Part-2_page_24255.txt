equity in ~he corporation_and.60 percent of the equity was osten­
sibly owned by the Chinese, who gave deeds of trust to the Agency 
-for their shares. This overt arrangement demonstrated for purposes 
of international law that the company was majority-o~ed and con­
trolled by Chinese. The Chinese continued to press the company 
to get into the international common carriage field. The company 
had several DC-4's and began modest operations between Hong Kong, 
Taipei and Tokyo_. They graduated • to DC-6

s, and it was at this time 
that the· Agency first got into the question of competition with U.S. 
industry. Northwest was then flying to Tokyo and Seoul and to 
Manila, and was trying to obtain rights into Hong Kong. Don Nyrop 
had noted the Agency
1
s interest in this area when he had been 
Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1940's and the 
early 1950's. Houston told the Corrnnittee: 
He (Nyrop) became head of Northwest, a very tight 
manager, a very capable fellow, and he used to 
complain that we were interfering, we were taking 
passengers off·his .airline, and we would go to him 
and say, we have to keep the- airline in this busi-
ness because the Chinese say they need an international 
airline. They're not ready to start their own yet. 
And it is necessary to its overall cover status as a 
going commercial concern. 
By 1959 Mr. Nyrop was complaining that the Agency was doing too much. 
Finally Nyrop decide~ to complain to the Civil Aeronautici Bo~rd and 
the Agency agreed to place it before that Agency for a _decision. 
A meeting was held with the entire Board, at which time Nyrop was 
able to make his case ''for the fact that he was a private industry, 
he. should not be interfered with by government competition."
