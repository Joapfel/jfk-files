During brief discussion of CONGO developments, 
"GRAY said that he hoped that Agency people in 
the field are fully aware of the.top-level 
feeling in Washington that vigorous action would 
not be amiss." (SG Minutes; emphasis added) 
Allen DULLES stated at an NSC meeting that 
IILUMUMBA was not dispos~d of and remained a 
reat danger as long as he was_not disposed 
of." (HSC Minutes) 
At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES reported 
that "five Congolese soldiers had attempted 
to assassinate MOBUTO on the 15th of 
October. The U.S. had prior infonnation 
of this attempt and had warned MOBUTO ... 
(NSC Minutes) 
At a Special Group meeting, Mr. MERCHAN.T 
"asked whether any real planning has been done 
in taking direct positive action ae;ainst FIDEL, 
RAUL and CHE GUEVARA. He said that without 
these three the Cuban government would.be 
leaderless and probably brainless. He conceded 
that it would be necessary to act against all 
three simultaneously." 
The minutes further state: "General CABELL 
pointed out.that action of this kind is 
uncertain of results and highly dangerous 
in conception and execution, because the 
instruments must be Cuban. He felt that, 
particularly because.of the necessity of 
simultaneous action, it would have to be 
concluded that Mr. MERCHA.t"'lT'S suggestion is 
beyond our capabilities." (SG Minutes)

Issues and Ques_tio_ll~ 
Against LUMUMBA personally? 
Did the NSC contemplate "disposing of" 
LUMUMBA by assassination? 
Did.this information prompt the U.S. 
to plot the assassination of LUMUMBA 
in retaliation or to protect MOBUTO? 
6 
Was MERCHAHT referring to an assassina­
tion of Cuban leaders? 
Shortly before this, CIA had made the 
assassination contract with the Mafia. 
Was General CABELL unaware of this CIA 
contract?. Was General CABELL expressing 
a traditional CIA objection to assassina­
tion proposals? If so, on what other 
occasion did Mr. GRAY hear the CIA 
objection? .
