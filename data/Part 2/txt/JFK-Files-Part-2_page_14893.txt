-This matter involves the reported contributions by 
I 
Local 688 to the political campaigns of Federal candidates. 
hbst 0£ the contributions involved were apparently made from 
the political action committee account of Local 683. 
Contributions from such accounts would not normally constitute 
violations of Section 610, Title 13, U. s. Code; however, 
with respect to this case, the Department by memorandum of 
December 14, 1959, stated that it had been advised by the 
U. s. Attorney in St. Louis that the political action committee 
t 
fund of Local 638 v..as actually a general' fund of the union's · 
which was raised from dues assesqrnents and was .not a fund-derived 
from voluntary contributions. Section 610, Title 13, U. 3. Code, 
prohibits contributions by labor unions to the caii1paigns oi 
Federal candidates. 
On November 2, 1959, the U. s. Attorney in St. Louis, 
Missouri, began subpoenaing a number of witnesses to appear 
before a Federal Grand Jury in Jt. Louis ·which conducted an 
inquiry concerning the captioned matter o In co11junction with 
the Grand Jury's inquiry, the Bureau, at the specific requests 
of the u. s. Attorney and of the Civil Rights Division, 
conducted certain investigation for the assistance o:1: the 
U. s. Attorney in presenting this r.1a tter to the Grand Jury. 
ll Our investigation included interviews w:L tll Senator Wayne 
l.Iorse (D.-Ore.), Dena tor Thoii1as Hennings (D. - 1'.Io.), 
Congress1aan James Hoosevel t ·(D. - Calif.) and Congressman 
Henry s. neuss (D. - Hise.). 
On January 27, 1960, u. s. Attorney Webster and 
Assistant u .. f3. Attorney Bigler, St. Louis, advised that on 
January 2G, 1960, t11ey had $.ent a proposed indictment, together 
with a summary of the evidenc~ to the Department for its -
approval. They advised that they would like, if possible, to 
present the in:.:.lictraent to the Grand Jury in rJt. Louis on 
February J, 1960. 'l.'he U. S. Attorney said that the proposed 
r 
indictment ~oes not include a cI1arge against James H. I:Ioffa. 
He said tl1e ev1cience connectin[; Eoff a with tI1e cl~_eck paya0le 
to the Con~ressuan I-Ienry 8. n.eus~3 ca1;1paiE;n seemed insuf:Eicient 
to support a charr;e ac;ainst I:oifa. These o£ficials mentioned 
that the proposed iudictmen t inclucles 21 counts, invol vin(; 
10 political contributions.
