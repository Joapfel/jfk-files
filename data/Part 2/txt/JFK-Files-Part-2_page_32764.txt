The third area in which the Boeing approach involved greater 
development risks was its extensive use of titanium in its wing carry-
through structure. We have had some experience in the use of titanium 
in other Department of Defense weapon systems but mainly in h~-at'-:: ::'· 
resistant applications and where high stre~s levels in thick plates are not ,· 
involved. The Fourth Evaluation Rep0rt observed that data concerning the 
fatigue design properties of titanium, in the thickness Boeing proposed to use 
in the wing carry-through structure, is very limited, and that this raises 
::' 
the question of the advisability of using such thickness. The Rep0rt 
further commented that the effect of temperature on structural details, 
especially in the aluminum-to-titanium splice, can be expected to be 
quite pronounced in producing metal fatigue, and the Report concluded 
the Boeing fatigue test program showed lack of realism. In fact, Colonel 
Gayle, the TFX System Project Officer, sent a letter to the competing 
companies pointing out that, in the judgment of the Aeronautical Systems 
Division, it was not advisable to use titanium in fittings which are subject 
to heavy load, nor in heavy section areas because of a lack of data relating 
to such use. If Boeing's proposed use of titanium did not work .out and 
heavier steel had to be used to replace the lighter metal, I realized that 
not only would the operational capabilities of the Boeing plane suffer, but 
additional costs would be incurred. 
In contrast, the General Dynamics design solved the problem of wing 
loading by the ingenious but simple expedient of providing a bolt-on extra 
J 
wing extension for the Navy version of the aircraft, instead of employing 
relatively unusual applications. of an exotic metal.
