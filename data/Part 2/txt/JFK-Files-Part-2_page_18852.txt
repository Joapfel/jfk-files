The above New York letter concluded by setting forth that a 
case has been opened under the caption 16AM A. JAFFE; IS - R''jn the NYO 
.. and will be investigated as directed in no number SAC letter AF Series, 
1952 dated 10/22/52 captioned "Espionage and Foreign Intelligence 
Investigations - Double Agent Program11; that subsequent correspondence 
in this case will be carried under the single caption of the subject. 
In addition to the infonnation set forth above, the Bureau's 
letter of 7/19/54 set forth that inasmuch as the reason for JAFFE's 
contacts with the Soviets has been determined and in view· of his allegations 
in regard to a physical surveillance conducted on him on 7/9/54, it is not 
believed desirable to continue inquiries in regard to him for the purpose 
of considering his development as a source of information in regard to 
Sovlet activities. The Bureau concluded that no further investigation 
should be conducted regarding JP.FFE unless additional infonnation comes 
to WFO or NY1 s attention that JP.FFE may be engaged in activities inimical 
to the seem. ty of the U. S., at which time the Bureau should be i_f- 1 
appropriately advised.
