This mofning Kemper took a call from Ivlr. Sam Jaffe, 
i ·, CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801. 
I 
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director 
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in 
New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm • 
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly; ( t.,,() 
the Director could not comply with this request; '- ' 
! ; 
l 
Jaffe then v1anted to know jf it would be possible to 
interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but 
that this interview would be general in nature and vmuld not refer 
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad 
national picture. 
Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting 
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable. 
I 
Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC-Foste:r and alerted him to Jaffe's 
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be 
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York. 
RECOMMENDATION: REC-13
