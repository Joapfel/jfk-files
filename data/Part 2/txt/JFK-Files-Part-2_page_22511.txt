an anti-Co"mmunist gToup privately sponsored who 1:1ill attend 
the Vienna Youth Festival and will make them~elv~s known 
d~ring the Festival. Wiley will probably cover the Festi­
val for the Newhouse Newspaper Chain, National ·r.eview and 
U.S. News and World Report. He has received $500 1n pri­
vate subscriptions to cover the cost of his transportation 
to the lrrF. The cost of his proposed itinerary amounts to 
$1,056.70 for transportation. Allen recommended the Office 
of Security pay the additional cost of.$556.70 with the

The New York Times reported on 3 August 1959' that 
Charles Wiley, his wife, and Jo.1:1.ne Mellor, a Br~tish sub­
ject living in New York City, wei·e "roughed up" when they 
attempted to join a parade of Eastern Bloc delegates to 
the WYF. Wiley and company waited until the parade had 
started and then unfolded their banners with such slogans 
as "Remember Hungary," "Remember Tibet," and "What About 
Soviet Imperialism?" That incident got much press cover­
age, particularly because Wiley's wife was obviously preg­
nant. 
A 14 September 1959 memo for the record from Wiley 
reflects that in a meeting with staff members of the HCUA, 
Wiley was instrumental in talking HCUA out of holding 
hearings which would be intended partially to expose the 
alleged inept, but expensive, effort made by CIA tu infil­
trate the WY F w i th a 1 a r g c g r o up u n cl c r cover of the I n cl c - . 
pendent Service Committee. The Director of Security memo­
randa concerning the foregoing was forwarded to the Legis­
lative Counsel on the 16th and 25th of September 1959 and 
the 27th of October 1959. They were also forwarded to the 
Office 9.f\t1i<4 DCI.
