Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Adr.1.inistration (LE.-\.-\) r·equested 
that the Agency give consideration to our publishing, at 
LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volur.1e. It 
was the ·inte:nt of LE.<\i\ to make broac.-scale distribution 
to Police Departments throughout the country. The Director 
of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly 
dctcr:mincd th3t the LL;\..\ request should not be honored be­
cause the Agency should not put itself in the position of 
publishing law enforcement material for general and un- -
classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print­
i~g facilities. 
b. On S January 1971, the Director of Security re­
quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven·rnotor 
vehicles for use in connection with a special support 
operation ~hich would last approxinately 3 months. The 
Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memo­
randum of 5 January 1971, that "This support .activity has 
been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director 
· and has his personal approval." The r_equest ,-.-as approved. 
c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has 
requisitioned from this Office a considerable anaunt of 
materiel which ~e understand w~s to be given or loaned by 
them to local Police Departments. In certain cases some 
of this materiel was issued from Agency stocks and, in 
other cases, dirett procurement of ·the materiel was made 
- by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete 
listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2.
