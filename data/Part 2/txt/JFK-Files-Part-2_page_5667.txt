1 I (1951-63), De Vosjoli retired and became a CIA/FBI asset. As ' 
a USG asset, he had contact with German and Canadian 
Intelligence Services in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. He 
became a naturalized US citizen c.1971. Apparently his case 
was not handled in normal defector channels as the 
responsible component has no records of De Vosjoli. His 201 
, file shows that his last substantive contact with the Agency 
1 I was in 1972 and was initiated by him from Florida. Although 
\1 De Vosjoli has publicly acknowledged his unilateral

As a basic tenet of the covert relationship, the Agency \ \ 
agreed to protect the fact of their relationships with the \ \ 
USG; and they, in turn, promised to keep those relationships \ \ 
secret. To our knowledge, the individuals have honored this \ \ 
basic contractual commitment. The Agency believes that the \ 
possible harm to the individuals, their families and/or 
associates, and the potential for damage to sensitive 
intelligence operations, outweigh the contribution the 
release of these three names would make to public 
understanding of the assassination. The Agency is 
particularly concerned about the erosion of the principle of 
protecting the identity of sources and the potential 1 
1 / chilling effect on future agent operations and recruitment. j/ 
1 The Agency is further concerned about the possibility of / 1 
-~ 1\, liability to the individuals and their families for failure ;/ 
, to honor its commitments of confidentiality. ,//
