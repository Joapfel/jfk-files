on fungal agents generally compatible with such an approach was underway at Fort 
Detrick shortly before this scheme was hatched and the agent was prepared at 
Agency direction in a form suitable for application to clothing, pillow cases, 
and so on. Tuberculosis germs with which the breathing apparatus of the suit were 
to be contaminated were available at Fort Detrick though not included in Agency 
stocks. Finally, the general presence of BW agents or toxins in all of these 
plans suggests the strqng influence of work carried on at Fort Detrick. 
None of the intervie1vs. undertaken in the course of this· investigation provide• 
information about specific.support to operations which may have involved 
assassination. Roosevelt, who was Ch.ief of TSD from 1960-1962, believed that 
discussions involving assassination took place but claimed to know few of the· 
details and was skeptical as to the seriousness of such discussions. Treichler, 
Chief of the Biology Branch during this period, denied ever having received 
requests for such support or providing it, but these assertions appear incompatible 
with information he earlier provided to the IG's office during its investigation 
of assassination attempts. Treichler may constitute a connection between the 
MKNAOMI project and the assassination plots involving Castro. • He was the officer 
responsible for MKNAOMI during th.is period. The records show his giving direction 
in specific terms to the preparation of materials at Fort Detrick matching those 
mentioned in the assassination schemes. Finally, the IG.'s report indicates that 
he delivered such material to other elements of the Agency. Beyond the Castro 
schemes, no suggestion can be found that any of these materials or devices was 
ever considered for use for lethal purposes.
