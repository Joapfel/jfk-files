I ,: 
that prohibition on Fulbright grantees to all of those under 
the Fulbright-Hayes legislation. Under the specifics of the 
Agency's interpretation, it makes a distinction between those 
students, or graduate students~ or professors selected by the 
Board of Foreign Scholarships, and the rest -- and the rest. 
includes cultural leader grants and the like. 
'No~, perhaps it migh~ be the sensible thing in the 
language like this to confine it to the Fulbright-Hayes Act, 
which is the basic legislation which deals with this. 
Senator Schweiker. How many others would you have outside 
of that? Would you have a lot of other programs? 
Mr. Bader. Other programs? . , I . 
Senator Schweiker . What percent of the t6tal picture is 
the Fulbright-Hayes Act~. . I.,. 
Mr. Bader. I reallj wouidn't know, Senator. I think it 
is the major part of it, ~ctually. You could have a National 
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in which a per-son would 
go overseas, and this, under the language we now have before 
you, that would include those individuals. 
The Chairman. Well, I can see how vulnerable a grantee 
might be when approached, and if we have already written 
,, 
into law a prohibition ~~at relates to the Fulbright stholars, 
I -should think it ought to apply to any others that are 
'' ' ! 
receiving educational or'cultural grants from the United 
States.
