~MOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegat~.§.. 
was frequent commentator on other people's 
work and made a practice of denigrating 
their reports with respect to radiation 
lethality. 
Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked 
if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives 
were motivated from anything more than 
genuine scientific position. They 
responded.- "Who can say?" MOSKALEY, 
both from papers he gave and his questions 
and comments in discussion, indicated he 
was Ttvery ~har:p_,_ The paper he gave 
presented no new data. His paper said 
nothing specific.

About one third of the soviets expected 
at th~ Third Int'1 Congress of Radiation 
Research put in appearance. The papers 
were disappointing. A paper written by 
MOSKALEV and V.A. STRELTSOVA was not 
impressive.
