also went over all incoming messages from agents to scrutinize for 
the use of freedom signals.'' When the absence of such signals .as 
pointed out to PM they would sometimes claim that the agent had 
merely forgotten them. CI was able to stop all cable traffic to 
such agents when under suspicion. After a while Rothwell was 
delegated to be the CI contact with the PM people, and due to his 
quiet methods and competence he gained a fair share of their 
cO?lf'idence and the work proceeded more smoothly.

7. Simmons and his section prepared a 225-page stulfof 
Castro's intelligence organization. This document was distributed 
generally throughout the U.S. intelligence community; as were also 
some extensive studies on Cuban blodtwardens. They also issued cs/ 
CI information reports and Simmons gave a number of briefings to 
higher-ups. They were able to identify 14 provocative activities 
by the Cuban services in the U.S., Dakar and Havana. They identified 
a U. s. employee of the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a Castro ~netration _ 
agent in 1960. ! This document contains the identities of 492 Castro G-2 
- staff officers.

9. .S1rnrnons described the following difficulties he bad bad: 
a. Hissection was not fully staffed until October 1960, 
although he went to the greatest lengths to get additional people. 
He first had a machine run made for a list of CI personnel having a 
_ , \knowledge of Spanish. He checked the records of the individuals 
Wt-"' c. thus disclosed. He sent the names thuqselected to the W/4 . 
. .-.-.. e :~._,r. personnel officer who made a _ _ueat effort, but in no cas~s he ~p!e 
Ii->" , ,1 ,,. ·~ to __ ~_t_a~ _taken off his present job_. He feels that the DD/P

, .. t:.' :,c ... - , -~ of such .l'-p~~J~s._t so that the latter will cooperate when their

for two TDY trips, Simmons could not face going to Marchand vi th a 
further reques~ and instead asked Jack Earman in the DCI' s office Ce. 
help him get Melberg for another trip. The Director of Training 
complained of this irregular procedure. If Mr. Bissell bad so 
in!ormed his se~or officers, Simmons fe_:~~ _ that they wo~d ~ve 
recel:ved-better _cooperation. The re-suit of lack of personnel was that 
they all worked six or seven days a week. Simmons knows of no case 
of a directed assignment to the project_. As it was,he persozitaily­
had to spend-Bo per-cent of his time on administrative matters with 
the result that be could only spend 2Q__per centaf his time on operations.· 
His final T/0 was four case officers, four analysts,-- two clerk-typists 
and one secretary.
