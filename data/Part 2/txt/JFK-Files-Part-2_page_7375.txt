Dear Mr. Field: : ·'. 
• - 4round the end of July, Mr. Roeder, obviously impressed 
•• by ·your admonitions about the need for security, asked i£ I 
• ~ould work up a package of guidance on how to handle classifi~d 
.·docu~ents. Our Office of Security put this together, and while 
I think Mr. ~oeder had in mind sor':lething more applicable to 
aJi individual than to an office, I thought I would pass this on to 
you !or wha_tever use you care to make of it. 
• Incidentally, we have not -yet carried out th~,;·physical survey 
of your quarters which you requested on 29 July'. .I have been 
in touch with Ms. Hess, and our Office of Security will conduct 
• . • one ~s soon as she· is ready. We may h_ave some other recom­
mendations for your consideration when that is_ done.
