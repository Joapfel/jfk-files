On 8 September 1963, the CIA IG report ref12cts in a conm0nt that the U.S. 
governn12nt publicly confirrn?d on Oct. 8, 196 3 that aid had alraady been cut 
quitely and over a period of some 1mnths. Bill Colby, Jock Anderson and Dave Smith 
told us that the public announcement of the aid reduction was a signal to the 
general and that the reduction was planned with that in mind. It may be that 
the cut in aid was de1ibe1.·ately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that 
intention did not find lts HB:J into the n.~cord. 111e nearest thing to it is in the 
record of a pre::sidentia1 neeting of 10 September 1963. 'l"ne President asked 
Rufus PhilUps of AID what specific actions Phillips rec0mnended and he suggested 
11cutting aid to Colonel 'I'ung wl1ich would be viewed by the generals with much 
enthusiasm as an indication of virgouous of Jl..merican position. " In general, 
a:ld cuts were discussed in terms of bring pressure on Diem to make needed changes in
