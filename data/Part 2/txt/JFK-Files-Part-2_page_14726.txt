. . . . . 
. Selective Service investigations conducted by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation in -recent years have 
broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the 
dra·ft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000 
_ pending investigations, compared to 9 ,000 a year ago. 
In fiscal. year 1968, .809 · _convictions were recorded 
as compared to 763 convictions :the previous fiscal year. 
For the first seven months of fiscal·year 1969, 380 convictions 
were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a 
similar period in the preceding fi~cal year. It appears 
that such a trend will continue during the c·urrent fiscal· 
year.· 
There follows a brief sunmiary of an investigation 
of interest concerning a Selective Service matter. 
At.San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned 
Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with -
Selective se·rvice because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn, 
had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,· 
Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968. 
Following arraignment and release on his own 
recognizance,.a Complaint and.Petition for Injunction and 
Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the 
draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person 
under 21 years of age cannot vote, contro\ or dispose ?f • . 
his own property, serve on juries, marry,· contract or litigate, 
theri he cannot register for the draft without his parents' 
consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son 
principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his 
own conseience, bears the main responsibility and should 
• be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this 
case ruled that the son must stand_ trial for ref.using.: to 
register for the draft and rejected the mother's appeals. 
A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been 
scheduled for March 19, 1969.
