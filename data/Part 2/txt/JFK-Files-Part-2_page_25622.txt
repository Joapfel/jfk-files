June 24, 197; Testimony of John Rosselli before Committee 
Senator\Church presiding 
Los Angeles 
Rosselli first met Maheu in approximately July, 1960, 
Pursuant to a telephone call from Maheu. At their first 
meeting, Maheu told Rosselli that a high government official 
had requested that Maheu recruit Rosselli to "fight Communism 
90 miles away from Florida" -- to recruit Cubans to assassinate 
Castro. 
New York 
Rosselli had second meeting with Maheu and went to New York 
in September under the alias of John Rawlston [Castro was 
in New York at this time]. Rosselli met Jim O'Connell of 
CIA, plus "three·others." 
Florida 
O'Connell, Maheu and Rosselli met in Florida hotel approxi­
mately one week after New York. Rosselli introduced Giancana 
to Maheu. Also introduced X (Trafficante) to Maheu. Obtained 
permission from Maheu to bring Giancanainto project. 
Rosselli recruits Cuban #1, Rosselli's cover was as Wall Street 
businessman. Rosselli and Maheu agree on a $250,000 price tag 
for the job. 
O'Connell never met Cubans. Trafficante, Cubans and Maheu met. 
Maheu brought $10,000 and poison capsules. 
Rosselli told Giancana about CIA involvement to keep his mouth 
shut. Rosselli only had one discussion with Giancana. 
O'Connell called Rosselli after Bay of Pigs. Met in Florida 
not long after Bay of Pigs with William Harvey, O'Connell and 
Rosselli. Harvey·told Rosselli that he wanted Rosselli to 
have nothing to do with Maheu and not to use Giancana connections. 
Rosselli indicates that pro-Castro people in Florida probably 
had inkling of assassination attempts. 
During Missle Crisis, Harvey asked Rosselli to see if "they" 
had any intelligence on us, on the missiles.
