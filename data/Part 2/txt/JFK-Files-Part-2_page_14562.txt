In view of the above information, it would appear that .Brazil 
\could easily align itself with the Soviet-bloc countries and thereby 
create an international situation affecting the U.S. l?hile there is 
no apparent. indication at this time of a political upheaval in Brazil, 
Brazil's President's recent opposition to the nationalist and le.ftist 
groups in Brazil miqht tend to develop internal strife in Brazil, 
leading to such an upheaval. 
From the above, it appears that we should try to place ourselves 
in a position to obtain current intelligence data concerning Brazil.

HTO requested the Bureau to obtain State Department clearance for WF·o 
to initiate a program looking toward the development of informants and 
_ sources within the .Brazilian Embassy, Fla.shington, D. C . 
. FlECOJ11MENDAT ION.~ 
It is recommended that Bureau Liaison representative orally 
clear with State Department our intentions to explore the possibility 
of developing sources and informants on a carefully selected basis 
at the Brazilian Embassy, l'f/ashington, D. c., and other Brazilian 
establishments, if it should become necessary, with the clear 
understanding that we will seek State Department clearance for each 
individual investigation and interview.
