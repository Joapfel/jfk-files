On April 23, 1976 during ~•· Rosselli• s appearance before the 
Schweiker-Hart Subcommittee, w¢\took the opportunity to question 
him about any information he might possess regarding the New Orleans 
Mafia Chieftan, Carlos Marcello. ~ 
Our interest in Marcello :developed from l)~•!the allegation that 
Marcello was tangentially invo_lved with both Clay Shaw and David 
Ferrie; the fact that Marcello was deported by Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy and that the assassinatfon of President Kennedy was a possible 
retaliation, • • :/ 
In my telephone conversation with Jim Johnston, 8/13/76, he could 
think of no other reasons why we questioned Rosselli about Marcello. 
If you would like to talk to J:f::µi about this matter, his telephone 
number is 780-6203.
