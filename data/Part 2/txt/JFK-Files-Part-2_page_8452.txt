MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer to the DDA 
FROM M. L. Latta 
Deputy Chief, Plans and Review Group 
Central Cover Staff 
SUBJECT Fairways Corporation 
1. Per our telephone conversation today~ attorneys 
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168 
items previously deleted by court order from the book, 
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora­
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/D0/0 for review in 
this connection. 
2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items 
(107, 128, 129, 279; on pages 123, 132, 133, -and 403 respec­
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on 
all four items is that they are still classified, since,they 
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an 
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are 
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B)(2) 
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive 
Order 11652. 
3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby 
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair­
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency 
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there 
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to 
the question in a manner which could have been construed as 
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In• any case, CCS 
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered 
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when 
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal 
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair­
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public 
disclosure.
