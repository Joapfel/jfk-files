4. The Plot to Assassinate Lumumba 
In the fall of 1960, a scientist from CIA headquarters 
r " delivered t·o .the thief o~J Station in Leopoldville lethal bio-
logical substances to be used to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. 
The Chief of Station testified that after requesting and receiving 
confirmation from CIA headquarters that he was to carry out the 
' scientist's instructions, he proceeded to take "exploratory steps" 
in furtherance of the assassination plot. The thief of)Station 
testified that in the course of his discussion with the CIA 
- \_, :- -·~-1 
scientist,, t_ctney 0GottliebJ he was informed that President Eisenhower 
had ordered the assassination mission against Patrice Lumumba. 
&~·ttli·~~ s mission to the Congo was both preceded and followed by 
general cables urging the "elimination" of Lumumba sent from CIA 
headquarters in an extraordinarily restricted •~ves Onlv'' channel 
including two messages under the personal sie:nature of Allen Dulles. 
The lethal substances were never used by the ~hief o~ 
Station. But despite the fact that Lumumba had placed himself in 
the protective custody of the UN peace-keeping force shortly 
Ir,, ·1 before the poisons were delivered to the~hief o~Station, there 
is no clear evidence that the assassination operation was termi­
nated before Lumumba's death. There is, however, no direct evidence 
of a connection between the CIA assassination plot and the events 
which actually led to Lumumba's death.* 
* See Section 6, infra, for a discussion of the evidence about 
the circumstances that led to Lumumba's death in Katanga.
