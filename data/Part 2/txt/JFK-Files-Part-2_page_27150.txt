14 October 1975 
MEMORANDUM FOR: GENERAL SCOWCROFT 
FROM: ROB ROY RATLIFF 
SUBJECT: Justice Department Request for Mail Information 
Jeanne Davis transmitted to me a request from the Department of Justice to 
survey 40 Committee and pr.edecessor group files to determine any information 
of a list of subjects focused on operations involving mail. She asked that I 
transmit my findings directly to you. 
I assume that Justice is interested in illegal use of the mails. As I understand 
CIA' s admitted activity in this field, it was .an intelligence collection operation 
and therefore would not be subject to review by the 40 Committee or its 
predecess<;>rs. We find no record that mail intercept operations were discussed 
by the 40.Committee or predecessors; however, there are references to mail 
operations in Committee records. 
Jeanne Davis said Justice wanted material on "any use of mail techniques." 
These are representative items: 
TAB A- -Reports which indicate general mailings of propaganda and 
related material. There is nothing sinister in this- -you put a book 
or pamphlet in an envelope, address it, put on postage and drop it in 
the mail. 
TAB B--Letters were test mailed inside a denied area to see if they 
come out, cir individuals mailed spontaneous letters to CIA-supported 
enterprises. Again, there is nothing unusual about this--regular use 
of the mail system. 
TAB C- - Special covert operations which make use of the mails, including: 
C-1--A forged letter mailed.in Prague to a Czech leader. 
C-2--Mailing of black letters, primarily from third countries. 
However (see page 5 of 9 May 1972 item), some of these letters 
may have been inserted into the mail 
originated in the denied .area.
