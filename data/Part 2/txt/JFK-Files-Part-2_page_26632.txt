E. T~ailap.d Prime Minister Sarit, who suffers from 
. an incurable liver disease, is failing. Doctors 
attending him, including one of our own, give him 
nomore than six months more. Sarit has attempted 
to arrange for an orderly succession when he does 
go. The chances of this are no~ good; Thai poli­
ticians and military figures are already jostling 
one another for position. • 
• F. USSR Cosmos 22, launched a week ago, was recovered 
yesterday. It is the eleventh unmanned satellite to 
be recovered. All recoverable satellites have been 
launched from Tyuratam, the main Soviet missile test 
center, and recovered after three to ten days aloft. 
A series of non-recoverable satellites has been 
fired from Kapustin Yar.
