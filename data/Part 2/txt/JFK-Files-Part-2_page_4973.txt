MEMBERS WHO DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND HOPED PROVISIONS WOULD BE 
IN PLACE TO ENABLE THEM TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SCHEDULED 
MULTILATERAL MEETINGS. HURRYING TO A RECEPTION SHORTLY AFTER 
ARRIVAL FOLLOWING A LONG FLIGHT, HE DID NOT WISH TO BE LATE BUT 
NEITHER DID HE WANT TO LEAVE OTHER DELEGATES FAR BEHIND. WHEN 
IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD HURRY ONCE THEY SAW HE WAS 
READY, HE COMMENTED -- WITHOUT ANY HINT OF REGRET -- THAT 
EVERYONE WAS DEMOCRATIC NOW AND IT NO LONGER WORKED THAT WAY. 
2. HE EVIDENTLY HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN, AND RESPECT 
FOR, THE JAPANESE, REFERRING TO THEM AS A SPECIAL CIVILIZATION. 
AT THE RECEPTION, HE AND JAPANESE DELEGATES AGREED TO MEET LATER 
THAT NIGHT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS IN SPITE OF SOME BADLY NEEDED 
REST. 
3. A PERSON WHO LIKES TO ESTABLISH A ONE-ON-ONE 
RAPPORT, HE EXPRESSED A REGRET AT NOT SPEAKING SPANISH SINCE 
LATIN AMERICA IS ONE OF HIS MAIN AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. HE 
NOTED THAT LATIN AMERICANS DO NOT REALLY OPEN UP WHEN SPEAKING 
THROUGH INTERPRETERS. TIME CONSTRAINTS PREVENT HIM FROM 
LEARNING SPANISH AT PRESENT. 
4. ECOLOGY - A SPECIAL CONCERN: M_i;MEDOV SHOWED A 
PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR ECOLOGY AND NOTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NEED 
HELP IN DEALING WITH ITS PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA. HE RUEFULLY 
COMMENTED THAT MAN WAS THE ONLY CREATURE THAT WOULD DESPOIL HIS 
ENVIRONMENT. THE PROBLEM WAS A GLOBAL ONE AND REQUIRED 
CONCERTED COOPERATION ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. 
5. PROBLEM AREAS FOR RUSSIA: ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV, 
RUSSIA'S CURRENT OPEN BORDERS MAKE THE COUNTRY VULNERABLE TO 
TERRORIST INCURSIONS (IRAN AND AFGRANISTAN WERE MENTIONED) AND 
TO THE OVERFLOW ONTO RUSSIAN TERRITORY OF BORDER CONFLICTS. 
WHEN PROBLEMS BEGAN IN AZERBAIJAN, IRAN SENT FIGHTING UNITS 
ACROSS THE BORDER TO ASSIST AZERIS; RUSSIA WAS NOT NOTIFIED. 
THE PROXIMITY OF THE CONFLICT IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND ITS 
POSSIBLE ESCALATION IS VERY WORRISOME. THE CIVIL WAR IN 
CHECHNYA HAS-THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING MORE SERIOUS AND IS A 
VERY TROUBLESOME ISSUE. 
6. THE ECONOMIC TRANSITION: MAMEDOV ASSESSES THAT 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH CANADA AND THE UNITED 
STATES, WILL BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH COMMERCIAL TIES. ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS IN RUSSIA STILL HAVE 50% GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. 
THE BANKING SECTOR IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS 
INTERNATIONAL-STYLE BANKING. YOUNG MANAGERS (MID JO'S) ARE 
INTRODUCING NEW IDEAS, WHILE OLDER EXPERIENCED STAFF PROVIDE THE 
NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. THE CURRENT PERIOD IN WHICH 
RUSSIA IS BEING ROBBED BY SOME, IS SYMPTOMATIC OF TRANSITIONAL J 
UPHEAVAL AND IS COMPARABLE TO THE POST CIVIL WAR ERA IN THE 
UNITED STATES WHEN A NUMBER OF ITS Cle[' .LZE!'JS 1\C(mI-REB-WEM,;'.F-H=-I-N--
