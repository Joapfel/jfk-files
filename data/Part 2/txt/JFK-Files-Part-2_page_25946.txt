Castro • Plot to I r Death?

. Herald Slaff Writer • 
In 1960, when the CIA was try­
. ing to set up a delicate attempt on 
. the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to 
a man once described as "the big-
• gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-
• try" - West Coast unde{'.world 
: figure Johnny Rosselli. 
Rosselli - a seemingly improba­
. ble conspirator in a government 
• plot - got the "flag-waving" label 
.'from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana, 
:then Chicago's top crime boss and 
a man Rosselli .brought into that 
:same plot.. 
Now both are dead, murdered in 
the past year, and investigators are 
wondering whether their plotting 
led to their deaths and whether the 
CIA plots against Castro - only 
recently made public and even kept 
from the Warren Commission· -
are vital clues to the John F. Ken­
nedy assassination. 
The deaths of Giancana, in June • 
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer, 
have aroused a renewed concern in 
Washington, where on Friday the 
House of Representives voted _to re-• 
open the investigation of the Ken­
nedy murder. 
REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D., 
Va.), who will be chairman of the 
panel, said he is "convinced" a con-' 
spiracy was involved in Kennedy's· 
death. •• · 
Now, in the aftermath of the~vi~~ 
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-: 
selli, the question arises of;t what 
role, if ·any, the Kennedyc::-'White 
House played in the early 1960s. 
"deal" the CIA made with the two 
underworld figures to have Castro 
murdered. • 
Whether·:· the Kennedy TWhite'' 
House knew 'about about the. CIA's 1 
plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found .' 
out after the contacts were ended),· 
the CIA's use of the underworld

'.seems ironic in retrospect. 
!'. Robert Kennedy's passionate ef~ 
'forts to disable organized crime are 
• well documented . 
1N 1960 when Robert Kennedy 
wrote about what he had learned 
of organized crime in America 
from his years as chief counsel to 
the Senate Rackets Committee, he 
-too quoted Giancana to make a 
point. 
He told about Giancana's inter• 
view at his local draft board at the 
outbreak of World War n, when 
he was asked what he did for a liv• 
ing. 
. "I steal," Giancana. is said -to 
have replied. 
; So Sam Giancana didn't go to 
war and years later would boast to 
'.Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that 
ne stayed out of the Army - la• 
:beled unfit - by telling the truth. 
1 "What's wrong with the syndi• 
•cate?" Kennedy_ quoted Giancana. 
_'."Two or three of us get together 
:on a business deal and everybody 
•says it's a bad thing. Businessmen 
;do it all the time - and nobody 
·'squawks." 
1 A Senate committee began stu-.­
!dying the Kennedy questions more: 
·'than a year ago as it looked at co­
lvert CIA activities. 
• t IN AN addendum to the Senate 
=Intelligence Committee's interim 
:report last November, Sen. Howard 
'Baker (R., Tenn.) said, "It is my 
!personal view that on balance the 
;likelihood that presidents (the re­
:port dealt with Dwight Eisenhower 
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro) 
assassination plots is greater than 
the likelihood that they did not." 
lust to trace Rosselli's histor. 
:with the CIA is mind-boggling for 
the investigators. Yet, it is just one 
Jspect of the search for his killer. 
'.·- Johnny Rosselli - born on the 
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and 
"71 when he died - was not first 
and foremost a CIA operative. ______ _ 
:{ His greater role as evidenced by 
two convictions, his associations 
:and to some extent his own com­
ments, was as an influential, if 
¥,ublicly lesser known, organized 
.crime figure. i.., 
·~ ,, HIS ASSOCIATION with other 
!Jdentified underworld members 
was monitored by law enforcement 
agencies as recently as several 
,weeks • before 1lis July 28 disap­
pearance.· • • 
"-:-By all accounts, Rosselli was a 
_charming man, dressing in expen•. 1 
!sive clothes, married for. only two· 
fyears • in the early 1940s and · 
)known most of his life as one who • 
/easify·attracted women. • 
1 He wa~ an ·immigrant who told • 
:in a short autobiography written . 
\about 1967 that his "life of crime" •. 
;began as a teenager in Boston, at­
;tempting arson for his stepfather 
:,and-stealing $50 on his own. As he·: 
ut!aveled west, ,finally to settle in. 
:California, his attention turned to . 
1bootlegging, gambling and dab• 
;!>ling in the movie business. -
~ . ., . 
j IT IS said that Rosselli guarded 
,the West Coast gambling interests 
;for Giancana 's Chicago syndicate. • 
l Why Rosselli was chosen by the 
;cIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un­
,clear, although CIA officials have 
since testified that they wanted the 
;J<ind of contacts in Cuba which or­
•ganized crime had made during the 
~re-Castro days when Havana was 
·a·,gamblers' haven. • - '· 
1 • Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence with • 
Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid­
ered the key underworld gambling 
figure in Havana.· 
The unraveling of CIA and un- ·· 
derworld conspiracies. an awesome.-
• :Web spanning decades. is left to a • 
team of nine in the Metro Homicide 
Division. It is a team now clearly 
consumed hv the task which has 
been a· full-time operation since 
Rosselli's body was pu_lled from 
Dumfoundling Bay on Aug. 7. •
