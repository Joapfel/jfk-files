MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting._ 7 A:e.;ril_l960 . . 
PRESENT: Mr. Merchant, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Gray, Gen. Cabell 
v{ Dominican Republic 
Mr. Gray asked the Acting DCI whether he had anything to add 
on foe situation in the Dominican Republic to what had been covered 
by himself and the Secretary of State that morning at the NSC meeting. 
General Cabell replied that he would only like to add the comment 
that it appears evident that Trujillo will not consider making any 
arrangements for an orderly succession to himseli, but that he will 
either hang on to the bitter end or flee the country on short notice, 
a la Batista. 
Mr. Gray asked. the Gr-cup's views on what happens after Trujillo, 
specifically how Castro can be kept out of the Dominican Republic. 
General Cabell commented that so far no worthwhile opposition to the 
Benefactor has been identified, and that in his opinion it might well 
become necessary to dispatch U.S. forces, openly identified as such, 
to the country in the immediate aftermath of the demise or flight of 
Trujillo. Mr. Merchant said that his preliminary thoughts were that 
there would probably be a good chance to get OAS support for a move 
of this kind to fores tall Castro; on the other hand, we might expect 
some internal revulsion at the arrival of u: S. forces because of the 
• memory of the Marine occupation. 
Mr. Merchant added that Mr. Rubottom was thinking seriously

via ·Haiti, thereby requiring any sizeable Castro. effort to be an 
amphibious one. He said that this plan has not yet been formally
