this can be done. very hard to do 
it, but I know that our position will be much worse in every 
way if we fail to tlo it. 
Now without trying to decide that now, let us proceed. 
Senator Schweiker. May I make one comment on that, Mr. 
Chairman? 
I have had vacillating feelings on public hearings, and I 
think what I have come down on is this. I think we should go 
ah&ad and issue a preliminary report without public· hearings. 
I think we should put the matter of public hearings in abeyar.ce 
untll we get into'the Chile thing and some of the other areas 
of so-called assassinations that may not be Presidential 
assassinations per se and leave th~ Committee option that we 
may well want to elect to go into what happened in Chile 
publicly· and bring up that assassination if that is what we 
det<!rmined. 
I have trouble.determining at this point in time whether 
w~ should have public hearings, and I think we ought to keeo 
that option open as we go ~long. 
Thd Chair~an. I have no argu~ant with thd Senator or. ~hat 
scor~. 
Senator Schweiker. I know. As I say, it reconciles with 
your viewi and it protects the rights of those who say they 
w~nt public hearings. 
The Chairman. I have no argum€:nt with that.
