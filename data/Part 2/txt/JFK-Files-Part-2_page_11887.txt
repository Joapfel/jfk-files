reau that such compensation must be reported as income when filing an 
income tax return.

rendered through a private enterprise or similar general term applicable

witness in Bureau case, determine whether he paid Federal and state 
taxes on income he received from Bureau for his, services. If such 
taxes have not been paid, obtain all pertinent details and promptly 
submit recommendations for handling situation.
