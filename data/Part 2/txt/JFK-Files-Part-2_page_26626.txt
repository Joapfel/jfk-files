that Soviet harassment of Allied ac­
cess routes to West Berlin will shift 
this weekend to the air corridors.

the Allied representatives yesterday 
that Soviet transports would be using 
the air corridors for brief flights 
during the next five weekends. 
c. Moscow has tried on a num­
ber of past occasions to assert its 
right to restri~t Allied use of the 
air corridots~ In early 1962, the

have since demanded that Western 
flights stay between stipulated al­
titudes, that we file flight plans 
in advance and provide prior notice 
of border-crossing times.
