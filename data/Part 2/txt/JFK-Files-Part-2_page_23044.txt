run by William Harvey? 
Mr. Halley. To de/elop the capability to carry on the 
assassination? 
Mr. Halley. No. I hav~ no knowledge of Harvey being 
focused on a project or-given the capability of carrying one 
out. 
Mr. Daron. Harvey has testified, as has Richard Bissell, 
I will represent to you, that instruction was given by Bissell 
to Harvey to set up, to develop such a capability in early 1961 
and that Harvey took st~ps to develop such a capability in 
coordination with an asset in New York named QJWIN and I think 
that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was 
involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under­
world in Europe and might be used for any number of dirty 
dec!dS. 
Mr. diGenova. It should be emphasized that the Executive 
Action Plan that you are referring to has had as its goal the 
incapacitation 6f foreign leaders, one possibility of 
·incapacitation hein~ the ultimate weapon, assassination. It. 
was just not assassination. It was a spectrum of activities 
that could be used to incapacitate a foreign leader an'{Where 
from illness, chemical warfare, and then including dea~.h. 
Correct me if I am wrong, but it was not tust assassination. 
Mr. Baron. Does that rin~ any bells?
