At an NSC meeting.presided over by Vice President 
NIXON, Allen DULLES reported "TRUJILLO'S position 
continued to weaken and was now quite precarious. 
[he] thought further attempts will be made to kill 
or oust TRUJILLO." Under Secretary of State 
DILLON said "if TRUJILLO could be removed'. from 
power in the Dominican Repub~ic while pro-CASTRO 
elements were prevented from seizing power 
in that country, our anti-CASTRO campaign 
throughout Latin America would receive a 
great boost. The Vice President agreed that 
getting rid of TRUJILLO would be a favorable 
develoE!_Jl_ent for us.
