government. As such, CIA consents to the release of these 
documents with the redactions proposed by the Board. 
15. (S) Proposal for Future Coordination: With regards t:o 
any other foreign government information that may exist in the 
files, CIA proposes that it approach its liaison services to 
request their consent in the release of their information when it 
would be appropriate to do so. Although recent events with 
Australia make it impossible for CIA to approach them at this 
time, this may not be so with other services. In cases were CIA 
beiieves, because of the nature of the relationship, that it 
would not be possible to request the consent of the service, CIA 
proposes that the documents either be postponed from release· or 
that CIA and Board's staff coordinate a summary.
