The December 27, 1963, edition of ''The New York World 
,egram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC 
?~as seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity 
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street 
rallies and ma93picket lines, and the direction of an active 
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. 
Its comparatively brief span of.life was attributed to mounting 
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional 
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United 
Nati0rs Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which 
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf 
by suspected presidentiaJ assassin Lee Hh Oswald. 
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second 
source advised that V. T. Lee had recently ,remarked that thq 
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another 
simiiar vrganization. 
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there 
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the 
FPCC had been dissolved.
