27 March 1963 
PARAGUAY 
1. About 60 Paraguayan nationals traveled to 
Cuba in 1962. It is estimated that over the past 
two years as many as 120 have been in Cuba long 
enough to receive appreciable political or military 
training. The preponderance of Paraguayan nationals 
visiting Cuba are political exiles living in Uru­
guay, Argentina, and Brazil. 
2. The Paraguayan Government forbids its 
nationals to visit Cuba, but cannot control trav­
elers who visit neighboring countries which have 
Cuban missions and then proceed illegally to Cuba. 
3. There are no reports that paramilitary 
trainees are active inside Paraguay. There is con­
siderable eviden6~ that some returnees have joined 
exile formations waiting on the Paraguayan border 
for a favorable occasion for incursions. 
4. Since January, 1962, at least 1,000 persons 
have been arrested for guerrilla, sabotage, terrorist 
or other subversive activity, but only an estimated 
140 were held for any appreciable length of time. 
We know of only one scheduled for trial, and none 
of those arrested is known to have received training 
in Cuba. 
5. Most of the arrests have stemmed from about 
10 major incidents, of which two involved sabotage 
and terrorism, one guerrilla activity, and the re­
mainder subversion. There is a rumor that the un­
known individual who placed a bomb in an Incarnacion 
bank had been trained in Cuba. Perpetrators of the 
other incidents have been identified, and none is 
known or believed to have received any training in 
Cuba. 
6. Federico Tatter and Anibal Garcete were re­
ported to have returned from Cuba in late 1962, Tatter 
to take over military direction of the United Front for 
National Liberation (FULNA), and Garcete to organize 
cane workers. We know of no other Cuban trainees who 
may be in positions of influence among Paraguayans.
