~;f Did Mr. Dulles tell you that President Eisenhower 
wanted Lumumba killed? 
Mr. Bissell: I am sure he didn't: 
Q: Did he ever tell you even circumlocutiously 
through this kind of cable? • • 
Mr. Bissell: Yes, I think his cable says it in effect.· 
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 33.) • 
As £cir discussions with Dulles about the source of autho­
rization for an assassination effort against Lumumba, Bissell 
stated: 
I think·tt·is probably unlikely that Allen Dulles 
would have said either the President or President 
Eisenhower even to me. I think he would have said, 
this is authorized in the highest quarters, and I 
would have known what he meant. (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
p. 48.) 
When asked if he had sufficient authority to move beyond the 
consideration or planning of assassination to order implementa­
tion of a plan, Bissell said, "I probably did think I had [such] 
authority" (Bi~sell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62). 
When informed about the Chief of Station's testimony 
about: the instructions he received from Gottlieb, Bissell said 
that despite his absence of a specific recollection: 
I would strongly infer in this case that such an 
authorization did pass through me, as it were, 
if Sid Gottlieb gave that firm instruction to the 
Station Chief. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40.) 
Bissell said that the DCI would have been the source of this 
authorization (Bissell, 9/10/75, p: 40).
