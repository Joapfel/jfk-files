Mr. Daron. Did you ever hear any discussion to the 
effect that the Agency was attempting to achieve through Artime 
indirectly. what they did not want to achieve directly in a 
fashion that.would be attributed to the CIA, namely the 
assassination of Castro? 
Mr. Halley. I think that l'OU have tied two issues together 
there and I do not think I can answer the question that way. 
I would like to Sdparate the question into two parts. 
Mr. Daron. Go ahe~d. 
Mr. Halley. The first part, as I mentioned to you earlier 
the CIA did establish a. relationship with Artime and he was 
12 givt:n funds and other support to run his approach to solving 
13 the Cuban probl~. lie was one of two such activities that were 
14 run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is 
15 correct that perhaps he was set up so t.hat there could be no 
16 dir~ct attribution in his activities to the United States, 
17 because he set up a base in· Nicaragua, and the story as I recall 
18 it was put out that he was receiving assistance from the 
19 Nicaraguan government, and therefore there was a part of the 
20 whole covi::r story, if you will, for him. 
21 So, yes, there was an attem~t to set him up as a parallel 
22 track or a separate track. That does not follow from that, in 
23 my perspective, that was geared tow~rds an assassination 
24 operation, because that was a fantastically large operation 
25 involving lots of people, you know, with substantial amounts of
