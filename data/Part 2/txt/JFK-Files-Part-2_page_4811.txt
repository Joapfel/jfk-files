INTERVIEWER: All right~ what about your impressions of Mr. 
Colby's cooperation with the Church and Pike Committee. 
MR. HALPERN: I knew you were going to ask that sooner or

big fight made by Colby on getting access to all the stuff on 
the Agency rather than just give i_t away. First of all I would

was wrong. A lot of peop)e defend him. And I have friends on 
both sides. And everybody knows where I stand. And I still
