many years, all my life. But when I was down here at that tim 
I knew he had a high position in the CIA, and was in charge 
of all this sort of stuff, and he was·at a number of meetings, 
there,, or'.·even at the ,·-Jhite House. He was an advisot.,to Mr. 
Dulles. So I say that is very likely. 
Mr. Baron. By this sort of stuff would you mean covert 
actions? 
Mr. Dillon. Covert actions or anything that was important 
enough in that general field to involve Mr. Dullesp The CIA, 
the President. He was a person there, one of the people that 
was talked to about it. There were three people. There were· 
really at that time Allen Dulles, General Cabell, and Bissell. 
Mr. Baron. Was it your general impression that this was 
a high level meeting -- a sufficiently high level meeting so 
that Allen Dulles might have been in attendance? 
Mr. Dillon. He could have been. 
Mr. Baron. And are there any other people who would have 
been likely candidates to have been in attendance at the 
meeting? 
Mr. Dillon. I imagine there must have-been some represen­
tative of the military there. But I don't know who it would 
have been. But there must have been someone else if the 
Secretary of Defense.was there. Now, Erwin, since he didn't 
allow these things, he might have been there. That is just 
supposition.
