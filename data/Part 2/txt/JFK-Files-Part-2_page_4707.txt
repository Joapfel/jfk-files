MR. HALPERN: Yes, Hel~s was the DCI then. Yes, '67. 
INTERVIEWER: ,okay. How about, the. question is raised sometimes: how are 
reforms and real or potential abuses processed within the Agency in the 
decades before 1975? 
MR. HALPERN: In practically every case that I know of, at least it went 
through the entire chain of command. Usua~ly the IG was in~olved, and then 
the Legal Counsel got involved. And people were demoted, people were fired, 
people were reassigned. It all depended on what the gravity of the situation 
was and there were all. kinds of different activities incl~ding some people who 
did nothing more than try to swipea few bucks. And some of those went to 
court actually. 
INTERVIEWER: Is that right? 
MR. HALPERN: And, in those days, we could do, with the help of the judge, 
have the trial in camera so 1t didn't get a lot of publicity. But we went 
through a 11 the ins and outs on a lot of this stuff and depending on. what the 
situation was, the General Counsel would take it over the Attorney General if 
necessary. It all depended on what happened. But there was every effort made 
first td try to clean it up inside th~ organization, inside CIA if possible. 
And if not you went outside and got whatever help you needed and invoked 
whatever laws were necessary to make sure something like this didn't hap~en 
again, and people were told. Usually you didn't get the names of the 
.individuals involved, we always tried to protect that. And it wasn't just 
because of privacy or anything like that, it's the nature of the businessA 
You don't talk about names. But the kind of activity weie usually well 
publicized at staff meetings and passed down the line. So you tell people so 
these things don't happen again. You can't always be sure they don't, but you 
try.
