• by· "the name· of • RIHA • in San Anl:on io, Texas , who was no z,e la t'ion 
to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia. 
According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antonio to 
leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for him to 
attempt to sell; however, the bracelet was eventually returned 
to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could 
,I locate no buyer. Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN-
BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler 
in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350. 
TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and 
actually paid him $~00 in cash with a promise to pay him an 
: additional $100 later, which he never received. 
CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered 
his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he 
witnessed at her insistence. By way of background, he explained 
that in the spring of 1969, TA?lNENBAUM introduced him to an 
elderly man by the name of GUSTAV FR~DERICH INGNERSEM, a plastics 
engineer and a native of Germany, who owned some type of plastics 
plant in Denver,. Colorado. He stated he had f o-rmerly done some 
work in plastics,·and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSE?: might 
help hi.~ get established in this field. As a result of this 
meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the 
company of TAHNENBAUM and her two chil-:iren, made two vacation 
trips to New Mexico with him. He stated l:hese trips were in 
either April or Hay, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised 
him that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNEHBAUM 
had him visit her residence where she told him that INGwERSEN 
had drawn up a will and signed it prior to his death, but had 
neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with 
Colorado law. She said that IIIGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had 
intended to ask him to witness the will, but harl died before this 
could be accomplished. She then coaxed him for over an hour to 
witness this document, and still believing she was a bona fide 
official in some Governmental capacity, he affixed his signature 
to the will. 
CERVENY concluded by sta1:ing that TANNENBAUM had never
