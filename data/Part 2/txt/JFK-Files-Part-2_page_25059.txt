) AFFIDAVI'l' 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SS: 
I, C. Douglas Dillon, being first duly sworn, do upon oath 
depose and state: 
From June 1959 until early January 1961, I served as Under 
Secretary of State. During approximately 35-40 percent of 
that time, I served as Acting Secretary of State because of 
Secretary Herter's absence from Washington. 
Secretary Herter, who preceded me as Under Secretary of State, 
had served as the State Department representative on the 54/12 
Committee, a predecessor of the present Forty Committee. When 
I became Under Secretary, the President asked me to retain my 
earlier responsibilities for foreign economic policy. Accord­
ingly, the Number 3 position in the Deparb~ent of State was 
designated as Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Robert 
Murphy was appointed to this position_and took over the State 
Department's responsibilities on the 54/12 Committee. 
Because of the frequency of my service as Acting Secretary of 
State, I was kept regularly informed of important 54/12 Com­
mittee decisions. On occasion I met with the 54/12 Committee 
and participated i~ ·its deliberations. 
During this entir~ period I have no recollection of any dis­
cussions or.decisions looking toward the assassination of 
either Generalissimo Trujillo or Prime Minister Castro. 
On one occasion in late July or early August of 1960, shortly 
after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington, I attended a meet­
ing in the Pentagon at which the overall Congo problem was dis­
cussed. During the discussion, which covered a great variety 
of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding the 
possibility of an assassination attempt against Lumumba was 
briefly raised; The CIA representative indicated that the Agency 
did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended considera­
tion of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any 
discussion of assassination attempts against anyone. 
Dated this/4./ day of May, 1975.
