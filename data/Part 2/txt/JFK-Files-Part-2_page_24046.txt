Approved, Drafting Subcommittee, 
l0/8/75 (Lumumba sections open 
to possible reconsideration) 
IV. Findings and Conclusions 
In evaluating the evidence and arriving at findings and 
conclusions, the· Committee- bas been guided by the following 
standards. We believe these standards to be appropriate to 
the constitutional duty of a Congressional committee. 
1. The Cammi ttee is not a court. Its primary role is 
not to determine individual guilt or innocence, but rather 
to draw upon the experiences of the past to better propose 
guidance for the future. 
2. It is .necessary to be cautious in reaching conclusions 
because of the amount of time that has passed since the events 
reviewed in this report, the inability of three Presidents and 
many other key figures to speak for themselves, the conflicting 
and ambiguous nature of much of the evidence, and the problems 
in assessing the weight to be given to particular documents 
and testimony. 
3. The Committee h·as tried to be fair to the persons 
involved in the events under examination while at the same 
time. responding to-·a need to understand the· facts in sufficient 
detail to lay a basis for informed recommendations. 
With these standards in mind, the Committee has arriv_ed at 
the following findings and conclusions.
