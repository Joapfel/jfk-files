Re: · The Ceritral Iritelligence Agency's Compliance with the JFK Assassination 
Records Collection Act, 44 u,s,c. § 2107 • 
Dear Mr. Deutch: 
Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board {
11
Review Board") has been 
working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,-- • 
to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. 
These actions have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy 
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) ("JFK 
. Act''). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group 
and-~~ Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and 
have appreciated the cooperation we have received. 
The purpose of this letter is to request your agency's cooperation in assisting the 
Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the f\merican 
people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplishBd to the greatest reasonable 
extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has 
identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President 
Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the 
public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials r~lated 
to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H. R Rep. No. 102-
625, Part 1, 102.d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) ("The Federal Government's failure to release 
official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled ·charges of 
government complicity in the assassination ... a salutary purpose is served in opening 
these files [relating to the JFK assassination] to allay the suspicion of government 
cover-up.").
