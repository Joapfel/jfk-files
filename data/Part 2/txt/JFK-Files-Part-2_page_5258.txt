Dear Mr. President: 
washington. D. C. 20505 
Under the "President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records 
Collection Act of 1992," this agency has been reviewing and 
forwarding to the National Archives all of its record¥~lating 
to the assassination of President Kennedy. As.a part of ·t:J:ia~ 
process, those records and specific information within records 
which were determined to require continuing protection were 
postponed from release under the guidelines of the Act. 
The Assassination Records Review Board appointed by you is 
responsible for reviewing the postponed materials not only of 
this agency, but all government departments involved in this 
effort. The Board then makes a determination that a particular 
postponement was justified under the Act or that it was not. 
If the latter occurs, the agency then has thirty days in which 
to presen~ its case to you and ask you to concur in the continued 
postponement. 
We are now at the. point where the Board has made a deter­
mination to release the names of two former Agency officers who 
·served in a covert status during their Agency careers in a number 
of overseas posts. The position of the Acting Deputy Director of 
Operations and one in which I concur, is that release of these 
two names would do harm to the Agency and its operations and, 
postponement is proper under the Act. In addition, the revela~ 
tion of these two names would not add to public understanding of 
assassination issues in any substantial way. Thus, I recommend 
that you direct the continued postponement of the two names. 
On behalf of the Agency, I thank you for your consideration 
of this request. 
Sincerely, 
John Deutch 
Director of Central Intelligence
