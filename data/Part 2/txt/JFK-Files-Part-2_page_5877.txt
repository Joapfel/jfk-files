SUBJECT: ~Re: blurb from JFK Board 
23 September 1998 
After reading the note below, I spoke with the GC, who working with Bob Caudle, was seeking to have 
included in the Board statement the fact that the DC/ had sent a letter endorsing my declaration. i 
suggested to the GC that even with this addition, the JFK Board comment would be most unfortunate. 
The whole six year effort was designed to put to rest all of the conspiracy theories and this comment 
would undercut the effort. In addition, it likely would result in significant additional questions, additional 
work for 0/M, OCA. OGG and PAS, and put the Agency in a bad light. I suggested that I should ask the 
EXDIR to sign the declaration. The GC interposed no objection. I then spoke with the EXDIR who agreed 
to sign a declaration if this would satisfy the situation. I informed the GC thafthe EXDIR was willing to 
sign and the GC asked me to inform Bob Caudle, which 1 did. After you spoke with Judge Tunheim and 
got his agreement to: 1) re tum the Cohen declaration and the DC/ letter and substitute the EXDIR 
declaration, and 2) eliminate the "blurb," I had the EXDIR sign the declaration. 
I subsequently briefed the DOA, ADDA, and ADDMS. of the above.
