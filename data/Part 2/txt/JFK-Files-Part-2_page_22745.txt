Mr. Kirbow. Can you see this getting any better with 
your new selectee who is coming from the outside world? 
Probably knows the term counterintelligence, but knows nothing 
about the intelligence community basically? 
Mr. Miler. I don'j -- quite frankly, I couldn't comment 
on Mr. Dush at all, but if Mr, Dush is going to have to rely 
on the current management and the current management of counter~ 
intelligence in the CIA, it is my view that he will get 
completely erroneous information and not have ·the advantage 
of understanding counterintetligence, and would be forced to 
make decisions which ultimately will be tragic to this 
country as far as counterintelligence is concerned, from 
ignorance. 
Senator !!art of Colorado. What kind of erroneous 
information? 
Mr, Miler. What counterintelligence is~ how it should 
be organized, what the threat to the nation is that can be 
hopefully countered by an effective counterintelligence organi­
zation which is integrated l.>etween the CIA, the FDI, the 
milit.:iry services, the Dep.:irtment of State, and all other 
agencies concerned. '--
