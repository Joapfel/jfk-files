(- The €hief 09scation was confident that he would have foreknowledge 
of Lumumba's departure and that action plans were prepared for that 
eventuality: 
DECISION Oil BP-ENCOUT \HLL !'RO!lABLY BE MADE 
Sl!OP.TLY. STATION EXPECTS TO llE ADVISED BY 
[AGENT] OF DECISION !,t!EH MADE... . STATIOll 
HAS SEVERAL POSSIBLE ASSETS TO USE IN EVENT 
OF BREA!.(OUT AND STUDYING SEVERAL PLAHS OF 
ACTION. (CIA Cable, 11/14/60.) 
There is no other evidence, however, that the CIA actually 
gained prior knowledge of Lumumba's plan to depart for Stanleyville. 
In fact, a.cable from Leopoldville on the day after Lumumba's 
escape betrays the station's complete ignorance about the circum­
stances of Lumumba' s departure (CIA Cable ~H 48484}, Leopoldville 
to Director, 11/28/60). 
But the same cable raises at least a question as to whether 
the CIA was involved in the capture of Lumumba enroute by Congolese 
troops: 
[STATION) WORKING WITH [CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT] 
TO GET ROADS BLOCKED AND TROOPS ALERTED . 
[BLOCK] POSSIBLE.ESCAPE ROUTE. (CIA Cable, 
11/28/60.) 
A cable of December 2 reporting Lumumba's capture militates 
against CIA involvement, however, because it portrays the Conr,olese 
forces as the source of the stat ion's information (CIA Cab le (rN 1064.3), 
Leopoldville to Director, 12/3/60). 
The (chief of) Station testified that he was "quite certain that 
there was no Agency involvement in any way" in Lumumba's departure
