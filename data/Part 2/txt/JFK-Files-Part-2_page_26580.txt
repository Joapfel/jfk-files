6. Czechoslovakia­

7. Cambodia 
a. Czech President and party 
boss Novotny has gone to Moscow, 
evidently for economic talks, judg­
ing by the composition of his dele­
gation. 
b. Novotny's background of 
Stalinist excesses have put him on 
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They 
also have given rise to control 
problems, particularly in the frac­
tious Slovak party where pressures 
for liberalization have made their 
mark. 
c. Party problems and Novotny's 
leadership may thus also come under 
review. 
d. A curious sign of the times 
is the fact that, although President 
Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential 
flag has remained up at the official 
residence. It might simply have been 
an oversight, but the symbolism will 
not be lost to the people in Prague. 
a. Cambodia, as expected, has 
asked the Geneva co-chairman to call 
the Geneva conference participants 
together (in Djakarta) to discuss 
measures "to ensure the internation­
ally' guaranteed and controlled neu­
tralization of Cambodia. 0
