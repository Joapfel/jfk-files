Mr. Schwarz. Would you distinguish, though, the part 
that is recollection and the part that is based upon other 
matters? 
Mr. Dundy. That is exactly what I would like to do. 
The part that is recollection is very vague. And I 
6 would say that I have no recollection of more than one conver-
7 
8 
sation on this subject. And the impression that sticks in 
my mind is that I was told about it in a general way. And 
9 it was described to me as an effort to study through the 
10 possibilities by which one might act against an individual 
11 in a conicxt other than that of espionage and counter~espionagc, 
12 a context more political.

Mr. Schwarz. When you say "act aguinst an individual", 
act in what fashion? 
Mr. Dundy. Act in a variety of fashions, as I recollect 
it, but up to and including killing the individual. 
17 The two things that I think ar~ clear jn my recollection 
18 about that -- three -- one, that it was a concept presented 
19 or described to me -- I was in effect heing briefed on it. 
20 Two, that it was entirely an untargettcd -- that it 
I 
21 I was in no sense a plan to do anything to anyone. 
22 And third, and I think quite important, that it was 
2:'.> not anoperation which had any specific target. 
24 Mr. Schwarz. You said you w,ere in effect briefed on it. 
25 Dy whom?
