that all CIA proprietaries have an operational charter approved 
by Congress which forbids launcing activities by proprietaries 
or using their funds which are contrary to the charter. This 
internal CIA standard would probably strengthen the existing 
requirement that covert action projects be certified by the 
President and flagged to Congressional Committees. At present, 
MHMUTUAL has such a charter (not reviewed or set by Congress) which 
restricts MUTUAL to insurance operations. This charter was 
established in 1974 (called an "Administrative Plan") and must 
be formally amended before the Chief of Cover Staff will authorize 
use of MUTUAL resources for other missions. 
D. Privat'e Inv'e'stment by CIA. 
The authority of the Agency to engage in private investments 
and its general policy ambivalence on this matter already have been 
noted. Two types of general as well as budget issues are presented, 
one the inverse of the other: 1) Could or should CIA engage in 
investments which could accumulate funds outside the budget process 
and hence be available for operations that have not public scrutiny 
outside CIA? 2) Is CIA investment policy too restrictive in regard 
to bank deposits? Specifically, should CIA place large amounts of 
money in private banks without charging interest? Some 20% of its 
annual $1.2 billion of appropriated and advanced funds goes into 
private deposit here and abroad; with year-end balances of about 
$150 million and average deposits considerably greater. The banks 
selected get an interest or investment bonus, Their selection is 
non-competitive, rooted in historic circumstance, albeit in insti­
tutions that have shown themselves flexible and responsive in
