-Jo·irn F. KENNEDY, November -rS, 1963 
By Saturday night, even the telc,·ision seemed worn 
out by attempt ,:ind failure anJ ceased lo commcrit ,1nd 
g,we over to a succession of Fhotogr.1phs of the col­
imns ancl the windows and. the corners d the \i'/hite 
House and of the shadows of the ['!'C;'lt Lincoln he,,d ,·, 
in Springfield and to a voice re(iting "Oh, C1ptain, 
My Captain." It is to be, then, the gr,,nd style. But the 
_ship has. not weathered every storm; J\'lr. Kennedy is 
not Abrah,im Lincoln; not bcc.iu~c he is more or less, 
but bec,rnse he is a remembered physic,,! prese:1ce Jnd 
Mr. Lincoln an im;ige of the pL1;;tic ,,rts. One's O\\'Il 
time is person,11, not historical. Just how king will it be 
before m,1ny of us will wzint lo read a book about the 
day Mr. Kennedy ,vas shot? 
The news of the President's ass,1ssin.1tion \\',15 f,i\'cn 
by a taxi driver to three gentlemen .,s they left ,1 hotel 
• on Arlington Street in Boston.· They turned right 
around and hurried back inside to ,1ttrnd 111 their in­
vestments. Packed with students ,incl l1u,;i11c~smen ,1 
shuttle plane from Boston to \V,1-;.hi:1ston \\'.lited for 
permis~ion to t,,ke oif when the c1pt,1i11,c1rnc-on the 
intercom: "Folks, up here on the flight deck we've been 
listening to the news ,1nd the President is dc,1,!." There 
was only time to hear one woman s,1y, "How drc,1d­
ful" before three men \-Vent b,1ck to discussing 11 !.111 
specifications. A college student re,iding ,\_,,:1rn1e11111on 
p,,· • ~o visible .:itlcnlion. One of his 1wtcs re,,d, "luvc-
in- ___ ,e." The plane took off, the stew,1rde% c:1llcctcd 
the money and started to serve drinks. Then the c,p­
tain was back ;igain,a:_hcy had been lislcning to more

news, thc1t is trying to listen to news bec.:iuse their 
real job w,1s to hear flight control. There had been a 
gun b,,ttle in DallJs; J r,1trolman was killed; the police 
had l.1kcn ,1 m«n in ~~·ie theJter. Vice President 
Johnson w.:is now the President. The talk of busi(}CSS 
\\·ent on through this, and stopred only when the cap­
L1in Jg:iin_ interrupted to s:iy thc1t the new President had 
been sworn in ;iboard an aircraft. A few laughed. 
They ask too much of us when they ask us to act up 
to the grand style. \-'v'e are not ,:m emotion,,lly affluent 
people. And yet some of us always complained that 
Mr. Kennedy did not seem quite emotionally commit­
ted enough. But now someone remembered with special 
affection a moment l..te in the -r960 cJmpaign. Mr. 
Kcnncdv w.:is in a motorcade and the Democratic gov­
ernor ·,,-'ho w.1s wilh him said how wonderful it wJs to 
fee! the love \vith which these crowds pressed forward 
to 1ecl 1hc touch oC their candidate. "Oh, dry up," Mr .. 
Kennedy s:iid. lt seemed now somehow a special grace 
in him th,1t he used only the re,1! in emotion and ab­
st,1i11cd from f.1bric,1ling the expected. He had too much 
respect for the 5r,1nd style to counterfeit it; how much 
t1·uer to him miv.ht we h<.1\·e been if we had come down ,, . 
in sc,1lc ;rnd if the many of us who must have remem­
bered the lines from Cyn1ucli11c hJd thought them 
proper lo spc,1k
