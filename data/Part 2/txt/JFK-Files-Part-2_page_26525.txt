MEM:ORANDUM. l.i"'OR THE PRESIDENT 
Subject: Your t--1eeting with President Lopez Mateos 
We do. not ex;pect to make any: major political decis_ions 
but want to p;ive new emphasis to the friendly relations 
which exist between Mexico and the United States. These 
relations are now at an all-time high. Me:,dco felt it had 
a real friend in President Kennedy. Th~y_feel the ~a.me 
z:elationshiE exists with.you but want to be reassured. A 
warm Texas handshake and abrazowhen yoU greet Lopez Mateos 
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that 
relationship. 
We want to stress the identity -of i:nt:ere:st.s of our two 
countries and our ability to work out in the nspirit of 
El_Chamizaln any problems that may arise between us. 
Desoite the ;Lnformal atmosphere of the visit, we 
should give scrupulous attention to Mexico's extreme 
sensitivity~_on s0vereign equalit:2: and Mexico's strong 
desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to the 
United States. 
Lopez Mateos B_Qeaks.for the Mexican Government and 
no important decision is made without.his approval. He 
has followed an ••independent" foreign policy but knows 
that good relations with us, especially in the economic , 
sphere, are essential to his country. At times his foreign 
policy has been too independent--for example on Cuba and in 
commercial and cultural relations trlth Communist China.
