By 1976 the office of the ~xecutive Officer of the· 
staff included a Privacy Act Section with four positions in 
addition to a three-person Records and Registry seetion. 
(FOIA •nd Privacy Act request& were handled together.) But 
this by no means solved the proble=. !n the fall of 1977, 
as DO ceiling and personnel reductions were being meted out 
and the staff was trying to gear itself to 9etting along 
with less, the DDO was advised that the staff's Privacy Act 
section vas eo strained and its personnel under so mueh 
pressure that henceforth it would not accept deadlines 
imposed by elements outside the staff. When requirements 
were received, the section would advise the ~eguester how 
muoh time would be required to complete the work. 
But nonoal FO?A and Privacy Act requests were not all; 
there were also specia).ty requests that had to be met. All 
had the common denominator of the staff's unique files and 
records. These ineluded such matters as: 
FOIA requests for infor,nation concerning Lee Harvey 
Oswald.•• Handling these required the creatiQn of a task 
force of 13 operations officers and analysts, plus clerical 
personnel, and their full-time efforts for over a month, 
Requests for interviews and/or information from the 
Senate and House Select Intelligence Conut1ittees, and the 
Department of Ju&tiee.

a&sessmant of and involvement with Oswald in the Soviet 
union had led to endless debriefing, analysis, and cross­
checking research on this subject.
