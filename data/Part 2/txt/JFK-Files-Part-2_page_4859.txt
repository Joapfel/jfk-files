• REF: NONE 
TEXT: 
1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE PASS PARAS 3-4 MESSAGE TO BSS 
AND ADVISE WHETHER THERE ARE SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO RELEASE OF BSS 
DOCUMENT (BEING FAXED SEPARATELY). 
2: HQS IS FAXING (OR E-MAILING, IF POSSIBLE) DOCUMENTS FOR 
STATION AND BSS REVIEW. 
* 3. THE DO<JFK>REVIEW TEAM ADVISED EUR/NG THAT A 1963 BRITISH 
SECURITY SERVICE DOCUMENT, WHICH HAD·BEEN ATTACHED TO.A CIA. 
DOCUMENT, IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED AT THE END OF THIS WEEK (31 
*JULY) TO THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD. THIS DOCUMENT 
(CSCI-3/778,353) DESCRIBES A MARCH 1963 INTERVIEW BY BSS IN 
.HALIFAX OF LILLIAN SLOBODA, WIFE OF VLADIMIR 0. SLOBODA, WHO WAS A 
DEFECTOR TO THE USSR. THE BOARD IS INTERESTED IN DOCUMENTS IN CIA 
. POSSESSION PERTAINING TO DEFECTORS TO THE SOVIET UNION AROUND THE 
*TIME OF OSWALD AND THE<JFKASSASSINATION.> EVEN THOUGH CIA 
OBTAINED THE DOCUMENT FROM A FOREIGN FRIENDLY SERVICE, IT WOULD 
THUS BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DENY RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENT IN 
FULL. 
4. WITHIN THAT CONTEXT, EUR/NG REVIEWED THE DOCUMENT AND 
PROPOSES REDACTION OF ALL REFERENCES TO BSS, CIA AND FBI (LEGATT 
LONDON RECEIVED A COPY OF THE INTERVIEW RESULTS IN 1963). THE 
PASSAGES WE WANT TO REDACT ARE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE FAXED COPIES 
WITH BRACKETS. WE CERTAINLY WILL FORWARD TO THE DO REVIEW TEAM 
'ANY ADDITIONAL DELETIONS REQUESTED BY STATION AND/OR BSS. ABSENT 
THESE FEW PASSAGES ABOUT US/UK INTELLIGENCE, THE DOCUMENT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO AFFECT CURRENT CIA EQUITIES; ON ITS FACE, IT ALSO DOES 
NOT APPEAR DAMAGING TO UK INTERESTS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE EXTREMELY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION GIVEN TO US BY 
SECRET
