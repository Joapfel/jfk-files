Bundy testified, however, that one reason for getting an 
estimate of this kind was to get it on record that we should 
not be "fussing" with questions of assassination and that it 
was not a sound policy. (Bundy, 7 /11/75, p. lt+l.) 
Bundy further testified that it was not um.isual to assess 
the implications of a foreiV,n leader's possible death, giving 
the cases of Stalin and DeGaulle as examples. In the case of 
' . 
Castro, Bundy said he felt it was only prudent to attempt to 
assess the question of a post-Castro Cuba since Castro was 
such a "dominant fip:ure;'. (Bundy, 7 /11/75, p. 145.) 
(c) The Standing Group's Discussion of U.S. Policy 
Towards Cuba 
The Standing Group's documents indicate it continued to 
assume the desirability of harassment, but recognized there 
were few practicAl measures the U.S. could take that ~ere 
likely to achieve Castro's overthrow. 
In his April 21, 1963 memorandum on "Cuban Alternatives" 
Bundy identified three possible new alternatives:. (1) forcing 
"a non-Communist solution in Cuba by all necessary means
11
, 
(2) insisting on "maJor but limited ends", or (3) moving 
11
in 
the direction of a gradual development of ~ome form of accorrrrno­
dation with Castro". (Bundy Memorandum to the.Standing Group, 
April 21, 1963, p. 3.) These alternatives were discussed at 
Standing Group meetings on April 23 and May .28, 1963.
