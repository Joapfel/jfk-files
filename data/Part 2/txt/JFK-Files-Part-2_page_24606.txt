knowil.edge of the AM/LASH assassination plot, however, the additional issue 
posed by that testimony does not really arise. 
(continued) 
of normalizing relations with Castro. (Rusk, 7/10/75, p. 85). Similarly, Bundy 
te.stified he "absolutely" did not believe President Kennedy would have authorized·: 
or permitted an assassination device to have been passed at the same time a 
possible rapprochment with Castro ~as being pursued. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 151). 
On the other hand, when the possibility of exploring better relations with 
Castro was initially raised (but before any talks were begun) Bundy indicated 
that it could be explored on a "separate track" while other proposed actions, 
such as sabotage, were going on. (Agenda for Special Group meeting of 4/29/63, 
p. 2.)
