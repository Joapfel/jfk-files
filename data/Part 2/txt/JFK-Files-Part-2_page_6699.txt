REFERENCE: A. Memo for C/IMB, dtd 27 Feb. 97, 
Same Subject 
B. Memo for DA/DO IROs (CSI 97-062), 
dtd 31 Jan 97 
The following actions need to be taken to complete the 
Agency's response to the JFK Board's Request for Additional 
Information and Records No. CIA-16 {Oswald Pre-Assassination 
Files>: 
a. Response to Reguest: CIA has to provide an official 
response that will become a part of the public record. The 
response should be a releasable version of your memorandum of 
27 February 1997; according to the classification markings, most 
of the text is unclassified. I recommend that you send me an 
anno~at:·ed copy indicating what can be released. I will prepare 
the response and coordinate it with you. Also please review the 
attachments to the memorandum for possible release. The JFK 
Board may consider documentation of the destruction of 
potentially relevant files as assassination records .. HRG will 
handle any additional coordination (OGC, DO, etc.) required. 
b. Transfer of Oswald's OS File{#0351164l: The original 
Office of Security subject file on Oswald currently held by the 
Office of Personnel Security should be transferred to the 
Historical Review Group. The file will be incorporated into the 
Agency's JFK Assassination Collection and reviewed for release 
under the JFK Act of 1992. Most documents in this file will 
probably be duplicates of documents in the HSCA sequestered 
mat~icll held by HRG, however, under the JFK law all "Oswald" 
fil~cft-e considered assassination records. The ARRB staff has 
asked for access to the file when practical.
