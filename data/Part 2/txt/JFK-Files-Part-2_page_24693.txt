tion of WIROGUE (O'Donnell, 9/11/.75, pp. 39-1,2). O'Donnell men­
tioned thatagenf QJHiN was considered for use on a "stron8 arm 
squad,lt but' said that this was for purposes more p;eneral than 
assassinations: 
surveillance teams where you have to go 
into crime areas ... where you need a 
fellow that if he gets in a box can fight 
his way out of it. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,

Richard Bissell recalled nothing of the WIROUGE approach to 
QJWIN (Bissell,. 9/11/75, p. 71). Bronson Tweedy did recall that

(Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 63). But Tweedy testified that WIROGUE would 
"absolutely not" have been used on an assassination mission against 
Lurnurnba because "he ·was basically dispatched, assessed and dealt 
with by the balance of the Division" rather.than by the two people

in the Africa Division -- Tweedy himself and h_is deputy, Glenn 
Fields -- who would have known tha.t the assassination of Lurnumba 
was being-considered (Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 64-65).

connected to an actual assassination plan, he would have transmitted 
a message in a more narrowly restricted channel than that in which 
this cable was sent. ·His cable on WIROGUE's approach to QJWIN was 
sent to headquarters with a security designation that allowed much 
wider distribution than the PROP cables that he sent and received 
concerning the Gottlieb -qssassination assignment. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 102.) In contrast, he limited distribution of the cable about
