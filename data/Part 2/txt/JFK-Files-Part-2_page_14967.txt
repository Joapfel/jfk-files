WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL. 
CRIME ON HIGH SEAS 
, Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year 
Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished 
information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons" 
of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the 
19~3 bombing of the Canadian freighter, -uHoward L. Shaw" 
in Chicago, Illinois. 
Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was 
immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose 
of paying him off a promised $8,000 for maintaining his silence 
relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison. 
The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an 
electronic device be attached to Cupp 's person to record con­
versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be 
obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be 
forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on 
1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the 
Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping 
is illegal. 
At approximately 9 P. M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney 
General called Mr. DeLoach relative to this case, indicating he 
felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason \vhy it 
. should not be used. Mr. De Loach informed the Acting Attorney 
• General if he felt this way he should put these views in writ1ng, 
since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then 
on the other hand be directed by the Departmentrto enter into such 
. procedures. The Acting Att~rney General, upon a 1110111ent's 
reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he 
probably would not put this request in ,vriting and perhaps would 
inform the Organized Crime Section of the DepartnH~~nt not to 
request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no 
such request from the Acting Attorney General.
