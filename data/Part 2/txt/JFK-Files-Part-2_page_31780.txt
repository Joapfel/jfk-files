·ROBERT SCHEER was interviewed.by BRANT FRAYNE 
and PAUL SALTZMAN a.t the Expo· ' 6 7 in Montr~al,. Quebec, G3.nada, 
in June, 1967, and the results·of this interview w_ere.showri 
on Canadian Broadcasting Company television netw9rk on .. _ February 
23, 1968. Some of the points emphasized by SCHEER.in this inter-
view are as follows: • • • 
11Ramparts11 magazine, of which SCHEER is Editor, tries 
:!.:o be exciting· and to fill· a void in American life. It tries 
-to handle the< stories the other ma.gazines do no1:. have the gu~s _. 
to handle and to give some diversity of opinion in the inassmedia 
of ·America. It ·is·an experiment in seeing whether American. 
freedom _and __ democracy really works~_ Other magazines .are ·locked 
into ·the establishment because_ of 1:h-e funding required to start a 
magazine and the income received from advertisers,while nRanipartsvi 
_ is probably the only large circulation magazine in America tha.t 
do~s not depend on advertising. • • • 
. . 
"Ramparts" made a decision to challenge the· big 
magazines and to turn·· to a secular monthly magazine two and a, 
half years ago.(about January, 1965) and it·no longer has any_ 
connection with or particular interest in the Catholic Chu'rch. 
It is aime.d at challenging the establishment and its readers , __ 
who are primarily in the 15 to 40 year age group. 
_;;RcUnparts" has been called a muckraker and 
left-wing. It is on the left of ~he politibil spectru~ since 
it opposes the war in Vietnam and is interested in removing the 
ghe-tt_os in American_ liff:!. "Ramp~ .. rtsn is biased .as a left-wing ~··· _,, 
oppo~ition to 'jTime" magazine but . nTimeu is biased toward the 
establishment and toward maintaining the status quo~ "Rampartsn. 
has never been sued for libel or had a serious challenge to its 
factual accuracy. "Ramparts'' ha.s a· small staff of only 30 and 
has_ successfully challenged the other big ~ag~zine~ with ext~n­
sive advertising revenue and has done a more factual reporting 
job on the Vietnam War, its casual ties, civil rights stories ... 
and stories on such topics as the children of suburbia rebelling 
against suburban community and its values.
