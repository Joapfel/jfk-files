Chicago, Illinois, until February, 1970. 
Internal factionalism during 1969 produced 
three main factions: Weatherman, Revolutionary 
Youth Movement (RYM), and Worke·r Student 
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and RYM no 
longer consider themselves associated with 
the SOS. The WSA faction continues to use 
the name SOS.

advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972~ 
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466 East 48th 
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF. 
The source advised that Clark, on November S, 
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed 
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed 
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU 
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's 
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU, 
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at 
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the vlBF 
has no common politics and no common political direction 
at this point and the WBF could become a defense connnittee, 
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack 
of any other direction.
