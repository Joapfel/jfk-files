used Ampex 70l's to tape the conversations they intercepted. He 
said that the calls were monitored by the three or four of the 
employees as they came in. These employees prepared the log 
sheets and the resumen (summary). The reels were then given to 
the transcribers who fixed the times and reel footage cite numbers 
to the specific conversations on the transcripts. Mr. Arehart said 
that the times on the transcripts would be accurate, usually, within 
15 minutes more or less. 
Mr. Arehart was shown transcripts from the Soviet and
