WASHINGTON. 0.C. 20515

Peter Carroll Glynn, Jr. 
April 25, 1977 
Pursuant to an earlier phone contact, I interviewed Mr. 
Glynn on his job at 4301 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland 
at 2:35 p.m. Friday, April 22, 1977. Subject is employed as 
an Intelligence Analyst by NOSIC (Naval Oceanic Surveillance 
Information Center) 763-2258 and resides at 107 Howard 
Street, Dumfries, Virginia, 221-8748. 
He was serving with the U.S. Army on 11-22-63 assigned 
to Fort Walters, Mineral Wells, Texas as a radio technician 
and as such regularly monitered messages between Mexico and 
Cuba. As a result, he overheard comments in the sphere which 
were adverse to the newly assassinated President and were 
upsetting to him. Although he doesn't recall the exact 
dialogue, the gist concerned the humor found by the Cubans 
and Mexicans appraising this murder as being done by his own 
people and yet suspecting foreigners like themselves. 
Consequently, it has occurred to Glynn that we may 
benefit by causing a thorough check to be made of the ASA 
(Army Security Agency) who Glynn believes recorded all such 
messages usually in tape form-and stored same. He also 
prepared dossier of which he_ gave me the original and one 
copy. , 
He goes on to say their mission at Fort Walters was 
labeled a training mission and, as such, was comprehensive 
enough to encompass the recording of all such collateral 
messages. Additionally, he recalls the Mexican sending 
station used the name of "Chihuahua." .... ----·----------,
