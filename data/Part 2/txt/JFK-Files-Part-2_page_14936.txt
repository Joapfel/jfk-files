An attendant problem has arisen in certain 
inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable 
requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of 
these involved a request for the results of the review later 
the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, _of 
absoiute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid 
checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best, 
a very dangerous procedure. 
With regard to those situations in which the 
Department has made disclosures to the var~ous courts, 
continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to 
inform the court of the fact that the installation in question 
has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority 
from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental 
authority which was granted. The Department has been repeatedly 
reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations. 
The volume involved in this project has caused 
a decided strain on the Bureau in prociessing these numerous 
inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when 
the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of 
indications by the Department that the full review may 
encompass as many as 30,000mmes.
