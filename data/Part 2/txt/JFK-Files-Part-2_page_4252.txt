It was estimated that Artime 1 s schedule of one operation per month was 
overly optin1istic; one every three m'onths was about all Arti.111e could 
accomplish. The decision was to drive home to Ar time that his greatest 
value was not in hazardous· hit-and-run actions but in his survival as a 
continuing psychological threat in being. 
Mr. FitzGerald, in discussing the current situation in Cuba, stated that 
he believed the regime was in considerable difficulty. There has been a 
large increase in the number of executions and 1nass arrests. He also cited 
the fact that an entire CIA Pinar del Rio net has been rolled up by Castro's 
security forces and the k_ey man executed. The sugar and crop prospects 
were not good, the world price having dropped. Some of the n1ernbers were 
surprised at this picture and stated it did not seem to conform to the daily 
bulletins. Mr. McCone said that he would ask for a SNIE on the current 
situation in Castro Cuba. 
A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve the underworld 
to assassinate certain Cuban leaders. Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical 
of the reported plots and stated that he would like to go into the 1natter further. 
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was being put on 
notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity 
of the reports and then undertake prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy 
would call-the matter to the Attorney General's attention as a 1natter of law 
enforcement.
