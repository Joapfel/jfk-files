Of this total estimated monthly cost~ $126 covers cost 
of leased lines in New York City and the balance, :/120,413, the 
_prorated salaries of _personnel working the _plants. Over one-half 
of the estimated monthly ex_penditure covers techn{JiBl surveillances 
which the Bureau would desire to· maintain for its:""dwn intelligence 
and investigative requirements, even in·the absence of requests by 
State De.partment for the coverage. The only two which do not qualify 
in this respect are the French Chancery and German Embqssy coverage. 
JJuring the _past··six months two technical surveillances 
maintained uruler this _phase of captioned _program were discontinued. 
The coverage of the Cuban Consulate in Miami which was instituted 
5/20/59 was discontinued 7/15/59 because it was not _particularly· 
productive. From 10/5/59 to 10/12/59 technical coverage was main­
_tained on the Iranian Embassy in J/lashington to supplement special . 
coverage of General Timur Bakhtiar, head of Iranian Security Police, 
at specific request of Mr. Robert l.furphy of State Department.
