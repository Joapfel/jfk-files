Oswald? 
Mr. Angleton. I don't know the full 'FBI story. I know 
there was a tremendous flap in the Bureau. And one of the bes 
men they had in my view is a professional a man called Burt 
Turner, who I understand just got his law degree. And Burt 
Turner was one of the finest men on Soviet KGB activities in 
the US, one of the analyzts. And he was in the Washington 
Field Office. And it is my understanding -- and this is 
basically hearsay, but from pretty good sources -- that Burt 
Turner was handling the Oswald or/ related matters at the time 
the President made the trip down to Texas, and that there was 
some confusion that the Bureau had not turned over, or had 
not taken enough initiative in turning over, all the infonna-
tion on Oswald to the local police. I had been told that 
there was a black mark put against Turner's name, and that he 
confronted Mr. Hoover and stated he was not going to permit, 
or have it be known to his children, that his negligence was 
responsible for the death of the President. And he was pretty 
forceful about his position. And as a result, this was 
expunged or something to that effect. And that is the reason 
he went to the Washington field Office instead of sta~ing in
