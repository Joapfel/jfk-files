It was agreed that the operations in question must go forward and that 
the amount did not seem unl'easonable for activities of this scope and

agreed that this matter should be laid before the appropriate higher 
authorities and a presentation would be arranged hopefully within the 
next ten days. This was believed to be wise, not because any actions 
involving major political risks were to be taken in the near future, but 
because the Agency would soon become committed to variouo substantial 
e:>,.-penditurcs which should not be undertaken witho_ut reasonable aasu~ance 
that the operation was to go forward,
