Areas of General Inquiry 
A .. Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter­
intelligence Activities 
The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI 
intelligence and counterintelligence activities. 
There may be serious question as to the adequacy 
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's 
functions in these fields. Current st~tutes 
, authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law 
e~forcement functions, but they do not specifically 
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence 
•activities. Ther~fore; the Committee seeks to 
determine whether the FBI'..s authority should be 
clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre­
hensive statutory charter .

B~ Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli­
gence Di vision • 
The c·ommittee is investigating the structure and· 
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi­
siona Proposals have been made that the national 
security intelligence and GOunterintelligence 
functions of the FBI should be lo~ged in a separate 
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's 
criminal investigative activities. Further recom­
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina~· 
~ion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies, 
·ror strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and 
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney 
General or an independent board,and for clearer 
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this 
g,.rea. Therefore, the Committee desires complete 
information on the operating practices and proce­
dures of the FBI Intelligence.Division and of the 
field office activities supervised by the Intelli­
gence Division.
