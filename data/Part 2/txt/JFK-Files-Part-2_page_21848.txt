The Bissell/Tweedy cable informed the (hief o~St.ation that 
he was to continue to use this indicator for 
ALL [CABLE] TRAFFIC THIS OP, WHICH YOU 
lt!STRUCTED HOLD ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF. 
(CIA Cable, 9/19/60.) 
The \Chief of}Station -- referred to herein as "Hedgman"* --
•. ' 
testified to a clear, independent recollection of receiving such 
a cable. Hedgman stated that in September of 1960 he received a 
"most unusual" cable from CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 11, 
43). The cable advised, in his words, that: 
someone who I would have recognized would 
arrive with instructions for me .... I 
believe the message was also marked for my 
eyes only ... and contained instructions 
1 that I was not to discuss the message with 
\,_,_ anyone. (Hedgman, 8/21/7.5, pp. 12-13.) 
Hedgman said that the cable did not specify the kind of instruc­
tions he was to receive, and it "did not refer to Lumumba in any 
way" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 12). 
Three days after the Bissell/Tweedy message that Hedgman was 
to meet "Sid" in Leopoldville, Bronson Tweedy uses the same sensi-
tivity indicator on a 
basis (CIA Cable, EUT 
cable sent to Hedgman on an "Eyes Only" 
74837\Tweedy to Leopoldville, 9/22/60). /

* Due to fear of reprisal from Lumumba's followers, the(chief 
of)station for the Congo from mid-summer 1960 through 1961 testi­
fied under the alias "Hedgman" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 2; 3/25/75, 
p. 4) .
