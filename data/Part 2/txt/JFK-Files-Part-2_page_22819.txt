decisions. 
Senator Baker. Thank you, sir. 
Do you have an independent recollection of the meeting 
or the encounter with President Kennedy in connection with 
MONGOOSE? 
Mr. Bundy~ Not a specific meeting, but of the process 
which led to this decision, yes. 
Senator Baker. Describe for me, if you will, what 
MONGOOSE was intended to be? 
Mr. Bundy. Well, MONGOOSE in a general way was the 
whole set of things to be concerned with mostly, but not only, 
( 
covert activities against the Communist regime in Cuba. 
Senator Baker. The chronology also quotes the memo as 
saying, one, we will use our available assets to go ahead 
with the discussed project in order to help Cuba overthrow 
the Communist regime. 
Can you elaborate on that? 
Mr. Bundy. Not without documentary assistance beyond 
what I have just said. It was to be a fairly wide ranging 
program. I believe that what that really sort of implies 
to me is that all departments are to cooperate, that the 
Committee is"to review possibilities, proposals, to seek 
them out, and that the thing is to he coordinated by the 
Committee, whose chairman will be -- this summary dolsn't 
say so, but my recollection is that the chairman was to be 
TOP SECRET.
