to run it in the s~nsitive politica~ clim~te caused by th~ 
mounting disclo~ures.about CIA involvement inLJEN-76 This 
wa;. especially so because of our.reservations about mainta1ning 
p_roper security for the listening post which, as with other 
6perational aspects of the cas~, was under FBI managc~cnt .
