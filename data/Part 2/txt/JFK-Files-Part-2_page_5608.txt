Agee Memo • New draft 
SECRET 
From the Desk of;Unda C. Cipriani 
Here it is ... with Jeremy's improvements. Please read it carefully as I had to rush through this. Some of Jeremy's comments were slight 
wording changes so as not to offend "the Board" so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOIA 
section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now 
because I did add a bit about Scelso being an "official". And don't forget to attach to Stokes-DC! letter which I will fax back to you. 
Have fun -and let me know if you need help.
