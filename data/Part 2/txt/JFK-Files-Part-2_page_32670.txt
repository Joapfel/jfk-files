Adverse weather precluded further flights until September 26th. Flights 
were flown on September 26, September 29, October 5 and October 7. These 
flights completed the coverage of those areas of Cuba which had been spotlighte 1• 
as requiring early attention. 
Weather prevented any additional flights until October 14. On October 
12, the Strategic Air Command was given responsibility for operating the U-2 
high altitude reconnaissance missions over Cuba, and on October 14, it flew 
the flight which gave the first hard evidence of the existence of strategic 
missiles in Cuba. 
E. Transfer of U-2 Flights from CIA to SAC 
There have been numerous news reports alleging the existence of a con­
flict between the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Strategic Air Com­
mand (SAC) with reference to the operation of the U-2 high altitude flights. 
These reports have contained allegations that a deadlock existed between CIA 
and SAC and that this was resolved at the policy level by transferring the func• 
tion of flying the U-2 missions from CIA to SAC. It has also been alleged that. 
this is one of the reasons for the delay in locating the MRBM sites in Cuba. 
These allegations have also been closely inquired into and have been 
found to be without merit. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that an~/ 
conflict between CIA and. SAC existed. or that there was any d.elay in photograph:1 
coverage of the island because of the fact that the U-2 program was being 
operated by CIA prior to October 14. 
Likewise, there is no evidence whatsoever of any deadlock between the 
two agencies or any conflict or d.ispute with respect to the question of by whon 
the flights should. be flown.
