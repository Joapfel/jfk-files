our world trade. These weights must be remo\'ed and 
this need must be attended to by Congress and our­
selves. We must endorse, broaden and acti\'ely sup­
port the steps that adjustment assistance can take 
to alleviate human distress, cushion the impact of 
change and spur internal transition to successful 
competitive enterprise. 
When we become more familiar with the great in­
fluence wielded by exports and the creati\'e capabil­
ities of companies that operate in many lands, we 
will do a lot more to overcome, where they exist. 
the .. penal ties we pay for the benefits we enjoy. I 
firmly believe this. 
If I have reminded you of both the pluses and 
minuses that world trade produces, ask yourself how 
much of this your family knows and understands. See 
how skillful you can be in finding ways to make this 
vital topic really interesting to your family, your 
neighbors, your associates and the other thinkers, 
teachers and decision-makers in your community. 
This we will do, wherever we have Honeywell 
people who have built their careers on unra\·eling 
knotty problems in research, production, dist~ibu­
tion, legislation and public affairs. 
We mean to do the things which will make the or­
dering of a sound world trade policy in the (nited 
States the logical and popular response to a broad 
and informed public petition. 
We intend to urge businessmen; labor leaders, and 
government officials to work for a system of world 
business that will create jobs all o\·er the world -
not in one country to the disadvantage of another. . D
