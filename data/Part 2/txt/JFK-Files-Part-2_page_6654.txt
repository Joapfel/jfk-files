ARRB Request CIA-9: President's Intelligence Checklists 
Could you take a few minutes before the ARP to look at how we are handling the Checklists. 
ARRB has requested 11 (Nov. 20-30); Jim Hanrahan is reviewing. 
-'" 
Have you finished your review of the 24 documents sent previously? If so could you bring them 
with you. 
The two items you gave me to review last week are not considered "assassination records"; you 
can close the book on them. 
The ARRB staff will not complete its review of DI documents until the end of this week. Hopefully 
they will not select many as assassination reeords (AR). If possible, I would like to .set up coordination 
session at IP. I will call you as soon as I know how many assassination records we have. 
Thanks for you help. 
Barry
