contact with General MINH or JXJN, but the generaJ.s :initiate contact, such contact 
were authorized. In the course of rreetings with MINH or OON, assurances were to 
be given as specified in DIH74228 of 9 October where:l.n COLBY had stated that the 
matter of MINH's plans be detailed clearly indicating that MINH's plans offer a 
hif;h prospect of success. 11 While vie do not wish to stimulate a coup we also do 
not wish to leave the jrnprc~:;sion that the U.S. would thwart a change of goverrnnent

of increasing effectiveness in military effort ....
