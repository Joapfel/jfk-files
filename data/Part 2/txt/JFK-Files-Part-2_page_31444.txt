CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMIZRICAi'T FREEDOMS 
A source advised on May 4, 1960, that the 
Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms (CCPAF) was 
organized in Los Angeles, California, in January, 1952, 
for the announced purpose of supporting a number of 
individuals from the medical and legal professions who had 
been subpoer..aed to appear before the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities. 
Since its establishment, the CCPAF, in extending 
its scope, has worked for the abolition of all Congressional, 
State, and local committees investigating subversive 
activities and in the latter part of 1954 became very active 
in opposition to State and Federal legislation directed 
at the Communist movement. 
FRANK WILKINSON, Executive Secretary of the 
CCPAF, is described by the source as the "brains and energy" 
behind the organization. 
Another source advised on September 17, 1952, 
that FRANK WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of 
September, 1952.
