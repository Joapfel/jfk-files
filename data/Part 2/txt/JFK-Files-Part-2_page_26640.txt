to the USSR and in the Mediter­
ranean. 
Deployment Patterns 
Soviet submarines are as­
signed to each of the four 
fleets--Northern, Pacific, Bal­
tic, and Black Sea. Because 
of the restricted exits from 
the Baltic and Black Seas,how­
ever, most of the missile­
equipped units and all of the 
nuclear-powered units are based 
in ice-free ports of the Kola 
Peninsula (Northern Fleet) and 
in the Pacific Fleet. 
The Soviets are apparently 
trying to reduce the dispropor­
tion between the two major 
fleets--the Northern and the 
Pacific. Although the North-
ern Fleet still holds the favored 
position, several nuclear sub­
marines have been transferred 
under the polar ice to the Pa­
cific and a number of modern 
diesel units have joined the 
Northern Sea Route convoy in 
past summers. 
The Baltic Fleet is re­
sponsible for protecting Soviet 
coastal waters and for furnish­
ing diesel submarines for pa­
trols off the US Polaris base 
at Holy Loch. Moscow has also 
begun sending Baltic Fleet sub­
marines to the Mediterranean to 
take some of the strain off the 
Northern Fleet, which has been 
furnishing most of the units 
operating there. There are no 
nuclear submarines in the Bal­
tic, and the few cruise-missile 
units there operate in coastal 
waters. 
The Montreux Convention 
of 1936 places severe limita­
tions on the passage of Soviet 
submarines through the Turkish 
Straits. Black Sea - based 
submarines can pass into the 
Mediterranean only if they are 
headed for another fleet area 
for repairs. For this reason, 
only older diesel units are 
based in the Black Sea. Once 
in the Mediterranean, however, 
these units operate there for 
about 60 days on their way to 
and from Baltic shipyards. 
Patrol Activity 
Most of the increase in 
the level of Soviet submarine 
operations during the past year 
is attributable to the station­
ing of a force of six to ten 
submarines--mostly diesel attack 
units--in the Mediterranean since
