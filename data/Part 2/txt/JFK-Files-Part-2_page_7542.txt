1. Subject examined the photographs of the unidentified 
man very carefully but was unable to provide any information. 
We did not mention the fact that a photograph of the man had 
been published in the Warren Commission report until Subject 
said that he was unable to identify the man. Subject still 
could not make any comment about the identity of the man. 
2. We are returning the photographs of the man as 
requested. We regret that Subject was unable to be of greater 
assistance on this matter.
