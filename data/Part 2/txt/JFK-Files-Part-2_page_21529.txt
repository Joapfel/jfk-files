Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned QJWINN. Was QJWINI an agent 
who you did hold in reserve for possible use in connection.·' 
with the Executive Action program? 
Mr. Harvey. No, QJWIN; is an agent that I considered for 
possible use and used for a limited period through 
for the spotting of individuals with criminal and underworld 
connections in Europe for possible multi-purpose use, none of 
whom were ever advised of the use, none of whom, as far as I 
personally know, were. evet used. 
Mr. Schwarz. But the multi-purpose use included as one 
purpose the possible use in assassination? 
Mr. Harvey. Onl~ sense that had we ever been saddled 
13 with a flat, if you will, command performance on assassination.

I might have considered the people spotted by WIW, as possibil­
ities. 
But, you see, before anybody that is ever spotted is 
approached for any operation and particularly -- and please, I 
don't mean to sound pedantic on this, --!--=don't. n~ean-~-- is

crosschecks, so on and so forth. This particular spotting 20

echanism never actually went that far, as far as I know. 
I only know of one use made by QJWIN. until we terminated 
23 him some months later, I don't remember the exact date. It was 
24 before I went to Rome. I know it was in connection with an 
25 peration in the Congo that was not an assassination operatic
