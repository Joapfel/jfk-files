1961, Maheu informed the FBI that the tap involved the CIA, 
and sugcested that Sheffield Edwards be contacted (File R-505, 
Memo, 4/20/61). Edwards subsequently informed the Bureau 
that the CIA would object to Maheu's prosecution because it 
might reveal sensitive information relating to the abortive 
Bay of Pigs invasion* (R-505, Summary of FBI file). In a 
memo dated April 24, 1962, Herbett J. Miller, Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, advised the Attorney 
General that the "national interest" would preclude any 
prosecutions based upon the tap. Following a briefing of 
the Attorney General by the CIA, a decision was made not to 
prosecute:**

** Maheu subsequently drew on his involvement with the CIA 
to avoid,testifying before Senator Edward Long's Committee 
investigating invasions of privacy in 1966, Acco;ding to the 
Inspector General's Report, when Maheu learned that the 
Committee intended to call him, "he applied pressure on the 
Agency in a variety of ways--suggesting that publicity might 
expose his past sensitive work for the CIA" (LG., p. 74). 
Lawrence Houston, General Counsel for the CIA, met with Maheu 
and his attorney, Edward P. Morgan, and informed Senator Long 
that Maheu had been involved in CIA operations (Houston, pp. 
58-60). As a result, the Long Committee did not call Maheu 
to testify.
