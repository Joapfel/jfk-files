Sound counterintelligence coverage requires sources to. 
produce .not only investigative data but also intelligence data of 
value to us and other agencies in ~·guiding policy and making. 
decisions. Bureau is expectea to produce intelligence data and 
we can anticipate criticism as well as operational _moves by other 
agencies to fill vacuum if our operations do not produce necessary 
data. Sound source programs are based on long-range planning and 
re qui re forUXlrd thinking to get results. Scrambling for sources 
in reaction to problems is too late and ineffective. . . •, 
. • Vital part of our coverage of friendly nations· is 
continuing development of informants and sources (persons) in diplo­
matic establishments in U.S. This is recognized intelligence technique 
and is aimed at all countries where need for data exists with emphasis 
on "trouble spot" countries that tend to drift tollXlrd, or are targets 
of, Soviet Bloc and those countries involved in situations with inter­
national ramificationso This program ha,s paid off in sound benefits 
and existing sources represent effective outposts for gathering data 
in event of_ emergency as well as for investigative purposes.
