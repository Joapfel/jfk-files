Recognizing delicacy oj contacting and developing s,~~!:\:~. 
sourc~s and close interrelationship· with pro bl ems of internat i Olla{ 
relations and developments we consult State Department regulapiy ·,,,. 
on our objectives and intentions. For example, when we feel\a • 
particular country is logical target for development of sources in 
their establishments in U.S~ we. cl'ear with State to be certain they.·· 
agree and to. insure that we are nbt running into ,risky foreign policy 
situationo If they agree to country·as target we· then clear with 
State on each investigation of potential source relating to that 
country. Providing investigation favorable we then go back again. 
to ob_tain clearance from State -for interview with potential source~ ~ 
These i~itial interviews are conducted -under pret-ext with idea of /;,,, ••• \ ~

We are running into problem here in that after State has • .r \ 
cleared country as target and has cleared individual investigat_ions 
l
they are too often declining clearance for interviews on basis· 
potential results not commensurate with risk involved. This failure 
to clear_final step after passing_on risk aspect twice before 
results in UXJ,steful expenditure of investigative time and these ,~,. 
turndouns at this p~int are bound to have initiative-destroying --~~-
