:trpression 
M::-. Osborn impresses the interviewe:c as being honest, intelligent, and dedicated 
to the interests of the United States and its people. His rre.m::n:y appeared to te 
in error in sorre details, but considering the wide range of the interview a.r.d 
the tine peric::d LnvolV2d, coupled with the \·:ide breadth on resronsibilities ar.d 
the rn.Jrrber of personnel under his .sui::ervision in the Office of Security, this 
is to be expected. 
There is one area in whia.'1. the interviewer was doubtful concerning the corrplete 
candor of Mr. o~!:::om. That w-~s the area of his kno"..;ledge concerning the 
Penninqton matter.
