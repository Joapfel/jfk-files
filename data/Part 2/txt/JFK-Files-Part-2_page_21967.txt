It seems to me, although the records don't re­
flect it, that there was a meeting in September, 
a very brief one, in which I must have been 
told that there was a specific program going 
underway. That probably would have been by 
Henry (Kissinger) and perhaps with Karamessines 
there. I am not sure. (Haig testimony, p; 12)

Karamessines discussed the Chilean situation by telephone with General 
Haig. He indicated that the Station had "made direct contact with a number 
of the senior military officers, especially those who had been reportedly 
very activist-minded and had received pessimistic reactions from all."

(Memorandum/~ELT, by William Broe, 10 October 1970) 
Haig recalled the.telephone conversation with Karamessines on the 10th. 
His recollection accords with the CIA memorandum of conversation. 
I do know, and I know that from looking at the 
record this m~rning, that Karamessines made a 
telephone call to me in which he gave a·progress 
report. I recall that. It was in effect a nega­
tive progress report, that they were just not com­
ing up with it. (Haig testimony, p. 12)
