COVER 
' James E. McCord reported in a memo dated 1 Mp.y 1956 
to the Chief, External Branch/SRS, that he approached Lee 
Pennington of the Americanism Co~~ittee of the American 
Legion to determine whether he, Pennington, would be agree­
able to supporting CIA by providing cover for Wiley's work. 
Pennington wholeheartedly agreed to do so, stating that: 
"1. Should questions arise from acquaintances 
or friends as to where the index cards for 
the 1933-1936 are located, that Wiley can 
tell them that their typing is being handled 
by the American Legion Americanism Committee 
in Washington. 
"2. That in Wiley's work for the coming year in 
continuing the index of the Daily Worker, 
that he can advise his friends and acquaint­
ances that the financing and continuati6n of 
i.,1iiS work is bcir:; ::::.r:cl-:::1. by t !"'e i\n1Pric:2:r1isut 
Committee of the American Legion. Should any­
one press him for further details, he can 
merely refer them to Lee Pennington, who will 
furnish them Hith the same story." 
On 23 August 1958, Wiley wrote a report entitled 
"The Problem of a 'Cover'" in which he claims his original 
cover given him has worn thin and for all purposei is not 
existent. Wiley cites examples to back up his contention 
and makes several suggestions for improvement of cover or 
the establishment of a new one. 
Apparently this latter memorandum initiated some action 
by SRS officers who were handling Wiley since in the fall of 
1958. Records indicate that Wiley had begun to build cover 
as a newsman and holds press credentials in the Nortl1 American 
Newspaper Alliance, Indianapolis Star, and National Review and 
he will attempt to obtain credentials from all newspapers and 
magazines with which he comes affiliated.
