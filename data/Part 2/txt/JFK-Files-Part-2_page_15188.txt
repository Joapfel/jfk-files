My memorandum 12/21/59 pointed out twel ve."~ .. field offices, 
directly or potentially involved under captioned program in the 
development of live sources within foreign official establishments 
in the U. So, had been requested to submit evaluati·o11.5 and suggestions 
regarding possible expansion of this phase of program. As a result 
three specific questions were raised. These were considered at 
Internal Security - ·Espionage Conference June 9-10, 1960, with 
results set forth hereinafter: . . . .. 
First question related to whether we should attempt 
source developments in establishments outside Washington, New York 
City, and San Francisco, where all existing sources currently 
operate, and whether we should alter present instructions that • 
potential sources be limited almost exclusively to employees of 
foreign establishments who are U.S. citizens. Conference decided 
that official establishments outside Washington and New York City 
for the most part are of a commercial nature with honorary consuls,. 
most of whom in fact are U.S. citizens. For this reason in 
absenc~ of a showing that valuable intelligence data migbt exist 
in establishments removed from these two cities it would not be. 
feasible to undertake extensive program to develop sources therein.

Second question related to whether we should relax : 
present requirement that .all authorized interviews with potential 
sources be initially conducted under suitable pretext, preferably 
in connection with criminal matter unrelated to the employment ·of
