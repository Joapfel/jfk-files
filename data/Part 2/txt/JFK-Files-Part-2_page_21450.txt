Ple2.Se forgive rny 's'io\.1ffe"".s:i:J••±a ans\·1ering your letter 
of February 12. Much has been happening here, not all of 
it for the best, as far as I can see, but I still believe 
that the sharoenin~ racial.and class contradictions in 
Bri tJ.in -..., and. elset1here in :Europe -,... in recent '\'7ee1':s will 
provide an excellent situation in which Marxist-Lcninists 
u • > 
can work mo~e vigorously than in the past here. But there 
still remain fuany other internal contradictions, personality 
~onflicts, distorted reflections 6f the Cultu~al Revolution, 
ebc. that must be.re~olved. I wish I could write in greater 
detail, but I am certain you understand, ·t:Ti th your experience., 
far more than I do. 
Con'cerning 11Comy,ade11 Laslci, nothing further has been 
heard of him since he left here for Paris. 8is great com-. 
rade here, ViH:e 3al{:er, who published. a ht,ge intervie'i'T yri th 
Laski in his publication, Red Front,' also took to attad:ing 
what he no\·r calls 11M2.o 's ultra-Left clique. 11 Whether Lasl:i 
approves of Baker's new anti-Mao line, I cannot. say, but 
birds of a feather do flock together ...

The person liVins with me that you mentioned in your ~ 
letter is a lady,·rnother of the young student at the Univeriitr 
of '\Jisconsin that you met at my hotel· in Chicago ·when I was 
last there. He is still very much in .the revis~onist party, 
although deeply disturbed by its general reformist, not to 
say capitulationist line, yet still greatly swayed by some 
of the CPUSA talile intellectu2.ls, p2.rticularly Apteker~• ;E 'do 
wish you cor:irades might help him to understand the correct 
line and find a way forward. 
Give my regards to your wife, who· I trust has now completlely. 
recovered from her bout of poorheilth. 
'.Fraterrially yours.,
