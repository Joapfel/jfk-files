. Recent analysis has discounted the acoustical evidence brought forward in the 
investigation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. See infra note

n6J. See House Select Committee on Assassinations, Report of the S~lect 
Committee on Assassinations, H.R. Rep. No, 95-1828 pt. 2 (1979), The House 
Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that the acoustical evidence 
established that a fourth shot was fired, and, therefore, there wa·s a •high 
probability" that two gunmen fired at President Kennedy. Id. at 65-79. The 
Committee relied on analyses of a dictabelt recording of the Dallas police 
channels. See id. at 66-67. Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. performed the first 
analysis and concluded - based on impulse patterns detected from the recording 
and an acoustical reconstruction of the assassination - that there was a sot 
chance of a fourth shot from the Grassy Knoll. See id. at 66-72. Mark Weise and 
Ernest Aschkenasy performed a follow-up analysis for the Committee and concluded 
that there was a. 951 chance there was a shot fired from the Grassy Knoll. ·See 
id. at 72-75. But see Posner, supra note 6, at 240-42 (arguing that the House 
Select Committee misinterpreted the acoustical evidence, and, therefore, it 
"failed to establish the number of shots ... scientifically'').

Fifth, the warren Commission Report - all 888 pages of it - was the work of 
lawyers, who not only dominated the Commission, but also its staff. the true 
authors of the Report. n64 The_ final document reads like a legal brief 
supporting the argumenc that Oswald committed the crime. The Report ought to 
have been a dispassionate analysis of all of the implications surrounding Che 
murder, some of which the Commission itself had no knowledge. n~S Instead, the 
Report was a mound of faces that obscured the issue of Oswald's motivation and 
portrayed him as a sullen, dysfunctional, and troubled loner. n66 By
