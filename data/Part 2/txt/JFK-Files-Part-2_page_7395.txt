had suggested a different orientation. Mr. Anderson, 
characterizing the enterprise as a survey rather than an 
investigatio~, stated that his instructions were from the 
Chairman of the Committee: thev called for a detailed 
review of the operation of th~ birectorate in its entirety. 
Mr. Walters would mention certain particular interests, 
noted below, but that did not set limits to .the ultimate 
scope of the survey. Mr. Walters then took over: 
a. He expects to do a complete review, from 
the managerial and substantive standpoint, of the 
Directorate. His initial interests indicated an 
auditor'? approach to these questions - how budgets 
are compiled,- examination of accounting pro·cedures 
for regular and special funds, cost systems and 
the like. • 
b. He went on, however, ·t.o the management 
aspects which they would also pursue to 
determine the results of the Directorate's 
operations - the value of intelligence produced 
v~rsu~ the costs involved in procuring it, and 
areas of possible overlap in coll~ction with 
the military and with NSA. 
c. Specific areas which would be explored, 
given, as examples, included contingency reserves, 
the "special retirement fund" (presumably 
referring to MHMUTUAL), the procedures for 
reimbursing the State Department for cover and 
support, piopriet~ries (how created, their 
justification, value and effectiveness), safe­
houses and."CA cadres." 
Mr. Anderson reluctantly agreed to Mr. Shackley's request 
for a memorandum spelling out these objectives in sufficient 
_detail so that we could take the managerial steps necessary 
to resolve any conflicts in the priority of the time of our 
managers and senior operations officers who would be 
involved in current operations as well as overlapping 
inquiries from other groups concurrently overseeing the 
Directorate. Mr. Anderson also asked for any ongoing studies 
which the Directorate might have which would aid the team 
in its work.
