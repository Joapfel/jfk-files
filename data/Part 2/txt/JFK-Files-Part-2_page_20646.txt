Re: WONAAC 
The SW? specifically wished the convention to 
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete 
control of the female h:xly by the individual female. 
This specific issue, nwomen control their bodies" was 
adopted by the wo~en's or1anization and all other propo­
sals were rejected. 
Workshops were organized for each of the many 
separate racial and ethni::: groups repn~sented at the 
conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci­
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by 
the SWP. 
A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop 
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending. 
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the 
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi­
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard 
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups 
all to often find themselves without a voice when real 
issues are involvedo 
Of particular importance to the group was the 
La Raza U~ida P&~ty 1 a legitixat~ political ~arty in Texas 
wh:l.ch serve::; to un::te ~,1exican A:u:::;:~ic.ans. Of equal impor­
tance ·was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group 
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want 
children and are forced to live with men ~ecause of the 
mores of American society. 
Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion 
law repeal-.will serve to unite· WO!':?U P.nder one 1;;inner ·and 
more effectively se-r-;r-e the Won1-en' s M:::iv~:"lent . 
The convention adjourned after an a~reement that 
an nAbortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972. 
This action would serve to k~ep public attention focused 
on the need to legalize abort~ofi and to seek effective 
support from the many thousands of ,;;omen who want to right 
to chooseo
