Mr. McCone referred to a paper prepared by the JCS at the 
request of the Secretary of Defense, outlining a possible schedule 
of reconnaissance missions over Laos and Vietnam, which seemed to 
Mr. McCone to be unduly heavy. Mr. Gilpatric explained that the 
paper had been drawn up as an annex to a draft contingency plan, 
and was responsive to a direct request from the Secretary of ·Defense 
to indicate a sizeable capability for high-level reconnaissance for 
intelligence purposes. Mr. Gilpatric added that it is clearly under­
stood that such activity would not represent a "show of force," and 
that the latter would requfre low-level activity. Mr. McCone agreed

level reconnaissance of denied-areas.

contingency nature and that at this point they are by no means
