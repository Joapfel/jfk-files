Mr. Goldsmith~- Think for a moment on the Nosenko issue. 
As Chief of the CI Staff, .t.f it were demonstrated to you very 
clearly that the story giv,m by Mr.:. Nosehko on Lee Harvey 
Oswald was full of contrad.~ctions and in· addition to contra­
dictions, it was in many w.1ys simply incredible, what impact 
would that have on the Agency's assessment of Mr. Nosenko as 
being a bona fide rather than a dispatched defector? 
Mr. Tovar. Well, it .Ls dffficult to answer~ You are 
posing a question in a nar:::ow sense. You are focusing on one

emerge there. I would ans,ier by saying that again I am not an 
expert on Nosenko. • I don' : profef:IS to have· a full grasp of 
his bona £ides or anything related to it. 
I would say that ques:ion alone would not be enough to 
satisfy me that the inquir:r had been made ca.refully. There is 
much more to it than what :~osenko had to say about Oswald. 
There are more aspects . abo· 1t the bona £ides issue, more than I 
could give you today.

go into every jot and tittle of the issue. 
Mr. Goldsmith. In fa:t, the Hart Report did not mention
