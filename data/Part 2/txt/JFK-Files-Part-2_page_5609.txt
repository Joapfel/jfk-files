Meeting with ARRB Staff 
,,23 August 1996 
1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell, 
Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff, 
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four 
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had 
been identified as p_otential appe_a_l_ items, and on the 
Agency's concerns{E~_the b~stralian d6cumerits) I requestE:_d

2. Marwell agreed to send a "staff recommendation" to 
the Board recommending that they delay the release of these 
four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The 
rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be 
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's 
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next_ 
Washington-meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the 
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing 
to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that -·--·----------·-
the Board would agree to delay the release. ·- •

evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to .....
