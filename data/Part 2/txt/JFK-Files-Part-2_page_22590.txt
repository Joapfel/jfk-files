Memorandum, dated 12 March 1970 by CIA Cover 
• Employee states: "Wiley apparently had telephonea Jim 
McCord and at the end of their discussion, Wiley, or 
McCord, had the call transferred to our number." 
Memorandum, dated 6 April 1970 by CIACover 
Emplo't_ee to Chief, SRS st2.tes: "I received the attached 
vouchers and an accounting from Wiley on Saturday. I note 
that araong other things, he spent over $120.00 on film. 
Should this part of the accounting be referred to 1,lcCo:td, 
or do we accept it as presented? It is not cleai that it 
meets Agency require~ents, as all expenses are n9t matched 
up by nece;:;sary receipts. 1'

Wiley" states: "Subject telephoned today after having 
talked with Mr. McCord and advised that he had unfortunately 
lost the race to be a Congressional candidate from his 
district." 
McCord may also have been in contact with Wiley during 
1970-71 concerning the monitoring of a book to be written 
by CIA c~vert Agent an ex-Communist and CIA source, who had 
been involved 1n certain operations for this Agency (not 
mentioned in the f~l~) in r,iexico. The Agency was rather 
concerned whether At~n<fo-v~\-ti1uld expose his working for CIA 
and assigned Wiley to help edit the book. The following 
excerpts from the file tend to support the above contention: 
A memorandum, dated 30 June 1970, captioned "Contact 
Report, Charles Wi 1 ey," state?: "Wi 1 ey further sugg_,es t cd 
that, along wi thc{irt rk<;.~rd, he continue to handle 1...,IA Covert Ager.t 
and would brief A;en~ve so as to keep him content until he, 
Wiley, returns from his European trip. 11 (This very probc1bly 
refers to CIA Covert Agent. •
