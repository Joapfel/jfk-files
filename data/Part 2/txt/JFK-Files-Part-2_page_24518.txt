D. Operation Mongoose 
1. The Creation of Operation Mongoose. In November 1962 the 
proposal for a major covert program to overthrow Castro was developed. 
Richard Goodwin, a special assistant to President Kennedy, and Edward 
Lansdale, a military officer with experience in counter-insurgency 
operations, played major staff roles in the creation of Mongoose. Both 
Goodwin and Lansdale worked closely with Robert Kennedy, who took an 
active interest in this preparatory stage and in the later conduct of 
Mongoose. On November 1, 1961, Goodwin advised the President that 
Robert Kennedy "would be the most effective commander" of the proposed

operation. (Memorandum to.the President, November 1, 1961, p. ).

regime". (Lansdale Ex. 11, Memorandum to the Secretary of State, ,'r1:~ ~1'."} .,,· ...
