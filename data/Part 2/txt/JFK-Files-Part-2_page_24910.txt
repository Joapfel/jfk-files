Helms' failure to inform McCone about the underworld operation 
when it was reactivated under Harvey and poison pills were 
sent to Cuba was a grave error in judgment, and Helms' excuses

told that the CIA's involvement in·an assassination plot had 
terminated with the Bay of Pigs. Not only did Edwards, who 
had briefed the Attorney General, know that the. operation had 
not been terminated, but Helms did not inform the Attorney 
General that the operation was still active when he learned 
that the Attorney General had been misled. Helms did not 
inform McCone of the plot until August 1962, and did so then
