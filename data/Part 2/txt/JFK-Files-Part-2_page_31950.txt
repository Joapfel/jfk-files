(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 14 November 1968, Hugo Rivera, 
Assistant Manager, American Finance Corporation, 556 7th Avenue, New York, 
New York, who resides at 2020 Walton Avenue, Bronx, New York 10453, was inter­
viewed at his place of employment concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has been 
a close friend of SUBJECT for approximately 12 years stated substantially 
as follows: 
Source and SUBJECT first met approximately 12 years ago when they 
were both attending elementary school at PS 20, Simpson and 167th Street, 
New Yori. They were classmates from elementary school through Junior High 
School number 40, Prospect Avenue, Bronx, New York, and through their 
sophomore year at Evander Ch:t-ids.0 High School, 800 East Gunhill Road, Bronx, 
New York, in 1962, when Source dropped out of school and went into the United 
States Army.· Source and SUBJECT visited each other regularly while they were 
in school together, and because of their mutual interest in coin and stamp 
collecting. After Source went into the Army he did not see SUBJECT again 
until iit~,discharge in 1964; however, they corresponded with each other 
regularly: Since 1964 they have had frequent social contact, and Rivera 
las.t saw MARTI on 12 November 1968 when HE was home on leave to attend the 
funeral of HIS uncle who Source knew only as Polo. 
Source believed that SUBJECT and HIS brother, Ivan, were born in 
Puerto Rico but came to New York City when they were very young. When they 
first met SUBJECT resided at 905 East 167th Street, Bronx, New York, with 
HIS parents, Reyes and Manuel Marti; HIS brother, Ivan, and their younger 
sister, Blanca, who is now approximately 14 years of age. Prior to HIS 
induction SUBJECT resided with HIS family at 1201 University Avenue, Bronx, 
New York. HIS mother died in early 1967 from lung cancer. HIS only known 
employment was with an insurance firm on Third Avenue, New York, New York, 
where MARTI worked as an IBM operator, further details unknown. SUBJECT'S 
father was formerly employed with an unknown shipping company, but Source 
had no knowledge of HIS present employment. HIS uncle, Polo, who died 
recently, used to operate a small grocery store on 163rd Street, Bronx, 
New Yor~, exact location not~r~called. 46 
SUBJECT and HIS brother were brought up in a very respectable 
home, and their mother exercised rigid control-over their activities even 
after they were fully grown. They were not allowed to participate in any 
of the games and other activities in which boys usually participate with 
the other children in the neighborhood, and as a result SUBJECT had had 
very few close friends. Most of SUBJECT'S spare time was always devoted 
to reading or to HIS hobby of coin and stamp collection. Although SUBJECT 
is a perfectly normal male, Source did not recall HIM ever having a
