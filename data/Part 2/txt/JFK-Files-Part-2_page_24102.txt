C. The need- for a statute.a Commendable and welcome as they are, .these 
CIA •directives are not·sufficiento Administrations change, CIA directors chang~, 
and someday in the future what was tried in the past may once again become a tempt-
' ation. Assassination plots did happen. It would be irresponsible for us not to do 
' all that we can do to prevent their happening again. Laws express .D.Ur society's. 
values; they deter those who migh( be tempted and stiffen the will of· those who' 
want to resist. 
The statute we recommend, .which is printed as an appendix to this _report, 
makes ·it a criminal offense for persons subject to the jur~sdiction of the United 
States 1) to ~onspire, within or outside the United States, to assassinate a 
foreign official; 2) to ~ttempt t6 assassinate a foreign official, oi 3) to assas­
sinate a foreign 'official. 
Present law makes it a ·crime to kill, or to conspire to kill, a foreign 
official or foreign official guest while such. a person is in the United States·. 
18 U.S.C. 1116; 18 U.S.C. 1117. However, there is no law which makes it a.crime 
to assassinate, or to conspire or attempt to assassinate, a foreign offfcial 
·while such official-is outside the .United States. Our proposed statute. i_s thus 
designed to close this gap in the law. 
Subs·ectio·n (a).· of- the proposed statute would punish conspiraci~s formed 
within the United States; subsection (b) punishes conspiracies outside of the 
.United States. Subsection (b) is necessary to eliminate the loophoie which would 
otherwise permit persons to simply leaye the United States. and .conspire abroad. 
Subsections (c) and _(d), respectively; make it an offense to attempt to kill or 
to kill a foreign official outside the United States. 
Subsections (a) through (d) specific.ally apply to any "o-fficer or employee 
of the United States" to make clear that the statute punishes conduct by U.S.
