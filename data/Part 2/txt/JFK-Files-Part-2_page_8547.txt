Item No. 49 MSS p. no. 71a 
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily 
Americari is still classified SECRET b~cause it describes 
intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper 
publications. CCS files contain a newsclip from the 
September and October 19 74 edition of the .Columbia 
Journalism Review which states, "Landon K. Thorne, Jr., 
the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA, Benjamin Shute, 
then a partner in the prestigious Wall Street law firm 
of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore, now acknowledge that the 
fourth .Partner [in the purchase of the Rorrie Daily American 
in 1956] was the CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrange­
m~nt 'atypical' of what the Agency was doing, •·a bad • 
example'." It is questionable whether the remarks made by 
Mr~ Bross,who retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute, 
who left the Agency long before that, can be considered 
as constituting official Agency disclosure of thi~ 
information.
