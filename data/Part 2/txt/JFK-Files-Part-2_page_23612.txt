The ~-n1i te House 
Followins up on our discussion of the Dominican Republic at 
yesterdc:y I s nee tin::; of t\1e Sy-ieciol Group, I am forwardinc you a 
draft tele;:r~rn which we vrould like to send to Henry Dearborn, our 
Cor..sul Ger.nral in Ciutb.cl Trujillo, surJplemen1.in:·; the cuic'.ance he 
uill be receiving on the recently approved contin:::;ency plans. 
The text of this draft telosram has been siloim to the Azency and 
ar,reed to by them. I am also fon:ardinc copies of the exchange 
with Dearborn leadinc up to the present draft teleeram to him. 
I know it. wiJ 1 be 'difflcult for the President to find time 
before he leaves to h:lVe a look at this but., in view of the situ­
ation in the Dominican HepubHc, I feel. tJ1a t ho should app1·ove it 
personally so as to be sure that it is cons i3tent with his vieus 
as stated in the USC Record of Actions for Hay 5.
