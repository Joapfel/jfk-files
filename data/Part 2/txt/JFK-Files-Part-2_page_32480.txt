pharmac,eutical manufacturer who is the spark-plug of IPES 
(Instituto de P esquisas Economicas e Sociais), the principal· demo-
cratic action group in the local business world. Looking around him 
at the ot..1-ler tables; occupied by a good many well-known figures of

No conclusi~ns, •• obviously, should be drawn fro~ such 
slender indications~ It has been my observation, however, that

be impossible' in Brazil, or believe that even if it occurred, it
