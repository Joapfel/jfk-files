division and set fortl1 it:: com,-;i.cnts and recommendations concerning 
investigative-activity to be undertaken to eliminate any weaknesses 
detected, In tho~e instl'.rnces in which the disolosed weakness i.s that 
of lack of adequate informant coverage_, ad"'75.se in detail of the 
number of Bu1>e[iu-appro-ved potential security informants being develo?ed 
in the particular area, as well as concrete plans to obtain additiou~l 
informant coverage in the future. 
Each survey should contain a statement that all persons idontified as 
members of the Communist P11rty are listed in the sec\n'i ty index, or ~re 
~nformants or sources. Any exceptions sh6uld be nimed and a statement 
made as to ·whe·i;hcr the name has previously been furnisbed to the Bure::i.u
