clashed with the CIA's strong evidence in 
support of postponement. Initially, the Board 
was inclined to release Scelso's true name, but 
the Agency argued convincingly against 
release. CIA provided evidence on the current 
status of the individual, shared correspon­
dence sent by him, and even arranged an 
interview between him and a Review Board 
staff member. As an interim step, the Review 
Board inserted his prior alias "Scelso" as sub­
stitute language. (See illustration.) Then, at its 
May 1996 meeting, Board members deter­
mined to release "Scelso's" true name in five 
years or upon his death.

c. Information that identifies CIA officers. 
i. Review Board guidelines. For specific 
information that, if released, would reveal 
the identity of an individual CIA officer that 
the Board had voted to protect, the Review 
Board protected the information. 
ii. Commentary. Whenever the Review 
Board voted to protect the identity of an indi­
vidual throughout federal agency assassina­
tion records, it had to be realistic enough to 
realize that some information about individu­
als is so specific that release of the information 
would reveal the individual's identity. Exam­
ples of specific identifying information include 
home addresses, birth dates, job titles, names . 
of family members, and other less obvious, but 
equally revealing pieces of information. 
d. Names of National Security Agency 
employees. 
i. Review Board guidelines. The Review 
Board protected the names of all National 
Security Agency employees that it encoun­
tered. The Review Board would have consid­
ered releasing names of National Security 
Agency employees if it determined that a par­
ticular name was extremely relevant to the 
assassination. 
ii. Commentary. Due to the nature of NSA 
information, few NSA employee names 
appeared in NSA's assassination records. 
Even though the Review Board did not often 
encounter NSA employee names, it did have 
to vote on those names that it did confront. 
NSA's policy of not releasing the names of its 
employees conflicted with section 6(l){A) of 
the JFK Act that presumed release of such 
information unless NSA could prove that 
individual NSA employee names required 
protection. NSAargued that the release of any 
names, other than those of publicly acknowl­
edged senior officials, jeopardized the poten­
tial security of U.S. cryptographic systems 
and those individuals. As it did with the 
names of other' intelligence agents and offi­
cers, the Review Board considered the names 
of NSA officers on a document-by-document 
basis. Given the nature of NSA information, 
the Review Board members agreed that none 
of the few names which appear in the docu­
ments, and for which NSA requested protec­
tion, was of high enough public interest or 
central to an understanding of the assassina­
tion story. Thus, it protected the names.
