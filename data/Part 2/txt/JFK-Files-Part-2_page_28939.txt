This will acknowledge your inquiry regarding the check(s) for the 
of rn.£/9?9 
.The Treasury Department desires that each person promptly receive the 
amount .due him but wishes to avoid unnecessary expense in record search­
ing w~.ich results in many instances in finding the check was correctly 
paid. On a notice, such as you have furnished us, the Treasury Department 
must necessarily search its payment records from the date of issuance of 
the check until the date that a substitute check will be issued. Because 
of the large volume of payments, the searching operation entails a heavy 
expense for each item. Accordingly, it is requested that you fill out 
the questionnaire on the reverse of this notice and RETURN IT IN THE 
: ENCLOSED ENVELOPE. UNLESS THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS RETURNED NO FURTHER 1 
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. 
If you receive the check before hearing from the Treasury Department 
you should notify the social security district office shown above. Y-ffl± 
-may 11se the enclosed post card to notify \leS. After sending in this noti­
fication, you may cash the check. 
Upon receipt of this questionnaire, action if necessary, will be taken 
by the Treasury Department to place a stop payment on the check and to 
refer the case to the United States Secret Service for investigation and 
clearance so a duplicate check can be sent to you. The Treasury Depart­
ment will get in touch with you if it needs further information.
