Dear Dr. Gunn: 
Re: Request for Additional Informat.ion and Records 
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and 
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File) 
This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent 
request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had 
on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments 
and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of 
Security questions. The DO response is pending. 
1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum 
containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel 
Security which provides details about the files it had on 
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they 
were created. These include the Office of Security file on 
Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to 
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files. 
2. Also enclosed at Tab Bis a 27 October 1977 
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which 
explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In 
particular, it explains why the "missingn volume V may never 
have existed. 
3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald 
Security file and the file on American defectors. 
4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and 
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB 
staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will 
be processed according to current release guidelines. 
If you have any questions about this response, please 
advise. 
Sincerely,. 
J. Barry Harrelson
