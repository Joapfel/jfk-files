CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
MEMORANDUM: Cuban Training of Latin American Sub­
versives 
SUMMARY 
1 .. We estimate that at least 1,500 to 2,000 
Latin Americans have received guerrilla training or 
political indoctrination in Cuba. 
2. We have recorded the travel of 5,059 Latin 
Americans to Cuba in 1962, and reporting to date in­
dicates that at least another 417 went during the 
first two months of 1963. 
3. Field replies to a survey estimate that there 
were about 11,000 arrests in Latin America during the 
past 15 months for terrorism, sabotage, guerrilla ac­
tivity, or other subversive activity. Only a small 
percentage of those arrested, however, were brought to 
trial; almost all were released after varying periods 
of detention. 
4. Current efforts to improve and exploit re~ 
porting on travel to Cuba had not made themselves 
felt during the reporting period. The security serv­
ices of Latin American countries accordingly were un­
able, with isolated individual exceptions, to estab­
lish Cuban direction, instigation or training of ar­
rested subversives. 
5. Incidence of guerrilla, terrorist, and sab­
otage activity at present is highest in Venezuela, 
Peru, and~-in the form of largely non-political ban­
ditry--Co!ombia. There is sporadic guerrilla activity 
in and around Nicaragua and Guatemala, and a guerrilla 
potential in Ecuador and Brazil.
