Historical Review Group

16 February 1995 
SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records 
Proposed Regulations 
1. Attached for your review and comment is a copy of 
proposed regulations prepared by the JFK Assassination 
Records Review Board. - -The regulations -focus on the 
definition of "assassination record", which is very broad. 
The possibility of requiring additional records searches is 
raised. 
2. The Board plans to discuss the regulations at its 
next meeting on 6-7 March, so it would be helpful to give 
the Board our input in advance of that meeting. Please 
provide Barry Harrelson (~92;) or me (x<30373;) with your 
co~ents by 1 March.
