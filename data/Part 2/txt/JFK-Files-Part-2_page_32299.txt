COORDINATORS ,. S RECOMMENDATION 
1. I recommend course (3), a specially tailored 
program for Brigade members. 
2. I recommend against a Presidential determination 
providing broader privileges for Brigade members. 
3. I recommend no change in existing U. S. military 
training programs for .Cubans, except that a Brigade reserve 
unit should be authorized and other Cuban reservists should 
be permitted to join. 
4. I recommend that the Brigade be induced rathe.r than 
forced to accept this proposal, and intend to arrange 
consultation with them immediately if this course of 
action is approved. 
Rationale 
Lacking an immediate military use for the Brigade we· 
shoulci disband the Brigade as such. . Since we may in the . I

militarily.-trained Cubans, we should encourage B'rigade. 
members t.o enlist in the existing military training 
program for Cubans and to enter-a U .. $ •. Reserve Unit
