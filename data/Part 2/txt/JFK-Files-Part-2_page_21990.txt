36. Memo, Chase to Bundy,. 4 March 1965 . 
Chase recommendPphasing out suppo1 t to Artime. The CIA is consider-
ing diluting pesticides sent to Cuba; tlis is similar to the kinds of tactics 
mentioned in Items 28:an(i 29 above and .re a manifestation of the moral 
bankruptcy of U.S. p(llicy. Also some tclk here Qf backing a new exile 
group, RECE, though not much enthusiasm for the idea from anyone apparently. 
Oddly, CIA wishes to drop its paramilitiry capability, while DoD and State 
want the capability maintained. 
37. Memo, Grant Hilliker (State) to Burdy, 18 June 1965. 
This is a summary of U.S. policy tcward Cuba. The ultimate objective ~~: 
is still to replace the Castro regime. The memo notes that "the paramilitary f-«·'!'" 
program involving CIA-controlled actionE was set aside even before it really 
started." 
38. Memo, Bundy to LBJ, 26 June 1965. 
Adm. Raborn recommends reactivatior: of a paramilitary effort against 
Cuba. Bundy, Tommy Thompson, Rusk, McNamara, and Cy Vance are against this 
chiefly because of the concomitant inter national noise level. ''Most of us, "Bundy 
writes, "do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba." Raborn's 
recommendations said nothing about assassination . 
39. Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 30 May 1966. 
Rostow notifies the President that a CIA exfiltration mission ran into 
ambush and the agents were captured. Th~ President could expect "the noise 
level of Castro's charges of 'threatened Yankee aggression' may go up." 
40. Memo, Karamessines, DDP, to Rostow, 7 August 1967. 
This memo is important because it llsts the names of two or three Cubans 
who worked on CIA'missions. If they are in the U.S., it '11)8y be worthwhile 
talking to them about their activities.
