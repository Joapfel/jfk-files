In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that 
on several occasiol)s he had been forced by the Government 
to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in 
civilian clothes~ and supplies of arms~ ~e also knew of 
other fisherm~n who had been forced to do the same. The men 
and arms were carried to small islands·or transferred to other 
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long-as four .or 
five days. The fisherman did not know the purpose or final 
destination of the men and arms.
