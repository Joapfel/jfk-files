On 1 July 1959, this Agency entered into contract 
with Wiley, as an independent contractor, at th~. salary 
rate of $9,100 per annum, with additional compensation 
in the amount of 5% of the above sum, to be paid in 
quarterly installments, representing the Government's 
contribution toward IViley's choice of programs for insur­
ance, retirement, medical and health. The contract speci­
fied that he would be reimbursed for operational trav~l 
as directed by OS, and for other approved operational 
expenses, subject to accounting applicable with Govern­
ment regulations. 
The annual compensation was subsequently increased 
on 1 July 1960 to $9,900 per annum and on 1 July 1961 to 
$10,500 per annum, plus additional 5% as noted above. 
Salary has remained at the latter level to the date of 
his terwination. The contract was to run for an inde­
.J=ini tP ::ieriod, and could be terminated without notice in

himself unavailable for acceptable service, and could 
otherwise be terminated by either Wiley or the Agency 
with 90 days' notice. 
From 1955 to 1959; Wiley was paid in cash, and for 
several years after the contract was signed, officers of 
SRS continued to pay Wiley his salary either in cash or 
through bank money orders. In 1964 payments of salary 
were made by the Office of Finance directly into his bank 
account in New York City. 
From 1959 to the present time, SRS obtained a copy 
of ~ach year's Federal Income Tax Return, and on at least 
two occasions, Wiley was given a personal briefing on the 
management of the Agency funds, vis-a-vis income from his 
self-established firm, World News Analysis, by Agency 
Finance Officers. In 196~, because of his failure to 
comply with the SRS's instructions to furnish complete 
details on his claimed expenses, the regular payment of 
"operational" expenses was terminated, necessitating that 
he reduce expenses which h·ere not rcimburseable from the 
firm's income.
