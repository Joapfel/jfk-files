of those stories, saying that his information came from many people,·

including Justice Department lawyers in Washington and the FBI. One 
story he heard was that Maheu tried to intervene in Washington, either· 
_through direct contacts_in.the FBI or at Justice or through_Edward·:p::-::-::-:

Nissen said that there are extensive files- on Roselli maintained by 
' • .•J the FBI o~ the,D_epartment. Nissen had a vague recollection that the files 
contained a story about Maheu somehow being involved in a wiretap on Sam 
Giancona, for whom Roselli worked. Nissen also remembered information 
about a meeting between Maheu and Giancona regarding_ Cuba, but he couldn't · 
- remember any of the specifics. . .. . , .
