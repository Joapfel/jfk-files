The government's penchant for secrecy fueled the public's corrosively 
cynical view of politics and politicians. During the Watergate investigation, 
Presidenl; Nixon proclaimed to ehe nation that he was •not a crook,a n35 but he 
soon abandoned the Oval Office and joined his disgraced.vice president n36 in 
private life. n37 In one of the great ironies of modern American politics, the 
instrument of Nixon's downfall was a secret recording system installed in the 
White House·. n3B What was supposed to be a tool to record reliably the
