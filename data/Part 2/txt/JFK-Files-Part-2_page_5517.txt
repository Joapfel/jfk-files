SECRET 
ENCLOSURE 
(We request that this enclosure be returned to CIA once the 
Review Board has completed its deliberations on the issues 
discussed below.) 
{U) The Central Intelligence Agency requests that the 
Assassination Records Review Board reconsider its determination 
on the six documents listed below: 
{U) 1. 104-10012-10080 and 104-10009-10224 
{substitute--language for a foreign country document). 
{S) The foreign government in question has expressed 
strong concern about USG and CIA's inability to keep secrets, 
and current relationships are very tense~ If we are required to 
release the date and/or narrow the geographic choices too 
closely, the foreign government will be able to identify the 
document as theirs. Because this document is scheduled for 
another review in July 1997, we request that the ARRB reconsider 
the inclusion of the date of the document and designation of the 
·country of origin as "Pacific Rim Country", and accept our 
originally submitted wording. • 
{U) 2. 104-10051-10106 {release of location) 
{S) We. request reconsideration of the release of the 
location identified in the last three words in the eleventh line, 
paragraph eight. This CIA base currently is undeclared to the 
host goverrunent.

governrne·nt ~ctivity/liaison) . . .. 
{S) Regarding the release of the reference to the passport 
camera.on page 3, it is not the USG's position to confirm that a 
foreign -·government undertakes such activity. In addition this is 
an on-going operation. Further, releasing the words in question 
would establish a strong inference that the two Agency officers 
were permitted by foreign officials to inspect the camera, thus
