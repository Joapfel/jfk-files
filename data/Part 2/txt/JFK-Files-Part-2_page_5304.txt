SUBJECT·: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues 
• The chronological files of C. Tracy Barnes, 1959-1964 
• Office of General Counsel, Lawrence Houston, 1959-196-!lJ' 
• Operational Diaries of William Harvey 1962-1963. 
This request will by its very breadth require significant time on 
the part of the directorate (and DCI) IROs. While it may appear 
overly broad, we have developed a methodology. with the ARRB st·aff 
which provides the access required by the Board but guarantees 
that their review·is focused: In sum, we work from shelf lists 
to narrow the selection and then conduct file review sessTons -
with the ARRB staff; if material requested is particula·rly 
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive Director 
.or members of the Board. This effort will coqtinue fof'"·some 
time. j

Conclusion 
15. (AIUO) At the present time, over 40 persons·are 
involved in the JFK records review and we anticipate that this 
level of effort may increase by 25% in the coming months as we 
near the statutqry end of the Board· (30 September 1998) .. 
However, even if the Board is not extended (and it has been 
extended previously), there are statutory tasks for CIA which 
will extend 12-1·8 months beyond the end of the Board's existence. 
Your continued support is critical.
