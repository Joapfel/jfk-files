Congres..1:1iong.l.8-~J~c;tpC?!llm.i,~e~'-~ d~ted M~.~h, -28,, 19-'.i,5., (attached) 
appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and 
in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the 
. .agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where........,...,..,... 
a Third Agency is indirectly involved and the material is sensitive with- I·­
out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third 
Agency in this instance of the furnishing of su~Ii information to the 
Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined. 
Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's 
request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved 
and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency 
involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should 
be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined. . • . .. . _ /J ~-
