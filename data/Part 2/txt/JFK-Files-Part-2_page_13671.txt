On 5-22-75 CIA requested from the FBI copies of 
photographs of three ''bums" who were taken into custody by Dallas 
authorities on 11-22-63 in the vicinity of the Texas School Book • 
Depository. It has been alleged that the three persons shown in th\, 
photographs were E. ·Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis_, individuals . 
involved in the Watergate·•incident, and Thomas Arthur Vallee, who 
was arrested in Chicago, Illinois, several days before the Kem1edy 
assassination based on a threat against the President. Don Donahue, 
Special Assistant to Senator Henry Jackson (D-Wash. ),made a,vailable 
on 9-12-74 to Inspector Bowers a set of the photographs depicting these 
''bums" which had been furnished to Donahue by one Michael Canfield,. 
and the F'BI Laboratory made copies from these prints, the original 
being returned to Donahue. Donahue requested that his identity be 1 
concealed as the source of these photographs. Canfield was supposed to 
furnish a set of these photographs to Washington Field Office but it has 
been determined he never did so. 
At Mr. Adams' instructions, Bowers contacted Donahue 
on 5-22-75 and advised him of the CIA request for a set of these photographs. 
Donahue -..vas told that if he 11:as no objections we intend to furnish CIA a : • 
set of the pictures with the sta.tement that the originals were obtained from 
an individual who requested his identity be concealed. Donahue stated that 
was quite satisfactory to him, adding that if it becomes necessary h:~----ul, -
agree to his identity being disclosed as the source of these picfur •.
