to in enclosure and to which Kraft raised a question 
sets forth the information that Kraft advised ~7FO on 
9/4/69 of the burglary of his residence 9/3/69. Kraft 
now has no recollection of having spoken to the FBI 
about the burglary. Pertinent FBIHQ main case files 
on Kraft {62-115682, 65-75629, 87-107157 and 105-6.8548) 
were reviewed by Supervisor T. B. Burns in connection

resolve this matter.
