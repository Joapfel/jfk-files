4. Faulty evaluatibn and the predisposition of the intelligence com­
munity to the philosophical conviction that it would be incompatible with 
Soviet policy to introduct strategic missiles into Cuba resulted in intelligenct 
judgments and evaluations which latet proved to be erroneous. Among these were; 
(a) It was not until after a confirming picture was obtained on 
October 25th, 1962, that it was established by the intelligence community that 
organized Soviet ground combat units were present in Ct.J.ba. At this.time our 
plans for a possible landing in Cuba were substantially complete and were neces-­
sarily based upon the information that our forces would face only indigenous 
Cuban defense forces. 
(b) The number of Soviet troops in Cuba was substantially under~ 
estimated throughout the crisis. On October 22nd, our intelligence people 
estimated that there were ~000 to 10,000 Soviets in Cuba. They now say that, 
at the height of the buildup, there were at least 22,000 Soviet personnel on 
the island. 
(c) It was not until the photographic evidence was obtained on 
October 14th that the intelligence community concluded that strategic missiles 
had been introduced into Cuba. In reaching their pre-October 14th negative 
judgment the intelligence analysts were strongly influenced by their judgment 
as to Soviet policy and indications that strategic miss.Hes were being installc(: 
were not given proper weight by the intelligence community. A contributing 
factor to this was the tendency on the part of the intelligence people to 
discredit and downgrade the reports of Cuban refugees and exiles. 
5. The Subcommittee has uncovered no evidence to substantiate charges 
and speculation about a photography "gap" having existed from September 5th to
