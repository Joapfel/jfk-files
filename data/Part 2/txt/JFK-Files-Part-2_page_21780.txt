everything. 
Mr. Wides. And so that's when you first set up the 
proprietary for the smaller debriefing component of ~$:m 
Mr. Sarno. Well, I set up the proprietaries, the notionar 
company for a small debriefing office, and at the same time, 
we rented a· building, a larger building, and they used to 
operate in Coral Gables, received some publicity and we moved 
them out of Coral Gables to near the airport in a building wherf 
the main office was, where this main office was, where these ! 
reports from the debriefers or any other information was 
I 
collected would be processed, typed in finished form, translate 
and provided to us. 
Mr. Wides. About how many people did you have in 
Cubans at that time? 
Mr. Sarno. Well, that's difficult to say. 
Mr.· Wides. 150? Would yous ay 150? 
Mr. Sarno. I woul1 say inside, outside, it couln be 
close to 150. 
Mr. Wides. Did· you have more than a dozen or so working 
in the component on debriefing? 
-· 
Mr. Sarno. As I recall, at one time -- as I recall it, 
we had about 22, 23 people working in debriefing. 
Mr. Wides. And apart from those Cubans, you had a staff 
under you of assistants and secretaries who were Agency 
assigned personnel?
