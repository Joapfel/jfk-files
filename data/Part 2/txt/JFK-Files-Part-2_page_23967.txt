I1mnediately following the assassination, all< Cli\ 
personnel in the Dominican Republic were removed from the 
country and within a few days Consul General Dearborn was 
back in Washington. The State Department cabled the CIA station 
in the Dominican Republic to destroy all records concerning 
coritacts with dissidents and any related matters, except not to

C. Immediate Post-Assassination Period 
The U<S. Consulate in the Dominican Republic was quick 
to dispatch its early reports that Trujillo had been assassinated, 
and the U.S. communications network transmitted the report to 
President Kennedy in Paris. The< President's Press Secretary, 
Pierre Salinger, made the first public announcement of the 
assassination, preceeding by several hours release of the news 
,,- in the Dominican Republic. Secretary of State Rusk testified 
that when he learned of Salinger's announcement he was most con­
cerned. Rusk said that Trujillo's son Ramfis was also in Paris 
and he was afraid that Ramfis, <upon first learning of his 
father's death fr~m the press secretary to the President of the 
U.S., might try to retaliate against President Kennedy. (Rusk, 
32, 33.)
