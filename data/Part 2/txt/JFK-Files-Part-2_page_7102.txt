Before the overthrow of Pr~sident Goulart, Cuba 
was engaged in an ~ctive subversive effort in Brazil 
providing funds, guerrilla training, and propaganda 
support to Communist and pro-Communist groups. Oper~t­
ing primarily through its embassy in Rio de Janeiro, 
Havana collaborated closely with Francisco Juliao's 
Peasant Leagues in northeast Brazil and with Leonel 
Brizola, Goulart's violently anti-American orother­
in-law. The former Cuban ambassador privately 
described Brizola as ha~ing the best prospects for 
starting a Castro-stule revolution in Brazil. The 
ambassador appeared to be favoring him over Juliao 
from l.ate 1963 until the April overthrow.

office of Prensa Latina. A Communist party member 
in the state of Bahia revealed, for example, that 
the local Communist newspaper was financed by Cuba.
