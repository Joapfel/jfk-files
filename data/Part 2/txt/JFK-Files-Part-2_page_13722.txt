Dear Mr. At.torney General: 
Last week's issue of Newsweek, on page 15, 
states: 
Hoover's Secrets 
! 
I Following the death last week of Clyde 
T·o1.son, J. 'Ed-gar fl'o·ove·r"'·s -010-se f:ra:·end and No. 
21 man at the FBI, two FBI agents reportedly 
removed some documents from the late direct.or's 
hoqse in Washington, where Tolson had been liv­
ing. Officially, the FBI denies taking any 
such act~on, and a friend o~ Tolson's says the 
1 only Hoover documents Tolson had were old can­
celed checks and tax returns. But Newsweek had 
reported earlier that some of Hoover's private 
dossiers, including information "very, very 
damaging" to persons in the Nixon White House, 
were left in Tolson's custody, and a source 
told Newsweek this week that the mate~ials were 
carted away in a truck. 
Assuming that the files in question may be part 
of the so-called "Official and Confidential 11 files, your 
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on February 
27, 1975, is instructive. You said that the number of 
files which you reviewed contained matters relating to 
"Presidential directives regarding the role of the F3I in 
the security :'ieid 11 and to the matters related to "clon:c-:stic
