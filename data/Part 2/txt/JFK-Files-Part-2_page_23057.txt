what you have said is a concern of not only yourself in terms of 
realizing that it was a possibility but· of ,pe~ple'.like Dean 
Rusk and Mr. McCone, who also said, you have to realize then 
once these agents are in another country and are supplied that 
thdre is littl~ if anything we can do to control those weapons 
after they receive them. It would qe safe to say th.at that, of 
course, was understood that there was a lack of control, and 
to the extent that it was a problem, it existed and had to be 
tolerated because of thg nature of the operatlon, would that 
10 be correct?

Hr. Halley. I do not know whether I want to phrase it 
dXactly as you have in terms of this lack of control. Our 
mission in dealing with these groups was to first, to put them 
in areas where we did not have other intelligence covers. Their 
first task was to collect intelligence. 
The: second task was to organize a resistance which would 
take armed action if we ever got a total package put together 
that ~ave us an opportunity -- that was the first and secondary 
missions. Once we issued the weapons to the team leader, if 
• yo~ will, he had freedom to recruit from among the peasants 
anybody he wanted to. If he gave the peasant a weapon, ther~ 
was no guarantee either by the team leader or by us that that 
peasant would not do something that we did not want him to do, 
To even shoot a militiaman, ~ou could have an arqum~nt, you 
Know, over a woman. Any numher of things.
