OCCUB.HENCE: COI13Y stated that nrJ'.he CIA had noth:ing to do with the assassination of Pres­
ident DIEf,J and Mr. NHU. 'Ihe actual assassination was a shock and surprise to everi1one in 
±he United States govern.'TEnt and when it was announced it was a matter of grave concern. 
In retrospect, one must realize that there was_, however_, considerable .debate about encourcJr 
ing and supporting the generals :in an overthrow of the DIEM regim2, and that the record is 
very clear that the United States tr.roUE.)l itsoverall policy was in support of that overthr 
and, of course, I think it is fair to say that in launch:ing a violent overthrow of a re­
girre :involved such as this, people are going to get hurt, and in this case, the leaders v:c. 
killed in the process.
