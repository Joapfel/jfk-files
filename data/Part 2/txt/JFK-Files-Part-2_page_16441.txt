... 
A source has advised that the Students for a De111ocratic 
-So.ciety (SDS), ~sit is k.nuwn today, carne fnto being at a founding 
convention held at Port Huron, l\:1ich.igan, in ,June, 19(~. From an 
initial ideological posture of "participatory den1ocracy, '.' the current 
line of the national leadership reyeals an adherence to IVIar~isn1- Leninisn1. 
Mie~ael Klonsky, National Secretary, in l\Iarrh, 1969, called for the 
builaing of a revolutionary IviarAist-Len.inist moven1cnt. The prog-ran1 
of SDS has moved from involven1ent in civil 1ir:hts strot~~i~ tn an ~n.ti­
Vie'tnam war position and finally to its present advocacy·~~f an anti-
.,., in1neria.li~t ii11e, linking up the oppressed peoples· of Asia, Africa and r f • 
Latin America \vith the black liberation n1<>ve111ent in the United States. 
China,.· Vietnam and Cuba p-re re~arded as countrjcs which are leading 
the world-wide struggles a~ainst United Stat~s irnperialisn1. On the 
other hand, SDS r0~ards the Soviet Union as an in1perialist power and~ 
does not support the policie's of that country.
