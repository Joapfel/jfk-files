should 1:)e apparent that all conceivable situations cannot be antici­
pated. For that reason~ the data below should be considered as pertai~­
ing to representative si'!;un.tions which occur frequently enough to 
warrant specific t1•e;:-,,tment. The basic rule to follow is, of course, 
that security information must be furnished promptly to inte~ested 
agencies in the executive branch of the Government and that the term 
"intere::ited agency,. must be interpreted in the light of reason and 
common sense., li.ny unusu.:..l situa·tions should be brought to ·rhe atten·t-ion 
of the Bureau promptly for consideratiori and disposi t~on. 
Considerations affesting the national defense in Alaska, Hawaii, and 
Puerto Rico necessitate that the broadest possible construction be 
given to the existing requirements of dissemination to the intelligence 
services located in those areas. The Anchorage, Honolulu, a~d San Juan' 
. Off.ices sh_ould adhere -to such policy and effect such disseminatio.n as to 
\/discharge fully our responsibilities as laid down in Bureau instructions, 
·( --tpgether with practices which have been dictated by circums ta.noes 
f!':ithin those particular offices., . • •

The material set out b':'low must be read in conjunction with the Manual

of Rules and Regulations,[pa.rt II,]section 5, which discus~es the Bureau's 
over-all responsibilities in dissemination, together with existing 
policies, qualifications, and exceptions.

the Manual of Rules and Regulations,[part II,]section 5. If 
any doubt exists, the matter should in all instances be resolved 
in favor of dissemination. • 
·_ (2} Employees of or persons having regular access to key facilities 
or employees o:f plants having contracts with the military 
services 
Dissemination in these cases is treated specifically in section
