Mann solicited Dearborn's comments concerning plans­
under discussion for forcing Trujillo from power. Dearborn 
replied in a detailed letter which concluded: 
"One further point which I should probably not even 
make~ From a purely practical standpoint, it will 
be best for us, for the OAS, and for the Dominican 
Republic if the Dominicans put an end to Trujillo 
before he leaves this island. If he h2s his millions 
and is a free agent, he will devote his life from 
exile to preventing stable· government in the D.R., to 
overturning democratic governments and establishing 
dictatorships in the Caribbean, and to assassinating 
his enemies. If I were a Dominican, which thank 
heaven I am not, I would favor destroying Trujillo as 
being the first necessary step in the salvation of 
my country and I would regard this, in fact, as my 
Christian duty. If you recall Dracula, you will 
remember it was necessary to drive a stake through 
his heart to prevent a continuation of his crimes. 
I believe sudden death would be more humane than 
the solution of the Nuncio who once told me he thought 
he should pray that Trujillo would hive a long and 
lingering illness." (Dearborn to.Mann letter, 10/27/60) 
C. Efforts to Convince Trujillo to Abdicate 
Throughout the fall of 1960, efforts wer·e made on both the 
diplomatic and economic fronts aimed at pressuring Trujillo 
into relinquishing control, and ideally, leaving the Dominican 
Republic. The use of high level emissaries, both from within 
and without the ranks of government, was considered. (Special 
Group Minutes, 9/8/60; Hann to Dearborn corres., 10/10/60) 
None of the efforts proved successful, and at the end of 1960 
Trujillo was still in absolute control
