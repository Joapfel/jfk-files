Castro's ability to continue to finance subversive 
activities in other Latin America areas~ President 
Eisenhower also objected to the focus on economic 
sabotage, and he would not agree to the plan to 
identify assets specifically for sabotage operations 
against the sugar industry. Eisenhower was willing 
to support a program to identify assets for the sugar 
indus_try ·" and other things as well ... including • 
even possibly things that might be drastic." In 
addition to identifying assets on a broad basis, the 
President also requested that a comprehensive covert 
.. 
action program be prepared by Mr. Dulles. This, it 
was suggested, should go to the Special.Group; and 
if they approved the plans, then the President wanted 
to discuss them. In any event, action on the PM pro­
gram would be delayed until Eisenhower returned from 
his upcoming Latin American visit and gave his 
specific.approval.* 23/ 
* The Minutes of the Special Group Meeting of 17 Feb­
ruary 1960 also noted t;hat 
Mr.·Joseph Scott of State also reported 
later that Mr. Herter had made exactly the 
same point. 
This appears to have been one of the few instances 
where Department of State representatives indicated 
support for possible direct action programs rather 
than political solutions to the Cuban problem.
