Gonzales considers Ray highly dangerous because of his ambition to play 
prominent role in Cuban government after overthrow of Castro. Thin.lcs he 
poises threat to Varona I s authority inside Cuba. Ray appears to have 
support of middle class, politicians and professfonals. Should Ray join 
FRD, Gonzales thinks be will still operate on a unilateral basis while 
seeking to supercede FRD with MRP.
