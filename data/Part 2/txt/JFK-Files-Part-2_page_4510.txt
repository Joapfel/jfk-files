11. The boat then travelled east for approximately two to three 
miles down the coast from Guanabo, and they attempted to land on the 
beach again. Due to large rocks and heavy surf they decided-not to 
attempt a landing and inste~d nnchorod the boat beyond the surf line 
(about 30 yards out) nnd both RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ swam into the beach. 
RODRIGUEZ went inla11-q ___ g;_mL.caug~_bus to Guana bo, and they went back 
to the safehouse ofiPaulo MARTIN.E~b At the ·safehouse he found the 
pickup team of J3LANf!'"n and .t\MBIG-4; and some ~8 people whom they had 
acquired as pas~ngers. These passengers were all relatives of BLANCO 
and AMBIG-41 and BLANCO and AMBIG-4 told RODRIGUEZ they had been unablE 
to locate the homes of Je.s.uS-GOMEZ-Cal.zAdil,la and AMLE0-3·and therefore 
had not been able to contact these families. They then returned the 
bona fides photos and messages to RODRIGUEZ to take back to AMLE0-3 
and GOMEZ. (AMLE0-3 commented bitterly on this point stating that 
AMBIG-4 and BLANCO probably went to ~heir own homes first,.and after 
seeing ~he number of their relatives who wanted to come, ~eyer even 
tr~~d-to--f.ind his home nor that of GOMEZ.) RODRIGUEZ, AMBIG-4, arul 
BLANCO agreed upon another exfiltration point to the east of Guanabo, 
and arranged recognition signals. RODRIGUEZ then returned to the boat, 
leaving A~UH9::-:1 __ and .-!HANC.Q_ to co°-yQy ___ ~he passengers in three cars to ' 
the exfiltration point. • •

12. RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ arrived at the exfiltration point about 
30 minutes after the appointedlDur of 2300 1 and halted the boat about 
100 meters offshore. They saw a light on top of the reef at which 
point RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that the light was the proper signal, 
(When asked about the recognition signals, LOPEZ stated that he did noi 
know what the exact signals were, but that they involved 2 or 3 lights 
and an exchange of names. He maintains that RODRIGUEZ handled all 
these details). They broµght the boat right up to the reef at which 
point they were fired upon from the top of the cliffs from the direct!( 
of the highway. (AMLABEL-1 asked LOPEZ how they had planned to get 
women and children down these steep cliffs. LQPEZ replied ±bat the 
difficqlties--involved .. had .. not ocQµ~r.ecL.to __ ·t_t~em. • By the same token, 
they had no extra food on board the boat to feed the families.) 
13. RODRIGUEZ shouted to LOPEZ to jump overboard to use the 
boat as protection against the rifle fire. LOPEZ states that RODRIGUE'. 
was hit as he jumped overboard. RODRIGUEZ could not swim because of 
his shoulder wound. On RODRIGUEZ' command, LOPEZ (who by this time 
had RODRIGUEZ around his neck) started to swim toward shore. LOPEZ 
decided this avenue of escape was foolish, and turned back toward the 
boat. LOPEZ pulled RODRIGUEZ aboard. He then claims that the rifle 
(FAL) and machine gun fire was redirected, at this point, in toward 
land ::ra..th~r than out to sea toward their boat. LOPEZ_s.tate's ..:t_fiat-· 
this diversfoii-wis-tfie only ~fiing which saved them. ----------·---
14. LOPEZ started the motor and was proceeding north when he 
saw the signal lights of 6 or 7 small boats ringed in a semi-circle 
in front of his boat. LOPEZ apprised RODRIGUEZ (laid out flat on the 
deck) of this new development. Even though bleeding and barely con­
scious RODRIGUEZ asked LOPEZ if he could see the lights of Matanzas 
City. LOPEZ said he could. RODRIGUEZ advised him to head toward 
Matanzas hugging the coastline. The patrol craft (or fishing boats) 
had since extinguished their lights. LOPEZ followed his advice and 
several hours later arrived off Matanzas City having eluded the patrol 
craft. RODRIGUEZ then told LOPEZ to turn the boat to the left until 
the compass showed "N", straighten out and follow that course to Key 
West. Three or four of the gas tanks had been pierced by the barrage, 
and there was barely enough gas left to make it to Key West~ Their 
last remaining water tank was also shot up. They arrived at approxi­
mately 1730 hours at Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock Island, Key West, 
Fla. on 12 May 1964. 
15. Upon arrival in Key West, Fla, RODRIGUEZ was hospitalized 
and X-Ray pictures disclosed that the bullet had entered above his 
right shouder blade and came out on his right side and penetrated thro, 
his arm. He had four cracked ribs, and it appeared that his right 
lung was not punctured, but there was some blood between his lung and 
the pl~ura ~nd the Subject was operated on successfully the morning
