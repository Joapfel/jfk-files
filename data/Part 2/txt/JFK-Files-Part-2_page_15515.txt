assist FBI investigations through three·principal phases: (1) 
Regular notification from u. ~. intelligence agencies as to 
arrival in U. s. of intelligence personnel from non-Soviet-blcic . 
. countries; (2) Mai'ntenance. of _telephone surveillance of off ici8.l 
establishments of selected non-Soviet~bloc countries with-approval 
·oi State Department; and (3).Development.of live sources within • 
such-diplomatic establish~ents. 
SCOPE AND COST: 
The fi,rst phase consists chiefly of file. reviews cl.nd 
., ind~xing at the ·seii't of Gover·nment at nominal cost .• 
. .. Under the se~J~n~d phase we are presently operating 12 
telephone surveillances .co'Vering establishments of 11 non-Soviet­
blo9 countries .. The countries are: Algeria, China, Dominican 
Republic, France, India, Israel, Jordan, Panama, United Arab 
Republic, Venezuela and Vtetnam. The cost.of operating this •. 
Ji)ase of the program consi.sts • primarily of monitoring the technical 
.installations involved and· the translation of the intelligence 
product. These costs are. anal~zed each time the telephone ... 
surve·111ance i: justified- (on. a quarterly ba~j_s af~er ~h~ f~~'() 
month's operation). The ·cost appears to_ be rully Justif 1ed '--~~ 
based on value of data developed. • • • •

Under the third phase of this prog'ram we curr ::.-:.nt ly have.
