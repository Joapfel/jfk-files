February 6, 1978 • • 
Thia is a retyped letter. I visited Mr. Ferry , Deputy District 
Attorney, on August 16, 1977~ I told in the office that F.n.1. agents and 
Secret Service use police department to harass me •. Police department do 
supply pencil of anesthesia gas to the manager of the building I live. The 
manaser do, or use certain people. to free7.e me by anesthesia gas •· then push 
dru 6a, poison in my mouth to torture me - to take my sleep away - or bleed 
by rectal and they use many other che~icals to b~ainwash'me to use m~ in 
political assassination which I refused.On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on 
•, 8th and I Streets, man came to me from police or poet office, u.s. Department 
of Justice and freeze me by sas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will 
tell :)'OU where to go to shoot • to ·kill - Mr. Sargent Shriver. .I· refused. 
Manager, Mr. Sisal, of Marshall Hotel, cull on- the man to tell me this on 
the street. In February 1976, police intelligence told me that assassination 
will not happe~ here. How about to·moye to Maryland state. 
In this letter I ask you to get report from Dr. Fredericks. Bak~r, M.D.

bleed today very much and I am· weak. In this lette·r I ask you to give re-
s train order or respond to me what could be done •. The right wing in Americ,, 
made record to use me in· aosassination. I refuse. I am human and I like t~ 
be treated as human. Police put frame·up on me• just to take advantages ol' 
me. Police use lie, police use mental case to take advantages on me and tcli 
me that right wing do use such people like me. To prove I enclose copy mid­
night June 14, 1976 •. Also _I enclose copy letter I sent.to Mr. Ted Sheedy,
