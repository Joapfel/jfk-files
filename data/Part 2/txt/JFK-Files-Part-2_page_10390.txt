-Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation ·in a 
letter to The 1'.·ashini::tcn Post and said that the polygraph 
examinations hac bcon ccn~ucted by another agency. -Specu­
lation centcree around the Agency, but after a ~ay or so, 
press speculation in this regard died a~ay. 
8. Wenl86 app~rently hai never been satisfied 
and has been pressing ~Ir. Charles Bray, State Department 
spokesman, for confir~ation of Agency involvement. ~Ir. 
Bray learned today that Idenl86 plans to use a press 
conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press 
this point further. Mr. Bray_has been given guidance by 
Mr. Gentile to avoid confirrn~tion but if this is im~ossible 
he will indicate the exaninations were conducted by State 
Department Security officials utilizing an operator and 
a machine detailed to the Depa~tment for this purpose. I 
do not know ~hether or not the fact that the governnent-wide 
investigatjon h·as directed by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to 
Wenl86 but I suspect that it is and that this is the 
reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David 
Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an 
internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the 
White House v:as sa tis ficd that no Agency employee was 
the source.
