C. The July Overflight Program 
10. On 10 July, General Taylor, motivated primarily by 
the extcinsive use of aerial reconnaissance in following Chi­
nese Communist military activities in Fukien, had.asked the 
DCI for a comprehensive review of aerial photography a~tivi­
ties. The end-product of this exercise was a series of mem­
oranda dated approximately 16 July from the DD/I to ~he DCI. 
The one on Cuba recommended that U-2 flights over Cuba be 
continued at their current level of two a month. It cited 
inter alia in justification that earlier missions over Cuba 
had provided "conclusive evidence that recurring reports of 
submarines and missile bases in Cuba have been false," and 
that "our most important need is for any evidence of the de­
ployment of SA-2 missiles and/or MIG-2ls in Cuba." This_ 
proposal was approved by tha Special Group on 19 July and 
later by the President~ • 
11. The first of the two Cuban U-2 missions authorized 
for. August was flown on 5 August~ probably just too soon ·to 
detect significant reflections of the Soviet equipment enter­
ing the i~land at that time. The second mission was orig­
inally scheduled for 8 August but caricelled because of weather. 
The next·day the Special Group gave the DCI discretion to fly 
the second August mission "whenever the immediate situation 
with regard to Soviet materiel justified it." COMOR reaffirmed 
its requirement for the second mission on 13 August. The mis­
sion was again scheduled for the period beginning on the 19th,. 
held up for 9 days by weather and eventually flown on 29 August.
