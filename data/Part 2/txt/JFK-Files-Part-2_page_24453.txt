tion Plots During His Tenure as DCI 
The CIA considered several assassination plots 
against Castro during McCone's tenure as Director. Harvey 
initiated his corttact with Roselli in April 1962, and the 
operation involving underworld figures continued into early_ 
1963. In early 1963 the CIA looked into the possibility of 
assassinating Castro with an exploding seashell and contaminated 
diving suit. k"'-1/LASH was offered a p-oison pen device in 
November 1963, and caches of arms were delivered to Cuba for 
his use in the following year. 
(i) McCone Testified That He Did Not Authorize 
or Know About the Castro Plots and That He Would Have Dis-
approved th~ Plots Had He Been Asked

the plots to assassinate ·Castro which took place during the 
years in which he was DCI, and that he did not authorize those 
plots.* (McCone, 6/6/75, pp. 33, 44-45) He testified that he 
was not briefed about the assassination plots by Dulles, 
Bissell, Helms, or anyone else when he succeeded Dulles as 
Director in November 1961 (McCone, 6/6/75, pp. 6-7, 17), and 
that if he had ever been asked about the plots, he would have 
disapproved. (McCone, 6/6/75, p. 47) McCone testified:

in August, 1963, long after it had been terminated. See discussion,
