T P SECRET 
Mr. Baron. And I believe you had said to me before that 
despite your absence of a clear recolleciton as to which CIA 
people were there, it was clear to you that some top level 
CIA people were there? 
Mr. Dillon. Top enough, so that something like this could 
be raised and moreorless ~isp6sed of without even~thinking 
of it any further. 
Senator.Hart. Let me insert a question, if I might. This 
is a philosophical question. 
First of all, factually, in any of the dealings, formal or 
informal, that you ever had with President Eisenhower or 
President Kennedy, did the subject of assassination ever 
·arise? 
Mr. Dillon. As far as I know, as I recall, in dealing 
directly with either of them, no. 
Senator Hart. I would invite your speculation at this 
point as a sub-Cabinet officer under President Eisenhower, 
and as a Cabinet Officer under President Kennedy, I think 
the Committee would be interested in your view as to the 
attitude of each of them toward this subject, that is to say 
the elimination, violent elimination of foreign leaders? 
Mr. Dillon. Well, that is a difficult thing to speculate 
on in a totally different atmosphere. But I think probably 
both of them would have approached it in a very pragmatic way 
most likely, simply weighed the process and consequence
