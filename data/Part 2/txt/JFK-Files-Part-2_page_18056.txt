of my rights. 
Ho aslted about my bacli:grotmd which I provided, including 
the fact th~t I have been a Special Agent of tho FBI since 
August 7, 1050. • 
With ~egard to the extent of my participation in tho 
Huston Pl~n, I advised itr. Johnson that I was selected by former 
Assistant Director Wi11ianc. Sul1ivan to act as the liaison 
of£icer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the 
FBI Domestic Liaison Section and my -0xtensive liaison contacts 
through my parttcipation in the various United States Intelligence 
Board (USIB) Committees. My duties with regard to the Huston Plan 
were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings was mde 
and that the various papers p~epared as the result of meetings 
lleld were delivered to the proper individuals in the otller agencies 
participating in the plan. Some ~f the papers were clelivered 
personally by me, others were sent by courier. 
I advised Mr. Johnson that X was generally uware of 
the contents 0£ the papers prepared through my attendance at the 
meetings of the working group and discussions with participating 
personnel; however, l personally made no input nor did I participate 
in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.
