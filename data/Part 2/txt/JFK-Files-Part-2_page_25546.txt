and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my 
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right 
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of 
the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern 
is the, these letters and the code and the tape and 
possibly other things, are in the hands of this 
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and 
he's probably right now at the building. He is 
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to 
the same people that he has on the letters to tell 
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge, 
for having him arrested on·-the assault charge with a 
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the 
FBI. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex­
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My 
husband is calling me for help· and I don't know what 
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the 
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have 
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in 
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I 
worked for him and I don't know where to go because, 
the only ones that are helping me now are the local 
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid 
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the 
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get 
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get 
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put 
t,hem in the 23rd precinct. 
FS: They even, off duty ... 
ML: _The off-duty police, police officers take my children 
home ... 
FS: And they spend time at the house? 
ML: And they spend time at the house in their free time 
when they shou~d be home with their families. 
FS: Well you have saved the life of two people, right? 
ML: I would think so. 
FS: Well, you have. 
ML: Yes . 
. FS: When, one of the, who are the two people you saved 
.their lives?
