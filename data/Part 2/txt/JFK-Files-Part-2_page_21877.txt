Tweedy. No. Planning, yes, but nothing that 
e"'.er got anywhere. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 19) 
It is difficult to reconcile the cable traffic with Tweedy's 
testimony that no action plans were launched and that no authoriz­
ation for implementing the assassination operation, authorization 
for Hedgman's approach to his agent to explore access to Lumumba's 
entourage is in accord with Tweedy's description of his inquiries 
about gaining access to Lumumba. 
However, the fact that Tweedy was personnaly informed that the 
(chief of) Station "PLANS CONTINUE TRY IMPLEMEtlT OP" (CIA Cable 0N 
24171}(~hief of)station to Tweedy, 10/7/60) is harder to reconcile 
with his statements that a "go ahead" on the operation was never 
imminent, especially in light of Tweedy's PROP cable the next week 
which told the 0hie.f of) Station that Lumumba' s 
DISPOSJTION SPONTANEOUSLY BECOl~S NUMBER ONE 
CONSIDERATION ... THIS CHANNEL REMAINS FOR 
SPECIFIC PURPOSE YOU DISCUSSED WITH COLLEAGUE 
AND ALSO REtA.AINS HIGHEST PRIORITY (CIA Cable 
(OUT 8139~, Tweedy to~hief of)Station, 10/15/60) 
(iii) Bissell Testified That He Did Not Recall 
Whether The Assassination Operation Had 
Moved From Plannin~ To Implementation 
But It Was Not Against Agency Policy to 
Send Poisons to The Congo 
Richard Bissell testified that he did not remember discussing 
the feasibility of as~assinating Lumumba with Bronson Tweedy, but it 
seemed "entirely probable" to him that such discussions topk place 
(Bissell, 9/10, pp. 3-4).
