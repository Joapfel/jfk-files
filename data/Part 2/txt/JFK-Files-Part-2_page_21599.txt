INTERVIEW AND MEET-00 SUMMARY 
stresses that this is a problem. What is the dif­
ference between "internal security" and "counter­
intelligence" and "positive intelligence"? FBI 
would use these distinctions as an excuse not to 
notify CIA. 
Regarding the legal attaches, Papich was in Rio 
de Janerio after World War II. The FBI had moved 
out when the CIA moved in, but Hoover wanted to 
have someone there anyway. Papich stayed a year 
but wanted out since he disliked doing only 
liaison work with local police and CIA. The legal 
attaches were never operations and dealt with 
foreign security p ce and er inal police. A

There were six or seven legal attache offices 
from the 1950's until Papich left in 1970. Papich 
feels that if the FBI has legal attaches they should 
be closely coordinated with the CIA so that their 
assets and sources do not duplicate the CIA. A 
FBI- man abroad can be useful to the intelligence 
community through his liaison with local police.

Papich sees the implications of this for the need 
to have a single counterintelligence agency. There 
would be advantages of centralization, communication, 
and security.
