(a) Dulles Cables Again for "Elimination" of Lumumba, 
... an·d a Messenger is Sent to Congo. With a .Highly 
Sensitive AsBignment 
On September 19, 1960, several days after Lumumba placed him­
self in the protective custody of the United Nations peacekeeping 
force in Leopoldville, Richard Bissell and Bronson: Tweedy signed 
a cryptic cable to Leopoldville to arrange a clandestine meeting 
between the Chie.f of Station and "Sidney Braun," who was trayeling 
to the Congo on an unspecified assignme~t: 
["SID"] SHOULD ARRIVE APPROX 27 SEPT. . WILL 
ANNOUNCE HIMSELF AS "SID FROM PARIS". . IT 
URGENT YOU SHOULD SEE ["SID"] SOONEST POSSIBLE 
AFTER HE PHONES YOU. HE WILL FULLY IDENTIFY 
HIMSELF AND EXPLAIN HIS ASSIGNMENT TO YOU. 
(CIA Cable,· OUT 71464, Bissell/Tweedy to Chief. 
of Station, 9/19/60.) • • • • 
The cable bore a highly unusual sensitivity indicator 
"PROP" -- that restricted circulation at CIA headquarters to the 
Chief of the Africa Division.* 
* In a letter of September 23, 1975, the Chief of the CIA Review 
Staff informed the Committee that "PROP" was normally used "to 
denote sensitive personnel matters" (SeymourR. :Solton to Frederick 
A. 0. Schwarz and Frederick D. Baron, 9/23/75. It appears that this 
.sensitivity indicator, while creatid for other purposes, was utilized 
by Bissell, Tweedy, and the Chief of Station to restrict distribution 
of their communications about an assassination operation. The cable 
traffic cited in this report that was sent throu~h the PROP channel 
did not touch upon personnel matters except in terms of recruiting 
additional CIA officers and agents for the assassination operation.
