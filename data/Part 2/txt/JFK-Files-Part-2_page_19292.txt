WOMEN FOR PEACE aka 
Women Strike for Peace 
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette, 11 a daily newspaper of 
general circulation published in Berkeley, California, 
contained an- article in the November 19, 1965,evening 
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-
cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear 
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started 
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly t}:lrough­
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including 
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area. 
These groups support programs to achieve goals such as: 
(1) Continued disarmament negotiations. 
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations. 
(3) Planning now at state and national levels for 
conversion to peace-time economy and positive 
efforts to ease world tensions. 
The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific 
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over 
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given 
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-· 
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other 
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee 
meetings and general.meetings, as warranted, are open to 
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no 
dues or membership forms nor conditions for.membership. 
To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For 
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at 
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations 
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and 
candidates for public office. On the national level 
the group_attempts to influence government officials 
by letters and conferences.
