not -- but the matter is not resolved as discussion below indi­
cates. Ultimately the program question is whether there will 
be future U.S. involvement in covert wars -- and whether, if so, 
some substitute for CIA-owned air support can meet the operational 
requirements of secure, well-maintained local aircraft in place, 
with responsive schedules and capacity to gather a limited amount 
of signals and imagery intelligence. The Chief of CSS ventured 
the possibility that third-country assets could be used. Another 
possibility is use of U.S. military aircraft, overtly or "sanitized". 
One thing became clear: CIA sees itself as entering a different 
era of proprietaries. It has rejected the long-held doctrine of 
11 stand-by 11 capability i.e., the notion that it is worth investing 
considerable capital and operating resources in airlift, sealift, 
and other _assets primarily targeted toward contingency requirements. 
Instead, assert the Agency representatives, CIA is keeping today's 
and tomorrow's proprietaries strictly centered on current opera~ional 
tasks. The test of retention is the utility of a proprietary in 
carrying out assigned roles instrumental in approved Agency projects. 
This concept can be examined by listing the twenty major proprie­
taries which the Agency says will survive into the post-1976 time
