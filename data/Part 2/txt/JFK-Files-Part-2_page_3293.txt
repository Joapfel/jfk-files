I've been giving you lessons here about 
[how] a COPS should know a little about 
everything . . . Well, I promise you, until 
it. came out in 1975, this allegation, at 
least, that Shef Edwards and Mr. Maheu 
were working with the Mafia to assassinate 
Castro, concurrent with the Bay of Pigs 
Operation, that is the first time I ever 
heard about it. Ever! ... My thought, when 
I saw this, was Jesus Christ, I must have 
been a little over~compartmented, because 
we had spent a considerable amount of

year was .... well ... why _did they give 
me the idiot treatment? Then it occurred

I've just said in any kind of pique; and 
I certainly don't want to leave you -- or 
this tape recorder -- with the impression 
that had I known about this, I would .have 
been opposed .. I must say, I don't think 
I would have enjoyed the instrument very 
much -- whereas we put out an awful lot 
of bullshit to the Cubans about the res­
toration of democracy and all that. Those 
Cubans. that were working with us were not, 
I submit, working for the re-establishment 
of the Mafia as a controlling factor in 
Havana. I had a helluva lot rather, in
