the·Congo was a highly sensitive area in

zation of the advisability of the plot and the tenor of the times 
in which it took place. His response ind.icated that although he 
was willing to carry out what he considered a duly authorized 
order, he was_not convinced of the necessity of assassina:ti_ng 
Lumumba: 
I looked upon the Agency as an executive 
arm of the Presidency. . . . . Therefore, I 
suppose I thought that it was an order 
issued in due form ·from an authorized 
authority. 
On the other hand, I looked at it a~; a 
kind of operation that I could do without, 
that I thought that probably the Agency 
and the U.S. government could get along 
without. I didn't regard·Lurnurnba as the 
kind of person who was going to bring on 
World War III or something. 
I might have had a somewhat different 
attitude if l thought that one man could 
bring on World War III and result in the 
deaths of millions of people or something, 
but I didn't see him in that light. I saw 
him-as a danger to the political position 
of the United States in Africa, but 
nothing more than that. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
pp. 110-111.)
