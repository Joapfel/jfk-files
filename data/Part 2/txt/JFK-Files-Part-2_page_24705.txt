Coun,cil staff from 1951 to January 1962, offered what he termed a 
"clue" to the extent of Presidential involvement in the decision to 
assassinate Lumumba (Johnson, 6/18/75, pp. ·4-5).,'r Johnson re­
counted.the following occurrence at an NSC meeting.in the Summer 
of 1960 which began with a briefing. on world developments by the 
Director of Central Intelligence: 
,'<: Robert Johnson introduced his testimony with the following state­
ment: 
. -I would like to preface my remarks by pointing out 
that my dec.ision to offer testimony to this committee has 
involved for me a profound personal, moral dilemma. In 
my role as a member of the NSC Staff for ten and one-half 
years, I was privy to a great deal of information that in­
·volved relationships of confidentiality with high officials 
of the United States government. I have alway"s taken very· 
seriously the responsibilities implied in .such relation­
sh,ip~. 
These responsibilities extend, in .my view, far beyond 
questions of security classificatibn or other legal or 
foreign policy concerns. They relate to the very basis of 
human society and government -- to the relationships of 
trust without which no free society can long survive and 
no government can operate. 
I ha~e beeri forced by recent de~elopments; however, to 
weigh against these considerable responsibilities my broad-
• er responsibilities as a citizen on an issue that involves 
• major questions of public morality, as well as questions 
of sound policy. Having done so, I have concluded, not 
. without a great deal of reluctance, to come to your commit­
tee with infonnation bearing upon your inquiry into govern­
ment decisions relating to the assassination of foreign 
leaders. (Johnson, 6/18/75, pp. 4-5) 
After his tenure on the staff of the National Security Council, 
Robert Johnson served from 1962 to 1967 on the Policy Planning Coun­
cil at the Department of. State.
