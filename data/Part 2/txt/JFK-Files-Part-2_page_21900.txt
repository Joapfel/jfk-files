( specific, highly sensitive operational purpose which has been 
completed" (Memorandum for Finance Division from William K. Harvey, 
1/11/61). 0'Donnel~ explained Harvey's reference to the fact that 
QJWIN' s tnission had been "completed" by saying that once Lumumba 
was in the hands of the Congolese authorities "the reason for 
( 
the mounting of the project ... had become moot" (e'Donnel~}, 
9/11/75, p. 35). When asked if he and QJWIN were responsible for 
, \ 
Lumumba' s departure from __ ml custody and subsequent capture, lo 'Donnel!· 
said: "Absolutely not" (p'Donneli}, 9/11/75, p. 35). Harvey did not 
' , >-recall the meaning of the memorandum, but he assumed thatt'Donnelljs 
return from the Congo constituted the "completion" of QJWIN's 
mission (Harvey, affidavit, p. ). 
Despite the indication in the Inspector General's Report that 
QJWIN may have been recruited initially for an assassination mission 
and the suggestive language of the cables at the end of November, 
there is no clear evidence that QJWUl was actually involved in any 
assassination plan or attempt. The CIA officers who were involved 
in or knowledgeable of an assassination plot against Lumumba gave 
no testimony that tended to show that QJHIN was related to that plot. 
The 0hief of)Station had a "vague reco]:lection" that QJWIN

was in the Congo working for ~ustin O'Donnel~. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 95.) But Hedgman did not recall why QJWIN was in the Congo. 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) QJWIN was not a major operative of 
Hedgman's. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) Richard Bissell and Bronson 
Tweedy did not recall anything about QJWIN's mission in the Congo
