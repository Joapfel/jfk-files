Sil. And at that time, you knew who he was? 
•• ~r 
~edgmati 1 I recognized him as an officer of the 
Agency. . I believe he referred to the 
·fact that I had received a message and that he 
was the person concerned. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
pp. 15-16) 
The message carri~d by Gottlieb, then Science Advisor to 
\ 
DDP Richard Bissell, was unmistakeably clear according to Hedgman: 
Hedgman: It is my recoll~ction that ~e advised me, or 
my instructions were, to eliminate Lumumba. 
Q_: By eliminate, do you mean assassinate? 
Hedgman: Yes. I would say that was . my under-
standing of the primary means. I don't think it was 
probably limited to that, if there was some other way 
of doing it. 
Q: Of. doing what? 
Hedgman: 
threat .. 
Of removing him from a position of political 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 17-18.) 
Hedgman said that he and Gottlieb also may have discussed non­
lethal means of removing Lumurriba as a "political threat", but 
he s.aid,, 
11
I cannot recall with certainty on that" (Hedgman, 
8 I 21 / 75 , p . 2 8) . 
He clearly recalled the discussion of issassination, 
however: 
Q: And.what did Mr. Gottlieb indicate with regard to 
tne possibility of physically eliminating him?. 
Hedgman: It was my understanding that that was 
probably expected of me. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 18.) 
And again: 
Q: I take it that once you started discussing these 
lethal agents, there was no doubt in your mind that 
the kind of elimination he was there particularly to 
discuss was killing Lumurnba?
