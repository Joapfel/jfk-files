(.. on September 21, 1960, Allen Dulles stressed the danger.of 
Soviet influence in the Congo. Despite the fact that Lumumba 
had been deposed from his position as Premier and was in UN 
custody, Dulles continued to regard him as a threat, especially 
in light of reports of an impending reconciliation between 
Lumumba and the post-coup Congolese government: 
Mobutu appeared to be the effective power in the 
Congo for the monent but Lumumba was not yet 
disposed of and remained a grave danger as long 
as he was not disposed of. (NSC Minutes, 
9/21/60.) 
Three days after this NSC meeting, Allen Dulles sent a 
personal cable to the(Chief of Station)in Leopoldville which 
included the following message: 
WE WISH GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE SUPPORT IN ELIMINATING 
LUMUMBA FROM ANY POSSIBILITY RESUMING GOVERNMENTAL 
POSITION OR IF HE FAILS IN LEOP[OLDVILLE], SETTING 
(
HIMSELF IN STANLEYVILLE OR ELSEWHERE. (CIA Cable, 
OUT 73573/, Dulles to Leopoldville, 9/24/60.) 
On September 26, (e_idney Gcittlie~, under assignment from 
CIA headquarters, arrived in Leopoldville (CIA Cable (rN 1898~, 
Leopoldville to Director, 9/27 /60), provided the(ehief of) 
_Station with poisons, instructed him to assassinate Lumumba, 
and assured him that there was Presidential authorization for 
this mission (see Sections 4(b)-4(c), supra). 
Marion Boggs, NSC Deputy Executive Secretary, who wrote

interpret Dulles' remark as referring to assassination,.
