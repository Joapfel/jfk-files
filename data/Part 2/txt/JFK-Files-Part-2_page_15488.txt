Since Dominican Republic continues to be trouble-spot, are:;t- " 
primarily due to instability of Government and known eff~rts of extremists_ 
on the "Left" and "Right" to bring about a coup, State Department is· , : 
\ 
being requested to grant clearance for us to. initiate a program to •••

. . . . . . . 
For a number of years we have had a program to develop live • 
~sources at official establishments of various key noncommunist countries ~ 
which have been designated as "target" countries because of various ;r 
·factors, including evidence·· of Soviet or communist infiltration, 
importance in cold war and/or other international developments which :~::.~ "'\ 
.make a particular country of special significance. In the past ~ 
Dominican Republic, although meeting· above criteria which would qual~fy }t~ 
it as a "target" country, has not been so designated as our· coverag~ ast: 
considered quite adequate. •• t

However, now that the Dominican Government is most unst;a e ~i 
following the 9-25-63 overthrow of Juan Bosch, there has been a· .. ~-eady ~j 
~•1) change in diplomatic personnel assigned to U. S. which makes 1~>t / asible t~~

\~-"establishments. In the past we have handled development of such potentia~~ 
~~ sources in Dominican establishments by securing State Department · :6

In order to streamline our procedures in this regard, it is 
felt we should now take necessary steps to make Dominican Republic a 
"target" country by securing appropriate State,Department clearance for 
~- such source development. _ ,.,,_, / · .. ,:'/. ;i;;·/2'/J.,, // . 1~ .· .. c;; -· /~.✓--v .<_ .• .,(···.,. - •
