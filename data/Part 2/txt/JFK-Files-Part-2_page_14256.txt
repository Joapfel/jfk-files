• 3. A long line of Sup~e Court cases, beginning with Kilbourn v. 
ffhompson, 103 U ,S, 168 C®), has held that-the privilege or immunity 
: f~~ating to speech or debate should be given a broad and liberal construc-
g~m, In Kilbourn· the court stated: • • 
It would be a narrow view of the Constitutional provision 
to limit it to words spoken ·in debate. The reason of the 
rule is as forcible in its application to written reports 
_-presented in that body by its committees, to resolutions 
·offered, which, though in writing, must be rep:i::oduced 
•• in speech, and to the ~ct of voting,... In short., to things 
generally done in a session 0£ the House by one of its 
members in relation to the business before it. (At p. 204,) 
• 4. The court, moreover; has resisted arguments that an un\vorthy 
En1rpose should destroy th~ priv"i.lege. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 
~f7 the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 
. §? (1810), stating: 
• .. that it was not consonant with our sch?me of govern­
_ment for a court to inquire into the motives· of legislators, 
has remained unquestioned, (At.p, 377 .) . . 
J~e di~tance to which the court was willing to go to uphold this' principle 
.wg.s seen in United States v, Johnson, 383 U ,S. 169 (1%6). In that case 
· e f~rmer Congressman was convicted for conspiracy to defraud t...1i.e U.S., 
!B-. part on evidence that, in pursuance of a conspiracy designed to give 
e~;;istance to certain savings and loan associations which had been indicted 
e~ mail fraud charges, he was paid to give a speech on the floor of the House. 
?he Supreme Court gran!ed a new trial holding that a prosecution which 
e~aws in question. the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress 
· e;.-his motives for performing them "necessarily contravenes the Speech or 
:§~bate _Clause. 11 (At p. 185.) . • •. _ .. :-

. 5. The court addressed the issu~ of classified information in Gravel v. 
P"nited States, 408 U ,S. 606 (1972), a case which arose when S~mator Gravel • 
. ~airman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public 
Wprks Committee, convened a night meeting of the Subcommittee and there 
~~~d extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers which bore a Defense 
§~~urity classification of Top Secraet - Sensitive. • He _then placed the entil:e 
f?'. volumes ·of the study in the public record. Senator Gr?-vel claimed that 
· Af~cle I. section 6 protected hi~ from cr~mina~ or civil liability and from
