* Initially in his first appearances before the Committee Mr. Gilpatric 
was unable to recall any of the events or characters involved in Operation

Operations for the project, or Lansdale's involvement in the Special 
Group Augmented even though Gilpatric recommended Lansdale for pro-

approximately fifteen years, hacl jmpaired his memory on these events.
