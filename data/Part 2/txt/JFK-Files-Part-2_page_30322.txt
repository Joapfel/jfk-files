Mr. Devine. Yes,but as a defector would there n6t be 
reprisals taken by the Sovie~ U~ion against your family? 
Mr. Nosenko. s{r, befor~ the death of Stalin it could 
be takeri drastic me~sures agairist the family, b~t after the 
death of Stalin, from middle ·i950s, quite a little changes took 
place in the Soviet Union, and'the family will not suffer. 
Another thing, oh -sure~ will be certain things which they 
cannot achieve. Let's say my brother who studied later in 
the same Institute what I finish, Institute of International 
. rRelations, he will never have possibility to go abroad, but

Mr. Devine. How do you know that? 
Mr. Nosenko. Well, I do not know exactly, but you see, 
there were some defections before. The family didn't suffer 
it was, let's say, in '40s and maybe up to death of Stalin. 
Mr. Devine. Were those KGB defections? 
I Mr. Nosenko. Even from KGB.
