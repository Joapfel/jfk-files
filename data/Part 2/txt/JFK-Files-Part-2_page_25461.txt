President, ex~Pre~ident Carlos Prios. 
I don't know, there were so many, God. 
Alright, well that's, that's good enough. Anyway. 
Alright, that's when you first met Petty Humanez, 
alright. 
Yes. 
What was the idea of me sending you over there to meet 
Petty Humanez? 
Information gathering, to find out how he was 
sponsoring the Cuban exiles. 
Wasn't he suspected of supp lying money and o·ther 
goodies ... 
Oh, yes. 
to groups, where at? 
In Miami and outside of Miami. 
And down in Texas, right? 
Yeah. 
Training camps in Texas? 
Yes. 
Alright, he was feeding money to them also in ... 
Yeah. 
Texas, right? And this is to help overthrow Castro 
government, right? 
I would presume, yeah. I guess so. 
Now did you find out whether or not he was giving them 
this financial assistance?
