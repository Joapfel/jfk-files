GUATEMALA 
1. There were about 80 illegal travelers from 
Guatemala to Cuba in 1962, of whom we believe 20 
to 30 received training in guerrilla and sabotage 
techniques. Identified trainees have remained in 
hiding since their return. Guatemalan Communists 
have contingency plans.for paramilitary operations, 
but have been waiting for other elements to create 
a favorable opportunity for such action. 
2. Cuba in the past has furnished funds for 
illicit purchase of weapons by non-Communist ele­
ments, such as1.__ the "13 November" movement of ex­
Lieutenant Yon s·osa, whic.h has sporadically under­
taken unsuccessful military operations against 
Guatemalan army garrisons. The Cubans have cited 
the greater militancy of non-Communist groups in 
explaining such funding operations to the Guate­
malan Communists. 
3. Cuba gives asylum to former Guatemalan 
President Arbenz and other leadirtg members of his 
regime, and affords them propaganda facilities. 
4. Arrest statistics in Guatemala are incon­
clusive because of the waves of detentions during 
periods of tension. During nearly daily disturbances 
in January-March 1962 in which an estimated 40 were 
killed, for.example, about 1,000 were arrested under 
state of siege. A few were exiled to El Salvador, 
but most of those arrested were released after 
several days. 
5. Similarly, there were a number of arrests 
on charges of terrorism or subversion during the 
first half of 1962, but no trials. Communists in­
s~ired and controlled most of the street ·disturbances, 
but the mobs were made up of all anti-regime elements, 
and no known incidents can be attributed to the in­
dividuals trained in Cuba. Numerous copies of Che 
Guevara's handbook for guerrillas were passed out 
early in 1962 to serve as a "do-it-yourself" hand­
boo~ on sabotage and terrorism.
