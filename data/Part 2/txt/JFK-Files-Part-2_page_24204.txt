The CAB chainnan discouraged option (3) because it would involve 
.. ) public hearings and ·would be subject to criticism by the other supple­
mentals. Option (1), although least troublesome from the legal and 
exposure standpoints, would further reduce the shrinking number of 
U.S. supplementals (by 1972, there were only eleven supplemental 
carriers left) and would be unfair to. SAT employees. The CAB 
officials had no problem with option (2). On~ 1972 1 the DCI 
was presented with the results of the meeting with the CAB chairman. 
He approved the recommendation to explore the sale of the equity in 
SAT to the current management. It was noted that SAT had been operat­
ing as a supplemental carrier for 25 years, none of the employees of 
SAT had ever been an employee of the Agency and that both the Depart­
ment of Defense and the,chairman of the CAB considered it in their 
best interests to keep SAT as a viable carrier ra~her than dissolving 
the company and selling the assets. The rationale behind selling. 
SAT intact to its management was: 
a. Liquidation would ·deprive the U.S. of a useful air carrier 
and would be unfair to the e~ployees. 
b. Sale of SAT as a go•ing concern on the open market would gene­
rate an unacceptable level of public interest and scrutiny. A 
publicly advertised disposition would run contrary to the Director's 
statutory mandat'e to protect intelligence sources and methods. 
c. Although a potential for conflict of interest and windfall 
profit existed, sale of SAT to its management would best 
satisfy the requirements of everyone involved. 
The DCI was, apparently .• allowed this flexibility in method of 
dispq~al by statute. 40 U.S.C. § 474(17) provides that nothing in 
'the regulations relating to disposal of surplus government property
