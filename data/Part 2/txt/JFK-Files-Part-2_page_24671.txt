Gottlieb was a CIA scientist who was at that time the Science 
:·-· 
Advisor to Bissell (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 14). 
- O'Donnell said it was "inconceivable that· Bissell would direct_ 
such a mission without the personal permission of Allen Dulles", 
(O'Donnell, 9 /11/ 7 5, p. 4L~) . But the question of authorization 
was never raised by Bissell: 
I assumed that he had authority from Mr .. Dulles 
in such an important.issue, but it was not dis­
cussed, nor did he purport t:o have higher-. 
authority to do ·it. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 15.) 
O'Donnell promptly met with Gottlieb and testified that he was 
11
sure that Mr. Bissell had called Gottlieb and told him I was coming 
over
11 
(O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 13; 9/11/75, p. 7). O'Donnell said 
that Gottlieb told him "that there were four or five ... lethal 
means of disposing of Lumumba" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 13). O'Donnell 
recalled that "one of the methods was a virus and the others in­
cluded poison" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 12; 9/11/75, p. 7). O'Donnell 
said that Gott1i_eb "didn't even hint . . . that he had been in the 
Congo and that he had transported anj lethal agent to the Congo'r 
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 7-A). 
After speaking with Gottlieb, O'Donnell said: 
I then left hi~ office, _and I went back to 
Mr. Bissell's office and I told him in no 
way would I have any part in the assassina­
tion of Lumumba ... and reasserted in· 
absolute terms that I would not be invo·lved 
in a murder attempt. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 43.)
