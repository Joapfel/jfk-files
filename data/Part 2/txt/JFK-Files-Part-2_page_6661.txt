DI/IRO 
Disposition of the DI/IRO on the release of Country Names in the 11 
PICLs Reviewed by 
Me for the ARRB 
1. In light of the additional details, laying out the background of negotiations on the PICLs conducted by 
(Linda Ciprianl;in OGC and articulated in a note to George last week--not sent to me, I concur with the 
inclusion of country names of even the non-relevant titles in the text of the reviewed PICLs. It's always 
easier to make appropriate decisions when one is armed with the full knowledge of the background. In 
light of my very short tenure in dealing with this issue, I would appr~iate in the future receiving any ¢ 
background or additional information on prior negotiations that hatoearing on decisions I must make. 
Additionally, having that background information ahead of any review or disposition saves time and effort, 
and result in the best decision not only for the DI but also for the Agency. 
2. This concludes the DI action on this matter. A signed copy of this memorandum will be sent to Barry 
for his records.
