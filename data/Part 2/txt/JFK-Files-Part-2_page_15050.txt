Durin~ May, 1968, we institute,., investigation of l 
Shapiro following\ a request made by t~efCentral Intelligence I 
Agency of the Att~\ney General. Our &ptlrpose was to ascertain f 
I
~ his connections wi -ch Israeli officia~s and, in· particular, i 
whether he is in co~act with Isr~dii intelligence agents in l 
this country; We leai\(led that s~lpiro actually is in contact ,!

associated with the Israel,i tomic Energy Commission; and 
F \ 
with a number of United s~tate,~ citizens sympathetic towards \ 
Israel. We have defini,tely sHe~n Shapiro's loyalty toward • 
Israel and, in fact, h' has cons4dered whether to move to 
that country in ordeE to assist ~~rael. Shapiro has commented 
• that he will figh0or Israel and f'{equently travels there 
and meets with I,,~4:-aeli Atomic Energ1'~ommiSsion officials 
as well as withrother Israeli Governme:nt leaders. 
~ anticipated that our i~tigation of Shapiro 
c mpleted in the very near future'Xat which time we 
1;..e advising AEC, requesting that., a)t,ncy to advise 
eau what administrative action it intends to take 
. aga~ t Shapiro, bearing iri mind he has the hi~,est clearance 
for/ access to classified information· granted by A-.EC and his
