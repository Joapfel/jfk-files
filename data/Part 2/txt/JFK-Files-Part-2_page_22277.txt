and in the process, you obviously work up 
some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is 
quite different from the normal life style of most of.us. 
Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the

sent down. to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the 
capability of -- he was given by Mr. Bissel this chore of 
carrying on this particular operation as well. 
Mr. Schwa'rz. Had he been the person who had, in 
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba, 
hired an agent for that purpose? 
Mr. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He t(t) 
hired a foreigner . .1\nd this foreigner's job -
~ .___, 
. And there are some very obscure 
references that an additional assignment was to look into the 
possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba. The evidence is 
that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethville in 
1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I 
believe. And then Mr. Lrnumba was killed thereafter in a totally 
separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing ~c do. 
There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked 
to have something to do with this particular job said he did 
not want to do it.
