OCCURRENCE: On 30 October 1963, I.DOOE replied to BUNDY's cable (DIR 79109) of the 
sarre date by CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 2063): " ........ do not think we have the 
power to delay or discourage a coup. ION has made it clear many tirres that this is 
a Vietnarrese affair ...... I believe we should continue Ol;ll' present position of keeping 
hands off but continue to rronitor and press for more detailed information. CAS has 
been anaylzing forces for sorre tine and it is their estimate that the generals have 
probably figured their chances pretty closely ....... It does not seem sensible to have 
the military in charge of matter which is so profoundly political as a change of govern­
ment .... As to requests from the generals, they may well have need of funds at the last 
rrorrent with which to buy off potential opposition. To the extent that these funds can be 
passed discreetly, I believe we should furnish them .... If we were convinced that the coup 
was going to fail, we would of course -do everything we could to stop it. HARKINS has read
