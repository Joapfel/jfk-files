operation" would have been underst'ood as an assass'ination ·

Sheffield Edwards was quite infirm when examined by 
the Committee and has since died.-,•, Edwards testified before 
the Committee as follows: 
" ... [T]his possible project was approved by Allen B. 
Dulles, Director of CIA, and by General. Cabell, the 
Deputy Director. They are both ~ead. 
"The Chairman: How do you know, Colonel, that.the 
project had been approved by these two gentlemen? 
"Edwards: I pers.onally briefed Allen Dulles . . . and 
Cabell." (Edwards, 5/30/75', pp. 5-6) 
In his interview with the Rockefeller ·commission, 
Edwards testified (Edwards interview, p. S): 
"Q.: Now, who inside the Agency besides Bissell did 
you have any contact with on the top echelon? 
"A.: Very important. The plan was approved by Allen W. 
Dulles and General Cabell.·" 
-,~ As the investigation proceeded, members of the Committee 
requested that Edwards be recalled. Edwards passed away 
before this could be accomplished. As a result of Edwards' 
infirmity and subsequent death, the Committee was unable to 
examine him effectively concerning his conflicting prior 
statements concerning Dulles' knowledge of the plots.
