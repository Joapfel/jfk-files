1.%2, including the perio<l of the l!issile Crisis. (Sec p. ;:ibove.) Thus, Helms 
noted in a memorandum of a meeting on October Hi, l'JG2, that R.ohert t:e:1nedy in ex-
. tlie "0cneral dissatisfaction of the President'' h'itli r.lon~ocise, "pointed out press1.nf.j o 
that (i'longoose) had been underway for a year ... that there had. been 110 acts of sabo-
t ;:,nd that even the one which had been attempted had f,:1ilcd twice". (Memorandum age« 
by J{elms, Octobir 16, 1962, p. 1.) Similiarly a memorandum to Helms by his Execu­
tive Assistant (who spent full time on Cuba ·matters), which reviewed the llongoose 
,prop,r,1n1 in the aftermath of the Hissile Crisis, stated: 
"During the past year, while one...of the options of the 
project was to create internal dissension and resistance 
leading to eventual U.S. intervention, a review shows 
that policymakers not only shied away from the military 
intervention aspect but were generally apprehensive of 
sabotae;e proposals: (McManus, Ex. 2, p. 1, McManus, p. 11). 
Harvey testified that this assessment' of the Special Group Aug-
mented's position was an accurate one. (Harvey, 6/25, p. ) . 'I'his is 
also borne out by the record of Mongoose activity. For example, after 
Lansdale's initial six phase plan to overthrow Castro by the fall cif 1962, 
the single phase approved for January August 1962 was described by Lans-
dale as "essentially an intelligence collection" effort. (Memorandwn, 
.,......, 
April 11, 1962, by Lansdale). Indeed, the guidelines for Ope_~:¾},?~tl,d 
approved on March 5, 1962, stated that the acqu~-:~tfR:}ij)in~~"tt~ 
the "immediate priority objective of U.S. efforts~i~\~licomint'months." 
( Taylor Ex. 3, · p. 2, Guidelines for Operation Moneibo~e', March 111, 1962). 
The.Guidelines further stated that although other covert actions would be 
undertaken concurrently with intelligence collection, these were to be on ,..-.:~ 
a scale "short of those reasonably calculated to inspire a revolt" in.Cuba. 
(Id., p. 2). And the Special Group stipulated that Mongoose action beyond 
the acquisition of intelligence "must be inconspicuous." (Memorandwn, 
3/2/62, Lansdale, p. 3)~
