lo Reference is made to our memorandum number CSCI.;..3/773,057, . Sl/)/Jts!l 
subject as above, dated 10 October 1962. 
2. Jose ·~oLA,_2018 North ~Y.:.. Road, Miami ~. . ,£~✓!~itJ 
has advised ~=ntatives of another of'ffceo:ftnis Agency that he u j -:J 
learned from contacts in 'New York that ·{f'nu) PECAR, a Yugoslav ~:rade \ 
official in the u. s., is being recalled to'Yugoslavia,and wishes to 
remain in the(U. S. According to MEROLA, PECAR will vi:si t Miami from 
12 to19 April 1963. 
3. While MEROLA has an unsavory background, the representative 
who spoke with him is inclined to believe that he was telling the 
truth in this instance. MEROLA claimed that he lias also informed: the 
u. s. District Attorney of the above development. 
4. It seems probable that' {fnu) PECAR is identical with the 
subject of referenced memorandum, who was assigned to New York in late 
1962 as in INTERTRADE representativeo •• • 
5. We would appreciate receiving any infonnation ·available to 
your Bureau concerning PECAR's alleged desire to remain in the U. s. . .
