WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION ACTION 
COALITION (WONAAC) 
IS - C (TROTSKYIST) 
00: NEW' YORK 
RePBlet 2/28/73. 
4/4/73 
The Women's National Abort~on Action Coalition (WONAAC) 
has been the subject ~fa separate investigation by the Bureau 
~n numerous offices. In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed 
out that WON.A.AC represents a basic social change dealing with 
abortion rights and that i~ view of the fact the u.s. Supreme 
Court upheld the right 0£ abortion, the continued investigation 
of WONAAC at this time does no~ nppen? to be desi1--able and 
should bs discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that 
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) 
and its youth group, the Young Sceialist Alliance (YSA), should 
determine pertinent activities of YON.A.AC. 
After careful consideration of this Datter, the Bureau 
agrees with the observations of the Philadelphia Office that the 
investigation of WONAAC should be discontinued. However, in view 
of the fact that WONP..AC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a 
Trotskyist communist or,ganization cited by the Attorney General 
pursuant to Executive O~der 10450, it is the respoµsibility of the 
Btn•eau to investigate and report pertinent information relating 
to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned 
v organization. •

Therefore, recipients should close separate 
if'\ investigations concerning WONAAC. In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading 
~1r.Fe1t __ in the SWP semiannual organizational reports. •
