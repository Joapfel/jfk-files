So I think for the last, oh, fifteen, eighteen 
years, the proprietary management system was on 
the whole pretty effective fro~the Agency point 
of view. I think we knew what was going on. I 
think we were able·to get things up for decisions, 
and if we couldn't resolve them·at the staff level, 
we would take them up to the Director for decisions;

that I described, and the operators at least made the

of which I was Chairman,. and had representation from 
both the operation and management and finance out of

to focus on the question of whether it reviewed the needs first and 
then came up with recommendations on the operational solutions, or 
whether the operators came up with a solution and put it through 
\\ EXCOMAIR. Houston noted that EXCOMAIR·worked on a very informal 
basis because ''I knew all these people well, and I said. 'Let's get 
together and sort these out. 111 He indicated that EXCOMAIR was
