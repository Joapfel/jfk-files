Mr. Bundy. I don't know how often they met or what was 
said, I know nothing about that. I would have said, just in 
passing, that the Attorney General's relationship to the Direc­
tor of Central Intelligence was much closer and more impor-
tant than his relationship to Mr. Helms. 
Senator Baker. I am correct, am I, that Helms at the 
time was DDP and not DCI? 
Mr. Schwarz. That is right. 
Senator Baker. Do you have any idea why he would have 
20 met regularly with the DDP rather than the DCI? 
21 Mr. Dundy, I have no idea that he did. I know that he 
22 met often and intimately and easily·w1th the Director of 
2~ Central Intelligence, who was a close personal friend of his. 
24 Senator Baker. You are speaking of Mr. McCone? 
25 Mr. Bundy. Mr. McCone.
