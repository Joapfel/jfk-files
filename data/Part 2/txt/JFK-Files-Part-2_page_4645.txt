or the other - and literally stick him in a room and 
say, "Here, everything, and tell me what it's like." 
MW: The degree of communication between the DDP and DDI on 
Mongoose is apparently a lot more that it was during 
the Bay of Pigs Operation. 
SH: Oh, much more. 
MW: Years ago, when I started amassing the documents that 
we put together into the Bay of Pigs collection, I 
wanted to know if there 1was anything left in the branch 
over in the DI. So I called up.whoever was the Cuban 
analyst - this would have been, probably, early 1993. 
I don't remember the analyst's name (I could probably 
look it up), but he told me - and ,I don't know if this 
is true or not. The folklore in the branch was that 
whoever it was that had been one of the Cuban analysts 
was called in the Saturday before the invasion because 
there were all these news stories about Cuban defector 
pilots having bombed the air field in Havana and then 
flown to Key West and here they are, they have their 
planes on the ground and now they are defecting to the 
United States and this is a big news story. He came in 
and _wrote it up for the current publications at the 
time and gave it to his editors, and at the last minute 
somebody came over from the DDP and said "Wait guys, 
that's a covert action. Those are our planes, those 
are our pilots, those are B-26's we painted with Cuban 
markings. This is all a big hoax. You don't need to 
be reporting this to the President or you're going to 
look silly." So apparently this has been handed down 
at the Cuban desk by word of mouth. 
SH: It sounds true. 
MW: I don't know it that's true or not. You probably know 
better than I do. 
SH: It sounds true. Those things have happened. That's 
one thing we made sure in Mongoose we didn't do. I can 
go back to another operation that I was involved in 
long before we had things like Mongoose and Bays of 
Pigs an~~~ have you. ~isthe Indonesiant_____,
