G 1 Sen3:.~-~..fil.2.9t£.?JJJ.Y£,ittte ollJ~!.?Jli~~.i:~~~$.., and was asked to serve '_ 
- as Director· of the c·o:mmittee' s T8,sk Force-on·Domestic Intelligence. This r 
NW38296 
is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee an.d it '\'; 
will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces \.,, 
are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and ~ 
Command and ControL '

Eiliff said he had not decided whether to c>.ccept the off.er ~ 
and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He ~ 
said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent ~ 
working ar:ra,gern::nts he had d~veloped with the Bureau. He feels that his @ 
initial obligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police 8-; 
Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of prima1·y ~ 
benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congress!< 
He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to~ ?g 
break :u1y commitments that he might have made with the Bureau. ~ ~ 
If he accepts the appointment Elliff said he would, of course, 
suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment 
with the Committee. He said he would. also agree not to use any classified 
material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elliff 
has discussed this rn.atter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police 
Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever for 
his c>,ccepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would 
be free to.resume his proJ·ect after the Committee vmr .was done .... " .,
