in case of an a.ttack on the naval base. Herter 
indicated two extreme possibilities: one, that in 
case of an attack, the United States respond with 
only sufficient military force to protect the base 
itself; and another, that the United States decide 
that an attack on the base was in fact an act of war 
c 
and apply ·such military power as necessary. Herter 
also suggested, of course, ·that there would be possi­
ble responses between the two extremes, with activities 
i_n the OAS or the UN possibly having some bearing on 
the US response -- the sort of contention that undoubt­
edly must have raised the hackles on Mr. Stanulis 
again. The Secretary of State did specify, however, 
that the US response to an attack on Guantanamo would 
be the result of a decision made by the President of 
the Uniteo. States. 
As wi11· be pointed out subsequently, the Cubans 
• . ' would make charges about Guantanamo being the center 
for anti-Castro activities, and there would be a few 
instances where anti-Castro Cubans were able to find 
refuge within the confines of the b~se. Overall, 
however, there ·was a surprising degree of neutrality 
with respect to the naval installation duiing the 
course· of the. Bay of Pig_s. operation.
