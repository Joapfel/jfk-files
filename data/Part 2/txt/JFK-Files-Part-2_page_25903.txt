contact with.Bennett was for the purpose of our locating 
I 
I i 
Giancana and a telephone number at which I could reach him. : ; 
Bennett initially indicated to me, as described earlier 1n 
I 
this memorandum, that Gia~cana was in the hospital. My recol­
lection is that on my sec9~d telephone call with Bennett, he 
informed me that Giancana.was now out of the hospital and 
staying at the Warwick Hoiel. Finally, I recall calling the 
Methodist Hospital in Houston and asking to speak to Mr.

Giancana. I recall that t~e hospital authorities indicated

that they had no such person by that name in the hospital.· 
I do not recall the p~ecis~ date of this telephone communication 
to the hospital. It is my, recollection that the name used by 
I i 
Giancana was Doc Brown. I: am uncertain whether Bennett told me 
Giancana was using "Doc Brown" at both the hospital and the 
hotel, but I believe· he said that the alias was used at the 
hospital. Bennett advised that Giancana had been.visited by 
' I • 
several relatives.and gave· me the names of amuple of pers~ns
