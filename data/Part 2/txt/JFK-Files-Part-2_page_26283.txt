Membe·rs • of the Task Force were asked for their. reactions 
to the paper. -There. was a rather surprising degre·e-of agre~~ 
ment that something;· along this line must be do·ne or it will be 
virtually impossibl·e to q.eal with the situation in South Viet 
Nam. • (There was no ·state Department representative present at 
the tj,.me except Cottrell hims~lf.)". The ·ICA member and the 
representative of Jack Bell's office did raise questions as to 
whether political and economic action .by the-Diem regime was 
not a more important· precondition to solution in Vie.t Nam than 
military action in•Laos; 
I made the foliowing ·points. -about. the· proposal: First, I 
observed- that this would seem to.ime to. raise important .questions 
of policy ·which had been qonsidered and decided in the pa.st at 
the highest levels of government. I.indicated that I would be· 
unable to take a personal s_tand on the·.·j,ssues raised. - I ex­
pressed.: some surprise about ·the. apparent., unanimity of view that, 
unle·ss • we undertake military action in Laos, it would be 
virtually impossible to deal effectively ~ith the situation in 
Viet Nam. • I. said that--;- ·while I could see no objection to the 
Viet· Naill Task Force ra1sing these ·questions, 1 t s·eemed. to me 
that -t~ey should· be raised, mu.ch more clearly in the context of 
the Viet Nam problem.: That is, -the proposed memorandum should 
make clear why _"the· present si tuatio.n in -Laos will make· 1 t . 
difficult, if -not impossible, to carry o~t an ef:fectiv_e program 
. against the Vi-et Cong ·in Vie.t. Na.in .•. - Cottrell .agre~_p.· to take·· 
.r account. of this s·uggestion (wi•th .-which -there seemed to -be some 
.agreement in the Task ·Force}. · • • 
r-: ~-u1;ifJ f~-i·;t,-t;ilire· feeling· of· frui~-ration whi.ch .has 
prompted Cottrell -to produce his memorandur~j,:~-. I: specifically 
share his .doubts with respect to getting tt)~ French· ba·ck ·into 
·Laos.~· (I had- thought· ·that this ·proposal -had .been dropped as a· 
result of adverse reaction from various -sectors~ .. ) •. The·. Cottrell 
• proposals,"· however, raise. very directly th·e questiq_n ·of ·u.· S. 
military ·in.tervention in Laos.: • It seems to me inconceivable 
· that his objec.tive·· co~ld· be achieved without. such int·erv~ntion.
