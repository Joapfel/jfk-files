Hedgman: There was no doubt in r.iy mind that 
tFiis was one of the way[s], and probably what 
they thought was the only way that would work

Hedgman explained~~~~li~~)provided him with poisons as a means 
of assassination:

~. These were lethal biological substances? 
Hedgman: Yes. 
as. a non-expert. 
That was my understanding 
(lledgman, 8/21/75, pp. 18-19.) 
Hedgman testified that he received "rubber gloves, a mask, and a 
syringe" along with the poisons and that ~ot.t:liebjinstructed him 
in their use (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 20-21). Hedgman indicated that 
. this paraphernalia was for administering the poisons to Lumumba: 
~ [W]hen he(rGo.ttl;ebVcame to the Congo 
to give you lethal biological agents for 
the assassination of Lumumba, was it clear 
at that time that the means for administering 
those biological agents was to inject them·· • 
into a substance that was to be ingested by 
Lumumba, whether it be food, or drink, or 
toothpaste or any other substance that was 
to be ingested? 
Hedaman: That's my recollection, yes. 
(He gman, 8/21/75, p. 82; accord. p. 24.) 
Hedgman s_aid that the means of assassination was not restricted 
to use of the poisons provided by(G~ttiie~: 
This was not a sine qua non that I employ this. 
If there were another metnod, another way, it 
would have been acceptable. (Hedgman, 8/ 21/ 7 5, p. 19.)
