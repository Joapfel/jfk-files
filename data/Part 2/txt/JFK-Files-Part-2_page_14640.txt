Domestic Intelligence Division 
(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the 
Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice, ... 
• as well as Government departments in general, to shy away f~om pursuing 
logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary 
. security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate 
decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme 
Court is not required to meet these issues and. render decisions and thus, 
historically, to take responsibility for ~em. It is our feeling it is a far better 
•. · . course of action to attempt to implement those programs _necessary for our 
• national security and give ground gru.dgingly and only where forced to do so 
so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to 
carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.
