During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent 
in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and 
trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selec­
ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was ~¢t~ probably an 
operative of the Bulgarian· Militia and acted as the betrayer 
of his colleagues.
