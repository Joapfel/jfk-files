REASON FOR PROPOSAL 
V 
Following are listed a number of indications that the leader -
ship question will be addressed in the near future: 
a. With the termination of U, S. support .to the Cuban 
Revolutionary Council (CRC) a vacuum has been created. Various • 
exile groups in the U.S. and elsewhere' wW be vying for recognition 
and support in an att_empt to fill this void. 
b. There has- been constant pressure on the U.S. 
and on other Latin American countries to ·recognize a government 
in exile. This proposal could serve to lessen or eliminate much 
of this political and psychological pressure. 
c. This proposal could serve-to reduce the bickering 
among exile groups and may serve to resolve some of the problems· 
of Cuban exile unification .
