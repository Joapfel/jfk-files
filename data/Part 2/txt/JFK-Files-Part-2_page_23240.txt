Lu.mumba wae actually dead? 
Mr. Tweedy. I don• t rec al 1. 
knowledgeable on that than I am. 
You probably are much mor:e 
I don't recall when in 
etfcct we no longer considered it or it no longer was a 
factor. I just don't remember. 
Hra Daron. But, just now you were assuming that that 
~ould have the case? 
Mr. Tweedy. If it wos still on, it was still on 
the agenda, inevitably we must have diecuased it. If it was 
off the agenda then no, but I honestly don't remember. 
Mr. Daron. Let me show you now some cable tr~ffic 
between the agency and Lcopoldvilln which conRists of a 
series of cables that begins shortly before Lumumba was placed 
into U.N. custody, then continues after he wa~ placed in U,N . 
custody. 
In an attempt to refresh your recollection about the 
attitude at the Agency towar<l Lumumba after he was in U.N. 
custody --
Mr. Tweedy. 
Mr. naron.
