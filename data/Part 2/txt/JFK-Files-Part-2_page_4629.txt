1. The Chief Counsel ·of the House Select Committee on

obligation to protect his identity. 
3. We have reviewed our holdings on KITTY HAWK and have 
found no reference to any "KGB analysis of the Kennedy 
assassination" or any other information pertinent to the 
Committeeis interest. Discussion of the assassination of
