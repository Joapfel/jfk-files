in specific Latin American cas~s with information available from estab­
lished sources, but it has shomiunderstandable reluctance to become in­
volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance ;in cases where 
i there is no evidence of nor reason to· suspect subversive activities • 
\ • directed against the United states ·or violation of United states laws •.. 
l. It is felt t~t while this information is helpful., it ~oes not completely 
t: fill th~ gap in the intelligence information important in the condl.bt of 
:'1· foreign relations~ It is understood that the CIA, ·while interested in. 
foreign intelligence, does not, carry out surveillance operations within 
the confines of the United Statese _ 
• It would be rnca t. appreciate~. if ,.iou could e)q)ress an opinlon • as to _..,.,, ,t,:;

be arrang~d" on. an individual. case basis. . . ( ./ ,. . : . . . -. ~ 
An identical letter is being sent to th~ CIA in the hope that· ·it"'··
