Eisenhower which ·was employed to preserve !'plausible deniabil­
ity" by the President of discussion of covert operations 
memorialized in Special Group Minutes (Gray, 7/9/75. p. 27; 
Parrott; 7/10/75, pp~ 8-9). 
The four living participants at the meeting have .all stated· 
that they do npt recall any discussion of or planning for the 
assassination of Lumumba (Merchant affidavit, 9/8/75, p. l; 
Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, pp. l-2; Gray, 7/9/75, pp. 27, 32; 
Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 25-26). Gray said that he did not con­
sider the President's desire for 
11
very straightforward action".. 
to include "any thought in his mind of assassination" (Gray, 
7/9/75, p. 32). Parrott testified to the same effect, maintain­
ing that he would have recorded a discussion of assassination 
in explicit terms in the Special Group Minutes if such a dis­
cussion had taken place (Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 26-27). 
John N. Irwin II acknowledged, however,· that while he did 
not have "any direct recollection of the suhs.tance of that meet­
ingll, the reference in the minutes to the planning for 
11
getting 
rid of Lumumba" was "broad.enough to cover a discussion of 
assassination" (Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, p. 2). 
Irwin's interpretation is shared by Douglas Dillon and 
Richard Bissell--two high government officials who were not 
participants at this Special Group meeting but who were involved 
in the planning and policymaking for covert operations in the 
Congo during this period.
