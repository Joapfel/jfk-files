information requested from the Intelligence Community was being 
@
eld up by the White House until such time as the SSC identified 
pecific abuses it was interested in investigating. As a result, 
he attached draft was put together by the SSC to break the 
ogjam. Elliff admitted that much of the information requested 
in the 6/25/75 draft letter was embodied in the request of 5/14/75. 
For this reason, Elliff advised he contacted Mr. K. William

ment of Justice, on the morning of 6/30/75 to request a meeting 
between himself, O'Connor, and Messrs Wannall, Mintz and Cregar.
