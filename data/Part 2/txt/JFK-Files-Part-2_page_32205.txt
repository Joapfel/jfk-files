Our programs should be designed to encourage 
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile 
community and engage in constructive pursuits 
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer 
them some special assistance but not to the extent 
that they become a perpetual privileged class 
within the community: Presidential action on their 
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.
