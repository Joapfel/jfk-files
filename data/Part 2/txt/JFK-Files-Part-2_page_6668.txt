history staff and to form the Historical Review Group that will 
review the JFK documents and other documents of historical inter­
est. 
I believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to 
getting these papers declassified and released, and to open what re­
mains classified to outside non-governmental review. It is against 
this background that in response to the Committee's request, I cite 
our few technical reservations about the mechanism established by 
the joint resolution to achieve this same result. I intend to address 
only intelligence community concerns. I will defer to the Depart­
ment of Justice on any additional problems posed by the joint reso-
lution. . • . . . . 
First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to whether 
CIA materials· related to the assassination can be released to the 
public is inconsistent with my own statutory responsibility for the 
protection of intelligence sources and methods. • 
Second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no pro­
vision requiring security clearances or secure document handling 
by the assassination materials review board or its staff. 
Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not provide 
the Agency with the opportunity t9 obJect to. the release. of CIA in­
formation contained in documents onginated by Congress or the 
Warren Commission. Under the joblt resolution, documents origi­
nated by these entities can be released cilrectly by the executive di­
rector of the as8a$Sination materials review board without any 
review by the President or other Executive Branch agencies: 
Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for 
agencies or departments to appeal decisions by the executive direc­
tor to release information may not provide sufficient time for 
meaningful review of what could prove to be a large volume of ma­
terial at one time. 
Fifth, and fmally, Section 6 of the joint resolution, which. out­
lines the grounds for postponement of public release of a document, 
makes no provision for postponing release. of documents that may 
contain Executive privilege or deliberati\1_e process, attorney-client, 
or attorney work product information. While such privileges could 
be waived in the public interest and, in fact, are not likely to arise 
with respect to factual information 'directly related J;o the JFK as­
sassination, they would be unavailable under the joint resolution in 
the rare case they might be needed. 
These are the technical problems that I believe can be solved and 
that will, in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the 
assassination of President Kennedy. But,· again, whatever the 
future course of this legislation, CIA is proceeding even now to 
review for declassification the :relevant documents under its con­
trol. Further, we will cooperate· fully with any mechanism estab­
lished by the Congress and the President to declassify all of this 
material. 
Mr. Chairman, let me close with a comment on why I am person­
ally committed to getting these documents out. Like all Americans 
old enough to • remember that terrible day in 1963, and as several 
members of the Committee have alluded to, I also remember where 
I was and what I was doing. ,

I was a college student ~t Wiµiam and Mary, and I can remem­
b~r how the word spread-like wild fire between classes of that hor­
nble ev~nt. I _ma~e my way to Washington that weekend and stood 
at the m~rsection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues, 
w~ere I W8.lted fo-: hours to watch the President's funeral cortege I will never forget it. .- • • 
Prl ~dntereKd public ~rvice less than three years later heeding ~i ent ennedy's_ maugural call, a call I think man ·hJ. . 
eration heard. ·He 88.ld then, "Now, the trumpet summfns :!g~ 
not as a call U? bear. arms, -~ough arms we need; not as a call ~ 
battle, th~~gh m battle we are, but as a call to bear the burden of 
ti!~~~bhult stit!'1"le, year in and ~ear out, rejoicing in hope, pa-. . n a on, a s~gle ag8.lnst the common enemies of man-tyr8;Jllly, poverty, disease, and war itself.'' 
·M:. ~an, the only thing more horrifying to me than the as­
~mAmatio~ itself is the insidious, perverse notion that elements of 
. e encan (?overnment, that my own Agency, had some part in 
it. I am determmed personally to make public or to expose to disin­
terested eyes ev~ry relevant scrap of paper in CIA's possession in th~ ~0P~1°ft_help~I • to dispel this corrosive suspicion. With or with­ou egis a ion, mtend to proceed. I believe I owe that to his memory. 
Thank you.
