INTERVIEWER: I think that was made in a recent speech. 
MR. HALPERN: Yes, it was. I know. But I still don't 
understand how that can follow. If the comment is meant to

that kind of stuff, but going up to the Congress and telling 
them, I think such and such and my Director thinks differently, 
is not going to keep things honest in any sense of the word. 
The Director can still tell the President what he thinks. And 
that's where the .decision is made on any particular activity. 
I don't think even the crazy people in Congress say they are

John Horton on the Mexico business. I don't know the details

any of this stuff, except what he said in the public press. I 
read that and I've seen him on television and what have you.

Bill Casey actually did cook the NIE as was alledged -- John 
never alledged this but other people have -- if I remember 
correctly, and I think I've got the clipping somewhere, the
