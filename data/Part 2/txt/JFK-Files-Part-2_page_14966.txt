PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES 
AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS 
By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called 
attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and 
recommended the Department propose legislation which would require 
bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements 
for all banks under Federal Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on 
3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66, 
that ~ legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was 
submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66, 
recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the 
Department, on 8/3/ 66, advised the Bill was under study by the 
, Office of the Deputy Attorney General. 
. We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were 
advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis­
lation would be included on program for 90th Congress. By letter 
11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the 
Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions .. On 
1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current 
figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to 
1871, a new all~time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar 
year 1965.
