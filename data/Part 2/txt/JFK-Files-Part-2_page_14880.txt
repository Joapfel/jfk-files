STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES; 
JOSEPH ABRAMS 
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
This case was referred to us by the Attorney General 
on 12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George 
Ledes, a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph 
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation. 
We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in 
New York and have interviewed numerou·s persons in and out of 
SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firmso We determined 
I 
that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters 
while Ledes was still with that agency~ We are now engaged 
in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent 
knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing 
Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other 
records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes 
I 
relative to financing properties. purchased by_Ledes. Abrams' 
loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus 
bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of 
Interest Statutes. 
It .is noted we have been told that both Ledes and 
\
Abrams were associated with Tony Russo, ex-confidential 
assistant to former Attorney General Brownell. Russo has not 
been alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter .. 
The case is being given top priority in handling both 
in the field and at the Seat of Government.
