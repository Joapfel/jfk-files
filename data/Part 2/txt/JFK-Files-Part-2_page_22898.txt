There is this ·in U.S. vs. Nixon about 
what might be nondiscoverabls, all of which seems to bear on 
sort of foreig~ policy matters. 
Am I correct -- I think we're g~ing to hear a lot about 
that -- but am I c~rrect in' reading that decision that it 
really :. .• almost :; ,stands1 wholly that. they have the duty to 
produce all of the documentation and that case holds for that 
proposition, so that in our CIA matters, while they might raise 
some of this dictum, the FBI has no such defense, unless we're 
really trodding on those same grounds. 
Mr. Epstein. Of course, there is another issue in the 
Bureau materials, because we're on the issue of investigative 
files, which has never been really litigated, and that. 
is thd propridty of Executive Privilege when it comes to that. 
I might add that the importance of the issue of ·wgoeign.g
0 
to ji 
to subpoe~a on these really raises that, because if 
subpoena on.documents, then that is going to be worthless unles 
I 
Wd know in advance that we are going to win in court in a short! 
I period of time, including whether we have jurisdiction to be f 
Senator Mondale. In oth~r word$, y~u are saying they are 
going to raise the EXdCUtive Privilege defense, but that was 
the Nixon defense. 
Mr. Epstein. I think t~at thev would love for us to be in 
the position of ha~inq to issue a subpoena for docum~nis,
