standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular 
inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as 
to our activities. He was informed that there should be 
either a joint oversight committee between the House and 
Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees 
in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the 
entities through which all information relative to the 
activities of the FBI should flow. 
It was emphasized however, that there should be 
regular consultation between these representatives and the 
FBI. 
r Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative 
/ to the relationship between the Department of Justice and 
the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's 
opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be 
, a free flow 6:1: information between the FBI and the Department 
of Justice. 
At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed 
up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely 
set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities 
of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many 
of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure 
itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will 
maintain the confidentiality where necessary. 
Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters 
usually referred to as national defense, national security 
or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations 
must be based on the application of the facts toward a 
particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique 
that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal 
statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should 
be had in all instances.
