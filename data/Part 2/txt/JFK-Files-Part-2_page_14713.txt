GEN~RAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERAT10NS 
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE 
,REDUCTION OF CRil\1:E IN 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
In connection with the juvenile problem· in the District ·of 
Columbia, it is. suggested that an Enabling Statute be passed which 
would allow juveniles to be handled in the District of Columbia as they 
are throughout the United States; publicize :the names of the juveniles 
involved in serious crimes an~ maintain and make available juvenile 
rec~rds to law enforcement agencies. In areas of high crime, 
imp:roved street lighting should be installed. 
Mandatory sentences a!e r·ecommended for crimes 
committed w :ith the use of firearms or involving threats, and a 
habitual criminal statute might be effective.. Consideration could _be _ 
given to the registration of all convicted felons in the District, as 
well as a law requiring registration of firearms. 
Authorities responsible for allowing prisoners to be 
released under the "Work Release Program" should thoroughly 
consider their prior records so that vicious felons will not be returned 
to the streets. In addition, prosecutors should not accept guilty pleas 
·on one count \Vhile • dismissing other counts;. and abolition of capital 
punishme:q.t should be opposed until a life sentence means "life. " 
As_ a deterrent to ·bank robberies, District banks should 
on a voluntary basis accelerate the, implementation of the provisions 
of the Bank Protection Act of 1968, and consideration should be given 
• , • to the deployment of one police officer and a bank guard to selected 
institutions. 
More stringent penalties ·should be invoked for violations 
of gambling laws, and sentences should be made stiffer for second 
• off enders.
