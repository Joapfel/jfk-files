Indeed, it stated that "Agency officers made clear to each of the sources that 
the l!,.nited States Government would not under any circumstances, condone the 
planned actions". (Id. , p. 1.) 
When the Special Group considered the information in Helms memorandum on 
June 18, 1964, McCone stated he was "somewhat skeptical" and proposed additional 
investigation, but "others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the U.S. was being 
put on notice and should '3.o everything in its power to ascertain promptly the 
veracity of the reports and then undertake prevention". (Memorandum of Special 
Group Meeting, June 18, 1964.) In a memorandum on the June 18 meeting, McCone 
indicated he had dissented from the Special .Group's decision, stating his be­
lief that the Special Group was "overly exercised" and that he was inclined to 
dismiss the matter as "Miami cocktail party talk". McCone noted, however, that 
the Special Group "was more concerned than I and therefore planning to discuss 
the subject with the Attorney General and possibly Mr. Hoover". (Memorandum 
June 18, 1964, p. 1.) 
The Special Group decided that the reports be transmitted to the Attorney 
General "as a matter of law enforcement". (Id.) Robert Kennedy was informed of 
this matter a few days later and stated that the Justice Department would investi­
gate. (Memorandum of Meeting, 22 June 1964.) Thereafter the FBI conducted an 
investigation, the results of which were submitted to the Special Group on 
August. 19, 1964, by McCone.* (Memorandum, -August 19, 1964, McCone to Bundy.) 
*McCone's memorandum summarized seven FBI reports on its investigation. The FBI 
found that several of the persons it interviewed stated they had knowledge of 
the exile's plots and had reported the information to the CIA., Others inter­
viewed.denied knowledge of the plans.
