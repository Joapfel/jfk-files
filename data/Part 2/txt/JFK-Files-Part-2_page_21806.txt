TOP SECRET

Mr. Sarno. Domestic Operations. 
(Discussion off t~e record.) 
Mr. Wides. With regard to the information received from 
the former in New York ahou~ the plot to shoot a bazooka 
at the UN, was Mr. Shackley the Station Chief at the time you 
received that information? 
Mr. Sarno. I don't recall the date, but the date was 
betwe~n early '62, which it had to have been, and -- because 
Shackley left which I think was in July of 'h4 and that would 
have meant he was the Chief of Station. 
Mr. Wides. Well, didn't he just indicate before while we 
were taking a rbreak that you had recalled that Shackley was 
th~ Station Chief? 
Mr. Sarno. I don't recall whether he was exactly the 
Station Chief or not. I can't place the date with what had 
happened, so I know I went back to the Station and I reported 
it, and it in turn was reported. Now, if I told it to Shackley 
or if I told it to Dimmer, if I told it to the two different 
Branch Chiefs that were th9re at the time, I do not recall. 
Mr. Wides. __.... 
Mr~ Sarno. In the history? 
Mr. Wides. No, in the file, the project file. 
If we got that date when that took place, the date when 
the Agency had the information, would your report and report of 
the branch or station in Florida be in the project fild
