•• It is also noted that the subject was expelled from Moscow jft !i:..l 
it was known to the KGB that he was to be replaced and a vi~a/ 
had been issued to his replacement. Subject's expulsion coh~

cooperated with the KGB; -C- · \J 
The material submitted by NY indicated that subject 
reported to NY concerning the recruitment approach made to him 
but apparently did not admit furnishing information or assisting 
KGB. It is requested, therefore, that NY forward to WFO the 
complete results of contacts between subject and the NY office 
since the subject's initial travel to the USSR. WFO desires 
to review this material in detail before making contact with 
the subject and decide whether or not to use him as a source 
against Soviets assigned to the Embassy in Washington, D. C. -C-
