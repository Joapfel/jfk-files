r., Q.. y._ 
Justice Fortas returned my call or midday, 
6/13/66, late last night. I told him that I wanted to see him 
. about a matter which he might consider bordered on a violation 
of judicial ethi1:s. He was told that I had been able to discuss

~tSt;,;,S. in confidence with him on several other occasions, 1. e., 
th'!'J'enlins case, boyfriend, and other items which 
Mr:- Hoover had me handle with him, and that I therefore felt that he 
wouldn •t mind if this matter was brought to his attention. 
F,,., .. :::. 0 :S ,-. 
The Black case was then brought up and he was told that 
although he had disqualified himself, he ·might not desire to discuss this 
matter. Justice Fortas replied that he y.,ould be glad to not only-disc-uss 
this matter but any other matter with me on a confidential basis at any time. 
He then asked me to have breakfast with him at 7:45 a. m. this morning.

Upon seeing the Justice in his home for breakfast, we 
preliminarily engaged in small talk and eventually got down to the meat 
of the problem. I gave him a c2~:e!~~!! r!JF.diwn on the exchange of corres­
pondence that the Director had liaii wrth ~tzenbach. He~ was told specifically 
of Katzenbach's evasive tactics in attempting to defend Bobby' Ker1hedy. 
I then mentioned the Black case and told him that while the Director planned 
to furnish the Attorney General specl!lc, honest, hardhitting answers to the 
Supreme Court's questions, we nevertheless knew that Katzenbach would 
throw our answers out the window and present his own slanted version to 
the Supreme Court. Justice Fortas agreed. 
Justice Fortas stated that the entire matter boiled down to a 
) continuing fight for the Presidency. He stated that Kennedy was of course • 
out to capture that segment of voters which in the past had belonged to 
Vice President Humphrey. He mentioned that Kennedy, to a certain extent, 
had succeeded in capturing this lert-wing group. He added that of course lf 
facts, as possessed by the FB\ concerning Kennedy's approval of wiretapping 
\ 
were made known to the general public that it would serve to completely 
destroy KeMedy. . •
