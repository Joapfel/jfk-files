s SECURITY INVESTIGATI( 
• (6} Advise Bureau promptly by LHM of subject's r~turn from travel 
abroad. If such individual has traveled behind Iron Curtain, 
also furnish Bureau recommendations as to interview and state 
whether additional investigation is contemplated. 
File reviews 
Check office indices and review files thoroughly for pertinent infor­
mation showing background anq subversive activity. Include information 
in initial report. After each check and review of files has been made, 
consolidate reference cards pertaining to subject in indices. 
Security informants 
Information developed through security informants is- unsurpassed in· 
value both for intelligence purposes and as admissible evidence. 
Physical surveillances _ 
Physical surveillances should be used when, in opinion of SAC, infor­
mation of sufficient value might be obtained to justify their use in 
light of existing circumstance& and ·available manpower.· 
•• a. When information is received that meeting_s of sul;>versive. organiza­
tions are t.o take place, physical surveillances should be considered 
to corroborate such information and identify participants. • 
b. Surveillances of individuals in leadership or underground capacities 
serve to identify others within movement. 
q. Success of surveillances depends upon resourcefulness of Agents who 
must at all times exercise sound judgment and discretion. Be alert 
to observe activity of subject and countersurveillances which may 
be used to identify Agents and embarrass Bureau. 
Photographic surveillances 
Photographic evidence of meetings between individuals·or which shows sub­
jects entering or leaving meeting places of subversive organizations af­
fords convincing and admissible evidence to establish subversive activ­
ities. Prior Bureau authority is needed for photographic surveillances. 
of meetings and they must be properly correlated with other investi­
gative techniques to obtain maximum evidence. Conceal equipment to avoid 
detection by subjects or other individuals in proximity of surveillance. 
Public sources 
Make use of all logical public sources of information. Obtain background 
and lineage data from birth records and local bureaus of vital statistics, 
credit agencies, state records, public utility records, and school records. 
Obtain and index as reference material publications of subversive organ­
izations and records of state and Federal committees which have conducted 
hearings concerning subversive activities. 
Records of urivate firms 
Where pertinent information is available in records of private ~irms, such 
as past or present employers, insurance 9ompanies, and merchants, contact 
such firms provided it will not je opard·ize investigation. • 
Channelizing of information to case files 
Membership or activity in subversive organizations should be channelized 
to main case files of individuals involved. Mimeographed form FD-306 
may be used provided it is limited to reporting attendance at meetings. 
When information from informants or surveillances is channelized to indi­
vidual case files, it must be documented. Coordinate information receiyed 
from informants and confidential sources with active investigation. 
Preservation of evidence 
Bear in mind necessity of obtaining admissible evidence. 
a. Identify, preserve, and maintain continuity of evidence obtained for 
possible admission in Federal proceedings. Identify specitically as 
to source and date. . 
b. Notes or sta~ements from infqrmants necessary to refresh their recol­
lection if called to testify.must be in sufficient detail to serye 
this purpose and contain no material which would make their use 
inadvisable or inadmissible. . 
c. Informant's original notes or statements are not to be blocked, stamped, 
serialized, or mutilated in any way which would render them unsat­
isfactory for use in Federal proceedings. 
d. Above also applies to Agent's notes taken during surveillances or 
concerning evidence otherwise obtained.
