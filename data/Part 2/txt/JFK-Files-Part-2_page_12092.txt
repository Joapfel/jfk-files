• Four-month cvnluntion of informants not paid on Bureau authority 
If the informant is 110t br.ing paid crn J3ure~iu authorization, a communi­
cation must be transmitted. to the Bureau every four months a.ftcr the 
date of desi(:nation containint the sawc information set out ?.-bove in 
subsection 3b except those items conce-rning payments. Rcoommcndi~tion 
of SJC regarding continuance of informant should also be set forth UACB. 
In espionage and foreign nationality cases comnent is necessary regarding 
only those applicable items in subsection 3b. 
Receipts 
When payments are macte to anyone for information or ;,.ssistance on security 
matters, either on the SAG 1 s authority or on prior Bureau approval, receipts 
must be obtalned in e-v-ery instance in vrh:i.ch i-!.: is possi blc to do so.. If a 
reoeipt cannot be obtained for a partic 1.1lar payment, complete c:i.rcumstanccs 
should be set forth on the blue slip at the time reimbursement is claimed. 
a, Receipts should be of such a nature that they will bE: self-s11fficien-t 
so that, if it becomes necesHary to introduce the ~eceipts in evidence 
durinr{ the course of a trial, the reoeipi;·s will not relate to o_-i.;her 
docu.m;mtn or files. • 
b. Receipts should clearly show: 
-11) Date on which payment was made 
2} Perio~ f0r which made when informant is paid on a period basis 
3) Total &mount paid broken down into separate amounts for services 
or expenses where ·l;hese items are pertinent 
(4) Name of Agent making payment 
(5) Sign2.ture of person rece:i.ving the money 
c. Receipts are not to be witnessed by another Agent. 
d. If necess~ry to make corrections on the receipts, sbch correcti,• 
must be 1;.:;_tialed by the inform2.nt and :n"ot by the Agent. 
e. When tran:;,:ii ttint receipts and i tcmized statements of exP.ense_s to the 
Bureau, they should be stapled directly to the blue slip, leaving a 
margin of at least one inch to one and one-hn:f inches at the top to 
avoid contact with the Acco fastener punch. - e staples should be 
placed in such a manner that the date or oth~ data appearing ori the 
re.:-::-:i.pt vrill not be mutilated and all information on the receipt can 
be eHsily read without detaching it from the blue slip. Care must 
be taken that receipts are of such a nature that they clearly show· 
payment of money and do not refe~ to any other documentary material 
contained in Bufiles. 
6, Income tax returns 
a. Informants ·,rho receive compensation for their service_s to the Bureau 
should be • ~vised that such compe:µsation mu.st be reported as incor..e 
when filinJ an income tax return. 
b. Since all informants are considered indepen9-ent contracto.rs, 
they receive from the Bu.re au is selfHernploymen t income. but, siJ •. 
Bureau docs no·l; consider their acti-...-i ty as· the carrying on of ,_ :; 
or busin~ss, they may consider dispensing with the filing of a sch~dule 
C as part of f o·rm 1040 if i;hcy so cle si-re. 
o. The informant's own personal situation, however. should be taken into 
consideration.as he may receive income from·otl. sources as an inde­
pendent contractor which would require the dedi.:.,:, .. ::.on of self-employ-
ment tax, regardless of any Bureau income he may receive. • 
d. In cons:i.dering the filing of a tax on self-employment income, such 
a return is ba~ed upop : ,,t earnings from self-empl".>ymcn t of $400 
or more. If an inforrr ~ receives less than $400 from the Bureau 
and has no other self-·-·. :oyment income, this money in :i.:1.y event 
is not subject to the :.-··f-employment tax. If the i:n+-_,·~mant re­
ceives $4800 or more fro:: outsid·e employment subject ~ Social 
Seourity tax, again the self-employment tax requi:i.-em,- • •. do -:i.ot 
apply, 
[ e. Bureau income should be set forth under item[5]on pP -~e of th~ 
( Federal income tax return, form i040, =1.:1.d explained ·.:-(part •• 
[ schedule B,]of the return :i.s income recei-;ed from o-:;. sourcee :ir
