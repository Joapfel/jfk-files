V. CIA/White House Communication During Track II 
The testimony given to the Committee by Henry Kissinger and General 
Haig conflicts with that given by CIA officials. 
Kissinger and Haig testified that on October 15, 1970, t~e White

Karamessines and Kissinger and of one telephone conversation between 
Karamessines and Kissinger's deputy, General Alexander Haig. Karamessines' 
daily calendar indicates
