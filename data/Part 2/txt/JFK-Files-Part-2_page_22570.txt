' In December 1964, SRS prepared a. blind memorandum out-
' lining the use of Wiley, to wit: 
"Wiley has been :i con tract agent of SRS 
since 1959 and operates under a non-official 
cover of a one-man news agency in New York City. 
He is actually assistid clerically by his wife, 
who is witting. 
"Wiley, 38 years of age, is a born and bred 
New Yorker who comes from a theatrical family. He 
came to. our attention in 1955 when he was compiling 
an index of the Daily Worker on a grant from the 
Americanism Commission of American Legion. The 
grant was depleted before the index was completed; 
SRS arranged to finance same, and eventually ob­
tained a copy of the index. From 1957-1959, Wiley 
was financed as a cleared source from.both OS and 
CI Staff funds. 
"Wiley's contract does not require rc!"lewal 
and can be terminated for cause or otherwise with 
2 ~?~~~u~ of 90 ~?ys notic8. SRS has nn aoree­
ments with i'iiley as 1:0 length oi contract a11<l ru:: 
is not entitled to leave, retirement, or other 
benefits normally due an employee. 
"Wiley is paid from OS funds in the amount 
of $10,500 base salary, plus a quarterly payment 
of $131.25 in lieu of retirement and hospitaliza-, 
tion. He is paid his local travel expenses (which 
in the last fiscal year have been extremely low) 
on a monthly voucher arrangiment. All payments are 
deposited through covert Agency channels into a 
separate bank account for Wiley in New York. 
"By virtue of his non-government activities in 
obtaining photographic assignments and in assisting 
other writers in research, in addition to occasional 
sales of his articles directly to publishers, Wiley's 
cover firm has so fir been self-funding. He usually 
requires a large out-lay of cash in addition to his 
regular payments only if he is making an overseas trip.
