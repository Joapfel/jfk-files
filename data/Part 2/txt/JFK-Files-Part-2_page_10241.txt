exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the 
Soviet intelligence service. The reasons are still unclear 
to me as to ,J~hy the FB.I chose to brief the PFI.-\8 to the 
.effect that(.fL'\ was planning to wiretap extensively an-d 
r:_indiscrimi na. tc ly in th is country, to greatly increase, 
_ -the_ Agency rcpresen tat ion in the ~~oscow Embassy 'J n11d 
~enerally to use KGB-type tactics, also extens~ly and 
indiscriminately. This led ton heated exchange between 
DCI :,IcCone and ~Ir. Belmont of the FBI, one such mecti ng 
taking place in the presence of the Attorney General. 
It is clear· that the rI3I was opposed to any such proposal 
then, as n6w, and the plan never went forward,. 
5. During the period when Des FitzGerald wns in 
charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI ~cCone's office 
learned, quite by accident, that FitzGcrald hid secured 
the coopq~ation of several pronincnt US businc~s firms 
in denying economic items to Cuba. there w~s no question· 
but that the businessmen were glad to coop~rat6, but know­
ledge of this operation hnd to be rather widesprbad. 
6. On 17 April 1961, ~r. Robert D. Anderson came 
to per. ;\Jc Cone on behnl.f of r\mcr ican bus incss in tcres ts, 
offering to insert somc-S300,000 to try to secure a 
favorable re::-rnlt· iri the elections in Panama. Shortly 
after ·this -approach. IiJEi\!-128. of IDEN-129 
made a· s htU ar proposal to ~le Cone in· coiinec t ion 
with elections•iu_ Chile. On 12 Mny 1964 at a meeting of 
the 303 Conu.littcc, it was decided that the o-ffcrs of 
American business could not be ncccptccl. it being·ncithcr 
~ secure wny nor an honorable way of doin~ such business. 
Ttiis declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent 
ITT heaiingsJ but I nm not surprised thnt McCone has 
'forgotten that he helped to set the precedent of refusing 
to accept such collaboration between tHe Agency's operations 
and private business.
