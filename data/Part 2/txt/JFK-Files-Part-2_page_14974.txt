._ Congress is currently investigating the effect of the 
Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety o Senator 
Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around 
the CO\lntry regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received 
has been conflictingo Generally law enforcement of~icials testify 
that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber­
tarians take the opposite view. As bf this time, neither side has 
· demonstrable statistic~! proof to substantiate its contentionso The 
absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that 
Miranda is a new decision, being handed down on June 13, 19 66a 
As.of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial 
courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.
