Board, Tuesday, 23 April 1963 
1. The President'i;; Board has asked that you meet with them on

of this period be devoted to a review of both operations and intelligence 
on Cuba and have suggested that Mr. Cottrell attend for that period.

dures will have been settled prior to the 23rd, I would suggest that you 
may wish to give them a quick review of outstanding matters including 
their recommendations and perhaps a briefing on the latest C,_
