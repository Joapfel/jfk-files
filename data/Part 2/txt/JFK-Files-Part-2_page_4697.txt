MR. HALP~RN: Bad in terms that the l~adership had no trust in us. 
INTERVIEWER: Which leadership are you referring to, Sam? 
MR. HALPERN:. Schlesinger/Colby, obviously. Leadership no longer had any

or wanted to do. But by and large we worked very closely, as an Agency with 
Kissinger. He provided all kinds of support, assets, did all kinds of things 
at his request and so on. I was on the phone to Al Haig, for example, 
although I never met him, but was on the phone almost daily when he was still 
a Colonel on the Kissinger staff doing all kinds of things. And exchanging
