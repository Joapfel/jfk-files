June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at 
$120,000) from Mrs. John R. McLean, a guest at the 
Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas Island. The diamond ring 
was transported by Barnes and an associate to New York Ci'ty 
where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented 
to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of 
Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property 
violation was held in abeyance pending complet~on of the trial 
of the police officers. 
On March 13, 1967, Assistant u. s. Attorney Harold T. 
Sullivaq who is handling this ~atte~ advised that it was the 
specific instruction of U. s. Attorney David Bress that prosecution 
of Barnes in connection with the M-cLean diamond should be 
pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the 
Grand Jury. 
This is being followed most closely.
