The following testimony regarding the relationship 
between ''the White House" and the executive action capability 
was obtained by the Committee: 
Harvey: Harvey ·testified that his missing notes indica­
ted that Bissell mentioned White House urgings to develop an execu­
tive· action capability (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 37). Harvey said that 
he "particularly rernember[ed] 
11 
that Bisseil said that he received 
"more than one" urging from the White House (IL1rvey, 6 / 2 5 / 7 5, 
pp. 36-37; 7/11/75, p .. 59). However, h~ had no direct evidence 
that Bissell actually had any such discussion with "the White House." 
Ho specific individual in the White House was named to Harvey 
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 31). Moreover, he said that it would have been 
"improper" for him to ha;ye asked 13issell who he lwd talked to and· 
"grossly improper" for Bissell to have volunteered that name 
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 37). 
Bissell: Bissell specifically =ecalletl assi~riin8:Har~cy 
to investigate the capability (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 51}. However, 
Bissell did not recall "a specific conversation with anybody in 
the White House as the origin" of his instruction ·to Harvey (Bissell, 
6/9/75, p. 51). 
During the course of :several appearances before the 
Committee, Bissell's testimony varied as to whether or not he had 
been urged by· the White House to develop an executive action 
capability.
