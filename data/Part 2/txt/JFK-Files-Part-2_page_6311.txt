SUB.7ECT: DCI Sources and Methods Autt~rity With Respect 
to JFK Assassination Records 
1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the 
Preside~t John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprir::ed at 
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note. For ycur convenier.ce, I have hig~:igr.~ed 
the pe~:inent provisions that will aid in res;~ndi~g to a~ 
incr..:iry regarding the statute's ef feet on the DCI' s statt.:tory 
aut~o~::.:y to protect intelligence sources and methcds. 
2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supe:::-sede --,...:. " 
sta:uc.es that prohibit d:sclcs-..ire of informa:::.on, except for some),-"_.:.. ' 
irrelevant subject areas, such as __ t_ax records. Tne statute /.·: 
p-rovides that "it shall take·--precedence over any other law , r 
(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial 
decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would 
otr.erwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the 
Act. ARCA§ ll(a). This language, taken wit~ the provisions 
discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and met~ods 
that rr.ay be protected and set a strict proced~ral scheme by whicr. 
information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively 
supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect ✓ 
to :r.:elligence sources and ~ethods informat:~n subject to tr.e 
ARCA. 
3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the 
release of information may be •postponed." The statute 
contemplates that all information will eventually be released. 
Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available 
to t·he public no later than 25 years after the passage of the 
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president 
certifies that continued po~tponernent is necessary. ARCA 
§ 4 (g) (2) (D). w-ith resp·ect to intelligence-related information, 
ARCA_allows_postponernent if: 
"(1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is 
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and 
such public disclosure would reveal-·
