Some background information for you:

DAV FAM: FIN 7-82 
(S) First, although Congress authorized and appropriated $5.5 million for classificatioo_management,_jj is 
unlikely_tbaLGSI will recelv_e_tbeJulL$_5.5 million._Wby_?-" Congress levied a tax on DoD procurement thati 
{wiilhave a significant impact" on CIA's program because of the fact that our entire budget is incorporated in J 
\ 0oD's budget as Other Procurem~r:!t~ir Forc~.1As·a·resuln:iftnartax,<.Ql_~_t:i_~s to_tak~ about_a $49 million) 
~uction a~~e>_ss a~_~og.r::_a_r:!1_§.,.(per SAC direction). This_will impact on all activities -- inclffaing new adds.· 
Each activity can expect to lose~out 1 % of its reso_yr~_e§.)We will identify specifically how to take this cut 
at Friday's offsite. • • • 
(C)To addition, CIA has a largeFY98 unfunded bill (about ~143 millio_r))) On Friday, we will determine how 
to reduce and/or 1=1aythaf6IT1-:-one·orthe proposals on-the table for payingJhc1.t bill is to use~some of the) 
.( Congres~onal add man~~- obviously, we would have to work this(with the H)li) but the bottom line is that 
some of the declass money may be redirected to other priorities. 
~--- ------------ ---·- -----.. 
(C){Finally, we may decide to use some of the adds to prepay some FY99 shortfalls. We are already ) 
la.ware of a shortfall in FY99 of abc,u_!_ $1_§0 ~on.> - • --- ~ _.-
, __________ ~.--/~--
(U) So, the bottom line is that no one should count on getting the full amount of their add until we have 
finalized our decisions on FY98 and FY99 unfundeds. 
(C) All that said, if CSI does receive some or all of the money added by Congress, th~y do have the 
flexibility to allocate that money to other priorities. However, they should attempt to meet the spirit of the 
language in the Authorization Act. Specifically, the language reads, "The Senate bill added $5.5 million to 
enhance declassification efforts, with a particular emphasis on those documents relating to 
Guatemala and Honduras. The House amendment added $8 million for classification management. the 
conferees agree to provide $5.5 million for declassification and classification management and request 
that the Director of CSI report to the Congressional Intelligence Committees on progress in declassifying 
documents of historical significance, the volume of documents involved, the mechanism for review, the 
anticipated date of completion of this effort, and how the process can be improved." 
(U) Hope this helps. CRB
