However, I do not remember any such discussion, nor do I 
have any direct recollection of the substance of that 
meeting. 
5. Although Hadyn Williams probably reported to me 
on the substance of the NSC Meeting of August 18, 1960, I 
do not have any recollection of such a report, nor do I h~ve 
any other recollection of learning by another source of any 
of the substance of the discussion at that meeting. 
6. It is possible that I w~s present at the meeting 
at the Pentagon to which Mr. Dillon's affidavit refers. How-
ever, I do not remember if I were at this particular meeting; 
nor do I remember attending any meeting at the Pentagon where 
the question of assassinating Patrice Lumumba was raised. 
7. In answer to a questi6n from Mr. Baron I said 
that in my opinion it would be. improper for the Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency to undertake an assassi­
nation operation without an express directive from the 
President.
