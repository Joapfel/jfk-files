Mould it have been proper for the Chief or 
Staff D to arrange an operation in the Congo directly without 
going through the African Division although keeeping the 
African Chier informed? 
Mr. TVeedy. Well, the t"" are mutually exclusive. 
You can't have one without the other. To answer your first 
question, it would be quite improper and wouldn't have occurred 
that the Chief of Rtatf D was operating in an African Station 
without the African Division being informed. Thia, however, 
makes it amply clear that that vas not tho caso, the African 
Division was informed. In what depth in terms of tonne of 
headquarterB purposes I don't know but it would have been 
sufficient for Harvey to have done what he did and coordinate 
this with the Division and if the Divieion had perceived 
any objection or saw any problems they would have raised it 
before the dispatch went out. 
Also I noticed Dakar ie also invited to find Problems 
with this, if it did, and say so. 
Mr. Baron. What kind of missions generally would 
Staff o have been carrying out in Africa at thia time? 
Mr, Tweedy, Well, you know what the role of 
Staff D w.ae. 
Mr. Baron . This would be obtaining codes by surreptiq 
tious entry . 
Mr. Tweedy. This is in effect tho obtaining of signals
