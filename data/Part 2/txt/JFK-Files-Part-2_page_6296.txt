SEQUESTERED COLLECTION 
First of all, every document in the sequestered 
c}IJ.rection is available to the Board for review. The 
documents are available in full, without redactions. 
The record shows that the sequestered collection 
consists of documents compiled in connection with the 
investigation of the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations (HSCA). 
A portion of the documents were created specifically in 
response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were 
already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee. 
St:i.11 other documents were created by the Committee itself-. 
For example, notes of interviews conducted by the 
Corcimittee's staff. 
Within the sequestered collection there are two major 
categories of records. One category consists of 
approximately 129,000 pages of hard copy. The second 
category consists of 72 reels of microfilm, or the 
-equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy. 
The reason why the documents were sequestered-is 
explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the 
Chairman Louis Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner 
in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows: 
"Upon termination of the Committee, all materials 
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept 
and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA 
for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of 
RBP.tesentatives agree to a shorter period of time.• 
In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff 
Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete 
the process of de$ignating what materials were to be 
sequestered. All the documents made available to the 
Committee were included in the sequestered collection.
