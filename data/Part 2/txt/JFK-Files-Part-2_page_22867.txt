Mr. Dundy. No. But I will say this -- and it is a rando

I: wouldn't discuss it with.any journalist, I don't think. 
Mr. Schwarz. _The record from Mr. Schwartz is that the 
President said he was opposed ~o assassination, but that he 
brought it up in a conversation with Mr. Schwartz, saying 
that he was being encouraged to order assassination. 
Now, you have said that you do recall that the subject 
was talked about, your words, at some point, and that it 
might have been in ·the fall of 1961. 
Mr. Dundy. I wouldn't want to say that it was only in 
any given period. 
Mr. Schwarz. But that one of the points in which it 
might have been discussed was the fall of 1961. 
Mr. Bundy. Certainly. 
Mr. Schwarz. We are going to come to another period 
which relates to you. 
Mr. Uundy. May I interrupt one second. 
Could we go off the record for a moment? 
The Chairman. Yes. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
The Chairman.. Let's put that on the record. 
Would you restate what I have just stated?
