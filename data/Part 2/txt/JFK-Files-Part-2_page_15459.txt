I 1s essentially a short term view. Source development 1s def1n1 tely . 
a long ·term proposition and the most advantageous time. to initiate . 
such an effort is before the countrr, becomes a real trouble spot. 
• In. fact good. sources in ostensibly 'friendly" coUi,trY, establishments 
could possibly produce data pointing to impending trouble. We felt 
I 
the situation in Latin America warranted the long term view .. 
l 
Getting down to "brass tacks 11 all the requested clearance would 
have meant is that State would have agreed to our conducting discreet 
inquiries regarding potential sources. Existing procedures provide 
(and we did not propose a change)--that we not make a personal 
ll 
approach to a potential source without specific clearance from State. 
This gives State a firm opportunity to take the "cautious view" it 
f i des ires to take. _ . , 
. . . . . The development of. sources in diplomatic establishments 
is admittedly a delicate operation but can produce data of definite 
value. This is illustrated by several examples during the past year. 
Sources of this type have provided the first authentic confirmation 
of the assassination of the Dominican dictator, Generalissimo 
Trujillo; identified the Panamanian Ambassador to the Organization 
of Aiilerican States as on the payroll of the Dominicans; provided data 
as to what the President of Pakistan would probably discuss with - • 
President Kennedy; furnished-· a code .book utilized by Cuban diplomatic 
establishments in Cuba; and have provided voluminous valuable . 
intelligence data in connection with our inquiries into Doninican 
lobbying activities in the U.S. 
0RS1~RVATIC-NS: . 
It is felt we have ·.made our views known in detail and on 
the record and it is not believed we should pursue the difference in 
views wi_th State. This latter view is prompted by the fact that if { 
we take strong issue and sway State to our point of view we will simply! 
have State looking over our shoulder. without any real backing _on a 
sensitive operation. Ball's.letter does not require a reply.
