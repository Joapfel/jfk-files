"Grant's Tomb", a community newspaper, upper west

10, contained an article captioned, "women March on 
Washington~ This article reflected, in part; as follows: 
"out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying 
force of the Ann Arbor conference, the wcmen1 s caucus decided 
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for 
a women's mar:ch on Washington, D.C. on April 10. We all felt 
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same 
U.S. system that needs the dominance of rr~en over vmmen, white 
over black, brown and,yellow,heterosexual over homo'Bexual, and 
over poor to suppo~t tre aggressive war policy that is killing 
our Vietnamese sisters and brothers.~-----
"We are making this march one step in showing the 
world our solidarity. as ·women with all our sis·ters in Vietnam 
who are fighting for their lives. The Cc•mmi ttee to Defend the 
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has 
called for our support. 11
