of support, indicating U.S. support of the dissidents' efforts 
to·· overthrow Trujillo. (Dearborn 7/29, pp. 46-48; Owen p. 39) 
c. Failure to Disclose to State Department 
Officials in i•lashington 
There is no indication that the request or the passage 
of the carbines was disclosed to State Department officials in 
Washington until several weeks after the passage. In fact, on 
April 5, lleadquarters requested its Station to ask Dearborn 
not to comment in correspondence with State that the carbines 
and ammunition were being passed to tile dissidents. This cable 
was sent while Owen was in Wash_ington, and it indicated that 
upon his return to the Dominican Republic, he would explain 
the request. 'l'he Station replied that Dearborn had not com­
mented on the carbines and ammunition in his correspondence 
wici, State and he realized the necessity not to do so. (Station 
to HQS cable, 4/6/61) 
Dearborn testified, however, that he believed, at the 
time of his April 6 cable, that someone in the State De­
partment had been consulted in advance and had approved the 
passage of the carbines (Dearborn 7/29, p. 44)
