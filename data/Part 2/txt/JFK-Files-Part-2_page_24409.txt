The Inspector General's Report accepted Edwards' assertion that "the 
Agency was first unwitting and then a reluctant accessory after the fact", 
but offered no further evidence to support that contention (I.G., p. 67). 
The Committee also received conflicting evidence concerning 
whether the tap ha.d been placed to keep Giancana in Miami or to check 
on security leaks. O'Connell testified that during the early stages of 
negotiations with the gambling syndicate, Maheu informed O'Connell that a 
girl friend of Giancana was ha.ving·an affair with Rowan. Giancana wanted 
Maheu to bug Rowan's room; otherwise, Giancana threatened to fly to Las 
Vegas himself. Maheu was concerned tha;t'Giancana's departure would 
disrupt the negotiations, and secured O'Connell's permission to arrange 
for a bug to ensure Giancana 1.s continued presence and cooperation. 
(O'Connell, pp. 68-67.) Maheu substantially confirmed this account 
(Maheu, pp. 25-30). 
There is some evidence suggesting that the CIA itself may have 
instituted the tap to determine whether Giancana was leaking information 
about his involvement in an assassination attempt against castro. 
Bissell was informed that Giancana had been talking about Giancana's 
involvement in an assassination plot* ( without indicating the CIA was 
* When Roselli talked with Giancana after the wiretap had been discovered, 
Giancana "laughed ... I remember his expression, sooking a cigar, he 
alrrost swallowed it laughing about it" (Roselli, p. 52). Roselli 
claims tha.t he was "'perturbed" because "It was blowing everything, 
blowing every kind of cover that I had tried to arrange to keep quiet" 
(Roselli, p. 52). 
Roselli said that he told Giancana that the CIA was involved in the 
operation "in order to have him keep his mouth shut" (Roselli, p. 27).
