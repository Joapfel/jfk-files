In CIA Informal Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-IR-35, the 
Review Board requested additional information on a source identified-in RIF number 
104-10151-10206 as having given the CIA additional information on Lee and Marina 
Oswald and their time in the Soviet Union. At the request of the Review Board, the CIA 
searched its compartmented files and databases for additional information on this 
source and the raw intelligence information given by this source to the CIA. CIA 
provided the source's 201 file which was examined by the Review Board staff. No 
assassination records were designated from this 201 file. CIA also provided sections of 
briefing reports, an audiotape, and.portions of transcripts of conversations between the 
source and interviewers on Lee Harvey Oswald. A final memorandum from this source 
was also found to be located in the post-1978 volume of Oswald's 201 file. All of these 
materials were designated as assassination records and will be included in the jFK. 
Collection at the National Archives. 
Given the recentness of the information and the sensitivity of the source, the Review 
Board agreed to protect the source's true name and cryptonym.- Documents from this 
source are identified as the product of "a 'li)lued American intelligence source who was 
a senior, but not general rank, official in the intelligence service (KGB) of the former 
USSR; specifically, he served in the Second Chief Directorate which was responsible for 
internal counter-intelligence efforts."
