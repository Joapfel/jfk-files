This program was initiated in 1954 and expanded.in 
/ 1955 and 1958 to provide for the acquisition of positive in-
. telligence data as well· as other in.forrn.ation which would assist 
FBI investigations through three pr:i.ncipal phases: · (1) Regular 
notification from u. s. intelligence agencies as to.arrival in 
U. S. of intelligence. personne·l from non-Soviet-bloc countries; 
(2) Maintenance of technical surveillance of .official estab­
lishments of selected non;._Soviet-b1oc.countries·with approval 
of State Department; and (3) Development of live sources 
within such diplomatic·. establishments. 
SCOPE AND COST: 
The first phase consists chiefly of file reviews 
and indexing at the Seat of Gover1iment at nominal cost •. 
Under the second phase we are presently· operating • • 
27 technical surveillances covering.establishments of 17 non-
. Soviet-bloc countries. The -countries are: Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, 
I./ 
Iraq, Israel,. Japan, ,Mexico, )~~nama, Tur,key, United Arab Republic 1 
Venezuela, and Vietnam. The.cost· of operating this phase of 
the program consists primarily·of monitoring the technical 
installations involved and the transla.tion of the intelligence 
product. These costs are analyzed each time the technical 
surveillance is justified (on a quarterly.basis after the· 
first month's operation). _The cost appears to be fully ••. •• 
justified based on value of. data developed._(:) s:---~~// _F.-t~I
