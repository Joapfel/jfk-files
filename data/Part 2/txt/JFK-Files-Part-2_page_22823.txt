Mr. Bundy. Yes. 
Mr. Smothers. 
Mr. McCone? 
~re there others? 
Mr. Bundy .. I am • sure there are. Mr. Rostow. Mr. 
Goodwin. There may ~ell ·be other~,-Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. 
Dungam -- who has very little to do with it, but I talked 
to them because of my own absence of recollection about the 
Dominican Republic. 
Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise a few questions regard­
ing those discussions, and perhaps it will be somew~at helpful 
to us in trying to piece this together. 
Has any documentary evidence passed between you and 
the persons previously mentioned regarding the subject 
matter of these hearings? 
Mr. Bundy. Not that I know of. 
Mr. Smothers. Did Mr. McCone provide you any documentary 
evidence? 
Mr. Bundy. No. 
Mr. Smother. Did you receive any documentary evidence 
from any source other than the staff? 
Mr. Bundy. No -- I beg your pardon. When I testified 
before the Rockefeller Corranission I asked through that 
Commission whether I could .look at NCS files particularly in 
TOP SECRET
