reasons unexplained wit.1:i _the :Jiist.·i·ce ··Department. I have 
already mentioned one aspect of that problem, in connection with 
the failure of the Department to supply most of the material 
that we have requested, though that request was put to the 
Department two months ago, and it has-been -,decided already by 
the Committee that Mr. Levy and Mr. Kelley should be brought 
before the Committee in the hopes that these delays can be 
overcome. 
The first question before the Committee is when that can 
b~ don~. It is suggested that the Attorney General has Tuesda•• 
morning available. If it is all right with the Committee, I 
would like to schedule his appearance, together with that of 
Mr. Kelley, for Tuesday morning. 
s~nator Bakjr. Mr. Chairman, I don't mean to intrude my 
personal convenience into this consideration unduly, but if 
the Attorney General could do it at Tuesday noon, say, it woul~ 
help me. I have a commitment in Tennessee Monday night. If 
I catch the Tuesday morning plane I can't get here until 11:S0. 
If that's not possible, I ~ill canc~l Monday. 
Tha Chairman. This is procedural in charactar, so it is 
not altogt'lther important that eve;ry member be present. I thir.l: 
that from the standpoint of this Committee sc~edule, Tuesday 
morning, the Attorney General and 11r. Kelley would be good, 
would it not?
