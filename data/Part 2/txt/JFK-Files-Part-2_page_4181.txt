MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE 
SUBJECT: Meeting on the Multi-lateral Forces - 5:30 p. m., 
22 March, 1963 
ATTENDANCE: The President, Secretaries McNamara, Gilpatric, 
• Rusk, Ball, General Taylor, Ambassador Merchant, 
Mr. McCone, Mr. Kaysen and several others 
The purpose of the meeting was to receive Ambassador 
Merchant's report on his visits to the Capitals. Merchant reported 
qualified success, indicating reservations by the German, 
Italians and British for various reasons, the two most prominent 
ones being: 
a. Problem of control; 
b. Use of surface ships versus- submarines. 
A long discussion ensued in which it was evident that there 
was no clear-cut decision on the part of those in attendance as to the 
extent of the control of the United States versus control by 
European countries since it seemed to mean that control should 
shape up so that missiles could not be fired without United States 
· clearance; on the other hand the United States should not be able 
to unilaterally decide to fire the missiles. However, no 
country or group of countries exclusive of the United States 
should be likewise able to fire them. 
There was a difference of opinion. ·between State and Merchant 
on the one hand, and of the President on the other, as to whether 
Merchant's discussions should be reviewed with the Foreign 
Relations, Foreign Affairs, and Joint Committees at this time. 
The President was insistent that no approach be made to Congress 
at this time. Merchant dissented from this viewpoint but agreed 
to the President's directive. 
It was felt that the final expression of viewpoints should be 
sought from the Germans and the Italians, and it was agreed to 
draft a letter to Adenauer seeking an expression from him, with a 
similar letter to the Italians, though it was thought that no opinion 
should be sought from the Italians because of the impending election.
