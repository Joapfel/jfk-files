I. I, 
June,Q:, 1974, when Patrick Shea of the

Street in Houston, Texas. !iMr. Bennett's information was that 
Giancana was admitted to ~dbm 402 of the Hospital unde~ the ' ; : 
care of a Dr. Debakey. M~:· Bennett also advised that Giancana 
I 
was there for a gall blad~~r r~moval operation. I believe, al-
'. 
though I am not positive, liµat Bennett also advised that - j> 
Giancana was then under s~rveillance. My recollection at this
