reference to the use of vessels for the·transport of

for the Maritime Branch of Special Operations. At 
that time, according to Mr~ Chapman's report, WH/4 
was talking about deck loading of 3 LCV's, with 5 
armored tanks, 5 2-1/2 ton trucks, one caterpillar 
dozer, and two gasoline tank trucks -- hardly type 
of equipment which would be required for 2-3 man guer­
