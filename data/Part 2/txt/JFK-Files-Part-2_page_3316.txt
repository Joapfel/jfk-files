A PROGRAM OF COVERT ACTION AGAINST THE CASTRO REGilv!E 
1. Objactive·: The purpose of the program outlined herein is to bring 
. . 
about the replacement of, the Castro regime with one II".o,re devoted to the true 
interests of the Cuban people and more acceptable to the U.S. in such a manner 
as to avoid any appearance of U.S. intervention. Essentially the ~ethod of 
accomplishing this end will. be to induce, support, a!l.d so far as possible dire~t 
action, both inside and outside of Cuba, by selected groups of Cubans of a sort 
that they might be expected to and could undertake on their own in:.tiati.ve. 
?. 
Sbce a crisis inevitably entailing drastic action in or toward Cuba could be 
provoked by circumstances beyond control of the U.S. before the covert action 
program has accomplished its objective, every effort will be rriade to ca_rry it 
out in such a way as progressively to improve the capability of the U.S. to 
act in a crisis. 
2. Summarv Outline: The program contemplates four major courses of 
action: 
• i 
\ 
a. The first requirement is the creation of a responsible, appealing 
and U..."'l:ified Cuban opposition to the Castro regime, publicly declared 
as such .and therefor.e nee es sari.ly located outside of Cul::>a. It is hoped 
that withL'1. one month a political entity can be formed in the shape of 
a COtl.:lCil or junta, th:;:-ough the merger of three acce?table oppos itio.n: 
groups with whi_ch the Central Intelligence Agency is a.i:!:-ead.y b c~ntact . 
The cot1.C.cil will be encouraged to adopt as it;; sloga.::::. "Restore the
