In the course of these discussions of ground 
and air operations there were some' interesting contra-' ' 
dications among Agency spokesmen as to what was needed 
or what was wanted. Tracy Barnes seemed to have a 
great deal more to say than was warranted by his 
knowledge and apparent understanding of the planned 
action. In one discussion with Secretary Douglas, 
when Barnes was pushing .·for the use of an increased 
number of troops, he stated that the number.of anti­
Castro dissidents who might rally round the invaders 
would be no different if the size of the invading force 
were 600 men or 3,000 men. A rationale such as that 
and 'Barnes's comment to Gen. Lansdale when he for­
warded one proposal --
Please recognize that this proposal is 
a draft and is off the top of the head. 
without any detailed knowledge of possible 
applicable regs_and procedures --
help make understandable the consternation within the 
ranks of the Department of Defense concerning the 
Agency's. understanding of which end was ·up.* 10/ 
* rhere was also an ongoing discussion during this time 
period regarding the assignment of us Army Special Force 
trainers to the Guatemala bases. This is discussed in 
detail in Volume II.of this history, Participation in 
the Conduct of Foreign Policy.
