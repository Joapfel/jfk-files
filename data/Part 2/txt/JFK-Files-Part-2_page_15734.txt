calling upon our comra~es to learn how to apply the Marxist-_ 
Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study _0f 
Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, milit'1ry_ 
affairs and culturej and to analyse every problem concretely on

Our· comrades in the Party School- should not regard Marxist 
theory a.s lifeless dogma. It is necessary to master Marxist the­
ory and apply it, master it.for the sole purpose of applying it. 
I£ you can apply the Marxist~Leninist viewpoint: in elucidating­
one.or two practical problems, you shoule be commended ·and cre-
dited with some achievement,· The more problems you elucidate and 
the more comprehensively ·and profuondly you do so,. -the greater 
will be your achievement, . Our Party School should alsd lay do~m • 
yhr ±Nix rule· to grade students good or poor accoring •• to how 
they look at Chinats problems after they have studied Marxis~- __ _ 
Leninism, according to whether_or not they see the ·problems tjl~ar-
ly and whether or not they $ee them at all, • 
·Next let us talk about the question of the _"intellectuals", 
:Since China is a semi-coionial, semi-feudal country and her cult-
ure is not well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured • 
On-this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of 
the- Party made the decision over two years ago that we should ·.-:in : 
over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they nre 
revolutionary_and willing to take part in the resistance to Jd?an,~ 
w~lcom~ them one and all, It is entirely:right for us to ~stcem ·- •
