REP. LATOURETTE: Mr. Howe, I don't have a question but I'm glad you told the 
story of Otto Eisenschiml because somewhere in the back of my mind I remember a 
book or movie called the Lincoln conspiracy and I was certain that Secretary 
Stanton had something to do with the demise of our sixteenth president, so I'm 
glad you brought that up. • 
Mr. Tunheim, I do want to ask you a follow-up question to what we were talking 
to Congressmen Stokes about and I was fascinated by the document that you held 
up. When I was in the prosecution business and we had a public records law in 
Ohio which was new on the books, we found that law enforcement agencies always 
wanted to take a big black magic marker and redact everything. It was my view 
that that led to more conjecture, rumor, suspicion than not, and I think this 
document that you brought forward, knowing that it came from the Swiss federal 
police, that would give, I think, some cause to believe that Mr. Oswald had some 
Swiss bank account and was squirreling away money from foreign nationals as part 
of a conspiracy.
