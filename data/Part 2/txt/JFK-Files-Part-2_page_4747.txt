MR. HALPERN: Oh yeah. It's not just me or my guys, it's all the way through 
the government.· The Executive Branch everybody talks, that's all. On all 
kinds of stuff. It's not just. 
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we're going to come back to that. 
MR. HALPERN: All right. It's not just one Agency. By a long shot. And I 
think the Hill is making better strides on this and think they are beginning 
to realize and have for a number of years, a number of them anyway. Even what 
_ I told you about Huddleston. You know, you Members the Congress, trust us as 
your surrogates. Well, okay, that's a step forward. Instead of trusting 535

because I am adding up staffs as well as members of Houses and both 
committees. And don't forget, and people -- most of them -- do forget, that 
in addition to the two intelligence committees, you still have Appropriations 
in both Houses, you have Armed Services in both houses., and they sti 11

INTERVIEWER: In practice. 
MR. HALPERN: In practice. Don't kid yourself. Far more people know and they 
are better, they are beginning to learn, they are handling themselves much 
better, they have control of the stuff. Look at the Iran/Contra stuff. Very 
little stuff leaked from the Hill. What you've got is what they want you to 
get. They are controlling that stuff. Very well indeed. They are 
controlling the pieces of paper, they are controlling the reproduction 
machines, the xeroxes and all that kind of stuff. Much-better than the 
Executive Branch is doing. Yeah, sure, they are a smaller group. You know,
