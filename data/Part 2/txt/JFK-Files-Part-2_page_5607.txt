only what is accurate in Agee's book, but also what is \ 
inaccurate. • \ 
\ 12. (S) Furthermore, the language used by S~elso is. \ 
\ clear. The use of the phrase "exposed by Agee in his book" • 
does not allow for any other interpretation except that 
Agee•s description of the teltap is accurate. ·If Scelso had 
used other language, such as "has been written about 
elsewhere", the existence of the joint teltap operation 
would be protected. We request that the Board protect the 
phr~se as it is and use the above substitute language. Such 
substitute language would not alter the story of the JFK 
Assassination, yet would still allow for the protection of 
the joint operation. 
13. (S) While the connection between Agee's book and 
Scelso's testimony may at first seem attenuated, anyone 
involved in the review process conducted by this Board will • I 
know that it is not. Many individuals follow the decisions I
