~orked---i:-ine~ When Mongoose'. came along there was no 
quest·ron inmy mind .... at least, I would have done the 
same thing unless Bill Harvey had said "Don't talk to 
them," but he never did. Bruce Cheever, who was Bill's 
deputy, thought you had to bring them in, too, to let 
them·know what's going on. You don't go into details 
of an operation, you don't go into details of your 
sources. The only guy that ever did that was Des. 
That was 1963. His final report to Des was simply, 
"You guys are shooting yourselves in the foot. This 
information is very good, not just good but very good 
and you are masking it all with all these crazy by­
lines. I know you can't give the true name but you can 
at least change the by-line somehow." This is what Des 
used later when he became DDP for a couple of years, to 
change all the by-line systems throughout the whole 
DDP. We started to give better descriptions of the 
sources. Some of these things,had some benefits. But

second.... • ' 
BL: The IG report .... 
SH: In the ·IG report, the thing that bothered me, too, in 
there, in reading the IG report was the fact that so 
many of the case officers - if it's correct - seemed to 
be confused as to just what the hell they were doing 
and why they were doing what they were doing. I don't 
think we ever had that in the Mongoose show. We had Ed 
Marelius up here in Washington las the Chief of the FI 
Branch. We had Seymour Bolten as head of the Covert 
Action Branch, PP, Psychological Warfare Branch. We
