MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY 
SUBJECT: Policy Toward Cuba 
In the attached paper the JCS recommended to the SecDef that 
he forward the Army study entitled, 11 Square Dance" to the Inter­
departmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairs for appropriate 
interagency coordination as a basis for further consideration by the 
JCS. 
In the course of preparing a Chairman's position on "Square 
Dance," I pointed out that the covert operations proposed would involve 
serious injury to Cuban civilians, and probably should not be elected 
without very serious provocation -- perhaps greater than-that required 
to justify invasion. In addition, even if consistent with US values on 
"just 11 international behavior, it is highly unlikely that we could 1..mder...; 
take such operations without having our role discovered and resulting 
in .serious international liabilities. Finally, even if 11 Square Dance 11 
,vere successfully implemented, there would be no guarantee that the 
Cuban government would change its position. lvlore likely, Soviet aid 
ar..d control would be increased. 
As you are; aware, Bill Srnith participated in this study, 1:hough I 
under stand he did not subscribe to all of its contents. I recommend, 
l
. however, that the White House remain aloof from formal consideration 
of "Square Dance 11 at this stage. Then if the Coordinating Committee 
a.ad the: JCS should recom1nend action in accordance with study proposals, 
we can con sider their recommendations without any pre commitn1ent.
