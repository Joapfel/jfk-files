then gave them to Roselli {O'Connell, p~ 43). 
In late February or March 1961, Roselli 
reported to O'Connell that the pills had been delivered in 
Cuba to an official close to Castro who may have received 
kickbacks from the gambling interests (I.G., p. 23). The 
official kept the pills for a .few weeks, then returned them. 
Roselli and O'Connell ascribed his failure to a case of 
"cold feet" (Roselli, p. 24; O'Connell, p. 44). The Inspector 
General noted that he had lost his position in the Prime 
Minister's office, and thus access to""CastroJ before he 
received the pills (I.G., p. 28). 
(5) A Second Delivery Is Attempted 
Following this first failure, Roselli told 
O'Connell that Trafficante believed Tony Varona, a leading 
figure in the Cuban exile movement, might be able to accom­
plish the assassination (I.G., p. 29).* Dr. Manuel Antonio 
de Varona y Lorado headed the Democratic Revolutionary Front,· 
a Cuban exile group supported by the CIA. The Inspector 
General's Report suggests that Varona may have been receiving 
funds from Trafficante .and other racketeers interested in 
securing "gambling, prostitution, and dope monopolies" in 
* O'Connell testified that he met Varona only once,. an·d 
that after the meeting Varona told Roselli: 
"Look, I don't know [sic] like the CIA and you can't 
tell
1
me that this guy isn't a CIA man". O'Connell 
recalled, "I don't know whether I showed it or what, .. 
but. he suspected that I wasn't what I was represented 
to be." (O'Connell, p. 22.)
