A particular focus of attention has been the prospect that Cuba might 
become a. base for Soviet submarine operations. There ha.ve been repeated ru­
mors and speculations that such is already the case. Much of this is related 
to the Soviet assistance to Cuba in improving and expanding certain commercial 
fishing facilities.. The intelligence community, however, does not believe 
that in fact Cuba is now, or has been, a base for Soviet submarines. 
Admittedly, however, no spectacular operation is necessary to provide 
temporary advance base type support to submarines, sufficient to greatly ex­
tend their time on station away from bloc nation ports, and to facilitate theL 
operations generally. Reasonably sheltered anchorages or ports with sufficieni 
depth, re~dy supplies of diesel fuel, fresh water, food supplies, and relaxa­
tion facilities ashore for the crews greatly extend the time away from home 
for any submarine. The presence of a few skilled technicians and a supply of 
the high usage repair parts would additionally extend operational periods con­
siderably. The use of shore-based long range communication systems and infor­
mation from surface and shore-based radio and radar nets would greatly facili­
tate Soviet submarine operations in the Caribbean as well as assist in attempt: 
to evade detection. 
B. Nature and Capabilities of Forces and Equipment Now in Cuba 
l. Types and Numbers of Weapons - As previously mentioned, it was tes­
tified that the native Cuban forces are organized only at reinforced battalion 
level with the effective modern weapons for such units, including rifles, ma­
chine guns, light and heavy mortars and considerable field artillery. For an 
organization of that type they have a rather large amount of mechanized 
equipment, tanks, self-propelled artillery and armored personnel carriers.
