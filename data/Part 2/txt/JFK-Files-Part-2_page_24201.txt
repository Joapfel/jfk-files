it was proposed that either AAM should obtain the necessary certi­

again in order to avoid lengthy public hearings, which would be time­
consuming and generate public exposure, it was decided that the 
ownership of the company to be acquired'must be kept completely 
separate from AAM. This solution was concurred in by the CAB, the 
DOD. the CIA, and A.AM management.

ongoing MATS contract, it would actually perform the flying service

employ personnel transferred from AAM. Under inter-company agree­

and other services for which it would be reimbursed by the new 
company. In this way, Air America would share in the revenues 
generated by the MATS contracts.
