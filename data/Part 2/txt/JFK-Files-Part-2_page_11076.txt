1. Policy 
a. Communist Party_; USA 
By Presidential directive on 9-6-39, and subsequent restatements 
{se9 ·sec·tion 102, volume IV, of. this m2.nual), this Buren.u is 0harged 
with tho responsibility of coordinating all information with rogard 
to the internal security of the U. S. Since 1939, a large portion 
of the Bure;;,.u' s security investigations nas been directed toward 
a coverage of the activities of communists and other groups ;-rhose 
aims seek the overthro;·r of the U. S. Government. 'l'he Communist 
Party, USA, is the best organized 2.nd most dangerons from 3. security 
standppint. The party is not an isolated or purely domestic orgwn­
ization but is pa.rt of an international communist ·movement lecl and 
dominated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the ult'irnate 
• aim of nhich is to establish a ;-10rld-wide communist state. The 
CL~1mnunist Party, USA, bases its theory on i;ho principles of I"fa.rxism­
Leninism. .(Consiu.er::>.ble eviclencc sho,rn that these nrincinles look • 
toward the violent overthrow of the U, S. Governmen-:,,; or its downfall 
in the ev.ent of a w:;,.r with the Soviet Union.) It would be a gra.v-e 
error to suppose thst, because the party is actually and potentially 
small, it is not dangerous. . The contemplated role of the pa:L'ty is 
such that it c,111 be played best by an ot·ganiza.tio·n which is cohesive, 
e~:;ily mob:i.lized, h_ighly maneuverable, fanaticaJ.ly zealous, well 
·-ilisoipJ.incd, and imme,liately responsive in ~n cmerg,rncy to.the demands 
of •its leaders. The highest ::.u·l;hority in the Communist P .. ,.rty, USA, 
is the 112. tion:i.l convention l'fhich meets approximately once t1v,, ry two 
years. Bctvreen these conventi.ons, the n:>. ti 021:;.l. _coJTu-ni ttoe is- the 
highest o.uthorit:y: of the party.
