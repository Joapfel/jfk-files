Dear Bob, 
It was ver'3 good to meet with you. again in Waehingt022 on June 12. 
I am writinB to confirm our recent conversation about the CI.A's release 
of documents about me to the National Archives •. As X expla:ined to you at 
our meetizlB. I am very displeased that this was done w:i.thoutmy knovled­
ge and especially stiioe my photograph was o:tti.oia11:r released by the 
.Agency ~er the :first time in thirty years. 
J 
As you know, :i.t has oome to my attention that the Oli released these 
many hundreds o'/: paees to the public:, withoµ.t consulting me or telling

theee·reports totalling more than 700 pages. One is the October 1968 
·report supporting me by Bruce Solie; the other was a February- 1968 re­
port by the CI Ste.f:t wlu:ch attacked my credibility-. (Thie latter report 
cGntains a co~:, of my: photo :from the late 1960e. I consider this a·breaoh 
of my personal security.} 
I also consider man1 of .the details 1n both.of these reports to be of a 
very ?ersanal. nature. Other pages deal with with some ve-ry- sensitive 
cases which I gave the Agency about other people. The information in 
these reports was given freely and accurately by me to the OIA of!icere 
in the 1960s under tems of strict conf:i.dentiality. Although ~tis very 
• ' 
difficult for me to say this. I !eel that my trust 1n the Agency haB now 
been seriously damaged. 
.. 
Thie release particularly troubles me because for the pas~ thi.rty years 
I have retiainell very lo:,al to the Agency and considerate cf its wishes. 
For instance, despite many requests, I have onl~~epoken to a fe~ jourf 
nalists, and only when the Agency ~dvised me t~o. I have never sought
