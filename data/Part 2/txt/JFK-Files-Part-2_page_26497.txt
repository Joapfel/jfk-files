PANAMA 
1. Panama lists 56 legal travelers to Cuba 
in 1962 and two thus far in 1963. Altogether, 
however, 64 Panamanians a~e identified, on the 
basis of their political- backgrounds and known 
length of stay in Cuba, as probably having gone to 
Cuba for either political indoctrination or guer­
rilla training. Of these 64, 38 almost certainly 
received guerrilla training. 
2. Eighteen guerrilla trainees returned to 
Panama in February, 1963, after stays of four to 
six months. Six were detained briefly by the Pana­
manian security service, and t&e 12 others who re­
turned a few days later were not arrested. 
3. Training for Panamanians apparently started 
at least as far back as 1961. A guerrilla trainee 
from another country, attending a course with five 
Panamanians in July, 1961, was told by Cuban in­
structors that the Panamanians were being given 
more rigorous training than other nationals because· 
they had special sabotage assignments in the Canal 
Zone. 
4. We have, however, no indication of any 
paramilitary groups, activity, or training in Panama. 
5. Panamanian security authorities maintain rio 
statistics on subversive incidents, and many are not 
reported to central authority. There have been a 
considerable number of minor incidents, mainly by 
unknown perpetrators. Other than continuing sabotage 
activity against the United Fruit Company installa­
tions in Chirique Province, the most spectacular 
incident was the brief declaration of revolt last 
August by Manuel Jose Hurtado, a former Panamanian 
major, and 16 adherents. Hurtado, a strong anti­
Communist, was iJ:notivated by personal problems. 
6. Since 1 January 1962, there have been about 
67 individuals arrested, some of them repeatedly, for 
subversive activities. Of this group, eight are known
