MEMORANDUM 
TOM LAMBETH 
KENNETH D. KLEIN 
JUNE 14, 1977 
CLARENCE DAY - INVESTIGATOR 
It is my recommendation that 
Clarence Day be hired as an investigator 
for the JFK Task Force. His resume is very 
impressive and his long career as a law en­
forcement officer certainly qualifies him 
to be an investigator for this Committee. 
Equally important were his re­
actions to the questions I posed to him. He 
came across as an intelligent man who is well 
versed in the law as it applies to the rights 
of individuals, and he impressed me as a man 
who would be a valuable member of our task 
force. --- - Eu.fa,.,-
