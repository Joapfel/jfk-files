( The 0hief of)station concluded this cable with the following 
cryptic recommendation, reminiscent of his. testimony that he 
may have "~uggested'' shooting Lumumba to (Gottlietj as an alternative 
to poisoning (Iledgman, 8/21/75, pp. 27-29): 
IF CASE OFFICER SENT, RECOMMEi~D IIQS 
POUCH SOOi'lEST HIGH POWERED FOREIGN HAKE 
RIFLE WITH TELESCOPIC SCOPE AND SILENCER. 
HUNTING GOOD HERE WHEN LIGHTS RIGHT. 
HOWEVER. AS HlJNTH!G RIFLES NOW FORBIDDE:1, 
WOULD KEEP RIFLE.IN OFFICE PENDING OPENING 
OF ;{lJNTING SEASON. (CIA Cab le G=tl 289 36 ,\ 
10/17/60.) • ) 
The first sentence of Hedgman's recommendation clearly refers 
to sending a sniper rifle to the Congo via diplomatic pouch. The 
,rest of the message is probably an oblique reference to the 
possibility of shooting Lumumba at the "OPENING OF HUNTING SEASON" 
in other words, at the first opportunity to find Lumumba outside 
the residence where he remained in UN protective custody. This 
interpretation is bolstered by a report sent the next month by 
the ~hief of)Station through the PROP channel for Tweedy' s "EYES 
ALONE." Hedgman's cable described the stalemate which prevailed from 
mid-September until Lumumba's departure for Stanleyville on 
November 27; Lumumba was virtually a prisoner in UN custody, but 
inaccessible to CIA agents and the Congolese:
