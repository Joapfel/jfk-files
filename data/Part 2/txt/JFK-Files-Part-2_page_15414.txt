REVIEW OF PROGRAM AT INTERNAL SECURITY -
ESPIONAGE CONFERENCE 6/9-10/60: . 
At this Conference captioned program was revie~edo Considera­
tion was given to questions whether we should endeavor to develop sources 
at establishments outside Washington and New York City andl!::whether we should 
relax our procedures to permit more direct approac,h during interviews with 
potential sourceso • Conference concluded that probability of there -being • 
important intelligence data within foreign official establishments outside 
Washington and New York City was too remote to warrant expenditure of man­
power and money for.purpose of_ endeavoring to expand program in this 
direction at this time. With regard to relaxing requirement that potential 
sources be interviewed under suitable pretext, preferably of a criminal • 
nature, Conference felt we are operating in too delicate an area to ·let 
<lown safeguards at this time. Conference agreed that New York and 
Washington Field Off_ices should, on a highly selective basis, endeavor to 
develop higher~level sources where situation permits such efforts by 
making approaches to them through sources currently being. operated on 
lower levels (such as chauffeur~ clerks, secretaries, et cetera, in diplo-
matic ~stablishments). This will be done.- · • 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS: 
Controls are exercised on day-to-day basis through.review of 
outgoing instructions to field. Technical surveillances are subject to 
90-day evaluations. No interviews are conducted of potential sources with­
out specific State Department clearance. Control file is maintained to 
which copies of pertinent correspondence are :regularly routed. Semi-
annual evaluation_of program encompasses review of control fileo
