The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.

• . Committee on House Administration 
. House of Representa,ti ves 
Washington~ D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I am requesting that you consider authorizing a 
.· retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counse 1 
of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K. 
·Tanenbaum. Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee 
was erroneously terminated at the close of business July 31--. 
three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee. 
This administrative error was an.oversight, which went unno­
ticed unti 1 after the August pay period when he notified the 
Committee that he had not received a paycheck for August·l 
through 3. His annual rate. of pay was $36,000; therefore, 
the amount I am.requesting he be retroactively paid is $300. 
Mr. Tanenbaum was a valuable employee, wel 1 thought 
of by the Cammi ttee. I regret the error· and am hopeful that 
you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay 
he has earned. If there is anything further I can provide, 
please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to 
this matter is very much appreciated ..

LOUIS STOKES
