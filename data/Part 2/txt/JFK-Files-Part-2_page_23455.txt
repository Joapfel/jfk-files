SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 29 December 1960 
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant, Douglas, Gray, Dulles, Bissell 
✓ 
3. Air Drops - Cuba 
Mr. Bissel! notified the Group of plans for five supply drops m 
the next three days. 
I 
'5. Dominican Republic 
Mr. Bissell gave the broad outlines of a two-pronged plan for 
proceeding '-.vith certain limited covert activities directed against the 
Trujillo regime. He emphasized that although support would be given 
to the Figuercs g:oup: there is no intention of establishing a para­
milit2.ry fore':'! a.s such, since this would be impractical in view of 
requirements for Cuba. He also emphasized that the proposed actions 
would not of themselves bring about the desired result in the near futt:..re, 
lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo hi~self. 
The Group agreed with the proposal as outlined and felt that ·it 
should be mentioned at the Tuesday meeting. It was noted that 
Mr. Pawley feels that overt intervention in the Dominican Republic 
should be mounted simultaneously with the Cuban operation. The 
consensus of the Group was that this would not be entirely consistent. 
However, it was agreed that the plan is worth beginning at this time 
no matter what the eventual clecisio.n on overt intervention may be . 
.J6. Cuba 
Mr. Merchant reported a brief conversation he had had with 
Mr. Gray 1 s associates this morning. The latter had mac.le two points: 
(a) it would be de si ra blc to obtain the co operation and support of 
individual Latin American govcrnm·cnts, (b) it would be desirable, if 
possible, for the U.S. to break relations with Cuba, m concert with 
other countries, some time before January 20th.
