investigation in 1979. And on March 28th of that year, we filed our final 
report. In addition to it, 12 volumes of evidentiary material, printed by the 
Government Printing Office, was made available to the American public. In 
addition to this, we conducted 18 days of public hearings and an additional two 
days of public policy hearings. 
Prior .to the committee running out of both time and money, we had released 
everything that we had the time and resources to release. All of our other 
records were placed in the National Archives, under a House of Representatives 
rule which existed at that time, Rule 36, requiring such unpublished records 
routinely to be sealed for 30 to 50 years. The records of our committee 
relative to this investigation consisted of 935 boxes, which we turned over to 
the National Archives. Then, over the years, a considerable public debate about 
these records has ensued, including accusations that these records, if released, 
would contain evidence of a government cover-up, or complicity of government 
agencies in the assassination of President Kennedy.
