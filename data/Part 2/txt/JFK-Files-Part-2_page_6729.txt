CIA TALKING POINTS

cryptonym of a CIA source (IIJDECANTER) . -,...,.___ J 
• It is our considered judgment that the release of this 
cryptonym, in the particular context of the given 
document (SX-59777 of 15 •December 1991), and juxtaposed 
with the Los Angeles Times article of 29 December 1997, 
would: 
• provide an identifiable benefit to the Russian counter­

• result in concomitant damage to US counter- intelligence 
interests, and, 
• have a chilling impact on cooperation of current and 
prospective intelligence sources given this disclosure which 
could be viewed as an official betrayal of confidence. 
• Mindful, however, of the Board's statutory purpose and 
objectives, we propose however: 
• a substitution of a fictitious cryptonym (e.g., 
"TRUSTED") for the actual cryptonym tIJDECANTER }in this or 
any other document where it appears and would--'otherwise 
be releasable, and/or,
