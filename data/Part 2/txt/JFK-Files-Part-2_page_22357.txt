1-ir. Vice-President, Governor Reagan, distinguished 
member;.; of this Co;m~,ission. I am here willingly at your 
invit~tion; I shall answer all of your questions fully and 
candidly. 
My federal service has ~xtended over a 32 year period, 27 
of those years were spent with tb0 Central Intelligence Agency. 
I am proud of my service with the C.I.f., and I am proud of the 
thousands of dedicated men and women with whom I worked in the 
C.I.A. I retired from the C.I.A. on December 31, 1974, after 
having been on sick leave from March 8, 1974, until the date 
of my retirem2nt. My last ten years of active service with the 
C.I.A. were spent as the Director of Security. I was responsi~le 
to the Director C.I.A. and to other senior C.I.A. officials for 
personnel security and for the security and protection of classified 
information, data and installations, both in the United States and 
abroad. During my tenure as Director of Security, I served 
successively under Mr. John A. McCone, Admiral William Raborn, 
Mr. Richard Helms, Mr. James R. Schlesinger and Mr. William F. 
Colby. 
I am aware of allegations given recent prominence by the 
news media that C.I.A. conducted improper activities in the 
United States. Since my departure from active status in March, 
1974, I have had no access to Agency files or records with which 
to verify or refute such char 0es. I can assure the members of 
this Commission 11:y full cooperation but it is possible that my 
recollection of dates and details may be imprecise or unclear 
without access to p:J.rticular files and records of the C.I.A. To
