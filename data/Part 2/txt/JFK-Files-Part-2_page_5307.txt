clearly has the potential to do harm to the Agency as 
an institution and to national security. There is 
simply no way to measure the possible effect of such a 
release on past and future employees, agents, liaison 
relationships and operations. 
* Since most of the individuals involved have little or 
no connection with the JFK assassination, the release 
of their true names does not add to the assassination 
story. The substitution of pseudonyms or other 
identifier would meet the historian's need to track who 
is saying what to whom, etc. 
* However, the Agency does recognizes that there are some 
employees who are part of the JFK story (many of their 
names have already been released). We propose that the 
ARRB staff and HRG work together to establish a list 
of individuals who fit this category. These are the 
names that would be released unless the Agency is able 
to provide the required evidence of current harm. 
This approach would serve both the public's and the Agency's 
interests. It would also allow the Agency to focus its 
resources on completing the review and responding to the 
special requests of the Board, instead of spending an 
inordinate amount of time and money on individuals of 1 
marginal or no interest to the JFK story.

Proposed Action 
(AIOU} We have a little over two months to resolve this 
issue and be ready for the ARRB meeting, May 12-13. Support 
from~·-top managerfl'ent including a willingness to raise the 
issue,':wj.gh the acting/new DCI and possibly the White House 
is critical to success. I envision a memorandum to the 
Board similar to the one prepared on sources. However, I 
reco;nmend it be signed by the General Counsel. We should 
also be prepared to discuss the issue directly with the 
Board since we are asking them to reconsider a decision in 
which we initially concurred. 
(AIOU) Mr. Marwell recommends that we include examples 
of documents with names of marginal interest in our package. 
He also would like to start immediately preparing a list of 
those names which are "important to the assassination 
story". If you concur, HRG and DO JFK reviewers could begin 
immediately on these two tasks.
