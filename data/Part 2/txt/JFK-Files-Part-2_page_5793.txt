Re: CIA Compliance With the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 
Dear Mr. Tenet: 
We have received the CIA's Final Declaration of Compliance (dated September 2, 1998) 
regarding the completion of CIA's work under the President John F. Kennedy 
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 ("JFK Act"). On behalf of 
the Board, I am writing to express the Board's disappointment that CIA has been 
unwilling to have the most senior officials of your agency attest to CIA's compliance 
with the JFK Act. 
The Board had first asked CIA to submit separate certifications from each directorate, as 
well as the office of the DCI, attesting to their searches for assassination-related records. 
We stressed these measures to obtain assurance that all components of the CIA had 
complied with the JFK Act, as well as to assure the American people that the U.S. 
Government had left no stone unturned in releasing records on the assassination of 
President Kennedy. The CIA refused to submit separate certifications, insisting it was 
their practice for one official to speak on behalf of the entire Agency. The Board then 
requested that CIA's most senior officials, the Executive Director and General Counsel, 
certify CIA's Final Declaration of Compliance under the JFK Act. CIA refused. 
In 1992, CIA Director Gates testified to Congress that he was "determined personally to 
make public or to expose to disinterested eyes every relevant scrap of paper in CIA's 
possession" that related to the Kennedy assassination. See The Assassination Materials 
Disclosure Act: Hearing on S.J. Res. 282 Before the Senate Comm. on Governmental Affairs, 
102d Cong., 2d Sess. 55 (1992). The Board has merely asked that CIA's highest officials 
confirm that they are fully confident that this commitment has been fulfilled. While we 
recognize the substantial documentation provide~by 0A to demonstrate its work 
under the JFK Act, we are disappointed that CIA has been uncooperative in responding
