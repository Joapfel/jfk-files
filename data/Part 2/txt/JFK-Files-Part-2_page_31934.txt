interest or relatives residing abroad. Source was unable to suggest anyone 
who may have knowledge of SUBJECT. McLendon declined to make any re­
commendation concerning SUBJECT'S suitability for assignment to a position 
of trust and responsibility with the United States Government because of 
insufficient knowledge.
