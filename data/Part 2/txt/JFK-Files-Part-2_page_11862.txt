1. Use of students 
a. Students under age of 18-years are not to be developed as security 
informants, potential security informants, or other types of security 
sources in other than highly unusual circumstances. Under such 
circumstances, furnish complete justification to Bureau. 
b. Upon initial contact with prospective student informant or source, 
individual should be tactfully requested to execute a brief signed 
written statement for field file setting forth that this individual 
has voluntarily come fdrward to furnish information to FBI because 
of his concern over individuals or groups that may be inimical to 
interests of u. s. Government and that he understands FBI has no 
interest in legitimate institution or campus activities. 
2. Deleted 
3. Responsibility for well-planned coverage 
Each office must have continuous and well-planned program to obtain 
necessary coverage at institutions of learning so that Bureau can fulfill 
its obligations. Care with which this must be done in no way lessens 
responsibility of each field office to have proper coverage.
