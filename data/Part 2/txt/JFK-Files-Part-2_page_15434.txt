ADDENDUM BY MR. TOLSON. 10/13/61

•. • I am inclined to the view • that we should not send the attached 
communications • to the Attorney.· General and Deputy Under Secretary 
of State Johnson concerning our proposal to expand our inte Higence • 
coverage in this country with respect to 'countries in Central and 
South America. After all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson, 
indicated what we· could do and he,• in turn, advised that the requested 
clearances would not be granted. It is not the Bureau's basj£ 
~sponsibility to develop information concern!!J:g_Jhese for~ign co~_!!!E.~ 
It is obvious ffiat someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has . 
talked is opposed to our doing.this. We have been told that if ~here is 
a specific country or individual involved and a request was 1nade by the . 
. Bureau, consideration would be giyen to such a request. I think that we • 
should let the matter stand on that basis.· 
Mr. Belmont does not agree. This matter presently rests on 
an oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record. •
