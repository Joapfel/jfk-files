.alternative reason. He recalled being informed that after 
the pills had been delivered to Cuba, "the go signal still had 
to be received before in fact they were administered" (Maheu, 
p. 42). He testified that he was informed by O'Connell some­
time after the operation that the Cubans had an opportm1ity 
to administer the pills to Fidel Castro and either Che Guevarra 
or Jlaul Castro, .but that the "go signal" never came (Maheu, 
pp. 43-44, 60-61). He did not know who was. responsible for 
giving the signal (Maheu, p. 44-L5). Varona subsequently 
returned the cash and the pills (O'Connell, pp. 19-20; CIA 
Justice file R-153, Memorandum, Osborn to DCI, 6/24/66). 
The date of the Varona operation is 
unclear. The Inspector General's Report places it in March­
April 1961, prior to the Bay of Pigs (I.G., p. 29). Bissell 
testified that the effort against Castro was called off after 
the Bay of Pigs (Bissell, 6/11, p. 52) and Maheu testified 
that he had no involvement in the operation after the Bay of 
Pigs (Maheu, p. 50). O'Connell, however, was certain that it 
occurred during early 1962 (O'Connell, pp. 47-48) ..
