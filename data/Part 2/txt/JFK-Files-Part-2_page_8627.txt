- . , <11: Mr. P-resident, you _told the Demo• 
- 'Cratic Platform Conumttee that you ._ 
thought present defense expenditures 
could •be reduced ·by .five to seven bil­
~ion rlollars. Now I think you may have 
_modified your p0sitioni somewhat since 
then, Obviously 1n your short time in 
office you. didn't find the opnortunity 
to make cu~s like that in your precedes­
sor's budget. But isn't it also likely 
that next year's budget for the defense 
wi4l exceed this year's. . 
" : A. Well because of inflationary'pres­
f su~es and •because of an impossibility 
,~" • J of assessing the potential threat ·to our 
Y Q"' country from other nations, it's hard 
L.\ ~o predict ex~ctly _what the level of 
J Klefense spendmg will be. In the- short 
time that we had ava.Hable to work 
on the previous Administration's budg­
et-about three weeks of-111ard-work­
we were able to reduce the suggested 
expenditures by almost $3 biilion. I 
think about $2.75 billion.• 
This was done-and i think Senator 
Stennis in his recent public s.tatements 
has confirmed that it has been done 
without weakening· our own defense 
capability. And the 8ubstantial sav~ngs 
in defense spending that wiH still leave • 
us muscle w.ill be in such things as 
_the standardization of weapons long­
range planning, a more businessfake al• 
location .of defense contracting,- an as-. 
sessmenV of the defense contracts for 
construction or repair already out­
standing. 
• A reassessment of p~iorities of the 
evolution of new weapons which in th~ 
future ,can become enonnous'ly expen­
sive; -a longer assignment of military 
personnel to a base before they . are 
transferred; some emphasis on the cor­
rection of inequities and unfairnesses 
in the rebirement system. • 
These things obviously can't be done 
in three weeks, ,but tfiey will be an 
ongoing effort on my part. And I think 
the 1979 budget, which will be my Ad­
ministration's first budget, will show 
these ,improvements to a substantial de­
gree. 
Q. Will. next year's de.fense budget 
::1ctua11y _ be lower then than the one 
that Y<?U just revised. A .. I c·an't say ~ct. I

Hgence. Q. Mr. Preside!)t, the othe~ day. get-
4. Difference With Meany ting back to· tlus C.I.A. thmg, when ,that story broke your Press S-ecretary~ 
when ·he issued what amounted to a 
"no commenl" by the White House, 
someone agked him if this .story had 
broken back during the campaign when 
you were running for Presiden', v.ould 
you have given a similar response? And 
he said "wr.ll I don't' know." S0 ec1n 
I ask you, what would have 'ber.r: yo1.1:­
response? W0uld it .have· been the 
same? A. J don't know. 
Q. Mr; President; George Meany says 
he won't go along with your idea for 
pre-notification on wage a_nd price in­
creases. And my question really is, how 
hard. are you going to press Mr. Meany 
to go along and do you have anything 
else .in mind that you could use in tlhe 
way of Government involving itself to 
try to control inflation? • 
. A. I announced earlier my fimt comi., 
mitment not to have mandatory wage 
and price laws or authority, not to have 
5tandby wage and price authority. I've 
J1ot made any proposal to· Mr. Meany 
or· any' other labor leader nor to any 
representative of. industry or ma!)ufa~• 
turing. But I. will retain the option m 
the future of ass~,ssing what we need 
to do to control inflation. . 
I've emphasized always the word 
"voluntary." And to the extent _that 
I can arrive at a common understand­
ing with industry and labor lead_ers that 
a certain amount of cooperation and 
i-nformation can be exchanged before 
a miajor proposal is _made. I _think that:s 
. a Jegitil'.Jlate pursuit of mme. I can t 
force it. It's got. to be voluntary, And 
that's as far as i can go with my an­
swer. 
5. Wage-Price G'uidelines 
Q. You mean.just directly abouf wage 
and price "guidelines" which might be 
-voluntary. How is that for an idea? 
A. Well I think rigid guidelines are 
a mistake. H we said, for instance, that 
no p-rice increase or no wage increase 
could exceed 6 percent this would be 
too restrictive. It would be contrary 
to my own philosophy of Gover~me~t 
: and I think that because of the d1vers1-
ty of our society and the fact that it 
is a free enterprise· system, you've got 
to have some flexibility. 
But I'd prefer to ·deal with. these 
problems that arise on· increasing 
prices on an individual bases and I also 
prefer, of course, to work harmoniously 
7. Review of C.I.A. Acth•ities 
Q. Mr. Pr~sident, on tha:t same s_ub­
ject, • you sa·id earlier that you· r,:v1_ew • 
of c.i:.A. activities had found nothi~g 
.illegal or improper and you later said 
that these activities- are legitimate and 
proper. Isn't that a v~lue j~dgme~t th=tt 
the American public might like to 
share? But a10w can they if yo•• refusl'.' 
to' give them a1~y idea of ~ ;,at rou 
ihave discovei:ed dur',1g this review 
about payments, including ones n,1ade 
in secret? 
A. That is a va1ue judgment, It's made 
by the ~ndepen~ent Intellige~ce Over-· 
sight Boa.rd, which w_as establlshed an_d 
appointed by Pres1d,~nt Ford. Th11,; 
beard ha-s made itself avaifable to thr 
Inspector General and_to_any rmployre 
within the C.I.A. or w1tlun the defense 
intelligeno- agencies or ai:iy other to 
receive . even rumors of 1mprc,pnl'ty. 
--They· have ass~ss.ed ~h~se. op-::rations. 
-They made their mqmr1es_ m the past, 
which ,is in accordance with an execu­
tive order issued by President Ford lo 
the Attocney General of the United 
States and al~o to the President. 
I have read that correspond, ,1;·e. Jt's 
quite voluminous and I think lhat il's 
accurate to say thal -Senator Inouye's 
committee in the Senate and 1.i1e appro­
pri"ate committees .in' the House have­
also received lhis ir,;'ormation in thr 
past. 
I have talked to Senator Inouye and 
he confirms what J\c just told yn .... 
And I think he would also con1mn that
