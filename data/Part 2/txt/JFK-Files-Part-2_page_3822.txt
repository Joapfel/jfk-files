OS INDICES RESULTS: 
Subject's f'i1e contains newspaper clippings dating from March 
.1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with 
a burglary of' a munitions bµnkEh? at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together 
with David· FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. • To avoid arrest, NOVEL left , 
New Orleans, f'irstgoing.to McLean, Virginia where he was given a 
:lie detector test by Lloyd B .. FURR, a private d.etecti ve. (See summary 
on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial 
claim that he was working f'or CIA because of the .lgency's promi.mity to 
McLean, Va. 
After NOVEL vacated his New Orle.ans apartment in March 1967 
a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink 
drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her.boy 
friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in 
turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans ST.ATES~ITEM, Hoke MAY.
