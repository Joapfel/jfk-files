going to do it, there wou,l d be a new DCI in 24 hours -- or thereabouts. 
INTERVIEWER: And I think your point that it went up and down wasn't just the 
younger. . . 
MR. HALPERN: No, no. It was up and down on; the entire hierarchy. There were 
pro and con a~gumentation and what have you. Now they say a lot of the older 
hands are saying. you know, "We haven't got time to do everything for God's 
sakes. Which ts more important: the Soviet target or to find out if there 
are a couple of bucks coming into the country? People are going to be tn the 
streets anyway whether they get Soviet money or not." I mean, it doesn't take 
very much to get people tnto the streets in this country, as you can see. And 
that is part of the breakdown. And that. is Vietnam. Not Watergate. You 
know, Kent State didn't happen until 1970. We'd been in the war since '65

the military and th.e State Department guys and what ~ave you, and .I said when 
we went tn ... Let's see -- the Marines went tn tn March of '65 tn Danang. 
The class didn't start until August of '65. I was with the class of 
1
66, so 
we'd been tn there a few months. And we went to a briefing in one of the 
secure rooms down in the bowels of the Pentagon. And this was DCSLOGS (Deputy 
Chief of Staff Logistics> DCSLOGS, and they had a big briefing for us. We 
were all senior officers in the War College with clearances and what have you, 
and they were telling us this is October of '65 -- they had the usual 
Colonels with pointers attached showing us the charts for what they were· 
planning for Vietnam. And the graphs were going like this for five years. 
The number of .troops that w·ere going to be in Vt etnam -- five years! I looked . 
around at my buddies and I said, "What the hell is going on here? We just got 
there! How the hell you are planning a five year war·? You guys are crazy!"
