• THAT THE Melro team is even 
involved is happenstance. Ro,sselli 
lived in Plantation, Broward Coun­
ty. with his sister arid brother-in­
law. It's just that his killers chose 
to dump his body in Dade. 
While . several detectives say 
their instincts leaa them to con­
clude that the Rosselli murder was 
.ah internal underworld affair, all 
on the team are aware of the pres­
sure on them to search each clue 
that leads back to the CIA-Castro 
affair. 
. With Rosselli's death this sum­
mer, the newly appointed Senate 
. committee saw its list of knowl­
edgeable witnesses further trim­
med. Some of those witnesses have 
died violently and some from natu-
ral causes. • 
When Giancana was murdered in 
.Tune of 1975, before he could even 
be questioned by the committee 
staff, authorities attributed it to an 
internal gangland struggle - even 
though. the murderer is still un­
known. 
• The death of Rosselli, who had 
appeared before the committee 
three times in the past year with• 
o~t immunity, caused greater con-
cern on Capitol Hill. · 
THE SAME night Rosselli's body 
was identified - the legs hacked 
off and stuffed along with the body 
into an oil drum - Baker. vice 
chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. called for the FBI to 
·get involved in the case. (Several 
days later, Attorney General Ed­
ward Levi ordered • FBI involve-· 
rnent.) 
It wasn't until several weeks 
later, . however, that what was 
known • to Baker became public 
knowledge. 
A section of the former Commit­
.tee's April report told of a Wash­
ington attorney who in 1967 went 
to Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Earl Warren (chairman of the. 
then-disbanded Warren Commis- . 
sion) to say that two' of his- clients. 
believed they knew about Cuban . 
agents in the United States who , 
conspired in the assassination of : 
• John F. Kennedy._ · 
THE INFORMATION, eventually 
reached the FBI, but as the Senate . 
committee concluded this year, the 
1967 FBI probe was slipshod and 
incomplete. • 
One of the clients referred to in~ 
the report has since been ide1'tified:; 
as Rosselli. And it has since ·been 
learned that Rosselli was con­
vinced he held a vital clue to ttie 
JFK murder. •

"Th~re was, never 'the slightest 
doubt m John s mind that Castro 
was responsible for the assa·ssina- _ 
tion of Kennedy," said Edward P. 
Morgan·, the attorney referred to in 
the report. 
Morgan is an attorney of no 
mean stature in Washington. He 
_, served a~ chief counsel to the joint 
congressional • committee which 
studied the Pearl Harbor attack. 
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela­
tions Committee and for seven 
years was .chief inspector of· the 
FBI. . 
. ROSSELLI told Morgan about 
the CIA plot in 1967, when the De­
partment of Justice was vigorously 
attempting to deport Rosselli. for 
being an illegal alien. 
Rosselli, Morgan said, "was cer­
tain that the people he (Rosselli).' 
put aro~nd Castro in the CIA plot 
turned nght around and killed Ken­
nedy. The people he still knew (in 
1967) did it." • 
~osselli, according to Morgan,. 
~ec(ded to talk about his CIA activ.: . 
ity m hopes of decreasing the pres-
. sure from the FBI and Department . 
of Naturalization and Immigration,.· 
both Justice Department agencies. 
Several friends of Rosselli in­
cluding Morgan, say they are 'con- . 
• vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli 
to become· an organized crime in­
formant by threatening to have: 
him deported if he didn't coopera- • te. • • 
_lN ~!? 1; _ t_l'!.r__oug~ a , bungled_ 
. wiretap effort, the FBI - became, 
aware of Rosselli's CIA activities. • 
• While Giancana • and Rosselli : 
were in Florida planning the opera­
tion, Giancana wanted to return to 
L~s Vegas ~o check on his girl 
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he 
suspected· of dating comedian Dan 
.Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori­
da, it was agreed that a bug would 
be placed in her hotel room and her 
conversations monitored. 
. But t~e private detective they 
hired, with CIA money it has since 
been learned, was discovered and 
arrested. Eventually. the police in- . 
vestigation led back to the Castro • 
plotters. 
Prosecution was avoided when • 
the CIA intervened and said the 
"national interest" would be dam­
aged if the plot information be--
. - came public. 
\YHEN THE wiretap case was 
ag_arn _ to be investigated in 1966, 
this time by a Senate committee 
headed by the late Sen. Edward 
Lon~ (D., Mo.), the CIA again step­
ped in to stop it. 
Morgan was told about the pend• 
ing investigation by Rosselli and 
Robert Mahue, a former FBI 
agent-turned Howard Hughes aide 
who was the CIA's. initial link to 
. Rosselli. 
Mahue told Morgan that both he 
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to 
appear before the committee. Mor-' 
gan said he called Lawrence Hous-; 
ton, the CIA general counsel. Houss •. 
ton went to Long and the investi­
gation was dropped. 
MORGAN SAID he knew, as the· 
S_enate committee recently empha-. 
sized as well, that all i,nformation . 
• about the CIA plots - which could 
have been the incentive for pro-" 
Castro forces to kill Kennedy -
had been kept from the Warren· 
Commission. .. 
"I was an admirer of Earl War- . 
ren," Morgan said. "(His) report' 
said that . . . Oswald alone killed , 
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after 
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli 
that the Chief Justice could put his 
name on a report which didn't as­
sess the • most significant piece of 
evidence bearing on the kiiling of 
Kennedy." • • -
The information Morgan had 
was passed to Warren via colum-
nist Drew Pearson, a mutual 
friend. Eventually, it reached the 
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di­
rect orders from President Lvndon 
Joh~son_ in the spring of 1967, in­
vest1gat1on was not vigorously pur-sued. . ·-
_THE SENATE Intelligence Com­
rn1~tee compared that apparent in- • 
action with a statement former FBI 
director J. Edgar Hoover made to 
: the Warren Commission on May 5, 
1964. Hoover said, "well, I can as- • 
• sure. you so far as the FBI is con• 
cerned the case will be continued­
.i~. an open classification for au.' 
• time. That is, any information com-
ing to us or any report coming to 
. us from any source will· be thor-­
'. oughly investigated, so that we 
::'Will be "able7o prove or--disprove' 
0 the allegation." . . • } 
• A Senate Committee staff mem,.;'. 
ber commented recently, "what is-
• really happening is that the investi­
gation which the FBr should. have 
done in 1967 - and no one can 
come, close. to explaining why it 
wasn t - 1s actually being done 
now." • 
HART, AS have local investiga­
tors. has established three possible 
. scenario's for Rosselli's death: his 
recent organized crime activity. re­
taliation for his Castro assassina­
tion efforts or the information he 
held concerning the JFK assassina­
tion.
