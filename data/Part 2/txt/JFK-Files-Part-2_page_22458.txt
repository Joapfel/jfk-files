Q. November 22, 1963, was a Friday. When you say that 
records reveal that he was on a duty status the next day 
A. It was a Friday. Then I was mistaken. 
~ Does that mean he was on duty the following ~or.day 
or on the next <lay, Saturday? 
A. No. On the following Monday. I didn't realize t~e 
22nd was a Friday. 
~ Will you check that thing for us and give us a trie! 
memo together with whatever supporting -- copies of support1:"1'1 
documents you can find? 
A. Okay. 
~ As promptly as possible on this question. 
I think that covers the subject matter. 
MR. MANFREDI: I can give you another moment if you Wl'l'1t. 
Can you think of anything else? 
MR. OLSEN: I think that is all . 
MR. MANFREDI: Okay. Off the record.
