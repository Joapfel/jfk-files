Question: Why did you make this decision 
• with regard to Jake, coming directly to 
you and not goi~g through King? Was it 
just a-matter of great efficiency, or 
what precipitated that? • 
Mr. Bissell: I think it was in part on 
the model of the Guatemalan operation, 
and i'n part, I think, a feeling, probably 
on.my own part ---in some degree perhaps 
on the part of Allen Dulles -- that J. 
C. was not effective enough to handle 
this kind of very fast moving, quite 
large scale, quite complex, paramilitary 
operation . 
. Question: Do you recall any instances 
where there was a serious conflict be­
tween what Jake wanted to do and what 
J.C. King thought should be done? 
Mr. Bissell: I don't remember many, if ~. 
any, and I believe that the relation-
ships between Jake and J.C. were pretty 
good throughout. 10/ 
Certainly the·written record bears out Bissell's­
contention that King was fully informed and that the 
relationship between King and Es_terline was, if not 
_love, at least mutually respectful.* 
* The only point of contention between King and Ester­
line that surfaced in the records concerned the degree 
to which William Pawley should be involved in affairs 
related to the organization of the Cuban exiles. At 
one point, Jake suggested to the DDP that all contact 
with Pawley .be cut. off., but in sending Esterl_ine 's 
memorandum thrc:mgh channels, J. c·. King noted that he 
was against cutting Pawley completely off from contact 
with WH/4. · •• In fact, Pawley was· in continuous contact 
-- even thcn1,gh • in disagreement -- with both Jake and 
King until the close out 6f the operation.
