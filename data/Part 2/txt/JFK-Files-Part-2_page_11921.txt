10. Transfer of informants to other areas 
a. Keep alert to possibility of transferring informants to areas needing 
coverage through change in residence or employment. 
b. Keep in mind overall coverage of. organizations. If informant becomes 
prominent and may be able to expand his field of activity beyond your. 
field division, encou.r~ge him to do so in order to provide wider cov­
erage for Bureau's v1ork. 
11. .A.cti on by informant when uncovered .. 
a. "If informant is uncovered by subversive elements, instruct him to de­
fend himself vigorously and demand proof of his informant activity. 
b. Suspicio~ in many cases is directed to an infor~~nt without facts to 
back it up and by bluffing informant may confuse issue to point where 
his services may not be lost. • 
c. In some cases it may be -necessary for informant to acquiesce· to 
charges of deviation from strict discipline 9f organization involved, 
and thu:s cast off suspicion. 
12. Requests of informant to help defend others 
a. If requested by Communist Party, or other interested parties to assist 
in preparation of defense in subversive-type cases or handle assign~ 
ment where such information is readily availab_le, informant should 
tactfully decline. 
b. Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent and 
made matter of record. 
c. If informant cannot avoid becoming involved, instruct him not to report 
any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy. 
d. Promptly report any such incident to Bureau. 
l3. Preparation for testifying 
Contacting .A.gent must condition informant to fact that someday knowledge 
he possesses may be needed as evidence in court. Psycholo~ically prepare 
.. informant for fact that he may at future date be called upon to te sti:fy to 
information he has furnished on security matters; Proper indoctrination 
of informant is essential as Bur.eau must provide wi tnesse·s whenever 
Department initiates prosecutions in security cases. 
INFORYiANTS' IlTii'QRM!i.TION 
1. General instructions re oral and written information 
a. These instructions apply to security informants, potential security 
informants, panel sources, security confidential sources, and 
security sources of information. 
b. Specific instructions must be given to informants concerning prepara­
tion of statements containing their information. 
c. They should be submitted as quickly as possible after meeting or 
activity. 
d. Written statements should be submitted when possible. -In espionage 
and foreign nationality wAtters wri~ten statements a.re usually 
necessary· only in those instances involving possible future prosecu­
tion. (In the majority of cases diploma.ts or offi~ials who a_re not 
subject to prosecution are involved.) 
e. Carefully scrutinize each, bearing in mi~d that if informant is called 
upon to testify at a later date his statements will very ·likely be 
introduced in court. 
f. All information furnished by.informants must be promptly reviewed, 
recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, and all necessary action 
taken. Form FD-306 may be used in lieu of channelizing memorandum if 
desired. If so, prepare copies of FD-306 as needed for channelizing 
and staple one copy to each copy of informant's statement being 
channelized. Channelization should be noted on original FD-306 and 
on all copies. When informant's statement contains refeI,'e nee s to 
large number of individu_o.ls and/or organizations, and exceeds two 
pages, consider channelizing to substantive case file only those_por--. 
tions of statement which apply to particular individual or organiza­
tion. Of course, entire statement should be filed in informant's sub­
file. This procedure should be employed unless logical reason 
dictates otherwise.
