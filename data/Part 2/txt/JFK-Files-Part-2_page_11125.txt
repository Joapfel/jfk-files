Dissemination in these cases is made to preclude these subje.cts 
from utilizing the fact'they obtnincd a passport to refute 
allegations of subversive connectio~u. The State Department, 
therefore, will be in possession of data concerning a defendant 
should he a.t-;;emnt to utilize this tactic in such an action. 
Data. developed conce;ning individuals who are not within the Bureau's 
investigative jurisdiction ~

The Delimitations Agreement between -'.;he FBI and the armed forces· 
intelligence agencies states that the responsibility assumed by 
one organization in a giv~n field carries with it the oblig~tion 
to exchante freely and directly with other subscribing organfzations 
all information of. mutual interest. 
Thus, in disch2rging our basic responsibilities in the internal 
security field, it is imperative that information concerning 
members of the military services be referred immed.iatHly to the. 
appropriate branch having p~ima.ry responsibility for its 
personnel. This procedure is mando.tory, even though t4e security 
aspects of the data have not been fully resolved or verified. 
It should be specifically pointed out in such instances that "j;he 
informa~ion has not been verified., . 
Section 87D 5b of this manual instructs that if it is dete~nined 
a sec11:rity Sl;l.bject is a me,!1ber of the armed services the invesl;i-
.:· ... ga.tion must .1t tha."i; point be discontinued inunediatel-y and repo.rted. 
to thp Bureau~ The basis for such instruction lies in the f::?.ct 
that tha subject is no longer withi~ our investigative juris­
diction. In addition, dissemination bf pertinent reports must 
be made locally in the field to the appropriate intelligence 
a,gency., 
Our rP.sponsibili ty with regarcl to : :.J.i tary personnel is not con­
f?-ned· to those who have been the ,;~;;)jects of security investi­
gations. It extends to ~riy subversive derogatory dtta developed 
against a member of the armecl services during any of our invP-sti­
gations of either individuals or organiza~~ons. ~or irrstance, 
if it is a.etcn·mined that e. mem.ber of the :-~ __ ?d forces h::i.s b~en 
.in contact ni th a security subject or Ni t1_ ::-iy indi vid.ual or ;[roup 
raising securii;y implicati 1.ms, the .appropr·<,~e intelligence 
·service should be im.rned·ia tf:J.y advised locally. This should be 
done even though the secnrity aspects .of the contact have 11ot been 
resolved, so that the military services may be in a position to•dis­
cb.a.rge their responsibilities. It m11st be :pointed out to them 
specifically in such instances that the dMta a.re unverified, 
and. pertinent .devP.lO!)ments must b~ transmitted to them thereafter 
immediately apon receipt. 
Sectioll 87D cb (1) (h) provides that during the course of secu·.,_•ity 
investigations it .must be determined whether the· subjects !rnvc 
any close relatives in. tho armP.d forces. Our responsibilities 
regy.ire th;;,.t such assocLd:ions be c~,llcd to the· at·i:ention oi -~1,e
