EMBASSY·PROCEDURE "IN HIS DAY" AND PASS IT TO THEIR OFFICE. HE SAID 
THAT WHILE HE WOULD NOT ASK FOR C/0 BY NAME, IF HE HAD SOMETHING 
IMPORTANT HE WOULD DEMAND THAT IT BE PASSED TO STATION. 
7.· TURNING ONCE AGAIN TO DOMESTIC ISSUES, WHITTEN INDICATED 
THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AS HIS HEALTH IS MISERABLE, 
HE IS IN A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF PAIN AND HE NO LONGER HAS ANYTHING 
FOR WHICH TO LIVE; HOWEVER, HE SAID HE NOW PLANS ON WAITING FOR A 
TRIAL DURING WHICH HE WILL PERSONALLY CONDUCT SOME EXAMINATIONS IN 
ORDER TO DIRECTLY CONFRONT HIS WIFE AND.CHILDREN IN AN EFFORT TO GET 
THEM TO "ADMIT TO THEIR LIES." SHOULD ANY TRIAL OR AGREEMENT END IN 
JUDGMENT IN HIS WIFE'S FAVOR, WHITTEN CLAIMED HE WOULD NO LONGER BE 
IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN AUSTRIA. WHITTEN 
SPOKE OFTEN OF SUICIDE AS A WAY TO END BOTH HIS PHYSICAL AND 
EMOTIONAL PAIN. C/0 WAS LEFT WITH THE CLEAR IMPRESSION THAT HIS 
RESOLVE ON THIS MATTER IS FIRM; WHETHER HE WAITS FOR. TRIAL OR NOT IS 
A MATTER OF PURE SPECULATION.· C/0 TRIED TO REMIND WHITTEN THAT 
WHILE HIS BODY MAY NO LONGER FUNCTION SO WELL, HIS MIND WAS 
OBVIOUSLY STILL SHARP. C/0 THEN ASKED, NOT IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY 
BUT AS ONE HUMAN BEING TO ANOTHER, THAT SHOULD WHITTEN. EVER 
SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE, HE DIRECTLY CONTACT C/0 FIRST. 
WHITTEN COUNTERED BY SAYING THAT C/0 MAY BE ABLE TO DISCERN WHEN THE 
TIME HAS COME. HE SAID HE HAS KEPT ALL OF HIS DIARIES FROM WWII 
THROUGH 1953, HAVING INTENDED TO SOMEDAY WRITE HIS MEMOIRS. WANTING 
TO KEEP ANY FUTURE PROFITS FROM HIS FAMILY, HE SAID HE NO LONGER HAS 
PLANS TO DO SO BUT THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE WITH THEM LEFT FOR 
THE AUSTRIANS _TO FIND; THEREFORE, HE WOULD PASS THEM THROUGH THE 
RSO. IN THE EVENT THAT THIS OCCURS, THIS WILL BE A SIGNAL THAT HE 
INTENDS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE SUICIDE. 
8. AS C/0 GOT UP TO LEAVE, WHITTEN, AGAIN IN TEARS, THANKED 
C/0 FOR HIS PROFESSIONALISM AND HIS HELP, AND REMINDED C/0 THAT HE 
HAD ENTERED INTO A MOST HONORABLE PROFESSION. HE ALSO SAID THAT HE 
HAD BEEN MOST HIGHLY IMPRESSED WITH REF IDEN, WHOM HE ALSO 
CONSIDERED A TRUE PROFESSIONAL. HE ASKED THAT C/0 PASS ALONG A 
*SPECIAL NOTE OF THANKS AS THE OUTCOME OF THE<JFK>MATTER HAD 
"RESTORED HIS FAITH IN THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM;" WHITTEN BADE 
HIS FAREWELL BY NOTING IT WOULD BE THE LAST TIME THAT THE TWO WOULD 
MEET, AND WISHED C/0 A GOOD LIFE. 
9. FYI, REF INFORMATION THAT WHITTEN WAS STILL SEEKING AN 
ATTORNEY RUNS COUNTER TO A STATEME!IIT HE MADE TO C/0. ACCORDING TO 
WHITTEN, BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE WERE RETAINING LAWYERS IN FLORIDA 
WHERE SHE IS NOW RESIDENT. FURTHER, AS OF THE DATE OF THE ABOVE 
MEETING, SERVICE OF WHITTEN REGARDING THE SUPPORT MATTER HAD NOT YET 
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE WAS EXPECTING THE PAPERWORK AT 
ANY TIME. WHITTEN DID SPEAK OF MAKING A PAYMENT, BUT IT IS NOT 
CLEAR WHETHER THE MONEY WAS INTENDED AS A RETAINER FEE OR AS A 
PAYMENT TO HIS WIFE. HE HAS JUST PURCHASED A FAX MACHINE TO MORE 
QUICKLY DEAL WITH LEGAL MATTERS, AND THE DAY PRIOR TO C/O'S MEETING 
HAD LIQUIDATED MANY OF HIS FINANCIAL HOLDINGS TO KEEP HIS FAMILY 
FROM THEM. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT A VIENNESE SOCIAL WORKER 
VISITS WHITTEN FIVE DAYS A WEEK TO CLEAN AND RUN ERRANDS AND THAT 
WHITTEN GETS HIS MEALS FROM THE AUSTRIAN EQUIVALENT OF 
MEALS-ON-WHEELS; THUS, WHILE HE HIMSELF IS VIRTUALLY IMMOBILE, HIS
