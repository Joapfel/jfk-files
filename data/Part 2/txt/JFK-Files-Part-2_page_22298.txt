Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high 
seas, and at the time ±hat all of this is going on they are 
building what then, upon completion of production, had been 
the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named 
after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take 
a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest 
problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But 
finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and 
a half years to do it. 
Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to qet you off the 
track. 
Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verbose. 
Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in 
Athens? You mean_ by that you actually bought the pap":!r or just 
paid them to run the story? 
Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper. 
You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those 
days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation 
in those days, ·.=big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard 
20· for us to visualize that.
