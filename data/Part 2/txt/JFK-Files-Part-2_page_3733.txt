Hightower, Chief of the Asse>cia ted Press Burea·u for 
Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety 
of this action. 
14. The use of Fairways Corporation aircraft 
has been remarkably secure, but DCI McCone himself 
fo'rgot about the cover arrangement and became quite 
exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the 
San Francisco airport for the Republican National Con­
vention in 1964 aboard the Grumman Gulf Stream with 
the highly visible tail number N 8 E. This was, I 
explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate 
charter, but be didn't like it. 
15. ~~Cone dealt quite extensively with newsmen 
in Washington. In fact, they gave him a gift and a 
luncheon when he left Washington, which ls perhaps 
indicative of the press's relations with him. However, 
in the c;ase of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible 
Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher 
and the authors to change things. They did:not change 
a comma, and I doubt that this old saw wlllever sing 
again. • 
16.· Finally, and this will reflect my Middle 
.Western Protestant upbringing, McCone's dealings with 
the Vatican, including Pope John XX 111 .and Pope Paul 
V I, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters. 
17 ~ The above listing is uneven, but I have a 
sinking 'feeling t·hat discipline bas. broken down, and that 
allegations from any quarter which cast these things in 
the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention, 
and no.amount of denial wbuld ever set the record straight. 
If I may be .of any assistance in tracking down further 
details, ·I am of course at your disposal, but I would point 
0046:!
