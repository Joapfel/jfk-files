by informant and not by Agent. 
e. When transmitting receipts and itemized statements of expenses to 
Bure~u, staple them directly to blue slip, leaving margi~ of one 
to one and one-half inches at top to avoid contact with Acco fastener

reau that such compensation must be reported as income when filing an 
income tax return. 
b. Bureau income should be set forth on Federal income tax return, form

rendered through a private enterprise or similar general term applicable

formants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under 
SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able to report _ 
Bureau income on their Federal tax returns without jeopardizing their 
security or without challenge from Internal Revenue Service. Each 
office has detailed instructions and exhibits concerning procedure to 
be followed in handling and control of money withheld. 
e. When informa:nt or former informant is initially considered as potential 
witness in Bureau case, deter.mine whether he paid Federal and state 
taxes on income he received from Bureau for his- services. If such 
taxes have not been paid, obtain a1i pertinent details and promptly 
submit recommendations for handling situation.
