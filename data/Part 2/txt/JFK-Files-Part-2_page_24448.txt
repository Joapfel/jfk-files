(iv) Questions Raised: by Edwards' Corr.nunications 
to the Justice Department ih 196i and 1962. 
As fully described supra, pp. __ , the FBI discovered 
in the late 1960's that Maheu had been involved in an illegal 
wiretap in Las Vegas. In April 1961, Haheu told the FBI that 
: 
the tap had been placed in connection with a CIA operation, and 
I 
suggested that the FBI contact Edwards to verify this fact. . I . 
An FBI report of a Hay: 3_, 1961 interview with Edwards 
(in which Edwards vaguely described the use of Giancana as 
relating to llclandestine efforts! against the Castro.Government" 
I 
with no mention of assassination;, and a copy of which was given 
to the Attorney General) stated:! 
"Col. Edwards. advised that ~nly Mr. Bissell (Director of 
Plans, CIA) and two others :in CIA were aware of the 
Giancana-,Maheu activity in pehalf of CIA' s program and , 
Allen Dulles was· completely/ unaware of Edwards' contact 
with Maheu in this connecti'.on. He added that Mr. Bissell, 
in his recent briefings of ;Gen. Taylor and the Attorney 
General in connection with ~heir inquiries into CIA 
relating to the Cuban situation, told the Attorney General 
that some of the associated: plann_ing included the use of 
Giancana an:d the underworld! against Castro." (FBI memo­
randum entitled "Arthur James Balletti et al.",May 22, 
1961, p. 2.) (Emphasis added)
