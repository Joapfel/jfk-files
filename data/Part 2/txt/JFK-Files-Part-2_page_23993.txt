For this and all subsequent messages intended for the Army Attache, 
the secret CIA communications channel was used. 
Both General Philpott and Thomas Karam.essines testified that ini­
tially the Army Attache would be used only to 11obtain or procure" in-
telligence on Chilean military officers.* (Philpott, p. 11; Karamessines, 
p. 6) The September 28, 1970 message to the Army Attache, however, did

Chief of Station, and on occasion, the COS would show him messages 
ostensibly from Generals Bennett and/or Philpott, directing him to 
take certain actions. The COS also transmitted messages from the Army 
Attache to these Generals.

and that he ~ever received.any communication relating thereto, nor did 
he ever authorize the transmission of any messages to the Army Attache.

connected with Track II after his initial meeting with General Cushman 
on September 28. (Philpott, p. 16)
