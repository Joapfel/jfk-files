information in the PDB only and he would be able to tell QY a 
certain phrase we used. And nobody else except those several 
people in the room knew it. So that even the other people that 
got copies of the PDB didn't know exactly what the hell that 
' ' ' 
phrase meant. And it was good hot intelligence from a good 
source. You can't, you know. If they give that kind of stuff 
to the Congressional people, including the committee, 
specifically just the intelligence committees. I don't see 
why.· There is no reason for it. They are not involved with 
the day to day running of the government as much as they'd like 
to be. In which case leave the Senate and become President. 
INTERVIEWER: Maybe more of them are trying to play a larger 
role in making foreign policy. 
MR. HALPERN: Yeah, okay. They've got a perfect rigllt to give 
their advice to the President of the United States. He. 
theoretically, makes the policy, whoever he may be. His staff 
doesn't, the Secre~ary of State isn't supposed t~ do it, and 
nobody else is. According to the way I read the rule book the 
President of the United States makes foreign policy. 
INTERVIEWER: What about this statement. Sam. an officer said, 
"Congressional investigations in 1975 especially were like 
being pillaged by a foreign. power only we had been occupied by 
the Congress with our files rifled, our officials humiliated. 
and our agents exposed." 
MR. HALPERN: Right on. Absolutely correct. 
INTERVIEWER: You feel that is an accurate appraisal?
