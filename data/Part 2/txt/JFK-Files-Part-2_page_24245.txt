Included as Appendix D is an in-depth list of common stock 
purchases from 1971 through September 30, 1975. In addition, the~e 
are schedules of portfolio sales from 1964 through 1974. 
A look at the Project MHMUTUAL Consmlidated Balance Sheet for 
December 31, 1974 will give some idea of the scale as of that late 
date. Current assets (cash in banks, premiums receivable, advances 
receivable, accounts receivable, client notes receivable, rent 
receivable, interest receivable, and investments maturing in one 
year) totaled $6,910,891.00. Investments (time deposits, bonds 
and commercial paper, and stocks at market value) totaled 
$25,342!772.53. Fixed assets (real estate and furniture and fix-
tures) totaled $73,084.12. Other Assets (prepaid insurance, recoverable 
deposits, and other prepaid expenses) totaled $32,682.00. These 
combined for Total Assets of $32,359,430.45. 
As usual, the Project was subjected to an extensive audit for 
that year. 
The audit included site examination of books and financial 
records of 12 of the instrumentalities administered by 
Agency-owned management firms as well as review and evalu­
ation of related records, controls, and·procedures at 
Headquarters. Five instrumentalities administered by 
Agency-owned management firms are located abroad and 
will be audited later. Audit of the other six instru­
mentalities administered abroad by foreign accounting 
companies was limited to examination of financial reports 
and such other documentation as was available at Head­
quarters. These latter examinations provided us reason­
able assurance that Agency resources, totaling about one 
percent of project accountability, are adequately pro­
tected. 
That audit concluded that MHMUTUAL "continue(d) to be admin­
istered in an efficient and effective manner and in compliance
