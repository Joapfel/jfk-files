NOTE: -
Table of contents for Manual of Instructions and 
Manual of Rules and Regulations~ as well-as the several Sections 
of the Manual of Instructions which are being transmitted to 
the Select Committee, have already been made available to the 
General Accounting Office in the past, with the exception of 
Section 36i Section 105 1 and Section 107 1 Part II. Sections 
105 1 107 1 Part I and Part II 1 am Section 130 are not being 
furnished to the Committee, but the Committee will be allowed 
to examine these Sections at FBIHQ. Section 361 dealing with 
espionage~ although classified, does not contain sensitive 
material involving sources and we feel in the spirit of the 
requirement we should furnish this Section to the Committee. 
As a matter of interest, all of the material with 
respect to the Manual of Instructions which has been made 
available to GAO is actually maintained in FBI space.
