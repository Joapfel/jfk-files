CSI/HRG,. JFK Project Officer 
Records Briefing for ARRB Staff 
1. Meeting with you, 21 February, 1997, same subject; 
2. ARAB letter to DCI, dtd 27 November 27, 1997, RE CIA Compliance 
with the JFK Assassination Records Collection ACT. 
1. As we discussed in our meeting of 21 February, the ARAB staff has asked for briefings on 
the Agency's records.systems. These briefings are the first steps in the compliance with the JFK ACT 
process describe in reference #2. At the meeting we set the first two weeks in March as the timeframe 
for the DA briefing. Mr. Gunn has requested that the briefing take place prior to 12 March if possible. 
The Board is meeting on the 13-14 March and he will be reporting on the status of the compliance 
process. Let me know as soon as possible if this is feasible. 
2. Your proposal to include representatives of offices of Security and Personnel is excellent. 
The briefing should focus on what records would have existed in 1963 and how we search, or account 
for, those records today. The talking points paper for the DO briefing, which I left with you, will give you 
a good sense of the type of information the ARAB staff is interested in. If you have any questions, please 
give me a call on extension 31825.
