2. Cable to JMWAVE from DIR, 7 May 1964 - After looking atW"I'AUPJmaterial, 
it is obvious much of conspiratorial talk in JURE is for internal consumption 
only, the purpose being to protect myth that JURE is independent as basically 
• hostile to CIA. In a desire to obtain proof of any anti-CIA or u.s govt. 
activity by Ray, urge every effort to check accuracy ofwrAUFtP}'f-O'r,reporting 
and follov through for any overt manifestations of many a.U.egations made.
