RESULT WILL AT BEST BE CHAOS AND AT WORST 
PAVE THE WAY TO COMMUNIST TAKEOVER OF THE 
CONGO WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 
PRESTIGE OF THE·UN AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF 
THE FREE WORLD GENERALLY. CONSEQUENTLY 
WE CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL MUST BE AN 
URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE THAT UNDER EXISTING 
CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY OF 
OUR COVERT ACTION. (CIA Cable, OUT 62966, 
Director to Leopoldville, 8/26/60.) 
Dulles cabled that the Chief of Station was to be given "WIDER 
AUTHORITY" -- along the lines of the previously authorized opera­

EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT" (CIA Cable, 
8/26/60). "WE REALIZE THAT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY MAY PRESENT 
THEMSELVES TO YOU,
