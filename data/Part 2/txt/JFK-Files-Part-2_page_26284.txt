Other -Matters 
I raised the qµestion as to the next step in consideration 
of Diem•~ propo_sal -·for a 100,000 man increase in· GVN t orces •. I 
was told that .the matter was being studied in Defense. It ~as 
the view of the D6D representative that the -possibility.iof such 
an increase was· academic until some time in 1963 because t.t 
would take un·til then to raise the 20, 000· men already authorized 
and the. 30,000 currently under consideration. (The·:30,obo would 
be a part of the 100,000 since Diem w,~s using- a 170,000 man base.).-
·I also raised the question of wheth~r food supplies were 
being cu't off by the;Viet Corig.(as_ sugg,~~t..e .. ~t~you by· a
