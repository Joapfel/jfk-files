just give a brief summary to members of the subcommittee today. 
I'd like to thank the subcommittee for this opportunity to testify today in 
favor of House bill 1553. And I'd also like to note our thanks to Congressman 
Stokes for his leadership on this issue and his guidance in the important effort 
to release the records relating to the tragic assassination of President 
Kennedy. 
The review board is confident that the additional time requested and provided .by 
Congressman Burton's bill will allow us to complete our work and submit a truly • 
complete final report to the Congress, to the president and to the American 
public. I'd like to thank Chairman Burton for introducing the bill and 
Congressman Waxman and Stokes for co-sponsoring the bill that is before the 
subcommittee today. And I also appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your role in chairing 
this hearing today and assisting in this effort. 
One of the other members of the review board is present with us today_..; I'd 
like to introduce her - Dr. Anna Nelson, who is the distinguished adjunct
