'I have no recollection of briefing those 
two gentlemen except as members of the ooard 
of Inquiry that I have described, of which 
Allen fulles himself was a ma:nber. 
11 
(Bissell, 
6/11/75, p. 27). 
As mentioned above (Section (e), supra), Bissell testified that his briefings 
to the ooard of Inquiry did not deal with assassination efforts. (Bissell, 
6/11/75, pp. 45-46) . 
Discussing the document in a subsequent appearance before the Corrm:ittee, 
Bissell again said that.he had no recollection of any such conversation (Bissell, 
7/22/75, p. 56) but he was sure that it did not take place in front of the 
Kennedy/Taylor board of inquiry (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 64). 
However, Bissell speculated, the report: quoted language which "I might • 
very well have used, that is, the use of .the tmderworld against Castro. 
11 
(Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 21). 
The· examination of Bissell on whether he had had any such discussion and, 
C) if_ so, why he used such obscure and indirect language, elicited the following 
tes tim::my: 
"Q: Did you, sometime in May of 1961 coommicate 
the state of your awareness to the Attorney Generaf 
in your briefing to him? 
Bissell: Well, there is a report which I was shown, 
I thliik it was last week, I believe it also came 
from the FBI, but I could be wrong about that, or 
indicating that I did, at that time in May-, brief 
the Attorney General, and I think General Taylor to 
the effect that the Agency had been using -- I 
don't know whether Giancana was mentioned by name~ 
but in effect, the Underworld against the Castro 
regime. 
Q: . Did you tell them -- them being the Attorney 
General and General Taylor -- that this use included 
actual attempts to assassinate Mr. Castro?"
