5. On the other hand, CIA could use this situation as a 
way to highlight the problems HRG has had with the JFK review 
process - that documents are being reviewed and released to the 
National Archives in such quantity and speed that it is difficult 
for CIA to-focus on any one document and, more importantly, how 
seemingly innocuous information in one document can actually be 
quite significant in relation to prior or subsequent releases. 
Since September, when this cable was originally released, the 
issue of protecting 11-1exi:c_an li_aisJ:>J:JJ has become increasingly 
important because of other releases on this subject and because 
of your appearance before the Board in Febru~ry. 
6. Furthermore, this prior release shoul-tl not impair our 
ability to continue to protect the fact of C}fexican_ !.!!~O~~e.!!1~!19 in l 
this ~-:J:_c!PJ operation. Although we ed to the Board -~ i>I'-'-{-v\ 
that t9l~cRhraseC§iitD0M~~~~ns.~ives that relationship away, _ b~VJ:2-~ 
th~~~e does notr ;, Ea 1::; directly do so. In fact, the reason·------i-:g~ 
for the Board's insistence that this phrase should be released 
was ,tj}ae u e:t:::,i fact:-t•hat;;;-t;,ae cable did NOT directly state that the 
~~.xic_an'' ~aWer~~W,cil;tThche~::_tel-faQJ We sho~be able to use 
their arguments to continue to protect thefilaisol!,_relationship. 
7. Our only recourse is to acknowledge to the Board that 
CIA has no basis to bring an appeal to the President since this 
cable has already been released in full .. We should, however, 
maintain our position that we believe t-hi~ -information./is ·_ 
damaging especially in light of releases to National Archives 
.ein-Ge-::::Scpteud:Jer-~ and that we never would have acquiesced to the 
release in September if we knew then what would be released on 
this subject in the ensuing months. Although this message does 
not necessarily need to be conveyed by you to Tunheim and could 
be handled by John Pereira and David Marwell, given your past 
dealings with the Board on this issue, you may prefer to do this.
