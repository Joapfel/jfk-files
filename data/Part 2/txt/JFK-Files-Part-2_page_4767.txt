INTERVIEWER: Memory was there. 
MR. HALPERN: But boy, I• 11 te 11 you. • But on the other hand I 
don't think it was busy work ariy more than it was busy work to 
try to collect intelligence. Most of the stuff was done 
against requirements~ Somebody wanted some information, 
somebody wanted something done. And the guy in the field had 
to f1 gure out how to do it. And some of it was v_ery wasteful. 
It's like a war. War is a wasteful busineis. And this is a 
wasteful business. As I think I mentioned the other day, 
collecting intelligence by clandestine means is the toughest, 
most expensive, most time-consuming way to collect 
intelligence. But it has got to be done. And you are going to 
make a lot of mistakes. And you are going to loose a_ lot in 
the way. And you are going to waste a lot of time and effort 
and money, no question about that, to collect the little bit of 
information. And a lot of the information you are going to 
collect is going to be useless, totally useless. But there is 
going to be a few nuggets somewhere along the way. I think we 
have figured out, people have estimated -- God knows he can•t 
do it -- for the non-denied area countries, I think it was 
estimated that.clandestine collection produces no more than 
5-10 percent of the total take. That's a small percentage when 
you consider the amount of •information that rolls into this 
government. And particularly with overhead reconnaissance and 
with SIGINT. That's a hell of a lot of stuff that's pouring
