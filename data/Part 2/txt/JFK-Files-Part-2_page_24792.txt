On May 11, 1961, Dearborn prepared a two-page:! draft-
"1'':"' 
document which set forth ways in which the U.S. could overtly 
aid and encourage the opposition to Trujillo. The draft noted 
that means of stepping up the covert program were considered 
in separate papers. (Dearborn draft document of May 11, 1961) 
This Dearborn draft of Nay 11, 1961, was apparently used as a 
basis for portions of the ''Dominican Republic -- Contingency 
Paper" discussed below. 
Two .documents entitled, 'Program of Covert Action for· the 
Dominican Republic" were provided to the Committee staff from 
State Department files. Each appears to be a draft of the 
covert a~tivities paper described in Dearborn's May 11, 19Gl 
memorandur.t. One draft recommended an expanded U.S. offer to 
deliver small explosive devices and ar@s. (Document indicating 
it was attached to "Dominican Republic -- Contingency,'' dated 
5/12/61 and bearing Nos. 306-308). The other draft is very 
similar except that it concludes that delivery of arr.is within 
the Dominican Republic to members of the underground is not 
recommended. (Docw,1ent from State Dept. files bearing No. 310). 
Attached to the second draft was a one-pase document which 
Frank Devine believes he wrote. 
points including the following: 
It listed eight numbered 
"1. The USG should not lend itself to ~hr~~ 
political assassination. 
~--------"2. US moral posture can ill afford further 
tarnishing in the eyes of t!1c world.
