MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Meeting of the Special Group 18 July 1963 
PRESENT: Mr. McGeorge Bundy 
Mr. John A. McCone 
Mr. Roswell Gilpatric 
Mr. U. Alexis Johnson 
Mr. Thomas A. Parrott 
Mr. Desmond FitzGerald 
1. The undersigned was present at this meeting 
only for the brief item on Caba which involved the 
final decision whether or not to postpone the iwo 
external sabotage operations pl.a.nned. for 26 July. 
Mr. Bundy referred to the fact that the Agency repre­
sentatives had previously stated that they would 
prefer, in terms of the morale of the case officers and 
agents, to have a decision to postpone made at the 
earliest possible moment rather than to have such a 
decision reached at the last ninute. Mr. Bundy stated 
that in light of this he felt it reasonably certain 
that Higher Authority would consider that negotiations 
in Moscow were proceeding in a sufficiently favorable 
manner to warrant a postponement decision at this time. 
Mr. Bundy said that if the undersigned did not hear 
from him during the course of the day Higher Authority's 
decision to postpone could be assumed. Mr. Bundy 
further said that it was only fair to warn that there 
might be a resumption of Moscow negotiations at a later 
date -- perhaps August -- and that these resumed nego­
tiations might in turn call for postponements. (Mr. Bundy 
did not call and the operations have been postponed until 
approximately the 15th of August.)
