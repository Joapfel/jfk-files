Iiedgman described the extraordinary security precautions he 
took cabling his request for confirmation of the assassination in­
structions: 
There was some special channel ... because 
it was handled differently than any other 
normal message. For example, it was not put 
on a regular cable form, which, you know, 
you have several copies for your various files. 
And it was my recollection that I personally 
carried the message to the connnunicator to 
encrypt, and that was worded in a doublt-talk 
way that even the communicator would not 
necessarily know what it was about." 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 42-43.) 
This description approximates the PROP channel that was used for 
all cables relating to the assassination mission. 
Hedgman testified that soon after cabling his request for con-
( firmation that he was to carry out the assassination assignment, 
~'5~;-" 
he received an affirmative reply from headquarters: 
I believe I received a reply which I interpreted 
to mean yes, that he was the messenger and his 
instructions were ... duly authorized. 
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 37-38.) 
Despite the cryptic nature of the cables, Hedgman said "I was con­
vinced that yes, it was right." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 44, 50.) 
Hedgman did not recall receiving any indication, either from 
• t-' (_ 
{io~~li.e'i;Jor by cable, that he was to await further authorization 
before using the poisons (lledgman, 8/21/75, p. 38). Hedgman ex­
pressed some uncertainty about whether he "had an absolute free 
hand" to proceed with an assassination attempt without receiving 
"final confirmation" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 38, 47, 53).
