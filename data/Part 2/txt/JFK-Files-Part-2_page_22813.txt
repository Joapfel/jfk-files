On the question of th~ Exedtitive Action capability, I 
believe referred to as the ZRRIFLE project --
Mr. Bundy. Imust say that if I had known that was its 
name I would have looked_ harder, Senator Baker. 
Senator Baker. It is a fairly picturesque name -- as 
to Executive Action Capability, or ZRRIFLE, do you have a 
separate recollection? 
Mr. Bundy. I have a recollection of what I think of 
is one, I don't want to say there wasn't more, but of 
one discussion of the matter. And I know I was informed of 
it in some fashion at the time. 
Senator Baker. Do you remember by whom? 
Mr. Bundy. That is my difficulty, as I said earlier, 
I don't know. 
Senator Baker. The reason I ask is, from the other 
documentation I have, which corisists primarily of the 
Inspector General of the CIA's report, and maybe other 
material that I can't think of at the moment, it is clear 
and unmistakeable that they think of RZRIFLE or Executive Ac­
tion Capability as a White House initiative, or a W~ite House 
request of considerable insistence from the White !louse that 
they get on with the job. 
Mr. Bundy. That is totally inconsistent with my un­
reconstructen recollection. 
Senator Baker. Let me track that carefully.
