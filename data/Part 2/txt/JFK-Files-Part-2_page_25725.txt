• . To carry out the· assassination, the CIA 
. selected an underworld figure who could be

identified in confidential FBI files as "a top 
Mafia figure" who watched over "the con7 
cealed interests in Las Vegas casinos of the 
Chicago underworld." . 
Roselli represented himself as an oil man 
s.eeking revenge against Castro for his sei-
1Ure of oil holdings. 
For the first try, the CIA furnished Ro-
selli with special poison capsules to slip 
' into Castro's food. The poison was supposed 
• to take three days to act. By the time Cas­
, tro died., his system would throw off all 
• traces of the poison, so he would appear to 
: be the victim of a natural if mysterious ail-
ment. . 
Roselli arranged with a Cuban, related to 
one of Castro's chefs, to plant the deadly •

Sources familiar with the CIA conspiracy 
can't shake a nagging suspicion-unsup-

-that Castro may have become aware of 
the U.S. plot upon ru.s life and, therefore,
