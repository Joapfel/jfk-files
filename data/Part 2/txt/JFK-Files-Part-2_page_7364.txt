Dear Mr. -Staats:

My attention has been dh-ected to a letter from Mr. Keller,. General 
Accounting Office,. to the Honorable-William Proxmire dated May 10,. 1974.

-· • Inasmuch as Mr. Keller _has treated a suoject basic to this Agency's - : 
capability to carry out work mandated by Congress., I.believe it would serve· 
a use!'4 purpos~ to _review some of the background concerning the use of 
·confid~~ funds a.:nd their relationship to the audit of CIA over the years·. . . . : . .. 
. . . 
________ .. .... ... Mr. Keller notes in.his lette;-1hat there are ua fairly substantial number 
of ins~ances where e..~enditures are accounted for solely upon a certification . • 
_ by the head of the department or establishment involved." The need is ·clear 
in the case of this Agency.. The necessity to safeguard certain truly vital 
foreign intelligence secrets has been recognized by the Congt-ess in its . 
. . . direction to the Director of Central Intelligence·•ti protect intelligence sources • 
_ and methQds from unauthorized disclosure .• This responsibility was complemented 
by authorizing cert~ e..'"'J)_enditµres nfor objects of a confidential,. extraordinary, 
or emer~ency nature,. 11 to be accounted for solely on the certificate of the Director 
of Ceritral Intelligence. Such expenditures -Would apply., for example~ to a 
se_cret: ag~t- operating· abroad" ~-·a hostile climate whose identity must be p-i:-o-• 
-tected not- only so that he can continue_ supplying the intelligence involved,. but 
• also because his.freedom'."-and~on ocva"¥Pn his life--weighs in the balance.·._

_ . -·othei· intelligence activities do not haye such obvioµs security require-
• ments,. but are. nonetheless, within the sou~ces and methods concept. Liaison 
with foreign intelligence and security agencies is extremely important in fields of 
both positive intelligence and counterintelligence. Such liaisons to be effective 
.. depend on the confidence of each service that the other will protect not only the 
mere fact of the relationships,. but also its· sources and methods and sensitive 
info1·mation·. _Compromise of any of these brings not only protests from the foreign 
liaison scrvice, but in some cases a lessening or even cessation oj its cooperation.
