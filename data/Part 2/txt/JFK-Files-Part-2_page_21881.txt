5. The Question of a Connection Between the Assassination 
Plot and Other Actions of CIA Officers and Operatives 
rn the Congo 
~ustin O'Donne1, a senior CIA officer in the clandestine 
operations division in 1960, testified that during this period he 
had been asked by DDP Richard Bissell to go to the Congo to carry 
out the assassination of Lumumba ~'Donnel.~, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12). 
(o'Donnell)said that he refused to participate in an assassination 
\ 
operation, but proceeded to the Congo to attempt to draw Lumumba 
away from the protective custody of the UN guard and place him in 
the hands of Congolese authorities {?

Donne19, 6/9/75, pp. 13-14). 
Shortly after(o'Donnel~'s arrival in the Congo he was 
joined by a CIA agent with a criminal background who was used the 
following year by the CIA as part of a program to develop a stand~by 
(__ assassination capability. Late in 1960, one of the operatives of 
the (chief of/Station in Leopoldville approached this agent of 
(o 'Do~nell} s with a proposition to join an "execution squad" (CIA 
Cable ~N 1873,;V, Leopoldville to Director, 12/7/60). 
Despite the fact that 0•Donnel~was initially approached 
to be part of the plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, it is un­
likely that ~'Donnel~ was actually involved in the implementation 
of that plot by the0hief of)station. Whether there is any connec­
tion between the assassination plot and either of the two operatives 
QJWIN and WIROGUE -- is less clear.
