(iii) White House Officials Denied Knowledge of Assassination 
Efforts and Gave the Opinion that President Eisenhower Was Not Informed. 
1. Gordon Gray. Gordon Gray served as President Eisenhower's 
Special Assistant for National Security Affairs from July 1958 to the 
end of the Eisenhower Administration on January 20, 1961. (Gray, p. 4.) 
In this capacity, Gray served as the President's representative on the 
Special Group. (Gray, p. 4.) President Eisenhower specifically instructed 
Gray that all covert actions impinging on the' sovereignty of another 
country must be deliberated by the Special Group. (Gray, p. 6.) Gray 
-testified that during the.period July 1958 to January 20, 1961, the 
Special Group never approved an action to assassinate Castro (Gray, p. 6) 
and no such suggestion was made by Bissell. (Gray, p. 37.) 
Gray testified he did not believe Allen Dulles would have 
approached President Eisenhower without informing Gray. Gray stated: 
"I find it very difficult to believe, and I do not believe, that 
Mr. Dulles would have gone independently to him with such a 
proposal without, for that matter, my knowing about it from Mr. 
Dulles. •i (Gray, p. 35. )* 
* Gray pointed out "that I was not with President Eisenhower twenty­
four hours a day. It was a few.minutes every day, practically every day." 
( Gray , p . 3 5 . ) 
According to the records of the Eisenhower Library, Dulles was alone 
with President Eisenhower on one occasion in the Fall of 1960. That 
meeting lasted ten minutes on November 25, 1960. The record of the 
previous portion of the meeting attended by Gray indicates only that, in 
addition to discussion of operations in another country, "there was also 
some discussion of Cuba". (Memorandum, November 28, 1960, by Gordon Gray, 
of- Meeting with the President, November 25., 1960 at 10: 40 A .M. ) • We feeJ 
compelled to state that the fact of 'this brief meeting, on the evidence 
available, is of little, if any, significance or relevance.
