No Foreign Dissem 
missile submarines and the re­
assignment of their crews to 
new Y-class units have probably 
been at least partly responsible 
for the decline in ballistic­
missile submarine activity. In 
addition, the loss of a G-class 
submarine in the Pacific in mid­
March apparently resulted in a 
three-month standdown in patrols 
by these units. That incident 
probably caused the Soviets to 
implement new safety measures. 
Moreover, as the Soviets prepare­
to deploy new Y-class submarines, 
they may be reassessing the 
military value of sending their 
diesel-powered units into the 
mid-Atlantic and ~id~Pacific 
patrol areas. 
Until mid-1967, E-class 
cruise-missile submarines con­
ducted regular patrols in the 
Atlantic. Since June 1967, 
patrol activity in the Atlantic 
has ditninished; however, a 
series of single E-class units 
has been almost continuously 
present in the Mediterranean. 
Some of the submarines on re-
cent patrols have also engaged 
in other activities such as 
hydroacoustic research and 
support of naval training ma­
neuvers. J-class diesel-powered 
cruise-missile submarines ap­
parently have-been used primarily 
for peripheral defense. In 
late 1966, the first of these 
units to venture into the 
Mediterranean broke down and 
limped back to its base in the 
Northern Fleet. Some of the 
older W-class units are equipped 
to launch cruise missiles, but 
these, too, operate only near 
Soviet shores and probably are 
being retired from service. 
Recent patrols by diesel 
attack submarines in the Medi­
terranean have been extended 
to as long as six months through 
the use of Arab and Yugoslav 
ports for upkeep, reprovision­
ing, and crew recreation. Pre­
vious patrols by Soviet sub­
marines in the Mediterranean 
had lasted less than two months. 
Last year, a submarine 
support group operated for nearly 
six months off the west coast 
of Africa in a program to study 
the feasibility· of submarine 
operations from a floating base. 
The group consisted of a sub­
marine tender and a missile 
supply ship, and was assisted 
briefly by a survey vessel and 
two intelligence collection 
ships. Several other ships 
provided logistic support. Four 
submarines participated in the 
group's operations. One of 
these--a nuclear-powered unit-­
was away from home waters for 
more than six months. 
Once the new ballistic-mis­
sile submarines go on patrol, 
the Soviets may make greater 
use of such floating support bases 
on the high seas. Floating base 
ships would be vulnerable in
