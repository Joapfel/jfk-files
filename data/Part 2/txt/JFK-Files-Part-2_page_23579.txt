TOP SECRET 
EYES ONLY FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
- 2 -
One of _Bob Amoryrs brightest young men should be assigned to intelligence 
collection and evaluation. 
As for propaganda, I thought we might ask Tad Szulc to take a leave of absence 
from the Times and work on this one -- although we should check with Ed 
Murrow and Dick Bis sell. 
These people should have a headquarters. It should probably be at the Pentagon 
because (a) we might get better securit/; (b) MacNamar°'. will be easier to work• 
with in terms of getting whatever staff services, secretarial personnel, etc; 
(c} It is a relatively neutral place betwe.,en State and CIA; (d) you could re-· 
arrange your schedule to stop in on the .way to Justice every morning 
perhaps for a breakfast or post-breakfast meeting.

This operation should not be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. Initially only' 
George Ball (and Rusk, of course), MacNamara, McCone and Bissell should 
know of your participation. When they ,are named, the five section heads 
will have to know -- • the initial organizing work and contact work should 
be done through ·.your Deputy and myself. If this subJe·ct is discussed tomorrow 
then already too many people will knov.,; about it. 
• The first steps are (a} name the section chiefs {b) review with them all current 
operations in their field, establish their authority over operations, get nec­
essary staff assistance (on as small as possible basis), and start them to 
work; (c} establish the physical headquarters; (d) arrange for financing -- -
presumably coming largely from CIA.-
If this meets with your approval I will begin work on the above items with all 
final decisions on personnel and othez:, matters subject, of course, to your 
approval. •
