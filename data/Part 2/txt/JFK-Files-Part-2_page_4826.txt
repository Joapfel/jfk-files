MR. HALPERN: Do you want me to comment?

comment thought that there should have been a hell of a lot 
more. I think he was living in a dream world; He didn't 
realize how much he was getting from 8111. As I said before, I 
would have preferred if the Congressmen really had to dig and.

not pushi•ng things forward ·and not rushing things. And maybe 
he succeeded in holding back some stuff or at least delaying 
production of some stuff. But I can imagine Colby totally
