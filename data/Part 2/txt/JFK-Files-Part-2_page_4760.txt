of a circus atmosphere there was. If it were a simple 
executive session kind of look-see and the Senators or the 
Representatives involved were not running for President -- some. 
of them like Church did, and others -- depends on a whole 
atmosphere. It's hard to say. I think, and if our own 
President hadn't been assassinated, with or without attribution 
to Cuba or Oswald or KGB or God knows what else. If it were 
just simply an operation gone bad and Congress was looking into 
it, I just doubt in the '60's, the early '60's I'm talking 
about '60-'65, whether there would have been quite as much 
brouhaha about the whole thing. People wouldn't have liked it 
when you talk ~bout assassination, obviously, but remember when 
it took place in '75, ten years later, you've got to remember 
there is a whol-e Watergate, ten years worth of Vietnam, and a 
couple of years worth of Watergate involved. The Vietnam thing 
worst of all changed the attitudes completely. Because we only 
went in with Marines in '65. Sure we were in Vietnam long 
before that; we've been there ever since '54, for God's sake, 
but actually before that, from '45 on until the end of the 
war. But I think it would have been a totally different 
atmosphere. You know, conjecture. 
INTERVIEWER: Sure, yeah. 
MR. HALPERN: A "What if ... " kind of thing. 
INTERVIEWER: But I think your point about the assassination of 
Kennendy is . 
MR. HALPERN: Made a big difference.
