The "Executive Action" Capability 
Along with the question of authorizat{on for actual assas­
sination attempts, the Committee considered the extent and nature 
of authbrization for a CIA project which included, as one element, 
the development of an assassination capability. 
(a) Introduction 
Sometime in early 1961, Richard Bissell (Deputy Director 
of Plans) instructed William Harvey, who was at that time the 
Chief of one of CIA's Foreign Intelligence staffs, to establish 
an "executive action capability" which included research into a 
capability io assassinate foreign leaders. (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 51; 
Harvey 6/15/75, pp. 36-37.) At some time within the same period,. 
Bissell and McGeorge Bundy (Special Assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs) had a conversation about the matter. 
Bissell, Harvey and Helms all.agreed that the "generalized" 
capability was never used'' (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 87; Harvey 6/25/75; 
p. 45; Helms 6/13/75, p. 52). /' /\,vi(. CAA!ill) 
"Executive action" is a CIA euphemism, defined by the 
testimony before the Committee as a project for research into 
developing means for overthrowing foreign political leaders, .includ-
ing a "capability t.o perform assassinations". (Harvey 6/25/75, 
ri. 3t:: .. ) Bissell indicated that executive action covered a "wide 
spectrum of actions" to "eliminate the effectiveness" of foreign 
le d • with assassination as the "most ex.treme". action on the a.ers, 
spectrum (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 32). The Inspecto! General's Report.
