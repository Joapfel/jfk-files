Dear Bob: 
3331 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2 
WASHINGTON, 0,C, 20515 
October 16, 1978 
As you probably know, because the Committee is winding down, the 
decision has been made to terminate L. J.'s services as of October 31. 
I'm sure that you are .wondering how you stand salary-wise with the 
Committee because of the duplicate salary payments from the New Orleans 
Police Department. 
The following are my calculations of how you stand. 
You were hired August 15, 1977 at an annual salary of $24,000.00 
and taken off the payroll February 28, 1978. Your W-2 statement for 
1977 gave a salary of $16,637.46 from the New Orleans Police Department. 
The monthly amount would be $1,386.46 ($16,637.46 + 12). Prorating this 
amount would give $9,058.21.while on the payroll of the Committee ($1,386.46 
per month_ for the period August 15, 1977 to February.28, 1978). 
You have been due $613.54 per month from the Committee since March 1, 
1978 (the difference between your Committee salary of $2,000.00 per month 
and $1,386.46). Dividing $613.54 into $9,058.21 (the overpayment referred 
to above) would carry you almost 15 months or until June 1, 1979. 
According to the affidavit from your payroll supervisor, your base pay 
during the period you have been with the Committee is $1,273.00 per month. 
If we use this lower figure instead of the $1,386.46 which I got by divid­
ing the amount on your W-2 by 12 and I went through the same calculations 
as above, the overpayment would carry you about 11½ months or until Feb­
ruary 15, 1979. 
Either way, the duplicate payment by the New Orleans Police Depart­
ment for the period August 15, 1977 to February 28, 1978 is more than 
enough to carry you through December.31, 1978 without any further payments 
from the Committee. 
\ 
Please give me a call if you have any questions or dispute any of my 
figures. 
TH:ht 
Sincerely yours, 
c>;:Jtli1 •
