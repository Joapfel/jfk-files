MEMORI\NDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
Subject: Cuban Actions (U) 
1. On 21 March 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in respond­
ing to a Presidential request for new ideas relative to Cuba, 
stated that the President would be advised of any new and 
promising courses of action which could possibly bring 
pressure upon the Castro regime. 
2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have completed a reviei:1 of a 
study which examines. world sugar economics and th•2 vulner­
abilities of Cuba 1 s sugar industry. The study proposes an 
outline program which would undermine Castro I s ec:momy, 
deprive him of convertible currency, and cause political 
instability in Cuba through covert attacks against Cuba
1
s 
sugar industry coupled 1'1ith US s-c;abilization actions on th'e 
world sugar market. Basically, the proposal envisions a 
three- to six-year program, beginning with a_ 30 per cent 
reduction of anticipated 1966 Cuban sugar production, by 
introducing aerially from off-shore, a sugar cane plant 
parasite, Bunga. _· Subsequently, the economic and political 
disturbances caused by this attack could be exacerbated and 
exploited by such measures as spreading hoof-and-mouth disease 
among draft animaJ.s, controlling rainfall by cloud seeding, 
mining canefields, burning cane, and directing other acts 
of conventional sabotage against the cane milling and 
transportation systems.
