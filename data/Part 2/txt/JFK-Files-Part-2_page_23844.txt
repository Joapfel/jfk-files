Tt.)P SECRET 66. 
The second issue is we have proposed that covert actions 
be funded either by line item or by the contingency reserve. 
The third thing we proposed is that the contingency reserve· 
be replenished, if I am correct, orily by appropriation, concur­
rence of the oversight Committee. 
Now, what this in· effect does, I think the question that ·,, • 
he's driving at is, what do you do with the profits of a. 
proprietary organization? Can you put it in the contingency 
reserve?. 
·If so, our other recommendation would pick up the notion 
that it can only be done with the concurrence of the Committee. 
Is there some other purpose, direct transfer? Well, 
presumably one of _the limitations on reprogramming -- and this 
would be a fair point.to.make here, as part of its definition 
of limitations on rep:togrammihg, it is recommended that the 
oversight committee proscribe the ailocation of profits from 
any proprietary to a covert operation without their express 
consent. And this is really kind of -- if it do~sn't go,throug 
the contingency reserve, it really goes to the question of 
reprogrammi~g. 
21 No~,. I realize that we have said ,that our other recommen-
22 dation by implication would prohibit this, but it is only by 
23 implication, I would think.
