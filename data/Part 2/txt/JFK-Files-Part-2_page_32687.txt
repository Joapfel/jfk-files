Island by the Soviet air defense and missile system, and the island-Wide 
evidence of impressive, powerful, armored Russian troop units, all apparently 
immune from attack, has been and Will be an increasing psychological damper 
to the fires of revolt. We can only expect, under present circumstances, 
that whatever capacity and will to resist communism may exist among the peo­
ple in Cuba, will wither and shrink. The communization of the younger ele­
ment creates simultaneously an increasingly militant communist nation. 
The withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Cuba would remove a primary 
psychological prop of Castroism, and remove what is presently being used as 
a physical shield against any overt effort to keep alive the fires of free­
dom in Cuba. As mentioned before, the ability of Castro's native Cuban forces 
standing alone, to withstand any insurrection, depends upon the support the 
Cuban people give to the insurgents, and the effective outside help given to 
insurgent forces.
