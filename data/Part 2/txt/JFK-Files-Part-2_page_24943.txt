COS GOES TO CONGO AND RECEIVES MESSENGER FROM HEADQUARTERS 
COS said that he arrived in the Congo.as Chief of Station in 
early July (probably the 10th or 11th) 1960. COS said that before 
he left Headquarters for the Congo he did not talk with either 
Richard Bissell (DDP) or Bronson Tweedy (Chief, Africa Division) 
about the prospect of assassinating Patrice Lum.um.ha. Soon after 
arriving in the Congo, COS was asked to return to Headquarters in 
late July for briefings. He said there was no talk of assassination 
at those meetings, either.
