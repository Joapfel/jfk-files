be typewritten, but since I stole this tape recorder, I guess 
_it's just as appropriate as a letter. 
Clarence Kelley, Director of th~ FBI, 
~ 
Washington, .Q..·c. 
·near Mr. KeJ,.ley: 
I had always praised the thoroughness of the FBI, 
even though on scores of occasions you've permitted your 
paranoia and your lack of human understanding could foul.you 
up. Your drooling excitement and your paranoic stupidity and 
your fruitless eagerness at having Frank Drager in your grimy 
grubs in Springfield, Illinois, make super idiots of the 
Federal B~reau of Integration. You now realize how many 
foolish errors you ~made. In the near future you ,,;rill be em­
ployed by the new natural government of fu11erica rather than 
the Jew Justice Department and sue~ s::.ipidity will not be 
tolerated. How ridiculous for a gang of trained investigators 
to be fooled and beaten by a teenager. B~ve you idiots put 
all the pieces together yet? \-fnether or ~1ot you have, ·we both 
thank God for yo\1r parat""loid stupidity for now we are free to 
continue tying together the few remaining loose ends which 
will permit the National Revolutionary Army to eliminate 
criminal Jewish control of A~erica. Now our armies can con-
•tinue to join forces to eliminate this alien enemy government. 
Continue your search for Frank Drager and Bill Carroll. It'll 
be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to capture 
one of our soldiers in the future, beware, th~re's a speeding 
.soft-nose for all of our enemies. Unfortunately, niost fellow 
Agents are mercenaries. They are actually with ·us ·in spirit 
but they will still follow fhe orders of their Jewish superiors 
to attempt to detect and capture our people and unfortunately 
we will have to deal with these Agents ruthlessly until they 
realize that they are dominated and controlled by alien enei!lies 
of A"11erica and begin working on the side of -right. At one 
time not too long ago we patrfots were as useless~ a bunch.
