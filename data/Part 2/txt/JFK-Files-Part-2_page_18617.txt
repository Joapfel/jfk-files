Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources 
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by 
teletype. 
In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau, 
your attention is directed to over- all need for additional informants and 
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained 
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved 
in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program over the past several years. :.-~ \:..•~, 
In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each 
office should survey its informant coverage in• this field. If substantial 
numbers_ of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the 
territo'ry covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage 
sufficient to aiert you to exiie organizaLional activities uf polltk~l li.ati:i.'.i"'G, 
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data 
.'.~·:. concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field 
'·:··is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be 
overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development 
program. 
Very truly yours, 
John Edgar Hoover 
Director
