SUBJECT: Dome.ic Tests for Agency Rcs·-~ch and 
Dev.pment Efforts • 
e. Remote Physiological Neasuremen·ts -
An ORD-developca crrogcnic magnetoncter is 
being tested at a contractor's site for use 
as a remote cardiograph (magnetocardiograph). 
Some test subjects arc witting, but mo~t tests 
are on naive subjects (they do not know th~y 
are being tested). The magnetometer is com­
pletely harmless to the subject and the test 
results are closely h~ld .• • ' 
f. Personalitv- Structure of Defectors 
§ttidr_- ORD unde~tbqk to determine ~he per­
sonality structure of defectors during the 
period 1966-&9. The work primarily involved

with. a stµdy of the phenombnon of defection 
itself, i.e., leaving one religion for another, 
or changing one set of political beliefs for

intelligence collecting packages such as audio 
$Urveillance devices, small cameras, and cur­
rent measuring devices. Any data collected 
from unwitting domestic sources would have been 
used only for cngine6ring purposes ~nd then 
destroyed. 
h. Corar.nmica tions Link Loading Study - In _ 
the-perioa£r0ii1 1970 through 1972 various means' 
were used. to dheck out an intercept system designed 
to opt:3rat_e against Id~n 93 communications links. 
Under carefully controlled conditions, some U.S. 
microwave coraaunication5 were recorded and passed 
through the intercept system under test to prove 
quality of ·performance. All intercept material . 
connected with this ~as destroyed within a few weeks 
of the time of intercept and the material was never 
checked for substantive content. NSA participated 
and controlled most clemerit~ of the U. S, material~~-
