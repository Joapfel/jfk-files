Domestic Intelligence Division 
' (6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the 
Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,. 
as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing 
logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary 
security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate 
decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is th_at the Supreme 
Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus, 
historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling it is a far better 
course of action to attempt to imple~ent those programs necessary for our 
national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so 
so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to 
carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.
