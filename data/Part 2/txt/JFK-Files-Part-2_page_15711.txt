the kind of ·consequence. that rates attention. and action. Yhe second·· 
.way of qaininq power is economic: ownershin-of the businesses .. In,· 
America the slaves were freed with the oromise, by the Freedmen's· . 
Bureau, of .forty acres and two mules. Had this nromise been fulfilled,· 
the black man would have had land 9owe·r and the.ability to·inflict a, • 
. a consequence.· The ptomise, of cburse, was never fulfilled; 
Hhat about businesses? The businesses in the black community ·are 
• owned by the white man.· Thus, even ·the economi-c boycott is di ffi cult 
because there are not sufficient black-ownnd businesses to serve as 
an~ alternative ~enter for nurchasinq basic needed qoods. • . •·

office does not nose a realistic solution. It is true that members, ' . •
