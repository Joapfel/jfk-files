H. Relations with Tax, Regulatory, and Other Agencies 
Management and control of proprietaries· often requires 11cooperative 
interface" with outsid~ agencies to gain beneficial working relation­
ships and, as necessa3:y, any appropriate authorizations. These 
relationships are described below. 
For those proprietaries which maintain commercial books and other 
financial records. U.S. and State tax returns are prepared annually by 
commercial managers based on the corporation:~s financial records. For 
other entities where only internal Agency records are maintained, tax 
returns are prepared by Agency specialists in a manner to reflect the 
nonnal operations of a bona fide commercial business. Close coordination 
is maintained with the Internal Revenue Service, which is aware of the 
Agency's use of proprietary commercial entities. In the event an Agency 
entity is singled out for IRS audit, it has been agreed ·that the Agency. 
through the Office of General Counsel, will not_ify IRS of Agency 
ownership. The IRS then cancels the audit in order to conserve auditor 
.manpower. 
The Air proprietaries necessitated contact with the Civil Aeronautics 
Board. the Federal Aviation Agency and the National Transportation 
Safety Board: Specific problems were discussed, usually with the 
Office of General Counsel of the agency concerned by the CIA General 
Counsel. 
The Air Proprietaries dealt with State Department and the Agency 
for International Development. generally on a contractor/customer basis, 
although senior personnel of those agencies were advised by the Agency 
of its ownership of the companies.
