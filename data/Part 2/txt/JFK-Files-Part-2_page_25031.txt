T P SECRET 
notified by Mr. Merchant or Gordon Gray about what transpired 
at a Special Group meeting? 
Mr. Dillon. Not by Gordon Gray.· That wasn't his job. 
But it would be by Mr. Merchant if it was considered to be 
something that was of enough importance that it might be 
something that I would h~ve to act on or know about in my 
capacity as Acting Secretary of State, whenever that arose. 
Mr. Baron. 1'J'ere you aware that the US was supplying 
financial support or other kinds of support to "Moderate" 
polititions within the Congo who would be opponents of Lumumba 
Mr. Dillon. Not in detail, but certainly the general 
fact that we would be doing that, yes. 
Mr. Baron. Let me show you now minutes from a Special 
Group meeting of 25 August 1960. Which we will ma~ke Exhibit 
3 . 
(The above referred to document 
was marked Exhibit No. 3 for 
identification.)
