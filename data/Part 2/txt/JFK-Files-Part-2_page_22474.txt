W,fa\mWll$,lf}!;!fa~ All Cuban ac ti vi ties have been r.oved back 
and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean. 
Q Doespjfe/'l'{.i;;~mi·;.'5ita·,t:,i.:g'f:1]-- I beg your pardon --
' 
does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban 
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community? 
A No. Well, let ne explain that to you. We do have 
a career agent who has been with us for a good many years 
in r-1iami and we do use hi!!I to contact relatives of Cubans 
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S . 
who have relatives in Cuba. 
Now, this is done principally with the idea of a 
recruit!!lent target, determine weaknesses or strengths, 
type of thing. He does contact these people all over th~ 
t:-. is 
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like 
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin, 
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we 
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we 
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact 
these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or ~hat-
ever. 
Q So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens 1n this 
country, as access agents .
