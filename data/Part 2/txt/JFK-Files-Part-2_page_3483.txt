of DOD in doing this. He. said he would like the support of the President's 
Board and their thoughts on the terms of reference and the membership, 
including whether they thought some members of the Board might sit on the 
committee or whether this would present a conflict of interest, as the Board 
had apparently felt in a previous matter;J 
Dr. Killian asked if this panel was supposed to look at the future poten­
tiality of satellite photography, and Mr. McCone then read to the Board the 
terms of reference in his memorandum. He noted that he thought this panel 
should be constituted at this time because there were serious doubts in the 
U.S. Government about flying an aircraft over the USSR. Mr. Clifford 
asked if the panel would deal with.politics, and Mr. McCone replied, "No. 11 
Dr. Land asked what the relations of the panel would be with NRO and 
Mr. McCone replied that NRO would support the panel. Gen. Doolittle noted 
that the Air Force had a committee on satellite survivability, and 
Mr. McCone said that he knew this, but felt that that committee was not full 
out and not devoting the effort that the seriousness of the problem warranted. 
Gen. Doolittle replied that he was a member of that committee and he 
thought they were giving the problem verr serious consideration. Mr. McCone 
said he thought the problem involved a vast amount of work and he was 
concerned because all of the views were not being pulled together. He noted 
that what was necessary was to get an authoritative expression .as to what 
resolution wa·s required down to the nearest inch in order to determine the 
engineering of missiles/ 
Mr. Land asked what Dr. Purcell had said, and commented that he 
thought such a panel would be all right if it was composed of four or five 
who knew what they were talking about. Mr. McCone replied that he was 
not sure he had been able to get Purcell, and that he might have to ask 
Dr. Land to persuade Purcell; Dr. Land replied that he might be able to do it.
