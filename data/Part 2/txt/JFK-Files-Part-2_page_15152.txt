DOMINICAN SITUATION 
I 
The FBI was ordered· into the Dominican Republic by 
the President in May, 1965, ,to develop information to be 
used in preventing communists from gaining control in that 
country. At the height of·the Dominican Revolution, we had 
a staff of 14 Agents. -· In Augu~t, 1966, at White House 
instructions, we established a permanent Legal Attache office 
there staffed with three Agents._ 
Since his inaugurati6n July 1, 1966, Dominican 
President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of 
stability, however, there continues to be str_ong undercurrents· 
of dissension .. The rightists .reportedly have considered 
plots to remove Balaguer. Juan Bosch's political party, the 
loser in the June, 1966, election, has been most vocal in 
its opposition to Balaguer's programs and only recently 
published a document which appears intended to set the 
stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer. 
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension 
but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup 
as they have in the past. They possibly would be willing 
to let Bosch's political party provide the overt leadership.
