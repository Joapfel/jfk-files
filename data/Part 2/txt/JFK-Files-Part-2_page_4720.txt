show you how we felt, me and my buddies, these three other military guys, when 
the Colonel arrived -- I was the only civilian and these guys were all 
maj_ors. They were. you know. "There's .a colonel coming. 
11 
So I was the guy 
• chosen to, and I volunteered too. Okay. we meet th_i s guy and we bring him 
in. And I said, "Colonel, here's the war room, there are the maps, there are 
the order of battle cards. All the information is cross-indexed, so if you 
look at the cards you can find it on th_e map, if you look at th~ map, you'll 
• find it on the cards. We' 11 just leave you here. See where we went wrong.

We went off and got drunk. And I mean drunk. It was a bad one. But anyway, 
we said, "The hell with this nonsense." I got my military buddies out of the. 
range of fire. And the four of us went off. We came back, I think it was the 
next day, but anyway, when we came back the Colonel said something to the 
effect of, "I wouldn't have believed it.
11 
And I said, "We didn't make lt up. 
It's all there. You had it all in Honolulu. Everybody _in Washington has had 
the same information. We didn't make up any new stuff. It's the same stuff 
ev&rybody is using. He just added it up.and you guys didn't. That's all. 
Everybody was using pieces, using the magic figure it appeared was made up 
some years ago. Tinies have changed. The enemy has doubled its strength right 
under our very noses.

That was my one nice big session with Bill Colby. 
That's what we started out on. And so that's when we finally sent the 
messages out after this Colonel was here, then we sent the mess-ages which had 
that 18,000. It was a long total, but anyway. And Bill and I have been on a 
fighting relationship ever since, I think. I never mentioned it to him and he 
never mentioned it to.me again. It was done and that was it. Then I left. 
INTERVIEWER: You left?
