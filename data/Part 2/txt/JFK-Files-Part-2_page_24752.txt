ZR/RIFLE. Harvey testified that QJ/WIN' s function af_ter the. advent 
of Project ZR/RIFLE in 19 61 was restricted to the "spot ting'' of. 
potential assets for 
11
multi-purpose
11 
covert use. 
However, in the Fall of 1960--before Harvey was 
assigned to create Project ZR/RIFLE by Richard Bissell--agent 
QJ/WIN had been dispatched to the Congo by Arnold Silver, his 
---­supervising CIA case officer in Europe. William Harvey, as the 
Chief of the CIA Fcireign Intelligence staff on which Silver worked, 
had ordered QJ/WIN's mission to the Congo (CIA Dispatch AUDW-147, 
11/2/60) and arranged the financial accounting for the mission 
afterward (Memorandum to Finance Diyision from William K. Harvey,_ 
1/11/61). • [QJ/WIN's activities in the Congo are treated in detail 
in the discussion of the Lumumba case; see Section , supra.] 
There are two factors which may raise a question as 
to whether QJ/WIN was being used in an ad hoc capacity to develop; 
an assassination capability before ZR/RIFLE was formally initiated. 
First, there is a similarity in the cast of characters: Harvey, 
QJ/WIN, Silver, and Gottlieb were connected with the Lumumba matter 
and reappear in connection with the subsequent development of 
ZR/RIFLE. Second, Bissell informed Harvey that the deve1opment of 
an assassination capability had already been discussed with Silver 
and Gottlieb before Harv~y's assignment to ZR/RIFLE (Harvey, 6/25/75, 
p. 52; I.G. Report, pp. 37-38). 
,Nevertheless, there does not appear to be anf firm 
evidence of a connection between QJ/WIN and the plot to assassinate 
Lumumba.
