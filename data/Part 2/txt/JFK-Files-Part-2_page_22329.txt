In al~, Mr. Brewer believes he was involved in more than ten technical opera­
tions~ but less than 100 prior to 1968. In all cases he was merely supplying 
technical support for operations at the request of his superiors, and was not 
witting to the actual operation. In each case he assumed the propriety and 
la1,fu1ness of the ope-ration. 
Since 1966, i'-lr. Brewe1· has been engaged in only one technical operation 
(Operation PARAGON--threat against Director Helms and Vice President Ag'1.ic:w). 
\ilien that threat was made, Brewer suggested that a line be run into the in­
forming agent's apartr,1ent. Such a line was run from that agent's telephone 
(a telephone tap). This operation was approved by higher authority. 
Surveillance 
Surveillance was conducted off and on through the period from 1960 to 1973. 
Ho1vever, active survej llance did not begin until !968 when the 11Surveillance 
and Technical Uni t 11 w2-.s formed. Prior to 1968, surveillance 1•:as restricted 
to training exercises and surveillance of defectors. Mr. Brewer estimated 
that he engaged in about ten such operations prior to 1968. Training sur­
veill1nce continued after 1968, but only one surveillance of a defector was 
made ~uring that time. 
In 1966 Headquarters requested that the \'/ashington Field Headquarters form .:1 
sophisticated surveillance unit. S11ch a unit was not really created until 
Brewer took over the "Surveillance and Technical Unit" in 1968. After 1968 
surveillance took up ,; large part of the tiiile of the "Surveillance a;id Techni­
cal Unit's" time. Th(, Unit consisted of 14 support agents and 1.;as expanded 
to 20:...24 men during some surveillances. The l\'ashington Field Office did 
surveillance for the entire country with regard to Security Office matters. 
If a surveillance ,vas conducted anywhere in the country, Brc,,;er believes he 
would know of it. If surveillance was conducted in the territory of another 
field; office, that field office would have been in charge, with the l'lashington 
Offic.e providing the support. The following surveillance 1•;as undertaken by 
Brewer's Unit:
