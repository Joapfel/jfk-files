Mr. Halley. I am aware of the fact of this project that 
Artime was involved in that he got a number of weapons, any 
number of which could have.been used for sniper type activities. 
I am aware of the fact that he had a base in Nicaragua to 
·have,activities, so I would find it hard to sinqle out a weapon. 
My recollection of that that he was given a large number of 
weapons. 
Mr. Baron. Was one o1 Artime's objectives to have been 
to assassinate Fidel Castro? 
ttr. Halley. Not that. I am_ aware of.
