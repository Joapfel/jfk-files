said he discussed the general Cuban situation with the President many times 
·, 
J (Smathers, p. 6). Smathers had many Cuban constituents, was familiar with 
Latin American affairs, and was a long-time friend of the President (Smathers, 
p. 6). 
Smathers had the "impression" that the President raised the subject of 
assassination with him because someone "had apparently discussed th:is and 
other possibilities with respect to Cuba" with the President (Smathers, pp. 
16, 25). Smathers had no direct knowledge of any such discussion, nor did he 
know who might have been involved (Smathers, pp. 18-19, 25). The President 
did not indicate _directly that assassination had been proposed to him (Smathers, 
p. 18). 
According to Smathers: 
" ... [President Kennedy] asked me what reaction 
I thought there would be throughout South 
America were Fidel.Castro to be assassinated ... 
I told the· President that even as much as I dis­
liked Fidel Castro that I did not think it would 
be a good idea for there to be even considered 
an assassination of Fidel Castro, and the Pres­
ident of the United States completely agreed with 
me, that it would be a very unwise thing to do, 
the reason obviously being that no matter who did 
it and no matter how it was done and no matter 
what, that the United States would receive full 
credit for it, and the President receive full 
credit for it, and it would work to his great 
disadvantage with all of the other countries in 
Central and South America ... ! disapproved of it, 
and he completely disapproved of the idea." 
(Smathers, p. 22). • 
Smathers further testified that he had said the reason it would work to "great 
disadvantage" with the nations of Central and South America was because they would 
blam~ the United States for any assassination of Castro (Smathers, p. 6).
