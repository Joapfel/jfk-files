Pre~ent 
ialso were an i'!Tllerican corriaspondent and the latter s wife.) . 
On February 25, 1971, .Taffe ·stated he p.a.s had no 
further -conta.cts with Ya.rochevskaya., and has! seen Yarochevskiy 
only once since he ha.d them to his residence for lunch in May 
of 1969. Jaffe said he haq seen Yarochevskiy in at~endance at 
an anti-Vietnam ·war dernonstration in Washington, D. C., in 
'1969 ,} date unrecalled. Yarochevskiy was walking alone and 
carrying a. camera., ~and it was not ~til he was right on top of 
the Soviet did Jaffe realize his identity. They exchanged only 
1 greetings. Yarochevskiy told Jaffe that tq.ey must get tog~ther 
sometime. 
Jaffe stated he had never known Yarochevskiy prior 
to their meeting at the Hungarian Emba.ssy reception on April 17, 
1969. He had kno't'm Yarochevskaya previously, but only as one 
of a number of individuals whose services as translators, 
chauffeurs or house maids were made available to foreign cor­
respondents assigned to Moscow by a Soviet government agency 
which Jaffe k.T1ew as nUPDK;:. It is Jaffe' s impression now, that 
Yarochevskaya had been assigned by 1tJ?DK
1
~ as a translator, to 
Lares Bruger (phonetic), a. Swedish national and a correspondent 
for a. Swedish- newspaper, probably in 1965. 
Jaffe recalled that both he and Bruger (phonetic) left 
Moscow in 1965. Jaffe now ha.s the impression that Yarochevskaya 
was not ·ma.rried ·when he knew her in 1965. Jaffe did not know 
her socially. He did not know her by her maiden name. He recog­
nized her at the Hungarian Embassy reception in 1969 but only 
after Ya.rochevskaya. had. refreshed his memory by. recalling Moscow. 
Jaffe said he believes that the lil1JPDK11 was controlled 
by the KGB (Ministry of State Security); however, all of the ~~· 
persons e..mployed by "V1.2DK" were not necessarily coni.-iected with 
Soviet intelligence. Jaffe ·stated he has no information that 
Yarochevskaya is, or ·was, connected with Soviet intelligence.
