3. Q:nadvertent Overflights by Reconnaissance Ai-rcraft 
Colonel Steakley distributed a memorandum listing the four 
inadvertent overflights of Soviet territory by U.S. reconnaissance 
aircraft, since January 1961. 
He commented that in previous years the rate of such incidents 
was considerably higher. Mr. Bundy asked him to provide for the Group 
in the next week or so a recapitulation of such incidents, g~ing back 
to approximately 1949. 
Colonel Steakley said that both CINCPAC and the Joint Reconnais- _ i 
sance Group believe that the incident of 10 April, when an ELINr 
aircraft flew over one of the Kuriles, appears to represent a violation 
of established procedures and instructions. CINCPAC has asked for I 
a full report.

4. Cuban Operations 
Mr. FitzGerald expanded orally on the paper of 9 April, giving 
a summary of the recent results in the agent infiltration program, 
and outlining proposals in this field for the next month. The Group 
approved this projection. In response to a question about the status 
of Manolo Ray's people, Hr. FitzGerald said that CIA was in touch with 
him from time to time, artd that any plan he has to offer for activity 
against Cuba will be sympathetically received, but that he has not to 
date come up with any such proposal. 
The comments fran the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, dated 11 April, 
on the three papers being considered at today's meeting were noted. 
The Group requested that these conments be withdrawn and destroyed 
for -security reasons. With specific reference to the comment that a 
proposed sabotage action should not be carried out on the target date 
of the 20th or 21st of April, Mr.' FitzGerald pointed out that this date 
had been set before the status of the Donovan negotiations was known. 
He said that of course no activity .of this kind would be allowed to 
interfere with those negotiations at this stage. 
There then ensued a lengthy discussion of the entire question of 
sabotage. The Group agreed that the papers before it were responsive 
to requests which had been levied on CIA to come up with general and 
specific proposals. On the other hand, all members of the Group 
recognized that a searching examination must be undertaken in the light
