:Rafael Trujillo was assassinated by a group of Daninican dissidents on 
May 30, 1961. 
Tru_i illo was a brutal dictator, and both the Eisenhower and 
Kennedy Administrations encouraged the overthrow of his regime by Dcminican 
dissidents. Toward that end the highest p::ilicy levels of both Administrations 
approved or condoned supplying arms to the dissidents. Al though there is no 
evidence that the United States instigated any assassination activity, certain 
evidence tends to link United States official. to the assassination 
plans. 
:t1aterial support, consisting of three pistols and three carbines, was 
supplied to various dissidents. While United States' officials knew that the 
dissidents intended to overthrow Trujillo, probably by assassination, there 
is no direct e"1:dence that the weapons which were passed were used in the 
assassination. The evidence is inconclusive as to how high in the two 
Administrations information about the dissidents' assassination plots 
had been rassed prior to the spring of 1961. 
Beginning in March of 1961, the dissidents began asking United States 
officials for machine gi.ms . By the tine four M-3 machine gi.ms were shipped to 
the CIA Station Chief in the Iorninican capitol in April, it was well known 
that the dissidents wanted them for use in connection with the assassination. 
Thereafter, ho;,;rever, penni.ssion to deliver the machine gi.ms to the dissidents 
was denied, and the gi.ms were never passed. Two days before the assassination, 
President Kennedy personally authorized a cable to the U.S. Consul General 
·k The second paragraph under V.A.3.c. and the paragraph l.Il1der VII.C. were 
drafted pursuant to the directions of the Subcorrmittee but have not been 
reviewed by the Subcorrmittee.
