With respect to the possibility that nobert Kennedy 
may have authorized assassination outside of Special Group Augmented 
channels, Bundy stated that although Robert Kennedy did spur people 
to greater effort during Mongoose, "he never took away from the 
existing channel of authority its authority or responsibi'lity." 
(Bundy, pp. lt7-h8). Bundy further testified that there existed be­
tween Robert Kennedy and Maxwell Taylor (the Special Group Augmented 
Chairman) "a relation of real trust and confidence." In view of this 
relation, Bundy stated it was his opinion that Robert Kennedy would 
not have by-passed Taylor to develop a "back-channel" relationship 
with someone else to assassinate Castro. -(Bundy, p. 87).
