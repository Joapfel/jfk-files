Dear Tom: 
: .Ju,iy 9, 1975 .. 
. . . 
. We would appreciate your advising· the -Select 
Committee of ·=the following regarding pos.sible r:r.E; 
participation in or furnishing information to the I~telli-
··gence Evaluation Committee: 1) whether the ·IRS had a 
representative on the IEC and,· if so, who; 2) if there 
w_as such a represent 9 tive, what duties he·· had; 3) ·what 
information, if any, IRS furnished tb IEC. ·we request 
that the IRS identify for inspection and copying by the 
Select "Committee staff all documents relating to or­
constituting information furnished by IRS either 
• directly to IEG or furnished to persons in the Treasury 
Department or elsewhere which was ultimately provided to 
·IEC. 
The Committee has reason to believe that at a 
March 26, 1971, meeting of the IEC, Hr. Eug.ene T. Rossides, 
then Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, 
Enforcement and Operations Division, was introduced to the 
.. IEC as the person responsible for, inter alia, intelligence 
gathering by IRS, and that he ·would be called upon to make 
.. contributions from ·that source to the Co:rr.rnittee 1 s work. 
Essentially, the Committee requests th~t the IRS 
come forwa~d with all information it has regarding direct 
9r indirect IRS participatior;,. in the.work of the IEC .
