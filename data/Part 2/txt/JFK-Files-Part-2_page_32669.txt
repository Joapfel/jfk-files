In other words, the true order of battle of the enemy had not been ascer-
tained at the ti'me of the completion of plans for possible landings of our for­
ces in Cuba. This omission could have resulted in our paying a much higher 
price in casualties in the occupation of Cuba than had been anticipated. 
Equally important, since on October 22nd the President did not know of 
the presence in Cuba of a substantial ,number of Soviet soldiers in heavily 
armed organized ground combat units, he could not include this factor in his 
actions vis-a-vis the Soviets and demand at that time their withdrawal from 
the Western Hemisphere along with the strategic missiles. 
D. Alleged Photographic Gap 
There has been considerable public discussion about an alleged gap in 
our _photoe;raphic reconnaissance over Cuba during the period from September 5 
C)c::_\ (;a,\'€ R 
to 71 f bo:. 14. We have examined this question as thoroughly as possible and 
have found the allegations with respect to it to be unfounded. The record of 
the flights which were scheduled between August 29 and October 14 should be 
sufficient to clear up the situation and these will be summarized here., 
The flight of August 29, which has already been discussed, resulted 
in the discovery of surface-to-air missile and cruise missile sites. 
On September 5, a mission was flown which covered the central and 
eastern portion of the island. Good coverage was obtained of the central por­
tion but weather conditions prevented any photographic returns with reference 
to the eastern end of the island. 
A flight was planned for September 10th but this'was not flown. 
On September 17, a mission was flown but, because of weather conditions, 
it was not wholly successful.
