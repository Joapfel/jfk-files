Identification orders, wanted flyers, and check circular.s 
Each field office must maintain a mailing list composed of individuals 
and organizations to which identification orders, wanted flyers, and 
check circulars are to be sent. Each field office must review annually 
its mailing list in order to see that no data is sent to fi:r;-ms which 
have ceased business or have merged with other organizations. A survey 
should be conducted by Agents each year by every office, at time field 
office mailing list is purged, to determine whether additional names 
of individuals and busines·ses should be added to field office mailing 
list.

Identification orders, wanted flyers, and check circulars are to be 
furnished newspapers and periodicals only upon their specific request. 
Should a compelling reason exist for distribution of an identification 
order, a wanted flyer, or a check circular, such as possible employment 
of a fugitive by a newspaper or periodical, secure Bureau approval for 
such distribution. 
Give consideration to desirability of circularizing motels. 
. Veterans Administration (VA) installations should be circularized on 
identification order fugitives who are veterans. Office of origin 
has responsibility for instructing other offices to initiate distribu­
tion to VA installations in such cases.
