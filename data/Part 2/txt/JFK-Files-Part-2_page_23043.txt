years I have ~een literally -­
(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. Halley. Let me go back. You asked me about ZRRIFLE. 
This is one of a thousand or hundreds of cryptonyms. Evett day 
I read, you know, hundreds of pages of traffic, so wh~n you ask 
me do I know what ZRRIFLE is, I mus~ answ~r you off the top of 
my head no. I have tried to be helrful. I have asked you 
several times if you could give me a steering tip or show me 
what direction you are going, I might be able to try to comment 
on it, but ZRRIFLE as such means nothing to me. You really 
could not expect that it would, given the thousands of these 
things that come across my desk. 
Mr. Baron. That is absolutely unrlerstandable. I want to 
try to see what happens in the way of getting an unrefreshed 
recollection from you, then I will go back over these two, 
especially the next one, OJWIN. Do you recall a CIA asset who 
went by the cryptonym QJWIN? 
Mr. Halley. tJo, I do not. Knowing the system, and so 
forth, normally it would have something to do with Spain. It 
·does not rinq any hells with me. That is all I can give you, 
a sort of Pavlovian response. You f .lash QJlH1l on the screen, 
I am telling you now I do not know, but it probably_has 
something to do with Spain. 
.'Ir. l3aron. W~re you aware that a project involving the 
devclo~ment of a capabil{ty of carrying on assassination was
