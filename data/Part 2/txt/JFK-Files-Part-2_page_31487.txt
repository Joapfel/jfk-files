A source advised on August 1, 1963, and October 4, 
1963, that at a meeting sponsored by Progressive Labor and held 
on July 31, 1963, at Stiles Hall, Berkeley, California, it was 
decided that a committee be formed in behalf of the San 
Francisco Bay Area students who had traveled to Cuba in June, 
1963, in defiance of the ban by the United States Department of 
State on travel to Cuoa. The name decided upon was the Committee 
to Uphold the Right to Travel (CURT). 
The same source and a second source advised that 
CURT, a non-membership organization, has as its principal 
and main purpose the directing of publicity toward the thought 
of freedom to travel. In the event of the prosecution of the 
students who traveled to Cuba, ClJRT will become a comrni ttee to· 
aid in their defense.

elected, five are currently members of the Socialist Workers
