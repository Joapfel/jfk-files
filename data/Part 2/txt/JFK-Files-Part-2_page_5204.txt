OVERFLYJNG ~USSIA 158 . . 
.The next ~ we tried was something called ·a sa:µsbury 
• • s~, a.'metallici 1¢4-~pplied t6 the airplane'• tin~ge 
in t_he hope of deflecting ~coming radar beams, b~t it worked 
·only at soi:µe µ-equencles and altitudes and ·not at o~ers. 
• ·Kelly ~ought it was more ·practical to. try special fro:t;1. fei,. 
rite paints that .would 'absorb a radar ... ping · rather tbafi~•-:·~ 
hounce ·ii back-~ ~e sender. The paints were moderately ef- . 
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's 
outer skin and=_we· ~er$enc~d overheatil:lg engine problelllS. 
But. the paint-.l~wered the· radar cross sectipn by one order of 
magnitude, SQ ·we decided to give it a try. We called these 
specially p~ted af.ri,.ianes "dirty birds" and shipped the first· 
one ou~ for flight testing in April 1957. _Oqr test pUot, Bob 
Sieker, too~ ·the U-2 up to over. seventy thbusand feet arid 
suddenly. rad.toed that he was experlencirig rap{4 airframe 
heat buJldup,.Mom:ents later his engine blew out and.the face,. • 
plate blew off -Bob's oxygen mask··.as his pressure suit in­
s~tly ~ted. ·Tlie U-2" dove straight down and crashed. Jt. 
took us t1u:ee days to locate the wreckage-and Bo?'s. body. An 
. autopsy .revealed that above seventy. thousaitd feet· he· had 
suffered ·acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten 
seconds. The culprl~ that killed him was a defective face.plate 
clasp ~t ·cost fifty cents. • • 
Tbe ·~ ~ ~o desperate to .. buy time for these Soviet over­
.flights that ~i~ell got Kelly. to seques~r four of ott;r· test fflght 
c;ngf.ne~ aµd ~ve ~em w.t:!te a bogus fligJit manual for a.U-2 
twice os ~~vy as-ours anowith a maxlinum altitude of only 
fifty thousm;id -feet that carried only scientific weather gear in • 
its .~ay. The manual included phony insµ,nnent panel photos 
w11;h altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor 
~ts~ Po~ c:opies•.were produced and the~ artificlally aged· 
with grease, coffee stains,. and cigarette burns. How· or if' the 
. agency got.them into Soviet hands orily Mr. B lmew, and h~ 
never told.
