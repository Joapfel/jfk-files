be called mi.nd-be:c.ding reminds me. that my requests se~ to rc.e-to cover tfrls tmcl that yOu . • 
have not notified r;ie of tlu::1 release. I do uent these. If you interpret· my prior requests· 
-as not covering _them then:consider .. this a nei·i request. Hy recollection is that my initial 
requests cover anything a.'i.d ver-,rthing directly or indirectly related to this subjc;ct·. That 
you have interpreted my requests as~ have is evidence from prior corraspondence noti-
