(Hall) how was the cooperation of the DOD intelligence 
agencies including NSA / how much had they withheld? -­
Tilly said he found them cooperative but that the release 
was small. Did not know off hand how much was withheld. 
Hall considered so few record as "suspect" and ask if NARA 
had followed up. Tilly said no. NARA did not have the 
authority to question the agencies about their searches. He 
indicated that the Army among others had not responded to 
NARA's initial request. (During the public comments part of 
the meeting Newman and Lesar returned to the question of DOD 
compliance.) 
Several members of the Board had questions about the 
Presidential Libraries; Tilly described his role and the 
process. 
When Jack open the meeting for public comments, Newman 
returned to the question about DOD releases. He clamied 
that NSA had release only one true document and that most of 
the DIA files was administrative or news clipping. He said 
he had seen at least 30 DOD documents in CIA and FBI files 
that did not appear in the DIA release. 
Newman then ask if the agencies could withhold documents 
from the Board; Jack responded that under the law thar only 
Board had the power to withold a document. 
Lesar ask if the Board had given consideration to_his letter 
concerning the definition of an assassination record. Jack 
thanked him for the letters but the Board would not be able 
to address the issues Lesar raised until they had a staff to 
do the research. 
A third "expert" named Mark Zaid ask a question about Post 
Office files that had been released before and how they 
compared with recent Post Office files found by NARA. Anna 
responded that such questions require a staff.
