Memorandum to Mr. w. R. Wannall 
Re: u. s. Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence Activities (SSC) 
time allotted, appear to represent a disadvantage to all 
parties concerned, including the Committee. It was pointed 
out that the FBI, in particular, would have considerable 
difficulty in presenting a comprehensive and valid picture 
of its own CI operations under the conditions imposed by 
such a session. Mr. Elliff, after considering these 
objections, stated that he could understand the FBI 
position but was somewhat doubtful considering the pressures 
under which the Committee was operating that he would be 
able to alter this situation. 
ACTION: 
None. For information.
