of it, General Bennett and General Philpott feel that they are 
embarrassed to refute the fact that they had already been doing 
the work for the CIA 
Now, all those things were not ordinary garden variety 
daily events, were they? 
Mr. Phillips. They were not. 
Mr. Schwarz. You don't remember this at all? 
Mr. Phillips. No, and I didn't want to imply that it 
was necessarily because General Philpott would have been 
embarrassed, it could have been within CIA as well. 
But this rather unusual step was made because of the 
talents of the military men, to bring him into a program 
that you weren't even talking with the State Department about. 
14 And so that indeed was unusual to a great degree. And I am 
15 really very sorry to appear to be so vague about these things 
16 that I obviously had something to do with. 
17 But my explanation is that I was doing a certain job, 
18 and that other'people were outside, and Mr. Karamessines would 
19 be talking with Mr. Helms about something, and this, that and 
20 the other, ~nd I was on the day-by-day operation side, and when 
21 someone would come in and say, we want something to go down 
22 to Wimert, and it has something to do with General Philpott, 
23 I didn't pay the kind of attention I would to it if it had 
24 been one of our operations. 
25 Mr. Schwarz. Go back up to the beginning at paragraph 2
