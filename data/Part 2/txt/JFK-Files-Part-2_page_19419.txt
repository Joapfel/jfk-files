·£ Today, Janua;;·l;·, ~ngress 
reconvenes in Washington. 
Women,from all over the United 
States have gathered there to 
petitidn lhe Congress in the • 
name of the Jeanette Rankin 
Brigade. Jeannette Rankin, 
the first woman to serve in 
Congress and the only person 
to vote against U.S. entry 
into both World Wars, leads 
the women there, along with 
guch other sponsors as Mrs. 
M~L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte, 
Mri. John C. Bennett, Mrs.

--·---- • national coali tiW~r'"'wome~~~·-- ... 
antiwar groups mobilized ,. 
against the war in Veitham. 
As the cost of the war in lives 
and money mounts daily, the 
women of this country call upon 
congress to take action against 
it. To support the senators and 
Congressmen who oppose the war, 
to encourage those who are troubled 
but silent, to speak out, and to 
make our position known to those 
who still support this immoral 
war, we, as women of Hawaii, are 
gathered here. Our message to 
Reps. Mink and Matsunaga, to 
Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that 
women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government 
waging a genocidal war ... 
women will no longer accept a government which represents a military 
and industrial machine rather than its people .•. 
women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight 
and neglect of a society geared to profit and war ..• 
women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer 
remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor ... 
We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program 
commensurate with the needs of the American people; ·to foU{)W ,~ 
policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countriesi to 
pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect 
international law. 
American women who, as women everywhere, ar~ the bearers ·and conservers 
of life, will not stand idly by as life is destroyed. in our name. 
About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to 
Congress: 
As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business 
be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal 
of.American troopsj and that the Congress turn its attention to 
amel:ilorating the crisis in America. 
We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations 
for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to 
listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.
