DIR 84802, 11/22/6~ para. 1. The sequence of the cables 
can be detern,ined in that they were numbered sequen-. 
tially as they were sent. In this regard it should be 
noted tha.t this system ccn indicate the order in which 
he cables were sent but rot the order _in which they 
were written because, at 1east in Mexico, several of 
the Station officers were drafting and sending cables. 
Hence, the order of writjng them may ·not be the same 
as . the order in w_hich they were sent.
