have been rect'ited and run exclusivelv for the MHCHAOS 
program. f;iiead, emphasis ha~ been ~laced on the exploi­
tation of new and old ~gcncy assets who have a by-product 
c~pability or a concurrent capability for provision of 
information responsive to the program's requirements. 
This has involved th.c provision of custom-tailored collec­
tion require□ents an<l operational guidance. This collec­
tion progran is viewed as an integral part 0£ the recruit­
ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam 
Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-
. tions an<l Korean Branch operations. Agents who have an 
American ":-!o\·cr.1en t" background .-:n- who have known connec­
tions with the Ar.10rican

~-Iove1aent" arc useful as access 
agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis­
cern possil>lc vulnerabilities and susceptibilities,- and 
to develo~ operationally exploitable relationsl1ips with 
recruitment targets of the above prograns. These assets 
are of interest to our targets because of their connec­
tions with rtnd/or kno,,:J.cdge of the Americ~n ":-!ove1:1ent." 
Over the course of the r-!HCHAOS program, there have been 
approxiq3tcly 20 important areas of operational interest, 
which at the.: present ti1:1e ha\·e been reduced to about ten: 
Paris, Stockhol~, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers, 
Mexico City, Santiago, Ot ta,\'a and Hong Kong.

tions, two of which have been implemented to cover tar­
gets of special interest.
