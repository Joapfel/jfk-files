and Fidel and several of _his armed guards. 
Okay now, what happened 
Castanyava ... 
Castanyava 
Castanyava was the chief of the Navy. 
And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you 
go into that? 
Well he was very fond of everything German. He 
said he read and my father, you know, tried-
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on . the ._ ship 
because they were terrified. They thought they were 
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the 
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I 
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to 
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the 
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise. 
FS: And he offered you a job, right? 
ML: Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back 
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged 
gifts~ and my father and Fidel seemed to get along 
very well. My father is diplomatic and they 
.exchanged plaques and·my father's silver ashtray and 
·stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father 
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back, 
return to Cuba to be his. secretary since he was 
getting German mail and he did not speak German and 
he assured me that I would be safe and set up.in an 
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah .. And I had 
friends in Cuba anyway. • 
FS: How old.were you then? 
ML: Nineteen, nineteen years old.· 
FS: Did you get off the ship and stay there? 
ML: No, I went back to New York. .Fidel, on the bridge, 
asked me for my phone number and address in New York 
and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't 
believe it.
