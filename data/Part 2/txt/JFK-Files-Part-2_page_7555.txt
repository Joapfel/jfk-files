THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION 
US biophysicist who had conversations with Yu I Moskalev and Alex 
Hoise.e.v during the visit of the two Soviets to the US in October 1971. 
In October 19 ~~~~~~ .. ~~ Institute of Biophysics, Hinistry 
of Public Healt ,~cow an I Mex Hg1:J0 £Y· Central Advance) 
Institute for Training of Physicians, !-fosc01i1, visited several US 
biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these 
visits it was learned from Hoskalev that he 1s the Chairman of the 
USSR equivalent to the US :i'ational Council on 'Radiation Protection. 
In this position, !1oiseev is Hoskalev' 3 secretary. 
2. .Ho:h;aev was a difficult individual to figure out. He stated that his 
-·training is in health physics and that his job in the USSR is to be 
informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation 
protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal "Health 
Physics" regularly as veil as other Western radiation research journals. 
Although 1n discussions with Hoiseev he appeared to be technically 
competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of

his sight. If Moiseev is 1".oskalev' s ''guardian" (as he appeared to be) 
he let his own guard dOlm during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David H 
,'.!aylor. Department of Biophysics. In11titute of cancer Research, .Bel.lilout. 
UlC. During the course of the evening M.oiseev consumed countless gin \ 
and toni.cs until be could barely articulate. Uoskalev. on the other 
hand. sipped one or two drinks all evening. 
Moskalev was a ver, adept diplomat. He finds it easy and 
convenient to adopt his conversation to vhatever kind of group be is 
with. He tal.ked at consi.derable length about the role of women in the 
Soviet economy and mentioned that his own vife is a pathologist. He 
was always raucb freer in his conversation when Moiseev vas out of 
hearing. 
4. In terms of ais profession.al work, Moskalev stated that he has a 
program in the USSR of exposing dogs to various doses of radiation 
to leam the biomedi.cal effects of radiation. It 1.s a progra11t quite 
similar to that at the Lovelace Fowuiation in Albuquerque. New Mexico. 
The major difference bei.ng that whereas the Lovelace inhilation 
experiments involve only the beagle dog, the Soviets do not use a 
controlled breed, but rather use mongrels. Moskalev's budget, wich
