torn with the thought of leaving thia project which he be.ieve-• 
will be most successful, imd which would aa11ure his livellhood, 
but he knows that he must devote hims<-lf to the fight against 
Castro. It ie obvious to me that AMli.ANG-1 will within the next 
two months phase out of this employment to devote full time to 
the liberal ion of Cuba. 
f. A JURE Radio Link 
AMBANG-1 asked me if I would be able to auist 
him in the establis'1ment ol a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link. 
He explained that the JURE has spent a great deal o( money on 
telephonic communfrations between these points and were most 
anxious to set up a means of radio communic'ation in order to 
economize. I guess that AMBANG-1 could tell from my reaction 
that I was not too sympathetic to his request •for he withdrew it 
almost as soon as he had made it. He went on to say that this 
was a problem which they could overcome and I presume that he 
will seek to establish such radio communications without our 
assistance. 
g. Aerial Maps of Cuba 
AMBANG-1 informed me that the JURE membership 
had brought cut of Cuba an entire series of maps showing key roads, 
bridges, industrial plants, et al, which they had copied by the Aero 
Service Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. AMBANG-1 
stated that they had received most of these· photos from the Aero 
Service Corporation but that the 101 were still missing. He gave 
me the numbers of those missing and asked if we could procure them. 
I have since informed.AMBANG-1 that it would pP.rhaps be best it 
he could, or his organization, do this instead but that we would 
pay the travel of one of hii men, should this prove necessary.· 
Attached, hereto, is a copy of the missing photos in question. 
h. JURE Organization and Strength 
AMBANG-1 informed me that the membership ol the 
JURE in San Juan was now at about 500 members and that each 
of these individuals makes a weekly contributionto the organization.
