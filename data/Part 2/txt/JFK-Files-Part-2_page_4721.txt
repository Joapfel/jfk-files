MR. HALPERN: Oh yeah, I left at the end of '61 -~well.not the end because I 
arrived back in Washington. Well. even after that. Bill Colby made me in 
effect the third man down in the station because he and his Deputy. Ed Barbier 
who is now dead, were just swamped with paper -- release of documents, release 
of cables, relief of dispatches. what have you. They were working 20 hours a 
day and it was getting crazy. I said, "Bill if it is one thing in the world I 
can do -- and everybody knows I can do it -- I can move paper for you. Get it 
out of here. And you know damn well you'll see the ones you are supposed to 
see. And let me get rid of the junk." And so he gave me releasing 
authority. And I sat there as a station officer. because I said, "Bill, you 
know. my job with the mi 11tary is finished. And, you know. what do I do 
next?" He wanted me to stay on and I didn't feel like ~taying on. And so I 
sent a wire back to Washington. and he agreed. I said. in effect. "My job is 
done here, I did what you asked me to do. What is my_next assignment?" Just 
like that. And they finally said, "Come on back to Washington." And I came 
back to Washington and briefed everybody. But anyway. tnat was my 
relationship with Bill. I knew him well enough then. He's just a different 
kind of a guy. A ni~t-~uy. Easy to t~lk to, easy to get along with, but very 
opinionated, very firm in what opinions he holds, he holds, period. And it's 
a hell of a job to try and get him to change his mind. I'll give you a simple 
thing. He was running air operations. dropping agents into North Vietnam. 
And one night I ~emember we were in the communications shack <communications 
room>. And he had sent an "Ops immediate" and didn't get an answer. The 
plane was warming up on the-field, waiting to go. And they had to get a "yes" -
or "no" to go. I said, "Bill. they haven't answered in over an hour, for
