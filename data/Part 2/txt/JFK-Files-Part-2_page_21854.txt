stressed the difficulty of trying to carry 
out such an operation. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, 
p. 47.) 
The cable that Hedgman sent to headquarters reporting his 
initial contact with(Gottiie~was clearly an affirmative response 
to the assignment. The( Chief of) Station said that he and (Gottlieb) 
were "ON SA..'IE WAVELENGTH." (CIA Cable IN 18989, Leopoldville to 
Tweedy, 9 / 2 7 / 60.) Hedgman was "afraid" that ~obutu 'i]government 
was "weakening under" foreign pressure to effect a reconciliation 
with Lumumba, and said: 
HENCE BELIEVE MOST RAPID ACTION CONSISTENT 
WITH SECURITY INDICATED. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.)

President Eisenhower Had Ordered the Assassination 
of Lumumba 
Hedgman testified that in the course of their meeting in • 
Leopoldville,(o~.:·,Gottlieb) informed him that President Eisenhower 
had authorized the assassination of Lumumba:

zation of such instructions to you? •

Q: What do you recall in essence was what you 
said to him? 
Hedgman: In essence, I think I must have ... pointed 
out that this was not a common or usual Agency tactic, 
and I may have probably said that I never heard of 
it being done, which I had not, never in my training 
or previous work in the Agency had I ever heard any 
references to such, in my recollection at least, such 
methods. And it is my recollection I asked on whose 
authority these instructions were issued. • 
~ And what did Mr. (G~ttliE!~, reply?
