to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made 
any further approaches to Security's informant rec-ly, althou;h he • 
continues to see the.cially. Thus, there is slir~~eason to believe 
that further waiting will produce a break in the case. . 
10. There are two courses open to the Office of Se¢urity now. 
It C<;ln attempt to have the Agency en"l?lo~;ee s k:1.ov.n to be in contact 
with: the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might 
. aler~ the Cuban to our pen~tration of the operation, particularly 
since a piausible reason for t:::-:.n.sfer would be difficult to develop 
for some of the _persons involved. Alternatively, Security could • move overtly and charge the Agency employees ·with violation of the 
security regy.la tiori requiring reporting of contacts wi.th foreign 
nationals. This would, of course, tern1inate the Office of Security'_s 
operation. 
11. One of these courses of action should be chos·en promptly. 
The possibility that the employee in SB Division n1ay be passing 
information on CL\' s Soviet operations is too great to warrant further 
delay in moving against her. lv1.oreover, it is possible that the Cuban 
has current productive penetrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage 
to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from 
continuing this CI effort.
