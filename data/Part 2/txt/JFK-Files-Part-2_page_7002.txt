SUBJECT: Phone Conversation with Susan Oullette, HPSCI 
As you requested, I called Susan Oullette, HPSCI Staff today to respond to her questions about JFK Assassination records. She said that 
the Committee was interested in the process used for declassifying the records, the status of our review, and what criteria we use for 
declassification. 
Following are among the main topics we covered during a discussion of about 10 minutes on the STU-Ill: 
• A description of the JFK records held by CIA 
• Process of declassification (review by retired senior officers, coordination with DO, 
OGC, others) 
• Criteria for redaction 
• Coordination with FBI, other agencies on third agency documents. 
• Presidentially-appointed JFK Assassination Records Review Board 
• • Differences with the Board on release of certain information e.g., 
names of former employees, identification of stations 
Current appeal to the White House of decision by Board to release 
certain information we redacted. 
Efforts of the Board to identify additional records, incl_uding in other 
countries 
Susan said that she may have enough information for now, but she would let me know if more would be needed. I invited her to visit us if 
she wanted more details or to look at the records.
