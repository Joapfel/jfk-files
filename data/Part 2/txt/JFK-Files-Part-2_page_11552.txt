In reporting activities of a ~ubject since January 1, 1949, 
a greater percentage of repetitious and cumulative items 
and in most instances all such items should be specifically 
reportede 
It will be particularly inqumbent upon the reporting 
Agent to report specifically such items in those cases 
in which there is little informa~ion[indicating]sub­
versive activity of a subject since January 1, 1949. In 
those cases in whioh there is an enormous number of such 
items, you ~ay be more liberal in the selection of those 
items to be reported specifically.
