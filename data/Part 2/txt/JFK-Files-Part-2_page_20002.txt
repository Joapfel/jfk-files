Women n:ust use their n-.inds, their voices, and 
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; .to do 
less is tc ignore our specia.l r-csponsibilities to 
the hume n race. 
1110 000 , 
be killed in 
ir.g to go to 
in .Vietnam. 
wor::.en ha.ve sat ba.ck and let thei--r sons 
Vietnam. If we had 10,000 wc~en will­
jail if necessary we could stop the war 
You can..'1.ot have wa.-rs "'.1:!. tbcY...:.:t ":'·on~n. 11 
Jeannette Rankin r.:2.de the above statement in 
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first· 
woman elected to Congress, she voted against ~orld 
-:.=:a.r I. She has consistently rr:ainta ined he-r strug­
gle for pea.ce, and et ·88 she is as courageous and 
vigorous as ever -- an inspiTation to-all wc~en. 
The pTesence of the United States fo~ce$ in 
the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and 
illegal. There c2n be no possible justification 
for our inte~ference in tbe do~estic affairs of 
this tiny dist2nt land. 
This 86-year-old wo~an has stated that she 
is willing to etay in iail until the bo~bin~ i; - ~ ~ 
etopped. Not all women FTe ~Tee to join heT, but 
we c-:in a82ure her that thousa.ndE of y.1omen ,;,1ill 
march pe8defully beside h~T. Some will picket, 
otheTs will go to jail unti~ bail is aTTanged, 
and others will E'tay in jail with l!iss R2nkin. 
Every woman's p2-rticipation is ecually valuable. 
'~!e are confident each one will do the maximum of 
wbich fhe i e. capc1.ble .-
On Jenuary 8th, women from all over the land 
,,ill conveT12:e on VIashinr,,:tcn to der:~a.nd the end of 
this dishon6-rable war. ~~e shall come as individ­
uals, or as orga.niz~t ions, but ·we sha.11 join to­
fether as concerned wo~en under the aegis of 
Jean.nett e Rankin;., 
Will you join us to ~ave the ~en you love~ 
from death, and the country you love from eha~e?
