pouching an M3 machine gun on February ~ 10, 1961 ~ pp. 63,64; 
Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61). The request was raised again 
in March but no action was taken. On March 20, 1961, fG)cabled

by the internal dissidents until opposition group 
and HQS are better prepared to support /assassinationl 1', 
effect a change in the regime, and cope-with the arter­
math." (HQS to Station cable, 3/24/61)
