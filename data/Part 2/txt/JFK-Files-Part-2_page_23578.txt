MEMORANDUM 
I believe that the operation should be organized with five staff components: 
l. Intelligence collection and evaluation 
2. Guerilla and underground 
3. Propaganda 
4. Economic warfare (exclusive of covert activities within Cuba) 
5. Diplomatic relations 
Each of these divisions would be headeq by someone directly responsible to 
you. In addition you would have a deputy who would do th¢ actual contact work 
between this op·eration and the various government agencies involved. He 
would be the one identified as the source of orders and dire.ctives when direct 
contact with the agencies was needed. !tSbeu. l niW;pss:4 t'1etfi 11ug;.:kp ..,_. 
i~~ h Ji?f tbe.u.. He should be from CIA for reasons discussed below. I 
would act as Staff Assistant to you. ~y primary job would be to see that 
current questions for decision were presented to you at your morning staff 
meetings with the alternatives fully di.scussed. I would have no direct opera­
tional duties; thus keeping in the back
1
ground. 
I have talked to MacNamara and he has promised to supply a topflight guerilla 
and underground .man, as well as· whatever additional. personnel we need. I 
think this is the.best way to handle it. However, it will be necessary to use 
the CIA apparatus and agents for this.· That is why it will be valuable to assign 
a CIA man to you as deputy in order to keep them happy and''"U ls H t d· 
ttl.£; , c deeply involved at t:he command level. _In this way we can probably 
avoid an internal struggle between the CIA field operatives and the Defense 
co.mm and. 
Both the diplomatic relations and econo.mic warfar_e people can come from 
State. I have some ideas on this and -- if you give the :signal -- will discuss 
it with George Ball.
