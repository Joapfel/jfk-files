16. On October 6, 1961, Mr. Parrott told the Special Group that there was 
in preparation 
11
a contingency plan in connection with the possible 
removal of Castro from the Cuban scene&" (We should obtain this plan 
as it may· relate to an assassination plot.) (Source: Special Group 
Minutes October 6, 1961, 02783) 
17. On December 8, 1961, Gen. Lansdale presented "the outline of a program 
designed to overthrow the Castro government." (Source: Special Group 
Minutes December 8, 1961, 02795) 
18. The March 26 Special Group Minutes referred to a "Shipping Sabotage 
Paper of 19 March. The proposal reflected in the paper was remanded 
for Group consideration by the Cottrell Committee." (Source: Special 
Group Minutes March 26, 1963, 02839) 
19. On April 4, 1963, the Special Group approved three papers which were 
subsequently approved by "higher authority" on April 9. The papers 
were titled 
II 
Sabotage of Shipping,

Russian Language Broadcasts,

and "Propaganda Inciting Cubans within Cuba to Attack Soviet Troops." 
(Source: Special Group Minutes April 4, 1963, 02844 and Memo for 
Members of the Special Group April 9, 1963, 02845) 
20. The Minutes of April 11, 1963, Special Group meeting referred to 
"Three papers being considered at today's meeting." One of these papers 
may deal with sabotage in Cuba as there was a "lengthy discussion" of 
the entire question of sabotage at the meeting. Also, the Minutes state: 
"The comments from the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs dated 11 April on 
the three papers being considered at today's meeting (were requested by 
the group to) be withdrawn and destroyed for security reasons." 
Note: We should perhaps make a request for such comments, to determine 
whether they were in fact destroyed. (Source: Minutes dated 11 April 
1963, 02846) 
21. The Minutes of 18 April 1963 indicate the Special Group "turned to dis­
cussion of the papers from the,Coordinator of Cuban Affairs dated April 
16, 17, and 18." There is no indication of the subject matter of these 
papers. The Minutes state that it was agreed these papers should be 
11 staffed and sharpened up for presentation at next week's meeting~
11 
Note that the Minutes indicate the title of the paper dated April 17, 
as 
11
Maximum Covert Action Program
11 
which consists basically of "sabotage 
and harrassment, plus support to Cuban exile groups and individuals who 
may be responsive to our advice but not certainly to our command.
11 
Note further that the Minutes state Mr. Bundy and McCone expressed doubts 
as to whether "we are in a position to decide major problems of this 
type (presumably reflected in the three papers) until we have a clearer 
picture of what the overall policy toward Cuba is likely to be .... " 
Note also that Hr. Bundy stated he was not sure whether "it would be 
possible to embark on the activities proposed in the Coordinator's 
papers, without a drastic change in U.S. policy." (Source: Minutes 
dated 18 April 1963, 0284~-49)
