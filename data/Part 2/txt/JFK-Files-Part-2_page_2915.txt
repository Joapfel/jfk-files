supported the notion of dynamic action, but urged that such action 
not be reckless. Con~~quently, he recommended that the Lansdale 
group report to the 5412 oversight committee, which was properly 
qualified to give political guidance and evaluate proposals for 
action. In addition, although McCone agre~d the facilities of all 
agencies should be made available for such high-priority operations, 
he emphasized that these should remain in place and not be removed to 
form a new unit.under Lansdale. 
In this way, MONGOOSE, as it came to be known, was launched. 
With the White House's decision to go ahead (keeping the 5412 
Committee fully informed), McCone proceeded to discuss the Lansdale 
operation with top Agency officials. Acknowledging that the project 
had to be closely held--Lansdale had asked that the CIA's 
representative, Richard Helms, report only to the DCI--McCone 
nevertheless stated he intended to skip no appropriate echelon of the 
Agency, as such a course would deprive him of the advice of other 
I 
senior officers. Action would be at the Helms level, and the Agency 
would offer Lansdale all necessary support and assistance, but 
without excluding the participation of other Agency members within 
the strict security guidelines laid down by the President. Further, 
McCone directed the Board of National Estimates and the DD/I to 
undertake a continuing evaluation of MONGOOSE, viewing such 
precautions as a major step toward overcoming the compartmentation 
which had excluded the DD/I from any advance knowledge of the Bay of. 
Pigs landing.
