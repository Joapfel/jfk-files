ZR/RIFLE. Harvey testified tha~ QJ/WIN's function af~er the advent 
of Project ZR/RIFLE in 1961 was restricted to the "spotting" of. 
potential assets for "multi-purpose" covert use. 
However, in the Fall of 1960--before Harvey was 
assigned to create Project ZR/RIFLE by Richard Bissell--agent 
QJ/WIN had been dispatched to the Congo bv(Jijl'l'.<'>1Jf11ijiiL(v/41~ his 
supervising CIA case officer in Europe. William Harvey, as the 
Chief of the CIA Foreign Intelligence staff on which'ija1@i;wworked, 
??_ 
had ordered QJ/WIN' s mission to the Congo (CIA DispatchmNmW)147, 
11/2/60) and arranged the financial accounting for the mission 
afterward (Memorandum to Finance Division from William K. Harvey, 
1/11/61). [QJ/WIN's activities in the Congo are treated in detail 
in the discussion of the Lumumba case; see Section , supra.: 
There are two factors which may raise a question as 
to whether QJ/WIN was being used in an ad hoc capacity to develop 
an assassination capability before ZR/RIFLE was formally initiated. 
First, there is a similarity in the cast of characters: Harvey,

bjwere connected with the Lumumba matter 
and reappear in connection with the subsequent development of 
ZR/RIFLE. Second, Bissell informed Harvey that the development of 
an assassination capability had already been discussed with ;1.i,\tt-!1 
and~o.ttli.eb}before Harvey's assignment to ZR/RIFLE (Harvey, 6/25/?'j 
p. 52; I.G. Report, pp. 37-38) . 
. Nevertheless, there does not appear to be any firm 
evidence of a connection between QJ/WIN and the plot to assassinate 
Lumumba.
