held at the Black Bear Inn. She stated that while the reception 
I • 
was in progress, TANNENBAUM appeared, uninvited, and immediately 
sought out RIHA, took him to the bar section of the restaurant, 
and commenced a long, serious conversation with him which lasted 
for approximately one hour. She stated that RIHA's bride became 
extremely upset over this, as TANNENBAUM would not allow anyone 
to interrupt their conversation. Mrs. STEIN advised ~hat on one 
occasion she went into the bar to tell RIHA that his bride was 
becoming very upset, and was answered in an angr>y manner by 
TANNENBAUM to "leave them alone.u Following this conversation, 
the content of which is unknown to Mrs. STEIN, she s·cated RIHA 
appeared to be extremely up.set, and al though TANNENBAUM left 
immediately, RIHA seemed to have lost all interest in the 
reception. 
Following the incident during the we~ding reception, 
Mrs. STEIN advised that TANNENBAUM again visi-ted her at the 
Black Bear Inn concerning the immigration case of ZDENEK CERVENY, 
during which she mentioned to TANNENBAUM that she qwned some 
property in Lyons on which she- desired to build an apartment 
house. At this time TANNENBAUM ·told her that Ehe was a Colonel 
in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the 
rank of General. She told Mrs. STEIN that she could utilize . 
some influence in securing an FHA loan for her; that she had the 
authority to deport her at any time; a.nd intimated to Mrs. STEIN 
that for a percentage of the loan obtained, she would obtain 
same; and if Mrs. STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she would 
have her deported. Mrs. STEIN again pointed out that she considered 
TANNENBAUM a "nut," and ·told he1"' that all of immigration and 
business dealings were handled through her attorney. 
Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection, 
the above was the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February, 
1969, she made a trip to Columbia, South America, where she had 
resided for approximately ten years be~cre coming to the United 
States, and did not again return to Lyons until Ha~ch 18, 1969, 
follm-1ing the disappearance of RIHA from Boulder, Colorado, on 
Ha.rch 15, 1969.
