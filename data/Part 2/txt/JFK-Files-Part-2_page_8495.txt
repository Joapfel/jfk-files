MEMORANDUM FOR: SA/00/O 
FROM: Donald J. Purcell 
Chief, Covert Action Staff 
SUBJECT: The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence 
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks 
REFERENCE: Memo for All Divisions and Certain Staffs, 
from SA/DO/O, 8 April 1977, same subject 
Following are Covert Action Staff comments on items 
24, 48, 54, 55, 56, 236, and 280, which are among the 
passages containing classified information that were de­
leted before publication of the Marchetti-Marks- manuscript: 
a) Items 24 (p. 47), 55 (p. 80), 56 (p. 81), 
and 280 (p. 404) are classified secret, and are 
exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2) of 
EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and 
methods of operation. Specifically, these items 
name RTV, Inc. and describe it as a CIA proprietary· 
that was used for clandestine operations in a variety 
of countries. In addition, items 55 and 56 are 
especially sensitive because they describe an opera­
tion in Jordan, exposure of which could be harmful to 
United States relations in the Middle East { Section 
5 b 3). 
b) Items 54 and 236 (on p. 80 and p. 262) are 
classified secret, and are exempt from publication 
under Section$) (b) (2) of EO 11652, which protects 
intelligence sources and methods of operation. These 
items name Forum World Features, describe it as a CIA 
proprietary that was used for clandestine propaganda 
operations, specify that the clandestine operations 
were directed especially at the Third World, and further 
specify that the man who ran FWF was an experienced 
CIA operator. It may be worth noting that the Senate 
Select Committee declined to publish the name of this 
clandestine proprietary when the Agency advised the 
Committee that publication would damage the former 
director of Forum World Features, who had entered into 
a clandestine relationship with the U.S. Government in 
good faith.
