During the course of our~ estUaITon of individual 
hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating through­
out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data 
regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the 
identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-
fluence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt 
officials, and the operations of its vast co~a:t.4"0ns-~works.
