Helms said his view was that AM/LASH was a political 
action agent, not a potential assassin, and that the meet-
t 
ing with A1·1/LASH and his decision not to contact Robert 
Kennedy should be viewed in that light: 
" ... given this Cuban of his standing and all 
the history.~ .of trying to find someone inside Cuba 
who might head a government and have a group to re­
place Castro ... this was so central to the whole theme 
of everything we had been trying to do, that I find. 
it totally unnecessary to ask Robert Kennedy at that 
point (whether) we should go ahead with this. This 
is obviously what he had been pushing, what every­
body had been_ pushing for us to try to do ... let's 
get on with:doing it .• , (Helms, 6/13/75, pp. 117-113) ,::._/ 
• (ii) The Delivery of the Poison Pen on November 22 
·while Helms· stated that the. delivery of a poison pen to 
AM/LASH was not part of a,n assassination plot, Helms_ testified 
*/As discussed above (see pp. ), there was conflicting testi~ 
many from CIA officers as to whether they viewed AM/LASH as an 
assassin and as to the purpose of giving him the poison pen. The docu­
mentary evidence, however, indicates that AM/LASH in 1963 was intent 
upon assassinating' Castro, that the· CIA officers knew of this, and, 
in addition to offering a poison.pen, told AM/LASH they would 
supply him with high po0ered rifles with telescopic sights. (see 
p. , above). 
Helms testified that because Amlash 'was the asset we were looking 
for, (,-i)e didn't want him to blow himself or blow anything else by •• 
getting involved in something like this [assassination] and have it 
fail. We wanted him to stay in place." (Helms, 6/13/7'j, p. 131). 
Helms stated that "at no time was it. the idea of [the A.11/LASH-l] case 
officers, or those. people in the chain behind, to use (AM/LASH-1] to 
assassinate Castro." (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 13S). 
Helms ·further stated 
11 
••• there was an enormous amount of 
temporizing with this -fellow to keep him oh the team, to keep him 
working away at this job, but to try and persuade him that this was not 
the way to go about it." (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 135). Helms testified 
that AM/LASH-1 was given the poison pen "because h~. was :.insistir:i.,g on 
something and this was a temporizing.gesture rather than givinghim 
some kind of a gun he had asked for .... " (Helms {J~} J;s~.P:;,\3~:~?11;.p:.1
