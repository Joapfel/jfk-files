This proprietary was established to purchase an 
apartment building in Europe for Agency office 
and residential use. In 1968, then the build-
ing was of no further use to the Agency, the 
entity with the apartment building was ostensibly 
given to the Department of State as a gift. • 
The Department actually reimbursed the Agency 
for the building in Washington. The Agency, 
on behalf of the Department, is attempting to 
liquidate the company. This is complicated 
by a disputed foreign tax claim. 
This operational support mechanism had no assets 
at the time of its disposal in 1971. and the 
corporate shell was turned over to the attorney 
who established the company in lieu of payment 
of his prospective fee for dissolving the 
entity.
