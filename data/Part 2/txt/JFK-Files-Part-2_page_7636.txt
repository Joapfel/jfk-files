Chief, CI - Mr. Kalaris then suggested that the answer 
might very well be for the Senate Committee review officers 
to work with the original file with the exception of those 
particularly sensitive items which would either be steri­
lized or summarized. Mr. Kalaris added that to establish 
the sensitivity of these items he would be willing for 
the sterilizations/summarizations to be spot checked against 
the originals by the Senate reviewers. 
Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach conferred with his colleagues 
and then agreed that this would be acceptable. He did 
inquire as to approximately how many such items there would 
be. He was informed by Mr~ Kalaris that it was so~ewhat 
difficult to access but that there should not be more than 
100 such items. 
Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach commented that it would be 
necessary for his people to take notes, but he would agree 
that these notes not be taken from the building. The 
purpose of the notes is simply to allow the reviewers to 
keep track of where they have been and what they have seen. 
It was agreed at a minimum that their notes would be checked 
with us. 
Chief, CI - At this point Mr. Kalaris called Mr. Blee and 
requested approval of the above procedure. Mr. Blee 
concurred. • 
Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach commented that·his people would 
tab those sterilized or summarized items which they wanted 
to discuss and we would confer with them on those points.
