Mr. BELMONT. Well--
Mr. DULLES. May I just interrupt here a. moment. Is this inquiry directed to 
the question of whether it is now adequate or whether this is complete as of tbe 
time of the assassination? I think we have two questions there to consider. 
Mr. BELMONT. Mr, Dulles, this letter outlines our relations with Secret ~erv­
ice and the material that is attached covers both the instructions to our agents 
prior to the assassination and the current instructions. 
Mr. DuLLES. Subsequent to the assassination? 
Mr. BELMONT.· Yes, sir. (, 
Mr. DULLES. Yes.. 
Mr. STERN. What were the crit.eria .you employed and instructed your agents to 
employ before the assassination in determining what information should be 
reported to the Secret Service regarding threats against the President, members 
of his family, the President-elect, and the Vice President? 
Mr. BELMONT. These are contained in detail in the attachments which repre­
sent sections of our manual of instructions which are available to all of our 
personnel in the field as well as the seat of Government, and also iq the FBI 
handbook which is in possession of the individual agent in • the field. t'.rhese 
instructions. require that any information ind_icating the possibility of an at­
tempt against the person or safety of the persons mentioned by ;y:ou must be 
referred immediately by the most expeditious means of communfcations to the 
nearest office of the Secret Service. Further, that our headquarters in Wash­
ington must be advised by teletype of the information and the fact that it has 
been furnished to Secret Service.
