6. Some of the 158 guerrillas known to have 
been trained in Cuba have been in hiding and inactive 
ever since the January round-up, and others are known 
to be waiting outside the country. The MIR leader, 
Luis de la Puente Uceda, was believed to be in Cuba 
and now is in Europe. 
7. Guerrilla groups have sporadically attacked 
police stations for weapons, and robbed banks for 
funds. MIR members teamed with common criminals in 
April 1962 in a $100,000 bank robbery in a suburb 
of Lima, dividing the proceeds 50-50. Part of the 
loot is believed to have reached Hugo Blanco. MIR 
has brought in from Cuba a reported 5,000 copies of 
a special miniature edition of Alberto Bayo's guer­
rilla handbook. There is also,a manual on guerrilla 
operations based on Bayo's and Guevara's books but 
written specifically for Peru. 
8. Peruvian police in March 1962 broke up a 
small guerrilla training operation and determined 
that among those arrested, one was a former resident 
of Cuba, another had received Cuban training in clan­
destine operations, and a third, caught with radio 
equipment, admitted having used it to communicate 
with Cuba. The local guerrilla candidates were is­
sued kits including rifles of Czech manufacture. 
All of those arrested were soon released, but some 
were re-arrested in the January round-up. 
9. Prominent Peruvians who may have received 
indoctrination on visits to Cuba include nine student 
and ·youth leaders including two presidents of student 
prganizations; seven leading journalists; three labor 
union leaders; and nine former members of parliament.
