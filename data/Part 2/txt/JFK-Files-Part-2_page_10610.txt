Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland 
Re: United States Senate Select Committee 
To Study Governmental Operations With 
Respect to Intelligence Activities 
• 
Most of this information is obtained from paid 
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert 
citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances 
installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus 
-Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. 
None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's 
sake. The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that 
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting 
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may 
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these 
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized 
underworld are not aimed at developing general nonspecific 
data but at establishing which criminal violations its members 
are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court 
of law. 
Obviously, not every case opened, every lead followed, 
or every bit of information received is going to wind up in 
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates 
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the 
FBI. When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the 
inf(h:nrat.ion.• to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency. 
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past 
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make 
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over 
$151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, $9,000,000 
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia, 
and·· $6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax 
liens against $19,000,000 worth of property arising out of 
Federal gambling cases. 
In addition, a considerable portion of the organized 
crime intelligence information developed by the FBI is for­
warded to the various Federal Strike Forces coordinating 
racket investigations throughout the country and to the 
Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this 
information in its computerized data bank called ttRacketeer
