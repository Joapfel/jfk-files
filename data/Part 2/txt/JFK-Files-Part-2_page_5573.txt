. . Hi'. KLi:m. What divisfon or .unit of the Central Intelligence Agency had pri­
• mary responsibWcy for Nosenko7 . . . • • 
Mr. HUBPBY. The Soviet Russian Division. 
Mr. Kumr. Of which you w~'the Oliief? .Hr. HUBPHY. Yes, sir.. . .. • • • . • • 
Hr. Kl:.Em. And what i~ did you leave the Soviet Russia Division? 
Hr. MURPHY. Beginiling in 1968.. 
Hr. KLEIN. And up until what year did the Soviet Russia Division have 
primary respansfbllity for Nosenko? 
Hr. • HUBPKY. I don't recall the exact time but it was certainly up until the 
spring of 1967. 
Hr. Ku:nr. The investigation by Bruce Solle began at the end of 1967. At that 
time dfd the control or respanslblllty over Nosenko change from the Soviet 
Russia Division to another divfsion? 
Hr. HUBPRY. Hy recollection is that it changed in the spring or early summer 
of 1967 and the responstblllty was turned over to the Office of Secorlty of which 
Solle was a member. • 
Hr. KLEIN. As Chief of the Soviet Russia Division, did you have the primary 
responsibWty for what happened to Nosenko? And when I say happened, where 
he was kept, what he was asked? 
Hr. HUBPHY. I was responstlble for the case. 
'Mr. KLEIN. OK. .• . . . 
Hr. HUBPHY. Although the case was handled by one of the groups within the 
Dlvtslon. 
Hr. Kl:.Em. Bot they would report to you? 
Mr. HUBPKY. 'I'es. ·_._ . . 
• • • • • • • Hr. Kr..Ei:N. Tb.ere came a time in 1964, April 4, I believe, when the treatment 
received by Nosenko greatly changed 1n that hostJBe fnterrogatfons begao, ls that correct? 
Hr. MURPHY. I am not sure I agree with the formulation of the question. 
Hr. KLEIN. Well, elaborate. . • 
•Hr. HUBPHY. No; the previous pattern of voluntary discussion of issues under 
consideration changed and Nosenko was not permitted to evade questJons or to 
decide when he would or would not want to respond. · 
Hr. KLEIN. Could you describe for us what the pattern was before, as far as 
conditions and how it was changed?
