(aJ Definit:i.on 
A top functionar¥ is an individual, either a member or a 
no·nmembor of the Communist Party, to whom, because of his 
importance, it :i.s necessary to give continui;rns investigative 
attention in order to keep abreast of'comrnunism on a . 
national ba9is in the U. s. Necessarily, such an individual 
·would be on· a high policy level in the movement. 
The term "top funciiona~y• is not to be construed as re­
quiring that individuals in this category must actually 
hold official positions in party organizatio~s but shall 
be given a broad enough constructio~ to include others who 
are of equal importance because of their influence in the 
movement itself, or their position and activities outside 
the party in labo~, front, or similar organizations or 
movements e 
(b} Manner of dos ignation 
Prior Bureau authority necessary to designate a subject 
as a top functionary. Submit sunh recommendation to Bureau 
by letter containing reasons for the recommendation. Bureau 
deiires to be very selective in this matter and to concentrate
