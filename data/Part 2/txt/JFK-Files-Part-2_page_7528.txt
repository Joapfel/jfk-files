the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, tears 
a stri~ing resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich 
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the 
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhitit #237 as 
hav~ng been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City, 
either in the foyer or just outside.
