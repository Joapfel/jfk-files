1v1EMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Shipments of Cont2.min2.ting Elements to Cuba 
1. I refer to your interest in hearing more about the 
Fitzgerald operation which involves the current shipment 
of contaminating elements to Cuba and which is 2.imed at 
bringing about a breakdown of 2. subst2.nti2.l amount of 
Cuban machinery. 
2. Attached is a copy of a memo which I believe you drafted 
ro::r a meeting with the President on April 7, 1964. Item 5 
would appear to cover the type of operation which Fitzgerald 
is .now conducting. 
I h2.ve not corr:e across any minutes of the April 7 meeting. 
(As I recall it! you intentionally kept the attendance restricted 
and were the sole attendee from the NSC st2.ff.} While. I do 
r.ot recognize the handwriting or the doodles on the attached 
memo,· they indicate that Item,,5 was_.approved. My own 
-·<".;'./ - ,:,. • .,.· 
_ -strong recollection of the &::~- 1e1:p-from the meeting was 
. that Items 1 through 5 were 0. K. and that the only serious 
. problems concerned Items 6 and 7. 
3. I d.Ssurne Lt'lat you still want to hear a status report on the 
Fitzge::-ald operation at the Special Group meeting today and I 
will pass this word to both Des and Peter Jessup. 
I think this operation is probably too far down the road to stop, 
.., if indeed we do want to stop it. In any event, you will be able 
V-""~~ find this out, by some gentle questioning, when Des gives 
~ n1s status report.
