17 November JFK Board Meeting-• CIA issues (update) 
1. The following CIA items are on the agenda for the 17 November ARRB meeting: 
• (SI Reconsideration of the release o~ Va. as the location of the CIA Racord Center. 
In addition to written evidence being prepared by DA, the Agency has been offered the opportunity to brief the Board. 
' • Chairman Tunheim's proposal to advance the opening date of the Nosenko NBR (Not Believed Relevant) material from the 2017 per 
the JFK Act to the year 2010; 
The ARRB staff disagrees with the Board on this issue and will recommend that the release date remain 2017. However, they are not 
confident that the Board will accept their recommendation and has requested the Agency's position on the 2010 date. If the Agency 
opposes the 201 O change in the date, I will need a memo from the DO explaining why. We could offer a compromise--accept the 2010 
date provided the Agency has the same right in 2010 as 2017 to review and appeal the release of the records. I have ask OGC for a legal 
opinion. Please note that this decision affects only those documents designated "NBR" by ARRB. The documents declared to be 
Assassination Records (ARI will be re-reviewed and released, either sanitized or in full, during the coming year.

staff, some Board members consider CIA use f.state cover as an "open secret'' and areinclmed to release. We have been offered the 
opportunity to brief the Board.
