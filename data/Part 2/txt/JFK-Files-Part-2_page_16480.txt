letters that cornc to their hornes by.ni~ht. Underground 
partic-s cannut distribute leaflets announcing an ~inter-

tencies of the So-'-calle<l revolutionaric~. The so-called 
revolutionarit'S are in fact afraid of the very danger that 
they arc advocating for the people. These so-~alled revo­
lutionaries want the people h> say what 'l'hey themsel'6es, 
are .afraid to .say, an-~l the p~vple to do· what they them­
St:lVt:S are afraid to <lo. This ,uakes thc . .iv-c'alled revolu-

If these impostCrs would investig_~te the history of 
rcvQlution, they would see tl_1at the van~uard group always 
starts out above ground and js ·tater driven u:1derground 
by the aggressor. The Cub3n Revolution exernplifies this 
fact; when Fidel Castro started to resist the butcher 
Batista and the An,erican rtmn.ing dogs, he started by 
speaking on the ca"1'1pus of the University of Havana in 
public. He was later dr.iven to thP i'l·11ls. • His irnpa~t upon 
the dispossess en people of Cuba was vc ry gr eat~nd re­
ceived with tnuch respect. When he went into secrecy,· 
•. Cuban people searched hin1 out. People went to the hills 
to find him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the 
revolutionary struggle correctly. If the Chinese Revolu­
tion is investigated, it w~ll be seen that the Communist 4 
Party was quite on the surface so that they would be able 
to muster support from the rnasses. There are many 
~ . . 
areas one can read about to learn the correct approach, 
. such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution, 
• Fanon's THE WRETCHED OF THE EAR TH, the Russian 
.Revolution, the works of Chairman ?v1ao Tse-tung, and a •• -~ of others.
