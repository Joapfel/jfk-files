E SECTION 107. SECURITY INFORMANTS[AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES) 
-During i.ni tial s·tages I development and on occasion alive info~mants 
may raise a personal question concerning their own position if it 
becomes known publicly that they are affiliated with a subversive 
organization. In the event a potential informant or informant inquir.es 
as to -what can be done for him in such a case, he may be told that 
his cooperation is a matter of record in the FBI and if some question 
a~ises concerning his loyalty we will consider making the facts of his 
cooperation with the FBI known to his employer or to the responsible 
individuals. It should be pointed out that this action may make· it 
impossible for him ·to continue on behalf of the FBI and the service 
which he is performing for his country may be terminated. Bef·ore • 
taking steps to advise anyone of a potential informant 1 s or informant's 
cooperation, prior B1treau authority must be obtained. 
Specifically advis~ each potential informant that he is not and cannot 
consider himself a Bureau employee or "undercover J\.gent 11 of the F'BI. 
In this regard, the seriousness -of violating the impersonation statutes 
must be impressed upon the informant. 
··Advise potential informant that his cooperation must be strictly confi....; 
dential at all times and if he should feel he cannot maintain this • 
confidence he should so advise. There should be no doubt left in the 
mind of the informant that his relationship must remain on a confidential 
basis and if he violates the confidence he will .be of no value and by 
so doing the Bureauts investigative activity may be jeopardized. This 
must be thoroughly impressed upon the informant before you aocep1 him 
as such. If the informant has a-special problem which would require 
his revealing his relationship to his wife, eta., this should be· learned 
from him during the initial interview and a recommendation made to the 
Bu.re au when the results of the interview are furnished. The special 
circu.rnstances will be taken into consideration by the Bureau.· : ·-
If a prospective informant is connected in any m~nner with a labor· .. 
union, inform him that the Bureau is not interested in employer-:,. 
employee relationships as such and is only concerned with obtaining 
information on the infiltration in labor unions by sub-versive elements. 
"If the potential informant is a student, teacher, or has any similar 
relations with a school, college, or university, in his initial interview 
and subsequent handling, be sure to follow current instructions concern­
ing inves•bigations on the campuses of colleges and uni-versi ties ... : • • 
}'rom the first interview with a potential informant ·l;hrough his develop­
ment and until he is discontinued, extreme caution should be used at 
a~l times to be certain he is not a plant. 
When potential informant begins to furnish current information and 
otherwise qualifies for designation as informant, assign permanent 
symbol number and advise Bureau. This communication must be personally 
initialed by SAC or ASAC acting in his absence; individual 1 s background 
must also be thoroughly revie·wed at this time, keeping in mind possi b:i.li ty 
of using informant as a potential witness. If individual has any 
weaknesses~ set forth safeguards being followed to insure security and 
to prevent embarrassment to Bureau.]
