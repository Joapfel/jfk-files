JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS 
On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to 
the Acting Attorney General advising him that in view of 
the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal 
Government into the rights of defendants in criminal 
trials and in ordeT to assure that future requests for 
jury panel investigations would be made only in truly 
exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should 
not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific 
written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy 
Attorney General and that our field offices were being so 
instructed.
