_b. - Concept: This to be accomplished by introducing a known biol~gical 
agent into jet fuel storage facilities. This agent flourishes in jet fuel and 
grows unfil it consumes all the space inside the tank. 
9. Operation PHANTOM: 
a. Objective: The .objective is to convince the Castr~ Government that 
clandestine penetration and resupply of agents is being re~ly conducted.

10. Operation BINGO, • i:iWt 
a. Objectiv6: The objective is, ~,.er~"~-~:~ ~ci4'11t whi~~ µs_ the ,~.e.P~~!':\J,'!!' ,_. ,~: 
of an attack on U.S. facilities (GMO) in Cuba, thus providing the excuse for 
use of U. s. military ~ight to overthrow the current government of Cuba . 
. b. Concept: This to be .accomplished by th~ use of SNAKES outside the 
confines of the.Guantanamo Base •. SNAKES simulate·an actual fire-fight and 
·upon hearing such .a sound it is-entirely feasible that the immediate reaction 
on G'Mo would be that the base is being .a~ked. This would,. with proper 
preparation, be followed by a counterattack and with adequate planning the base 
at G'Mo could disgorge military force in sufficient nUinber to sustain itseif 
until other forces, which had been previously alerted, could attack in other 
are_as·. It is envisaged that a schedule of operations similar to the following 
would overwhehn the Cuban military and cau.se its defeat: 
(1) Simulated attack on Guantanamo. 
(Z) Word flashed to the President .. 
(3) President orders -counterattack-to include: 
(a) Immediate launch of alerted aircraft whose targets are Cuban airfields. 
(b) Irninediate launch of counterattack down strategic lines in communi- • 
cation in Cuba. 
(c) Fleet force standing by on aler~ would ma.lee way toward pre-sele_cted 
targets /landing areas. 
(d) Immediate embarkation of airborne troops previously alerted to 
pre-selected targets. 
(e) Launch of additional combat aircraft to clear drop areas and 
further interdict lines of communication~ 
_(f) Ships and airc;_:r31,ft would' land/ airdrop troops and secure airfields, 
road/rail terminals, etc.
