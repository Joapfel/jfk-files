Subject: JFK Records Review Project and Lessons Learned 
The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of 
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House 
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA} and the 
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB}. It contains a

cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were 
redacted. There is no evidence in· the Collection to indicate 
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.

of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also.known as the 
pre-assassination file}~ 
* six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and 
transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992. 
• The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection 
Act of 1992 (JFK Act} was signed 26 October 1992: 
* it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination 
Records Review-Board composed of non-government 
individuals; 
* established· "a presumption of immediate disclosure" 
for records relating to.the assassination. 
For first two years of its existence, the Historical 
Review Program focused primarily on the review of JFK 
assassination records:
