the Special Group take such steps within their areas of 
authority as they think appropriate, and may I in particular 
urge that the Central Intelligence Agency, as executive agent 
for these enterprises, emphasize the importance of security 
to all those with whom it has necessary business on these 
matters, so that we can maintain the high level of security 
set in these recent operations.
