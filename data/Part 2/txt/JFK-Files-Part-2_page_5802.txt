Re: JFK-Assassination Records Collection Act of 199~­
·.r.._;-· 
Dear Mr. Tu~nei~: 
This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding 
Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JFK Act." 
I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its 
obligations to locace, review, and release "assassination 
records" as defined in the JFK Act. -The Agency's 2 September 
1998 Decla::::acion of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's 
Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms mv 
judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the .~gency's 
searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration. • 
As Direccor of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly 
responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the 
adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under 
the JFK Act. Mr .. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of 
Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with 
-- direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and 
complete. There was no more appropriate signatory. 
In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers 
have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board 
all ·relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do 
not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from 
the 3oard. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding. 
I trust thac this will meet your requirements. 
Sincerely, 
Geo!" e J. Tenec:
