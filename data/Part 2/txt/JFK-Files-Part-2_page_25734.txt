WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES {SSC) 
Reference is made to SSC letter to the U.S. 
Department of Justice dated January 14, 1976, 
requesting access to certain material and delivery of 
other material maintained by the FBI. 
Pursuant to request item numbered 17, we 
currently have one abstract covering the areas of 
inquiry available for review at FBI Headquarters by 
approved personnel of the Committee. 
Pursuant to request item numbered 18, we were 
not able to locate a copy of a cable dated on or about 
November 28, 1963, from Director, FBI, to Director, 
CIA, regarding interrogation of witriesses concerning 
Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City. We are, 
-however, furnishing a copy of an FBI to CIA teletype 
dated November 27, 1963, captioned "Lee Harvey Oswald," 
which advises that the interrogation of Oswald between 
his arrest and murder had not extended to his travel to 
Mexico or his contacts with Soviet establishments. The 
teletype, classified "Secret," also contains details 
from an Oswald letter to the Soviet Embassy, 
Washington, D. c., which were obtained from a highly 
sensitive source.
