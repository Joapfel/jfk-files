SECTION 107 •• CURITY INFORMANTS AND CONFIDE.AL SOURCES. 
(4) Separate statements should be prepared for eauh meeting or 
separate activity in which informants engage and should be 
dictated by Agent as if informant were preparing them himself. 
{5) Information, after being reduced to writing, should be read 
promptly by informant and acknowledged by affixing his code 
name on each page. In espionage and foreign nationality 
matters, such authentication is necessary only where future 
prosecution is possible. 
{6) After informant authenticates statement, contacting Agent -
should prepare cover sheet, form FD-306, which should be stapled 
to it. Thereafter stai;ement should be handled as wri tte.n one. 
(7) Oral information furnished by informant purely of lead value 
should be included in office memorandum by Agent and sho_uld 
not be initialed by informant or exhibited to him or treated 
as evidence. . 
Tra-nsmission of information 
a. Statements should be personally delivered to contacting Agent •by 
informants when possible. Careful consideration should be given to 
full security of all such contacts. They should never be mailed to 
field offic·e or resident agency. If they cannot be ·obtained per­
sonally by contacting Agent, obtain confidential post office boxes 
for their receipt. 
b. Confidential post office boxes should be obtained under fictitious· 
names and not under names of persons who may be listed in post 
office directory. More than one informant may send statements to 
a post office box, but consideration sh~uld be given to obtaining 
post office boxes in different post office stations to prevent 
suspicion on part of postal employees. 
c. Envelope enclosing statement should have return address ·of another 
confidential post office box obtained under fictitious name. 
d. Statements should be collected at post office boxes regularly, but 
time of pickup should be varied. Work out system of rotation where­
by same Agent or Agents will not appear at same post office box for -
extended period of time.• 
e. When informant receives information of vital and immediate interes.t, 
he should furnish it as promptly as possible to contacting Agent or 
office by most appropriate means of communication. 
Handling of lead information 
a. All lead information obtained from informant must be run out to 
logical conclusion. 
b. If there is insufficient information to warrant opening case, tickler 
card should be prepared to follow informant and take other logical 
steps to obtain additional identifying data. Restrict tickler cards 
to information which would warrant investigation if identity 
established. If no identification is made after reasonable eff.ort, 
prepare ~Emorandum for informant's subfile. 
Handling documentary material furnished by informants 
a. .Pamphlets and similar documentary material furnished by informants 
should have placed thereon informant's code name. 
b. Informant should affix date he received material. If informant can­
not recall date of receipt, date he furnished material should be 
affixed. 
c. No additional markings of any kind, such as initials, date received, 
permanent symbol number of informant, file numbers, indexing symbols, 
etc., should be placed on documentary .material. • 
d. Receipt of such material should be recorded on form FD-306 or on a 
channelizing memorandum containing all applicable items. See section 
107K for filing instructions.
