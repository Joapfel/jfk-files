CHAPTER 5: THE STANDARDS FOR REVIEW: REVIEW BOARD "COMMON LAW" 
ii. Commentary. The Review Board 
n·lt..•,,sed CIA sluglines : because the ~gency 
rlL'n'r offered the Review Board any evidence 
Ill '-''plain why the Board should not r~lea~e 
ti L'01. An example of a CIA sluglme 1s 
--~YBAT GPFLOOR." "RYBAT" is a CIA 
aq.,t that meant "secret," and GPFLOOR 
\,-:1~ the crypt that CIA gave Lee Harvey 
l )~\,·,,Id during its post-assassination investi­
~.1tion. CIA initially asked the Review Board 
111 ptistpone the CIAslugline even where CIA 
h,1d released the individual crypts that made 
up the..• slugline elsewhere. For example, in 
tlw case of "RYBAT GPFLOOR," the CIA 
,H'rl'l'd to release the crypt "RYBAT" in two 
1,·1:1l·cs elsewhere in the document at issue, 
,111d the CIA agreed fo release the crypt 
<. ;('FLOOR when it appeared in the text. CIA 
ti•ld the Review Board that it could not, how­
,·n·r. release the slugline "RYBAT 
l ;('Fl .OOR." CIA offered no substantive 
.1rhuments to support its request for post­
p,,,wment of the slugline. Given the statute's 
dl·m,md that CIA provide clear and convinc­
mg l'\'idence in support of its requests for 
l'"~tponement, the Rev~ew Board voted to 
1t·ll·,1s1..• CIA sluglines. 
l ·1.-\ s11rz1eillance methods. 
i. Review Board guidelines. The Review 
Uo.ud generally released CIA surveillance 
rm•thods, the details of ~eir implementation, 
,md the product produced by them where the 
l{l•view Board believed the methods were rel­
l'\·,mt to the assassination. The Review Board 
~ustained postponements of CIA surveillance 
nwthods where CIA provided convincing 
l'\'idcnce that the method still merited pro­
tl

l·tion. Where the Review Board sustained 
th~· CIA's requests for postponement of sur­
w1llance methods, it substituted the lan­
huage "surveillance method," "operational 
dl'l,1ils," or "sensitive operation." 
ii. Commentary. As with all its sources 
,md. methods, CIA initially requested the 
Review Board to postpone all of its surveil-
1.ince methods since, CIA argued, CIA cur­
rent)y conducts surveillance operations. The 
Review Board, on the other hand believed 
that it was not a secret that CIA
1 
currently 
conducts surveillance operations. Moreover, 
the Review Board did not believe that its 
votes to release CIA surv:eillance methods in 
Mexico City in 1963 would jeopardize cur-
53 
rent CIA surveillance operations. Finally, the 
Review Board recognized that certain CIA 
surveillance operations in Mexico City in 
1963 were already well-known to the public 
because the U.S. government had disclosed 
details about those operations. CIA surveil­
lance, particularly telephone taps and photo 
operations, was a major element in the story 
of Oswald's 1963 trip to Mexico City. (See 
illustration.) 
The Board, therefore, concluded that the pub­
lic interest in disclosure far outweighed any 
risk to national security and directed release 
of the information. However, in records that 
CIA proved did contain information about 
current operations, the Review Board voted 
to postpone the information.

i. Review Board guidelines. The Review 
Board used date "windows" within which it 
released the locations of CIA installations 
where the location was relevant to the assas­
sination. Specifically, the Review Board 
released the location of CIA installations 
relating to Mexico City during the time 
period 1960-1969. Likewise, the Review
