MEMORANDUM 
TO: Tom Lambeth 
FROM: Robert J. Lehher 
DATE: May 26, 1977 
SUBJECT: Con Hitchcock 
This is to request a salary adjustment from $15,000 
to $20,000 per year for Con Hitchcock. Mr. Hitchcock was 
hired in December at a salary of $15,000. The thought 
of the then Staff Director and Chief Counsel was that after 
members of the staff were working here for a period of time 
and we were able to evaluate their work, salary adjustments 
would be made. Unfortunat~ly those salary adjustments were 
never made because of the delay in reconstituting and re­
budgeting the Committee. 
Mr. Hitchcock graduated from Law School in 1975. The 
only other attorney on the King Task Force that graduated 
that year was Sheila Jackson Lee. Her salary is $23,000 
per year. 
Mr. Hitchcbck has demonstrated a quick ability to 
assimilate factual situations, gives insightful legal 
analysis of those situations and writes cogently in these 
areas. He is a definite asset to our team and one of the 
bright~~t people we have on the staff. 
I had recommended to Al Lewis this same adjustment. Mr. 
Lewis agreed and was prepared to make_::,that recommendation to 
the Committee. 
For the above reasons, I hereby recommend Mr. Hitchcock's 
salary adjustment be made forthwith.
