•·Bissell· did not recall being, infonned by Gottlieb that 
Gottlieb had represented to the Chief of Station that there 
·was Presidential authorization for the assassination of Lumumba 
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 46). But Bissell said that assuming he 
had instructed Gottlieb to carry poison to the Congo, "there 
was no possibility'' that he would have issued such an instruc­
tion without authorization from Dulles (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
p. 47). Likewise Bissell said he "probably did" tell Gottlieb 
that the mission had the approval of President Eisenhower 
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 47). This led to Bissell's conclusion 
that if; in f~ct, thi testimony of the Chief of Station about 
Gbttlieb's actions is accurate, then Gottlieb's actions were 
fully authorized: 
Q,: In light of the entire atmosphere at the Agency 
and the policy at the Agency at the time, Mr ..

the pale of Mr. Gottlieb's authority at that 
point? 
Bissell: No, it would not. (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
p. 65). 
Bissell further stated: 
Knowing Mr. Gottlieb, it is literally inconceivable 
to me that he would have acted beyond his i,nstruc-,­
tions. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 41.) 
With respect to his assignment to Justin O'Donnell to "plan 
and prepare for" the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, 
p. 24) Bissell testified that
