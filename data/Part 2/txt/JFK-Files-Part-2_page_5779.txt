Re; 0A Com9liance With the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 
Dear Mr. McNamara: -• 
Thank you for your July 29 letter regarding CIA's submission of its Final Declaration of 
Compliance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act 
of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (''JFK Act''). lam writing to address CIA's desire that one 
official certify, under oath and on behalf of the entire agency, that CIA has conducted a 
thorough search ·tor records relating to President Kennedy's assassination. _ Your letter 
and concerns were brought directly to the attention of Review Board members for their 
consideration. We understand tha~ CIA would prefer ~teach CIA Directorate not 
be required to certify separately that it has done an adequate search £or records on the 
• assassination. as the ·Review Board had requeste~. 
The Review Board specifically considered your proposal that the certifying offi~ial be a 
records validation officer appointed by the CIA's Executive Director. -The Review 
Board requests, however, that the CIA's certification be made at the highest levels of the 
CIA. The Review Bo~ believes that certification by a records validation officer would 
be insufficient to assure, to the fullest extent possible, public.confidence in the CIA's 
representations that it has searched for and released all relevant materials -relating to 
President Kennedy's assassination. In view of the importance of the CIA's tormal _ 
representations regarding its holdings on Lee Harvey Oswald and President Kennecly

s 
assassination, the Review Board requests that CIA's Final Declaration of Compliance be 
certified, under oa~ both.py CIA's Executive Director and its General Counsel. 
I ask that CIA confirm. that it will agree to trus·m.anner of certification.
