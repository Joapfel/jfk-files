Issues and Questjons 
Why were no minutes vritten? 
Does context shov that phrase "his 
associate" refers to President 
EISENHOWER? 
Did such consideration involve 
assassination plotting? 
2 
Was this "package deal" the simultaneous 
triple assassination plot that was 
mentioned on November 3, 1960? 
Does this simultaneous_ disappearance 
plan refer to assassination planning? 
Is there a connection between this 
Special Group discussion and the NSC 
discussion on March 14, 1960, re a plan 
to remove Cuban leaders?
