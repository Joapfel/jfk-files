Comment: 
F : 
NOSENKO had most recently asserted that he met 
GRIBANOV socially only three times during his 
KGB service, and on each ·occasion TARABRIN was 
present. NOSENKO said he twice provided girls 
for GRlBANOV and TARABRIN, once in October or 
November 1963 in circumstances similar to those 
referred to. NOSENKO said that TARABRIN was 
Chief of the British Department from 1958 to 
1963, when he became Deputy Chief of "Service 
No. 2", the reorganized Counterintelligence 
Department of the First Chief Directorate.
