Talking Points for meeting with ARRB Executive Director, 
Laura Denk -- 4:00 p.m., 17 Aug. 1998 
Meeting is primary a "Meet and Greet" 
Laura will be looking for reaffirming of commitment to 
complete the tasks still outstanding and to meet the 
deadline for the Final Declaration. She may also bring up 
the subject of a "Memo of Understanding" on what is to be 
done after the Board goes out of business. 
Current Status: 
Sequestered Collection 
The re-review is virtually complete-- the remaining material 
(approximate two boxes) is mostly security files) 
[Note: In the review controversial, complicated or Denied 
in Full documents were white-banded for later processing; I 
currently have a team of 3 reviewers going through the 
collection handling these problem documents. A number of 
these could lead to potential appeal issues. It will take 
2-3 weeks to complete the white band review.]
