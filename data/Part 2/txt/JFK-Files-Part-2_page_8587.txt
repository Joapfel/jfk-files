Cult of Intelligence by Marchetti and Marks 
1. The responsible and knowledgeable components of this 
dir~ctorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from. subject 
book per your request. The review was made to determine whether 
each deletion was still classified under EO 11652 or whether the 
information in each deletion has been officially released by the.· 
U.S. Government. 
2. Attached, Tab A, is a list of the deleted items reviewed 
by this directorat~. Tab Bis a list of those items of primary 
interest of this directorate. All of these items remain classi-
fied; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released. Tab C 
is a list of those items which we determined are still classified 
under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be 
released, but we recommend that all· of the i terns .in Tab C be. 
coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab Dis a list of 
items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and 
should be referred to other indicated elements. Tab Eis a list 
of the foqr items mentioned above which we believe portions can 
now be released. The portions in red brackets remain classified 
and should not be released. 
3. Since many of the deleted items involved the Nation~l 
Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina­
tions· through our contacts at NSA. We were told that any 
coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General 
Counsel. As a result, no further coordination with.other ele•. 
ments was attempted.
