Mr, Baron. Back on the record, 
Although the top of thia cable doea not indicate where 
the cable was sent to and from, because ve don•t have the 
cover sheet tor the cable, you have indicated to me by looking 
at the designations that this cable muat have been aent from 
Leopoldville to headguartera, ia that correct, Hr. Tweedy? 
Hr. Tweedy, That ia correct. 
Mr. Baron. Let me direct your attention to paragraph 
7 which says, 
•station checking recurring reports ot Kaeavubu Lu.mumba 
reconcilation. Kaaavubu denies Bolikango failed deny 
possibility of Lumumba entering new government, possibly 
as vice Premier. Believe some substance to rumor but will 
do best prevent if Lumu.mba allowed even minor role he moat apt 
come out on top". 
Does that indicate to you that tho Chief of Station 
in the Congo at this point continued to be extremely concerned 
th11t J.umumba should not be a.lloweU even .a .minor role in the 
government of the Congo? 
Mr. Tweedy. That is what it says. 
Mr. Daron. Next, as Exhibit 4, we have a cable dated 
January 19, 1961. 
{The document referred to was 
marked Tweedy F.xhibit No. 4
