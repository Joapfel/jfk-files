Biographical background 
Opinions on PFIAB generally 
Never heard of E«ecutive Action 
"I know of no plan,plot, operational organization that 
ever came to President Eisenhower with-respect ao any __ 
assassinations,"XKM.(2272-3) 
In 1960, Eisenhower "approved a four point program, smkm:t 
sabotage, ~tepped up economi~ sanctions, propaganda, 
and the :t)u: training of Cuban refugees" • 
There was one xe "well known individual" on PFIAB 
who would ask at each CIA briefing on Vietnam "have you 
considered trying to bump off some of the leaders-in North. 
Vietnam". '.fmem!RmAl::m~mim:m::!llxma: Gray says that "Agency policy 
11 
was against assassination on the ground that it didn't-­
accomplish anything". 
"I know of no (assassination) plan or operational 
capability that has ever been authorized at any high 
level of government~ 
Rmemidem At a meeting with Gray and a representative 
of the CIA in 1958, "the President told me that he wanted­
the 54/12 gropp to pass upon all activities of this 
government which impinged upon the sovereignty or the 
people of some other nation .... President Eisenhower was 
very sensitive to the ~ecessity of having the top peopla 
in government from the appropriate agencies pass upon 
the wisdom, and in some cases, feasibility of those 
kinds of operations." 
Gray is unenthusiastic about proposal for Joint Congression 
al :m::oversight committee because of danger of leaks 
Gray recommends creation of a ''chief intelligence officer" 
(either the DCI or a Special Assist. to the Pres. for Int.) 
8 iRYJf~~O: Gray did not recall Ambasiado~ Farland's 
report in May, 1960 that dissidents in the Rom. Rep .. wantedt;< 
high powered rifles with telescopic scopesx: and subsequentl=":, 
received authorization to provide them by the Assist. Secy -
of State through the DCI. 
Gray did not recall Special Group meetings at end of Eisen­
hower Admin. (11/29/60; 1/12/61) at which it was agreed to 
furni~h arms to dissidents in the Dom.Rep. 
--"I would think our concern was, if we had that kind of 
conc~rn, was with being of assistance to the dissidents, 
and not assasssination, or that kind of activity."
