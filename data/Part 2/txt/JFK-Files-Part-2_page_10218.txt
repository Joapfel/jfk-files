Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation·in a 
letter to The ~~shin~tcn Po~~ and said that the.polygraph 
exaraina tions h.3.~ oce:n ccr1-:iUC ted by another agency. • Specu­
lation centcree around the Agency, but after a ~ay or so, 
press speculation in this regard died a~ay. • 
8. Menl86 app~r~ntly hai never been satisfied 
and has been pressing ~Ir. Charles Bray, State Department 
spokesman, for confir~ation of Agency involvement. Mr. 
Bray learned today that ldenl86 plans to use a press 
conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press 
this point further. Mr. Bray has b~cn given guidance by 
Mr. Gentile to avoid confirm~tion but if this is imp·ossible' 
he will indicate the exar.tinations were conducted by State 
Department Security officials utiliting an operator and 
a machine detailed to the Depar.tmen~ for this puTposc. I 
do n0t know whether or not the fact that the governraent·wide 
investiga-J::Son was directed-by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to 
Iden 186 but I suspect that it is find that this is , the 
reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David 
Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an 
internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the 
White House "as satisfied that no Agency employee was 
the source.
