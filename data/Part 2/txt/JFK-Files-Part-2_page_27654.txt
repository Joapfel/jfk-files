July 28, 1977 
For several weeks in November 1976, I worked with the Committee in the capacity 
of attorney. It occurred to me recently that for the periods I was on the payroll, deductions 
were made for federal retirement; however, at the time of my leaving I failed to execute 
the necessary forms to withdraw those contributions. 
At your convenience, I would appreciate receiving from you the necessary application 
to withdraw the contributions made by me to the retirement fund. Please return the 
necessary application to me at the letterhead address. Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
JK/mz
