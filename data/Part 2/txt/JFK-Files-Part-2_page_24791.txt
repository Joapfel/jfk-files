Dominican Republic. Noted the President's 
view that the United States should not 
initiate the overthrow of Trujillo before 
we knew what government would succeed him, 
and that any action against Trujillo should

Although the precise dates are uncertain, Dearborn was 
recalled to Washington to participate in drafting of these 
contingency plans and recommendations. Dearborn was in Washing­
ton at least from May 10 through May 13, 1961. 
While in Washington, Dearborn met with State 
Department personnel and with :Richard Goodwin and Arthur 
Schlesinger of the White House staff. Hhen testifying before 
the Committe·e, he was unable to recall the substance of 
his discussions with Goodwin and Schlesinger, aside from his 
general assumption that the current situation in the Dominican 
Republic was discussed. He did not recall any discussion with 
Good1.-vin or Schlesinger concerning arms, either those which had 
been passed to the dissidents or those which were being sought. 
(Dearborn, 7/29, pp. 58-61) Dearborn left the meetiny at the 
White Bouse, however, with the firr.i impression that Goodwin had been 
reviewing cable traffic between Washington and the Dominican 
Republic and was very familiar with events as they then stood.
