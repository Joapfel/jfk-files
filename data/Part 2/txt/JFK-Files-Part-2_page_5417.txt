• TWO, is another potential intelligence benefit to the 
Russian service . 
. • This specific release could arguably provide them with insights 
into our capability to assess the bona fides of defectors. 
• The Russian service knows if IJDECANTER was real; the CIA does 
not k_now this for certain. 
• THIRD, is an equitable 'issue. 
• "The CIA has never officially confirmed that PAPUSHIN was a 
defector in our custody and under our control; 
• The CI~ has pledged to protect the relationship; 
• _;While we aclgl_o.wledge that that it is publ-icly known at least to 
some degree -- nevertheless his wife, child ~nd father remain 
in Russia today vulnerable to whatever official or unofficial 
action the current government might take. 
• Quite candidly, I can not predict with any certainty whether 
the Russian government today would take action agai_nst the 
. family from this proposed release. 
• But I would urge caution here since the information at issue is 
minimal, not critical to the public understanding, and arguably 
harmful to living persons.
