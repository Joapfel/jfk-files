Re: JFK Testimi:mv • - <q_,: ~ ' 
Attached is the draft JFK testimony, as prepared by OCA.~ ~ 
draft has been coordinated with OGC, the Center for the Study~~ 
Intelligence- (both Dave Gries and Ken McDonald), and the DO. The• 
handwritten edits are mine and Dave Gries". A briefing book with 
Q's and A's will be ready by COB Friday. As Stan"s cover note 
suggests, the testimony must be coordinated with others in the 
Executive; OCA's preference is to send it out tomorrow. 
Dave and I agree that the section of the draft testimony 
commenting on the proposed legislation (pp. 7 et seq.) is too long 
and runs the risk of overwhelming the positive message you relay 
in the first part of the statement. It seems to me that while you 
should lay down your objections to the legislation's scheme 
clearly (and even forcefully), you should do so in language that 
will leave the impression (which is consistent with the reality) 
that (1) you are in agreement with their basic objecti~s relating 
to the material in question and (2) that you are doing, and will 
continue to do, all that you can to accommodate the release of 
material consistent with your statutory obligations. 
In particular I think it unnecessary to reiterate your 
"statutory responsibility to protect sources and methodsu more 
than a couple of times. Moreover, I think the paragraph on the 
definition of •assassination material• (middle of p.9) unnecessary 
and potentially counterproductive. One of the impetuses for the 
JFK resolution, after all, is the notion (crazy or not) that 
previous inquiries were insufficient in scope; this paragraph 
feeds right into that criticism. Some of the other "technicalN 
criticisms (i.e., paragraphs on pp. 9-10) seem important to make 
(especially if the basic model of the legislation is adopted) but 
might be better included in a post-hearing letter to the committee 
or something. Again, otherwise I fear you run the risk of leaving 
the perception of trying to nitpick the concept of JFK material 
declassification to death.
