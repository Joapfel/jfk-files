could you think of anything which would be of benefit to this 
Committee that we have not inquired into? 
Mr. Houston. The only thing I thought you might ask that -r 
I 
I thought you were going to mention it -- somewhere, and this isl 
v~ry vague in my mind, both where I heard it, in what context, 
and what the timing of the event was, but I have heard and I am 
sure you must have h2ard of the nelivery of a sniper's rifle 
to the Embassy in Havanna, which may have been intended for 
some sort of assassination attempt. 
Mr. Schwarz. The Embassy when we still had an Embassy 
there? 
Mr. Houston. It was apparently when we still had the 
Embassy. 
Mr. Kirbow. Was this a couchdd delivery, covert 
delivery, much like the later deliveries into the Dominican 
Republic? 
Mr. Houston. I think so. 
I don't know much about it. I just, through a vague 
recollection, I don't know any details or any specifics, it's 
one of the things you pick up. 
Mr. Kirbow. When would that have been? I am trying to 
date when we no longer had an Embassy there. 
Mr. Wides. [~~lfl~~~j, I think ~1;,1NQli.l was ~fn:e~;s-:t:a;t:gg:!}· 
[c:t.riS'i::i'•~.;~:~J.~;m-:~N6'1.l'~, and I believe he left in Ia te 19 59. 
Mr. Kirbow. Was that about the correct time?
