any recollection of such a report nor do I have any other recol­
lection of learning by another source of any of the substance 
of the discussion at that meeting.· 
6. It is likely that I was present.at the meetinr, at the 
Pentaeon to which Mr. Dillon's affidavit refers. However, I do 
not remember.if I was at this particular meetinr;; nor do I re­
member whether I was present at any meeting at the Pentagon where 
the question of assassinating Patrice Lwnumba was raised. 
7. It is my general opinion that it would be improper for 
the Director of Central Intelligence to undertake an assassinatio? 
operation without an express directive from the President.
