We are told by Mr. Bissell, who appnrently was not only 
a very good friend of yours, but also a very good friend of Mr. 
Rostow's --
Mr. Bundy. That is right. 
The Chairman. -- a man whose credibility as a witness 
would seem to have to be respected -- that he was at least 
engaged in developing such a capability on direct instructions 
from the White House. 
But when we pressed him for specifics, his testimony 
becomes very vague. lie can't remember just who it was who 
told him, he can't dispute the record, which says that in effect, 
he so advised Mr. Harvey when he enqilqcd Mr. Harvey to develop 
the cap11bility . And everyone else of high authority in 
the Administration that we have questioned so far testifies 
i::, !I that it was not the policy of the Administration to engage in 
il. ~-0 ,I assassination, and no such attempts were ever authorized,

and indeed, with the exception of one occasion in the Special 
Group, the subject never even surfaced for discussion. 
And when it did, if it did, it wns quickly shot down. 
Nevertheless, the CIA was in fact emharr:ecl upon such 
~ attempts during the period under review. ;..:: '.

the witnesses that have cornc before us, for integrity and
