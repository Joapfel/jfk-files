2. Harvey's Testimony Concerning Authority 
a. I larvey' s Perception of Authority 
Harvey stressed that at all times he was acting as a line officer re­
porting to his immediate superior within.the Agency, the Deputy Director for 
covert actions (first Bissell, then Helms.)* (Harvey, 6/25, p. 83). 
Similarly, Harvey also pointed out that his information with respect 
to authorization from outside the agency came from the Deputy Director: 
"(a)t no time during this entire period ... did I ever personally 
believe or have any feeling that I was either free-wheeling or 
end~nmning or engaging in any activity that was not in response 
to a considered, decided U. B. policy, properly approved, admittedly, 
perhaps, or through channels and at levels I personally had no in­
volvement in, or first-hand acquaintance with, and did not consider 
it at that point my province to, if you...will, cross-examine either 
the Deputy Director or the Director concering it. 11 (Harvey 6/25, 
p. 83.)
