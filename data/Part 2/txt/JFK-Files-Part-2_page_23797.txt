Mr. Bader. The CIA? 
Mr. Kirbow. Yes.

, Mr~ Bader. I would assume that they would have extended 
their prohibition to.this, or on the other hand one could argue 
I don 
I
t know what. their motives were .. It could have been they 
6 felt that this, the first ste'p they took was the one that was 
? dealing with what the public was demanding.

Mr. Kirbow. Well, I really don't see anything in our 
record or any evidence that they have given us or anything 
other than a staff position on this which we. are trying t~ 
I f 
sell the Committee that this is a harmful procedure. \' 
Senator Huddleston. What this does is extends beyond 
13 the practice of journalists to any other person, be it an 
I . . 
14 executive or clerk pr typist or whatever, .on the assumption 
I 
15 that you can't be a little bit pregnant. If the agency is 
16 going to.be subverted anywhere, not the agency, i~ the insti-
17 tution of the press is, that it is going to be subverted.,

,Mr. Bader. Mr,. Chairman, the Agency has accepted the 
I 
basic principle, because it has removed from its list of 
operational assets a rather larger number than .this would 
call for. 
Mr. Kirbow~ But if I hear correctly what you are saying 
23 then, we are out to protect the American media from being made 
24 pregnant by the CIA: and not worrying at· all about the reading 
25 public or the other,.but just the media.
