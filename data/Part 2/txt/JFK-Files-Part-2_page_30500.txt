allowed any cover-up or any destruction of evidence which migh~ 
shed some light on iJilie assassination of President Kennedy. 
I might add a little vignette. We had what it called a 
Libra ~.Pecima which is a book that the people signed when 
they come to a funeral or something. You may have run into 
something like this in the states~ when you go in and sign 
in at the funeral parlor that you were there or something. 
You express your:. regrets -- ~" pecima, in Spanish, means regrets 
or sorrow. 
We had a book down in the lobby of the Embassy building 
and when I came out one day shortly after the assassination 
-somebody in the crowd yelled Spanish for Bob, and I went over 
and ,it ~ was the Governor of the State of Sonora, which is 
a big state up iri northwestern Mexico. I had known him some 
years earlier. He was the-son of the General who was the 
outstanding military leader of the Mexican Revolution from 
about 1913 to about 1920. 
Eis father had been President of Mexico1.-- His father was 
assassinated, havirig. been elected to a second term. He was 
already elected; he had not taken office. 
I was profoundly touched by the presence of this son of 
\f an assassinated President in the lobby of our Embassy to, in 
i 
23 jJ turn, express his sorrow to us for the assassination of our
