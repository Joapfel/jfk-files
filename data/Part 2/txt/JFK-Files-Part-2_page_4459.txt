To illustrate the results of this opecational data, we.have 
recently been preparing the recruitment in place or defection ot 
one of the 'Principal officers of the Cuban Foreign~ervice in 
Europe. We have been able to .develop the proposals through an 
alreadv defected diplomat and the effectiveness of his approach 
and a reading on the diplomats reactions can be provided to us 
independently by three other agents in close contact with him as 
well as through a technical surveillance operation.

Some of these services are worlc.ing closely with the Task Force 
both in Washington and Miami, cutting corners on procedure, 
protocol and act.ually exceeding thei,r own official instruction■. 
This has been particularly true after the announcement of the 
Presidont on 22 October 1962. The degree of this effort is 
remar~c.ablo and runs all the way from full cooperation to an 
outstanding exertion of personal commitment, resourcefulness, and 
imagination to find ways to help our effort.
