Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan 
RE: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR 
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND 
MR. SARGENT SHRIVE~, DIRECTOR OF THE 
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY 
DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967 
MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO 
In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky 
authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the 
Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph T. Mulloy, an 
employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state 
sedi'tion charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press· 
a report prepared by an OEO investigator which contained state­
ments attributed to the FBI. An articl'e concerning this mat_ter 
appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star." 
The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous 
protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appe·aring 
in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening 
Star." In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they 
can't or won't give us the necessary assurances against leaks, 
we will cut off all investigative services to OtOo" 
Such a protest was lodged ~hrough liaison with 
Mr. Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEb, on 9/5/67 who advised 
that steps had ·been taken to insure that such did not recur 
in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.

attention of outright-seditious statements on the part of anti­
poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,joined the United 
Planning <lrganization, Washington, D. C., as a $50-a-day consultant 
on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67 Barry 
reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th 
Precinct, Metropolitan Police ·Department, at which time he 
denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would
