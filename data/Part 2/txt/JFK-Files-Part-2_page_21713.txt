most likely. 
Mr. Baron. And neither of those two men are alive today? 
Mr. Hunt. That's right. 
Mr. Baron. Did whoever gave you the information about 
Boris Pash indicate to you that there were any other units 
in the CIA that could take care of such problems by means of 
assassination? 
Mr. Hunt. No. My distinct impression and recollection 1s 
g the function, if indeed it existed, and I believed it then 
10 to have existed as I do today, was centralized or focused in 
11 Colonel Pash and 
Mr. Baron. Now what would have been the formal title 12 
13 of the unit, that Colonel Pash and. were running?

Mr. Hunt. ~fit had one, I never knew it. 
Mr. Baron. Can you add any other detail to the recorj 
16 on your talk with Colonel Pash and his reaction to your 
17 request that he consider on a general level the planning of 
18 an assassination of a suspected double agent? 
19 Mr. Hunt. Well, as I recall it, my conversation with ~ i:n 
20 was a relatively brief one. I stepped in the door, met him, 
21 saw who I knew briefly, or at least knew him 
~ 22 by sight, and I sat down and I said, we have this _problem in 
.; 
~ 23 the Albanian branch. We may need somebody liquidated in 
24 Western Germany. Can you handle it if that day comes, or if 
25 it comes to that?
