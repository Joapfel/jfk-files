another tragedy such as this occur, could we use the lessons learned in the 
model of this review board to prevent the significant time lag between the date 
of event and the eventual release of documents for public review? 
REP. STOKES: I would hope, Mr. LaTourette, that we have learned some lessons. 
Firstly, here in the Congress we'd no longer have such a rule in effect, an~ 
that will help us, I think, tremendously. 
But also, I think, by the agencies now working with a review panel of this sort 
and realizing that many of the type of documents which they will cite to you in 
their testimony - for instance, there's a very interesting document that they 
will talk about, where the whole page, with the exception of just the date and 
the name of a country - everything was redacted. And under their work, that 
whole page has been released, and everyone can read that. 
What you do by that is that you're to allay all the suspicion as to what really 
has been redacted and people can really see. And then you can't have the kind 
of rumors and myths that grow up around it.
