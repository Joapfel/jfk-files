2. The nature of the Sutton meeting was such that fetJ siE11ifi.cant scientific 
positions Wl'.lre taken: however, in gt?neral, the;,~uality of the paneri:; ~

Pol::md (1), South Africa· .(1), and the US (7). • 
3. To the extent that the proper "h3lf-life for lead in rn3n11 was discussed, 
the consensus appeared to he thnt (a) the loss rate crln not he represented 
3s a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on b3boons and 
be~gle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of ti~e ~o provide a 
measure of the "last slow r3te loss constant"; (c) it is likely that le3d 
and radium loss rates will differ because of the selective reutilization of .,, 
Pb in bone. D n3rltrop (UI<) and U$·researchers have been performing 
experiments which indicate that lea·d is not bound· by red cell. membranes, \ 
but ac sites in the cell interior. \ 
4. C R F.ill (UK) provi:ded a useflll sut:lmary of the contribution of polonium 
to human radiation dose. lie stipulated that the distribution of polonium 
will depend on whe::her it is administerecl as polonium per se or is allowed 
to gro;,• in an anim3l as the dnughtcr of an inzcsted parent. This is a 
signific~nt consideration to biological researchers engaged in dose 
calculation work.
