Only the documents that we had from them have been released as

REP. MINK: In other words, in reference to Oswald 
everything that you had in your possession, regardless of 
whether it belonged to other agencies·; ·because you found them to 
be declassified, have all been released? • 
GATES: That's my understanding, yes, ma'am. 
REP. MINK: Now, there is a·Washington Post article of 
May 14th which suggests that the materials that have been 
disclosed with reference to Lee Harvey Oswald contain nothing 
new. Is that your understanding also of the documents that you 
released to the archives? 
GATES: As I indicated earlier ,---.Lam certainly no 
student of this material. I do not know the answer to that 
question.
