• Our experience is that statutory mandates such as the JFK Act are very inefficient. The specific 
requirements of the act, including Board administrative decisions, required us to : 
• Address all possibly related documents, no matter ho_w insignificant. 
• Engage in lengthy negotiation processes over an almost endless number of documents. 
• Establish databases for management of the documents and worldlow _ l,;f 
• Treat documents in ways different from all other release programs. ...,.y- J uf J 4 .v if ....... 1~~

• Our expectation is that there will be more of such mandates, including the recently enacted Nazi 
War Crimes Disclosure Act. Similar proposals are under consideration for human rights violations in 
central america. What we have learned from our JFK experience is that: 
• We need to remain in very close coordination with the Oversight body to assure that we are 
not going down the wrong street and will have to repeat efforts. 
• We have found that annuitants "who know the territory'' can be extremely valuable as a 
resource for finding and understanding the senstitivity of material. 
• We know that we have to organize within the Agency and to gain agreement early on with 
regard to strategies for managing the effort, including agreement on what the final product is to 
be and how we are to get there. 
• We also need to keep senior management attention on what we are doing so that they are not 
surprised at the end, which not only causes delays in an orderly process but can lead to 
significant misunderstandings between senior participants. 
• We are trying to apply these lessons learned to our planning for the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure 
Act.
