First, while adr,iittedly there are contra­
dictions in the Agericy's written records, 
these records never1.heJess suggest that ·an· 
impulse camera was ·n operatiOD when Oswald 
visited the Cuban Er1bassy. Such a camera 
would have automatically been triggered 
to photograph any p,:rson entering the .Embassy. 
In addition, i~ has been determined by this 
Committee that Oswa· d entered and exited 
..... -· -· from th e C u ban a n d : ; o v i e t comp o u n d s o n a t 
least five separate occasions, resulting: in 
a total of ten oppo··tunities during which 
Oswald could have b,?en photographed by CIA 
surveillance camera:;. The existence of an 
Agency photograph of Oswald has been further 
corroborated by CIA personnel ~oth in Mexico 
City and at Agency ,eadquarters who claim to. 
have seen this mate·ial. • 
Finally, on OitJber 6, 1978, a manuscript 
written by the late Win Scott; former Chief 
of Station of _the ClA's Mexi~o City Station, 
was reviewed by a staff member of this Commit­
tee. While the tri ticism can be ofiet·ed t:iat 
Scott's manusctipt 1as not yet been established 
as a true record, r!levant portions of this 
manuscript do sugge;t that the contents are· 
~ccurate and that photographs of Oswald·were 
in fact obtained by the CIA'·.s Mex·ico City sur­
v~illance operation;. At page 273 of the manuscript, Scott wrote: 
These visits and co~Versations i~e 
not heresay; for persons watching thes~ 
embassies photographed Oswald as he 
entered and left each one; and clocked the 
time he spent on each visit. The 
conversations are also known to have taken· 
place~ including the one in which he told the
