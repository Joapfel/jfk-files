death, but they see it as a resl!lt of 
' exile politics, according to a. recent 
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel~ .

THERE HA VE been theories re­
cently propounded to show why

. inely shocked by the news. 
• It has since been learned that 
probably in the very hour IIFK was 
shot, a one-time Castro supporter 
was receiving a poison pen device 
from a CIA agent in what was a 
long-running anti-Castro 'effort. 
That Cuban agent was code~named:• 
AM/LASH, and he has since been 
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now 
imprisoned in Cuba for his a~sassi• •

Kennedy discussed the ramific~: 
tions of a Castro assassination. 
Smathers has since said Kennedy 
rejected the. idea and that the dis• 
cussion was more of a ''.brain-pick• 
ing" session. 
AT LEAST one high-level CIA 
official did testify he believed the 
White House. was being briefed on · 
the plots but according to Richard 
Bissell, one of the officials who 
originally decid.ed to use Rosselli, it 
was through the· method of "plau• 
sible deniability." • • 
T,hat, according to the recent 
Senate report, ''can also lead to the 
use of euphemism and circumlocu-· 
tion, which are designed to allow 
the President and other senior offi­
cials to deny knowledge of an op­
eration should it be disclosed." • 
Another alleged link between' 
the White House and the under­
world plotters, first made public by 
the Senate Committee, has also 
been denied by virtually everyone 
involved. Judith· Campbell Exner, 
the woman who claims to have 
been friend and lover to both Gian-
• cana and JFK, introduced to both 
by Frank Sinatra, was not .a link in..:., 
the Castro plotting,· those close' to "ii, 
both Giancana and. Kennedy have-': 
said. • • 
A MAN with access to Kenne•

ald recently, "The- Giancana-Ros­
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner
