rr~ject, the actual payments made by Mexico City 
St:ition per the ·terms of each Memor·andwn -of Oral . 
Ccn:i::itm~_nt (1-IOC) and in accordance 'with Mexican 
law and .cus.tom exceeded the estimate for termination 
costs made !1y Headquarters at the time the Amendment 
_w:as requested_. Te.rmination payments made to each

The long tenure of three of the terminated 
a.g_ents, the relatively high monthly salary of 
KVFACTOR·Z ($440) plus the computation of the 
ter.:iination payments in accordance with Mexican 
l3W and custom were the primary reasons that the 
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573. 
S. All agent terminations were accomplished 
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks 
were apparent at the time of the terminations 
3lthough any one, or all, of the terminated agents 
may at some future date decide to divulge to an 
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project 
opera.tions, KDFACTOR-Z, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6 
h:ive worked in photo surveillance operations for 
the Station since 19S6 and, therefore, obviously 
have ~onsidcrable knowledge of targets, former 
safesite~, personnel, and modus operandi of the 
Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was 
not concerned with incompatible operations or 
t3rgets, we believe the risks of damage to Station 
relations with the Mexican Government in the event 
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project cperations by a 
terminated agent are within acceptable limits. 
6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project 
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
-~ to cover the costs of terminating five agents 
and tKo basehouse surveillance sites under this 
project.
