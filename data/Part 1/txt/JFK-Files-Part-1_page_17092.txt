SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY 
1. WH Division requests renewal of LIEMPTY for the 
19-month period 1 -December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in 
tho amount of $69,725~ While this represents a slight 
reduction-on a pro rata basis fro~ the $45,000 for which 
_ LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month pC'riod stni·ting 
1 Dccombe1· 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest 
increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the 
estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the pust 
project year. This will provide for small salary increases 
to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents 
involved-in the project who have not received raises in 
some time as well as for slightly higher ronta l fees for 
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth 
year, is designed p1·imarily to provide for the collection 
_oI operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Me::-tico 
--City, including the identification and muv<.'ntcnts of its 
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY-provides 
for the maintenance and exploitation of threi basehouses 
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the 
Soviet Embassy and a ~obile basehouse in the form of n. 
panel ·truck used for mobile photography against the Polish 
Embassy, leaders and meeting sites of loca 1 communist 
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important 
co-rollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in 
the form of countersurvel llanco for Agency personnel and 
operations, including those of other bases and stations 
as tho needs and requirements of the, Mexico Station permit. 
The funds roqu~sted include $43,520 for the period 1 
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional 
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30 
June 1969, The lntter funds are asked for in a supple­
mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.
