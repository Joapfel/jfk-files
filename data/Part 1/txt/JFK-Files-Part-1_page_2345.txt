C. Has NOSENKO given an .acce;etable explanation·of his 
motivation in contacting CIA in.1962 and for his defection in 1964? -~ Of 
the eight listed categories which arE! bei~g given specific consideration 
in the matter of the bona £ides of NOSENKO,. this category is probably 
the most difficult in which to present a log~cal position with factual 
support. There are too many intangible aspects ·involved and although 
motivation is an important factor,· full resolution of the ~otivation 
problem is not a paramount factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or 
-~: is not a dispatched agent .. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision. 
Defectors are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit 
unfavorable information which they consider of a personal nature. 
On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following a request, furnished a 
handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of 
which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct, 
is quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo­
randum is one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.
