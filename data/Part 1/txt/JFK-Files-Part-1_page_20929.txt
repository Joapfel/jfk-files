BACKGROUND ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Until 3 March 
1954 
1. -A basfc document in consideration of this request ts HCSA-825, 
dated 4 February. 1954. 
2. I was runnfn'J an English-language newspaper in Santiago, Chfle 
() when-asked to work with our Station there. My first pay was $50.00 per 
\'091 .. ~t.. month. The file contains a project approval dated 31 May 1950; TCS-A-
(
, • l. 1064 asks that the first payment be made to the U.S. ·bank on 1 August 
bt-.,. .. 1 ....... ,1950. 
I ,,. 
1.o,-,·-'••'• ,. 3. Ourfng this period I recall a number of activHies undertaken 
for the Station, and J· travelled to New York for clandestine tra.lnlng. 
The file indicates ·'He was originally approved operationally t-, handle 
0"-6·;,/; the complex Soviet espionage case of .FULMINATEP.-2. ·His conduct of this 
·- c case was considered-excellent .... " Also, "It will be recalled that 
Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job ... w_hich he had done." 
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be­
hind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing 
leaflets, -booklets, etc. I also handled agents and did a number of 
spotting ~nd-assessing jobs for the Station. 
4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month 
whkh ran until the tennination date of 31 August 1953. (Actually thfs 
was fn the form ·of a loa~ which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The 
advance.was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do 
certain work for the Station, but whkh I retained.)·· 
5. After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in Chfle 
until 4 March 1954. Ourir~ this period I recruited a CP agent who still 
works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 Febru­
ary 1954 Headquarti!rs asktil that I be made available for another assigrvnent. 
The Station pointed out th-lt I was working on the recruitment, and that I 
and rny family ·t1ere phoning on·,1 European vacatic.n. Headqu,11'ters again 
requested my assigm_ient. Thus I ~eparted for the Guatemala project tn 
early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for 
tJy' adve'rtising in•m; paper} and leaving my fa;nfl:, behind to pack up. I 
accepted this 3ssignment without knowing where it was, or for how long ft 
would last. Indeed l did not even have a contract.
