(c) Responsibility for n'laintenance of the physical 
security file on the United States Embassy. 
(d) Acting in place of Vladislav KOVSHUK, Chief, 
First Section, when KOVSHUK was absent. 
As can be seen from the above,·_ the responsibilities of NOSENKO; 
by his definition, which. are borne out by specific information furnished 
by NOSENKO, would not coincide with the normal responsibilities of a 
Deputy Chief of Branch or Section in CIA._ An analyst can either accept 
or reject the theory that there is necessarily an equation between t:he 
,. 
responsibilities of a Deputy Chief in CIA and the 1GB, but ii the analyst 
accepts the theory, he must offer some supporting evidence o:::.. this point~ 
Pag:es 151 - 261 of the previous summary contained comments 
a·nd conclusions and sub-conclusions in regard to the claimed service 
of NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of First Section, First Depart::.n ent, 1960 
1961. The p.-evious primary conclusion was that he was neither Deputy 
Chief of the First (Am~rican Embassy} Section nor a supervisor in that 
section. The conclusion of this su....--nmary is that he was Depl.:..ty Chief 
and had supervisory responsibilities for work against code c:erks. The 
matter of the responsibility of !\OSZNKO fo:r work against cocie clerks 
will be considered later. Comments will first be mace on the respon-
sibilities listed in (a) - (d) above.
