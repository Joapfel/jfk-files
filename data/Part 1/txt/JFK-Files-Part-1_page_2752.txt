Top Secret 
(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
Attempted Recruitment of~TORSBERq]D 6 
NOSENKO's Information-196~ 
NOSENKO first'alluded to a KGB attempt to recruit an 
unnamed American military code clerk during his initial 
meeting with CIA in·l962~ • He was describing a new technique 
(which he later claimed to be·his own·idea) ·introduced in 
the 1960-1961 period·to overcome the·reluctance of Americans 
in Moscow· to·develop·friendships·with·soviet citizens. 
Beginning in·l960·the·KGB·instructed·"third-national" agents 
(Germans,· Frenchmen; ·and ·Finns; for ·example) to visit the 
American Club on·Kropotkinskaya Naberezhnaya to .cultivate 
American enlisted men living there. (GOLITSYN learned of 
one such agent of.NOSENKO and the·KGB·concluded that GOLITSYN 
had reported the KGB practise to the Americans, because 
foreigners no. longer were permitted to·enter·the America 
House billets freely for dances, movies, and the like at 
the club there.) NOSENKO had recruited the agent known to 
GOLITSYN in·order. to develop an American military code 
•·•clerk. Without identifying either· the foreign agent· or the 
American target, .. NOSENKO provided further details on the 
. case in subsequent meetings. 
Recruiting a military code clerk·from the Embassy was the 
American Embassy Section's "number·one'assignment", and for 
a year NOSENKO was involved in·an·operation against such a 
target almost to·the·exclusion of·-all'other·duties. The 
• case was considered· to· be the· "number· one" case; • and KGB 
Chairman SHELEPIN as well as·second·Chief·Directorate Chief 
GRIBANOV im~atiently·inquir~d a~ to·its·progress. The ~arg~t/ 
was an Arnerican@_rmy serge~ntlw~th ~bout 20 years' ser' 7ce 0<{ 
who, the KGB learned, wanted i.o· retire and take a. position , rY 
@.sa code 7lerfilwith the State Departme~t~ For·th 7 purposeOo 
of developing the target, NOSENKO recruited a foreigner who 
visited the USSR frequently. The "third-national" ·agent was 
placed in contact with the Ameri.can; and·they·had several 
drinking bouts together. After about·two·months; NOSENKO 
. instructed his agent to take the American to the agent's 
hotel room and introduce him there to a KGB female agent.
