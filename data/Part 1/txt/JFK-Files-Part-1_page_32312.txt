1110vcmcnts of :m operational target, and to devise a secure and timely method of 
approach' to the inJi vi dual Cllban. 
In COllq'l.'lriJ\~ Mr. Flores' performance a.<: an operations officer and as a 
supervisor, I bdic\·c his pcrfomancc is Sant'"t,'hat stronger in the fonncr capacity. 
~tr. Flores has :ill the attributes of•ari-exa..•llcnt case officer: he is aggre~sive, 
thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet in an operational situation. He is 
furth_cr nidcJ by his flumcy· in Sp--&lish :mil has on more than one occasion successfully 
passed hims<.'lf off :is a ~rxican bu,inessm;m. D..lring his TIJY travels, he has 
repeatedly dcioonstratcd dcdicatim to the job at hand, willingness to work long 
hours, ond a flexibility to handle all types of situations. 
Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic ...-hen it comes to the paperwork and bureau- - ;' 
erotic requiren.•nts of his position. l\hilc he is a good writer, he tends to handle:. 
his written tasks in a hurried mzr-.ner and· consequently, his work oftentimes requires 
review. He is itlso inclined to tale the shorter and easier approach when h:mdling • 
the paper flo"· rcquirCl1ll'nts. I 11'.C'!.tion these points not because they represent . 
basic shortcomings, but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance 
in his operations officer capacity. 
In sum, ►tr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated. 
operations officer. His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the 
human target .has been amply dcsnorutratcd. lie has now quite successfully been· 
introduced to his first superviso-r1 positiro and proven that he is canpetcnt for 
nssi~nts of this nature. I believe Mr. Hores is capable of handling positiros 
of increasing n•sponsibility and should be gh~ the opportunity to do so .
