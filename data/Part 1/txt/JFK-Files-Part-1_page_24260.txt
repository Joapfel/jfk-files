exuplo: He has read Marx and Lonin. 'fie might say he's qui.te 
familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and 
after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this 
is true. Ho could say it' nnd act like be and others thought 
a Maoist should act. However, appearance and essence are not 
synonomous. It might appear to non-Maoists that our troop is a 
Maoist because he can talk as good a game as.anyone else--or 
better than those who have not studied as Luch--but the essence 
of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialities. 
Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist so contained. 
Be cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find 
acceptance with the Maoists. They know the process it takes to 
get there: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good 
results." (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.) 
• 9. Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand 
correctly bow they wield their weapon, the dialectical method, 
it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp. 
Through proper study and understanding we can develop and promote 
Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists 
be will be much more acceptable and bis intel product will 
probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might 
not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and 
also he will have better recognition of key developments in 
Marxist world t~rough better understanding of their reality.
