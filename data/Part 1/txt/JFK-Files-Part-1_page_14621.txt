a.. J'l{c ·soviet· occupation of Czechoslovakia has·. 
been a disaster; riowe~er, criticizing the Soviet ~ction 
would mean taking sides with the Americans. A friend 
m~y. be c~~ticized in p~ivate but publicly he should be 
defended. (QUOOZE, 19 November.). The Cubans have to 
side-witp the Soviets for military and economic reasons 
and bec~usc, whether ri~h~ or wrong, they belong to the 
same idc~logical camp. Cuba had and still has enormous 
.discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, ana· the 
United·states but weighing the differences Cub, is.with 
Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, • 3 November.) 
b. AMAtrr0-1 was asked hy his government to report 
-on the new Spanisl1 Government which Havana calls "Opus 
Dei". To a visiting Cuban offil;ial he admitted that 
h·e was at a lqss to understand Spanish politics but 
attempted to detine thri~. It is not true that the 
Spa·nish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dci. 
There ire som~ ~en in the government who lean.to~ard the 
Opus Dci but there are others of a very difJcrcnt lcanin~ 
because they co_me 1 rom the Falangist ranks. These men 
(the Falar.gists) m~y go along with the Opus Dei line 
• because· they allow themselves to L,c "carried by the.• tide" 
but they are uot of the Opus Dei. (QL'DOZE, 19 November.)
