December 1962, ·all o:f JIIWA 's business with the Identity 3 
was handled via AIICAnDON-2 In mid-December 1902, AMCAROON-2 
made the suggestion that introduce REUTmtAN to A1,ICAROON-l 
in order that thero be a nckup contact, in the event thnt 
AltCARBON-2 were out of to or unavailable at such times as 
REUTEMAN might require ass stance :from tho Identity 3. REUTE?.IAN 
agreed to AllCARBON-2's suggestion! and, as a result, Ar.tCARDON-2 hosted a luncheon on 12 December 962 at the Miruni Club in the 
Hotel Columbus, ltiami, Florida, at which AltCARBO?f-2 introduced 
AllCARBON-1 to REUTE?.lAN. As a rcsul t of th ls ini tinl meeting on 
12 December 1962, an operational rel°l\tionsbip bas developed with 
AllCARDON-1, and it-is believed that this relationship contributes 
to the fulfillment of the over-all JllWAVE mission. In view of 
this, a special activities report is being submitted to cover the 
nature o:f ·JMWA VB• s 1·ela tionship with AMCARBON-1 during tbe

lib.on AliCA . _n ro . uce .r.uu,\,11,.1.1.A.i,u.1.1 o ~ , 
reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating 
with REU'l'EM4N .- • . This review was conducted for A?.ICARBON-1 's 
benefit, .1n·order.tbat be mt°ght clearly·understand the frame of 
reference. wb·ich·:s~ould prevail in his relationships with REUTIDIAN. 
:In this review~- AMCAREON-2 pointed out that it was the policy 
.o~ the Identity -3 that it would take no nction which would 
purposely em~arr•ss XUBABK or its South Florida operations. As 
. a result,· it:a:o.7 embarrassing items relative to XUBARK's operations 
·in South Florida·d~d· come to the attention of the Identity 31 ,this 
material· w9uld:b~ brought to BEU'l'E?MN's immediate attention. 
AldCARBON-2 made it•clear to AMCARBON-1 that such items should bo discussed with_·RiroTEMAN· in .a frank manner. In addition, AltCARI:iuN-2 
made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1 
. should :follow BEPTEUAN's guidance relative to how any particularly 
embarrassing item.might be handled by the Identity 3, so that it 
would not expose KUB.ARK operations and, at the same time, would 
not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3. 
In addition, AMC~BON-2 pointed out that, if AMCARBON-1 brought 
• a potentially embarrassing item to REUTEJ.tAN's attention and 
remedial . action_ ·on the . matter was not taken, by REtrl'EJ.lAN within 
a reasonable. period of time, then the Ide~tity 3 would feel free 
to expose any ineptness on XUBAmt•s part. AMCAnBON~2 pointed 
out tha.t in re·turn-~or this cooperation from the Identity s, 
REUTEJ.tAN had agreed that-he would-be available for contact by 
telephone or _periodic personal meetings at which AliCARBON-1 
and Al!CARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in 
Latin American affairs. AMCARBON-2 advised AMCAnBON-1 that this 
arrangement did not mean that AYCARBON-1 could expect to obtain 
any classified -information from REUTEMAN. The point was also 
made that AJdCARBON-1 should not press for the obtaining of 
classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips which REUTEJ.IAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories. 
AMCARBON-l'indicated that he understood the frame of reference 
which had been outlined by AMCARBPN-2. This frame of reference 
bas prevailed throughout JM\VAVE's relationship with AllCARBON-1 
during the period December 1962 to 'March ·1.964 ~ ·: . 
3. AldCARBON-1 'S JOURNALISTIC CAIUmR. AMCAnBON-1 originally 
,- started to work for the identity 3 in 195'1 on the City Desk, 
nnd subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment 
. which entailed covering major political developments in Florida. 
At a later date, A?.ICABBON-1 became a feature writer for the 
Identity 3. Then .in July or August 1962, AMCARBON-1 ·was made 
the Identity 4. This assignment was considered to be a significant
