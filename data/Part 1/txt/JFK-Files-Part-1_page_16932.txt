ll. When the Soviets raised the heigl:t of the vnll in their backyard 
about tvo years ago, they could have:blocked c0111plotol.y the viev or this 
base's working vtndov by makiru,; the vall a fw inches hlp;hor. Since thoy did 
not do thlo, it would oee111 to indicate that they nro not nvc.Nt that their 
activitieo aNt being monitored from.·this point. On tho othor hand, in recent 
months LIDIP'l'Y'-9, the.operator, has NJ)Orted that actlvitloo in the back 
yard have been curtailed more and more. Por exomple, the v<.Gen no longer 
• congregate thero dnily, the school children enter their clABeos by n route 
not vioible to LIF1'1P'l'Y-9 ar ..... the tre1Jo and ohrubo havo not boen trimmed in 
years, mnking L~-9'a viov poor in 1t0et directionc. 1,I11.fr'I'Y-9 so.ys that 
he hlto never noticed any undue intoreot in hls house or hlo a.ct1·-nt1es by 
the Soviets. .Acceso to the operating room c11n be soon rrcm tho vindov vhich'\ • ;' ,,., 
LIEM?l"i-9 bollevoo to be tho comrno ro001 in the target inatnllntion. • 1• ' 
l?. 'nle cover for thio base is that of a nonr.:\l J"1}8 id once. I.Ia,PI"i-9' s 
cover work io that of a car and in:iuranc'l salesman inn local automobile 
egency in the arternoon only. LIFJ.Wl"l-9 dooo work in hio cover. LII:MFTY-9' s 
cover for the u~e of tho operating roan is that ha doco accounting vork for 
client firms. 'i'he door ii; kept lock8'1 at all times and LU.MPI'Y-9 never o.llovs 
tho t:1Jrvo.nt to enter, even for cleBnlng purposes. 'nlo «iuipment 1o kept 
locked in a trunk vithin the room llhen not in use anrl n.11 logo and photos 
are Jc~ in a oafe located in LIW"..rT'l-9's bedroom closet. 
13. • OFllilIDE Con:ment. I bolieve the Soviets aro aware or the photo 
surveil.l.ance being carried out by this be.ee due to the pouition of' the vindov 
and the curtains during tne houro when l..I.El-!Pl"l-~ is oporating. 
14. stntion Comment. The Station doco not believe that tt.is photo base 
ia knOVn to the Sovieto. fllio belief io baaed on the 1'nct that tho LICALLA 
coverap,e is excellent and the~.hao been no indication that the Soviets act 
for tho benefit or obocrvers while the::, are 1n the bnck.Y11.rd. It is interesting 
to note thnt tho Sovieto made no effort to "protect'' the LN~GO valk-in mentioned 
in paragraph 6. above during a vJ.ait to the backyard nnd LICALLA d.i.i obtain 
photographs of the vnlk-in. Tho ochool children no lonp;er pass through the 
backyard because the location of the school vas recently c~ed and the children 
nav go by another route. The Station baa instructed Otll~DE to tet.e e·tery pre­
caution in order to protect the security of the LICALLA batle. 
15. As a gcner!il. camnent pert.ainlng to the security of' the bases in­
volved in Project LIEMPTY, it should be noted that the ::;oviets are &•-aI"a of 
the fact that.LIMOUSINE is the ovner/build.er of the nov LILYRIC building. 
LIMWSINE is aloo the ovner of the LIME.SA complex, through a holding company. 
16. The Station realizes that most of the detailo reported in this 
dispatch are knovn to Headquarter.a; however, the Station_ W'nntod to IIIBke the 
opinions of the Principal Agent and the Station a mattor of record in a 
consol.idated form.
