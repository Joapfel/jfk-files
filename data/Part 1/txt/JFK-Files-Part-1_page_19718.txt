I. .This memorandum will supplement the information contained 
in Mr. Victor R. White's memorandum o( 10 April 1967, sirice Mr. 
O'Connell was reassig,icd to the position of Chief, Security Policy and 
Executive Staff on 9 January 1967. 
2. This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March 
1967. During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the selection , 
frr this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to 
demonstrate his executi v,! ta! ents in this posit ion. 
3. Although the period for which he is b.-ing rated in this position 
is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I woulcl Ray that 
his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".
