addressees know, :,·RUIZ came to his post as a t1·a:nsfer 
from ttiEi Mi1listry of Foreign Corruµerce. On numerous

he was increasingly depr~ssed over his present position 
and his ability to fill it, which may account for some 
of this sense of personal unce1·tainty. lie has seemed 
a hard worker a-nd a man with good ideas on the work of 
the·EmlJassy and how it should be organized, ideas which 
he has 1·epeated endlessly, but he has b<'en unable to • _ 
inspire _in his subordinates. In his disputes with GALLO 
in June he complained about the lack of team spii:i t in 
the office. 
!). RUIZ's political ideas are centered in the Cuban 
revolution and the Statioh considers him as an 
~ues t ioned regime ~_l!Qp_()l~!er. However, his approach 
is diffe1·en t from that of die younger, less. intelligent 
men who·havc known nothing else. RUIZ has had a 
lsufficient b~eadth of education and exp~rience to make 
/a choice, to have reache~ his own decision that the 
· Castro regime is good for Cuba and that l.larxism as 
interpreted by the Cubans is an adequate intellectual 
found~ tion for Ii fe. A QUOOZE Report of lJ December 1967 
included a discussion with a Spanish employee of the 
Embassy during which RUIZ explained that the Cuban 
revolution is _diff~rent from any other rC'volution there. 
has ever been in the worldi that it has different 
characteris~ics and trajectories, that in sritc of having 
a mark of Marxist principles it has miny.variations 
which make it different. These vai·lations are unknown 
even to some of the comrades themselves. In a QUOOZE 
Report oi" 23 June, he commented on certain fea tu1·es of . 
the Cuban systein as "very difficult to understand unless 
one is of the left". The QUOOZE Report of 4 July quoted 
exte.nsively in OS~IA-24,112 of 9 August l!lt;s showed· 
most clearlv RUIZ's view of Cub., and the l'evo1ution as 
one entity and to see hi~f within _that__structlirc, a 
part of it and serving ft. Bt'~·ond that, his mind runs 
in business and public ~elations rather than political 
channels and he ha~ shown less interest in the policies 
than iri the pO"'er·-"i;eT_:ifio1)_~l!JP§ <>-Li..!1_c mt'!l within tj_l.e
