Application for Ta: Exempt St~tus. Rs~pnrts ask~d the IRS 
to make these Iaat~rials tivail:iible for inspection at a mutu­
ally convenient tbe. 
4. A review 0£ 3vailabla CL\ data on the listed· organi­
zations has shown that 89 of them were at.one time or nnother 
soJAehow associated \11th CIA. Cnly t..,.,o o.:f these: 
are of current ooerationnl interest. These two activities­
and 45 organizatloDs formerly ol int~rest to CIA were men­
tioned iu the Americ:in press during@Hrow.zy.01 Forty-two 
.other listed organiz3t1ons .which were in f~ct associated 
/with CIA were not expos~d during{lmrowE~.01 We have found no 
evidence th:it 55 01•ganizations 011 the li3t wero ever directly 
or indirectly associated with CIA. (B~cause two of the names· 
on the list are successive nal!les for the a:uie organization, 
the actual total number of organizations listed.is 144 rather 
than 145.) Three additional project organizations, not 
incl~ded in the It.l:soarts list, may hs vulnerable because 
they wore covertly funded by hitherto unexposed founcbtion 
funding instrWllents i-ncluced in the list. Only one of these, 
is of cur-
rent oparational interest. 
5. The Ci\ St.alt. was furnished a copy of the R:li:iparts 
letter and list· :ind b::is checked out the orgnnizations oi 
possible previ9us CA Staft interest. All org~nizations not 
re~dily i<.lentifiobl~ with l:nown project organizations or as 
CCS funding instr~ents have been traced with RID, witb CS 
nrea divisions that might logically have had an interest in 
them and ~g~inst CCS Ragistry files. Through arrangements 
with the IRS, representntives of CCS ond CGC also ex3mined 
nvailable IRS data (990-A'~ and Fonis 1023) on the listed 
organizations. This ~~s done before tho IRS documents were 
made available to Ramparts, in order to bs sure that restrict~ 
S90-A, Part. I. c.ata would no·t be :furnished to Rnraparts and to 
try to cst3bli3b ~he reasons for E.nmparts• interest in ~he 
o=.:·g:\nizntioils. Our current findings are the results of these 
various file revi~ws.
