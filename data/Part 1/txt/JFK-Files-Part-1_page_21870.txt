DERi'ABIN passed without· evoking. any particular 
thoughts, the defection to the.United States of GOLI~­
SYN, whom I had heard of as an intelligent person and 
a capable officer, undoubtedly ca.used me to think 
very deeply. Because to act t~us, it is necessary 
to have not only boldness and decisiveness, but also 
great. strength of will. And already I put to myself 
the question, will I be able to act thus in view of 
the dissatisfactions and disillus1onments which had 
accumulated inside of me? 
"15. Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before 
my departure I myself of my own desire enteretl into 
contact with you. The reason for this was the loss 
of money received by me for operational expenses. I 
would have been unable to accumulate such a sum of 
money before my departure and there ;,,as.nobody to 
borrow from (at this time GUK was'.·_hin,self in finan­
cial difficulty and at the same time he was already 
preparing for his return home),' To tell the truth 
about the loss of the money would have meant that it 
would be necessary to explain where and in what cir­
cumstances it had been lost. This would have risked 
expulsion from the KGD and a serious reprimand from 
the Party. Not to tell the truth, to think up some 
sort of a story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of 
all, they might think that I had appropriated the 
money, that is, stolen it, And this would be for me 
the worst of all and I would,·of course, in such 
event have told the truth. 
•16. To tell the truth, it was only afte_r my 
return home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not 
immediatelyr began fully to realize all the seriousness 
of my contact with you and its full meaning. And 
although I did not give you a~y promises er assurances 
about our continued contact in the future, I under­
stood that you· sooner or later would ~et yourself the 
task of continuing our contact, And here it was that· 
weighing up all the reasons and causes which I have 
in~icated above that in 1962 t took for myself:the 
decision to leave.the USSR at the first opportunitf 
and that I started to work towards being sent on a trip 
abroad. 
"17. Of course, I wanted to come abroad with some 
sort of 'baggage', that is, with materials which could 
be useful and necessary for you. In this entire period 
up to January 1964 I tried to collect information which 
. would be of the maximum value for you. My assignment 
.to-the~position of deputy chief of the Seventh Depart­
·ment in-July 1962 gave me a greater opportunity tnan 
before. But at th~ same time this assignment al.Jnost
