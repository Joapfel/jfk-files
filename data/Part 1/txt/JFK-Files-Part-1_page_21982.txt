As in the fRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was\invoh·ed "ii.th Lee 
Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his ;,assignment· to the 
Tourist Department of the Second Chief Ditectorate (1955· 
1960 and 1962-1964} .* While Deputy Chiei 'of the American• 
British-Canadian Tcurist Section, SOSENKO h~d a dire~t h,nd 
in the decisirin in October 1959 th~t OSWALD ~as of no oper• 
ational interest. to th~ KGB .,Xnd sho·uld be r·~t~rned immediately 
to the United States. Before President Kcrtnedy's assassi• • 
nation in November 1963i when NOSESKO was again in th~. 
Tourist Department as its Deputy Chief, he was pr~sent- at the 
time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD'i: 
application to the Sov{et Embassy in Mexico City to re•ente~ 
the USSR. After· the assassination, he also played a role in 
the KGB investigations of OSWALD's activities duririg reside~ce 
in the Soviet Union frora Octoocr 19S9 unlil June 19ti2. 
Collateral information relating to OSWALD's sta~ in tho 
Soviet Union, and particularly concerning hny connections he 
may have had with Soviet Intelligence, is meager and indirect. 
It derives almost entirely from indications ~f primart 
interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Gc.,vernr.ient organs) in 
every defector to the USSR, add from infere~ces which may be 
drawn from certain entries in OSWALD1 s "Historical Diary" and 
certain statements made by his wife, Marina, during inter• 
views ~n behalf of the Warren Commissiori. Aftet Pre~ident 
Kennedy's death, the Soviet Government provided the United 
States with official documents and letters ·pertaining to 
OSWALD's defection to the USSR, his suicide attempt, his 
marriage, and Other events inside the Soviet Union. This 
information from the Soviet Govern~ent generally agrees with 
the information fro:n NOSE?t;KO. The materi~ . .t~furi:i.!_shed by 
the Soviet Government make ng_E1ent1o_n_ o.La.n-)~-Soiict Intel·

In this sense NOSENKO's information is unique: It was 
and remains the only .such information avai I.able on the 32 
months of OSWALD's life in the USSR.** NOSE~~O's access to 
* For cont1nu1ty of presentation, botn periods of NOSENKO's 
alleged involvement, 1959·1960 and 1963, are discussed in 
this part of the paper • 
. •~ lndependent sources, however, reported on visits by OSWALD 
to the, ;.;oviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City between 29 
September and 3 October 1963 and on his (apparently ~vert) con• 
• tact with a KGB officer under Consular .cover at the Soviet 
Embassy there. NOSENKO originally said he knew nothing of any 
such contact. In October 1966 he revised this to say that 
OSWALD did not have contact with the KGB in Mexico City. NOSENKO 
explained that he had been sitting in the office of Tourist De• 
partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head• 
quarters from the KGB legal. Residency in Mexico.- Th! cable, 
which NOSENKO said he did not personally see, reported that .. 
OSWALD had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City requesting 
permission to return to the USSR ariJ that he had dealt with. 
Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel only.
