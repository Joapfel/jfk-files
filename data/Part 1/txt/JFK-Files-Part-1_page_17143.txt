4. Terminated Agents t>ossibly Affecting Present Project Security: 
A. ~ymond H. GERENDE 
GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent 
until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station 
-1ntermlttently sin~e 1955 and was used apnost exclusively in support activities. 
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly 
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and 
processing fllms,-:gtnd giving general direction to the project as principal 
agent. bfl969, after year~ of-excellent service wllh the Station, GE RENDE 
had serious marital pro1:Jlems ·which ended in separation from his wife, 
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1!)70 GERENDE was not used 
operationally.but was 'maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro­
ceedings would be completed quickly, When it became apparent the divorce 
would drag 01'1 interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE 
an~ his wife. ~ruce _H. FERNALD, career agent, met .,.,tth GE RENDE 
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying hirt his termination 
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where 
. he owns some property and has an ·income as an English teacher to employees 
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December 
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class 
~chedule has been cut back. T~e Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa­
tion that would indicate GERENDE has Vio]4ted hi~ secrecy agreement, 
There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention 
of the Soviets in 1968• A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City, 
who was latc1· Interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said 
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary, 
Oleg Maskslmovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons 
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee, The persons investigated
