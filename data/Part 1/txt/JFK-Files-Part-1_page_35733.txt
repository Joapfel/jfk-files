With respect to the relationship to the CIA of the seven 
individuals involved in the Watergate burglary, one of them at the 
time of the break-in was '0. part-time contract employee (1,iart.inez). 
one was a former full-tim_e contract employee (Barker}, two were 
retired staff employees (Hu...,.t and lvlcCord). The remaining 
individuals (Liddy, Sturgis and Gonzalez) were never connected 
with CIA in_ any capa_s.ity. (See attached sheet for details on these 
seven individuals). /These facts !J..g.y__e_b_e.en..A,.et..fu;;:t_Q.J?_:r:~~lY..jJ1

Not all contract employees have the same type of contract. 
Some are subject to all the controls that are placed on regular staff 
employees. Others, however, are employed £or a specific purpose, 
generally limited in time, for the use of their talents and/ or disciplines 
in meeting. a particular need of the Agency, and these are not all 
suqj-ect to all the controls which apply to full-time staff employees. 
Both Barker and 1viartinez were in this latter category of contract 
employees. The obligations of such contract employees are as stated 
in their contracts.
