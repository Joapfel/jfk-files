It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving 
"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow. NOSENKO said that 
this would be a provocation, but GRIBAL~OV replied that 
this made no difference. He instructed NOSENKO and 
_KOVALENKO to locate an agent who could be used to pass 
the compromi'sing material to BARGHOORN and told them 
to write a summary of BARGHOORN's background with a 
proposal that the Second Chief Directorate arrest him 
"when he obtains materials which are of interest to 
American Intelligence." This was to be ·sent in letter 
form to Semichastnyy over GRIBANOV's signature; the 
letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORN was to receive 
the materials. (That the evidence was to be planted 
was not to be mentioned. ) 
GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along 
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV 
concerning the Service Attaches, to Semichastnyy. While 
the four -- NOSENKO, KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV 
were waiting in GRIBANOV.'s office for _his return, 
GRYAZNOV received a telephone call from the Rostov KGB 
organization informing. him that the Service Attaches 
were in the air on.their. way back to Moscow. Shortly 
thereafter,. GRIBANOV returned with the news that the 
Chairman of the .KGB .had approved the arrests of the 
Service Attaches as well as BARGHOORN. Khrushchev was 
absent from r.ioscow .at .the .time, but Semichastnyy had 
called BREZHNEV and secured his ·approval . 
. When GRIBANOV. _learned from GRYAZNOV that the Service 
Attaches were already.. on ... their· way back to Moscow, he· 
became. furious and. sent. .GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or 
die.

• Meanwhile., .. arrangements were made with the· 
"Department D11 (the:KGB. element responsible.for.dis­
iriformatioh, • subordinate to the First Chief Directora,te) ._ 
to provide materials on missiles which could be passed 
to BARGHOORN. While these were being picked up, NOSENKO 
and KOVALENKO returned to-their office to plan the arrest. 
BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance 
upon his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio 
message was received from one of the surveillance cars 
that BARGHOORN had gone to the American Embassy, and it 
was decided that the agent (name not recalled, aged 25 
to 30 years) would be placed in contact with him as soon 
as he came out. The KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appoint-
ment with \ORCHARD of the British Embassy\ at 1900 hours ,ob 'c.. 1
