Identity-4 out of Ll~NCHOR, to cease holding group meet­
ings of LIANCHOR writers and to try to prevent further 
contact between Identity-4 and other members of LIANCHOR.

replace {1,INLUCK)as P/A. Identity-5 was tecbqically, 
linguistically, intellectually and professionally well 
qualified to head LIANCHOR. During tpe period of develop­
ment and assessment of Identi ty-4 by ~INLUC19, 0 1Identi ty-5 
wrote an excellent article on Soviet intellectual piracy. 
However, Identity-5 proved diffi~ult to contact and 
control and turned out to be leading a personal life 
which would have detracted seriously from his ability 
to administer LIANCHOR .0{ ~INLUCKJ was told to keep in 
touch with Identity-5, but to look for still ariotber
