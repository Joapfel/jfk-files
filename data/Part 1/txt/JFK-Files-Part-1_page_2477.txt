informed on a daily basis of the results of this stake out {always

. since, in addition to his ·transfer from the Fi:::-st bepart;:nent to the 
Seventh Department as of early January 1962, NOSENKO. went to 
Geneva in mid-March 1962 .. 
It is conceivable th.at, as he hi..nself now maintains, he was kept 
advised of developments or :riondevelopments :following the visit of 
ABIDlAN to the Pushkin Street building by Veniamin KOZLOV, a Chief 
of Department in the Seventh Directorate who had been known to 
NOSENKO since 1953, or Vladislav KOVSHUK or Gennadiy GRYAZNOV, -
Chief and :qeputy Chief respectively of the First Section, First Depart-
ment. Even so, however, his failure to call our atter .. tion to this matter 
in June 1962 would seem to require explanation, especially in view of 
the fact that-he did warn us about the danger of operational lett,:;r mail-
ings by ABIDIAN -- a warning which would appear clearly to have been 
derived from KGB coverage of the activities of ABIDIAN in the spri..-:.g-
summer of 1961. 
It is to be noted that during d1e June 1962 :rneetings NOSENKO
