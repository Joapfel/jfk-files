This, according to O'Brien, accounts.for Souza•s inability 
to provide information of real value. O'BrieD did indicate, 
however, that the usual P,I,.requirements had no punch. He 
cited, fo~ exampl~, the requirements after .Souza•s return 
fro■ Hawaii, which in effect amounted to: ~"hat's new? 
10. Despite the long hist~ry of .the Souza COfltact, 
01Brien is not now meeting· with Souza in person. Souza feels 
that O'BTien•is too well known in the Cuban community in 
Nev York and even the most elaborate contact arrangements 
would not be free of danger. Souza also shys avay from talk• 
ing un his home phone !or fear that it may be tapped. O'B=ien 
can, however, telephone Souza and lay on alten.at~ telephone 
o:-·even meeting arrangements. We did not establish :he fre• 
quency of O'Brien's current contacts with Souza n9r did we 
establish at what poin~ in the history of the contact the 
decision was made to dispen~-~-with per_sonal 1,11ee.tings; the .. 
aature of our meeting with'O'Brien did not permit elaborate 
and detailed questioning. He did recount, however ·an·in~­
teresting aspect of the case which followed Eron- ·the fact· 
that·a State De;,artment security officer assigned to New ¥ort, 
(fnu) Swazey, occupied the apartment directJ.y above Souza 
during his tour in New York and became quite friendly with 
Souza. O'Brien apparently used Svazey ·as an informal go• 
betweeL Oft the case. (Should we choose to pursue the Souza 
lead, an atte2pt perhaps should be ude to locate and debrief 
61fazcy with O'Brien's conturrence. Not~: This could be . 
Aathony Clinton Swezey, DOB 9 August 1911, who vas_Special 
Assistant to Secretary General of U.S. Mission to UN 1946 to 
1947,,. In 1963 lae was First Secretary, FSO•Z, ia Paris.)
