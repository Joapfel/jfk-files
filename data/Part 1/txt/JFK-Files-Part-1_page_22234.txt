A. lntro-:!~ction 
It is standard pro=edu~e to assess the bona fide~ of each 
intelligence and co•Jnterir.tclligence source, and special care is 
required in assessing sources of inforr.iatio~ relevant to the secu­
rity oft~~ United States. 
Or.e difficulty in doing &o with a Soviet source is that 
Soviet realities, particularly in the KGB, are imperfectly kno-.m: 
Except where indepen1ent inforr.:atic~ is available, it is risky to 
say ar.d ~mpo~_ible to prove ..,hat the Sov1et:.s--rr.ost notably the 
KGB--would or would not do ir. any given situation, or what any 
given !:{GB officer should or should not know. !r.Jependent informa­
tion, volurnino~s ir. quantit~, al't.:iough never ccmprehensive and 
entirely current"., nevertheless has been a.ssimilatead froo the re­
port:s of_ the se'l.'eral KGB staff off iccrs ,.,,ho have defected, fror:i 
the KGB agents ~ho have confessed, and from t~e Western services 
which have investigated KGB activities. There is, therefore, a 
base of !:"elicsble kno·,llecge u~n_wh1cn to predi~ate an assessment 
of~ source reporting on the KGB, even one who principally covers 
a KGB compone~t (in this instance the Second Cnief Dir~ctorate) 
upon whici1 tr.ere previously had t.cen relatively little ins!.de 
• nfor:r.ation. 1-'.oreover, in tbe .absence of direct evi<lence from 
other sources, it would b<! arbitarily confining if an assumption 
Jere not made that cer~a1.n KGB standard3 are at least comparable 
to these of Western services. Such prior knowledge and, to a 
11.~ited extent, such an assur.iption are factors in the asses£,ent 
of Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO that is sutrnitted here. 
A much more prominent factor in this assessment, however, 
is NOSE:-lKO• s o·,m testi::-io:iy. CIA has exhaustively debriefed and 
interrogate-:i NOSEln<O, his leads were checked, his information wa3 
studied, and a large body of facts per~inent to his l:.ona fides 
~as thus assembled. These details, as well as direct evidence 
from other sources and the views of specialists affiliated with 
CIA, have been presented in Part III. througr. Part VII. of this 
paper. 
Tr.e basic questions vith regard to the bona fides of 
NOSENKO are the follo~ing: 
- I~ there reason to question the ger.eral accuracy 
~ud r.ompleteness of NOSENKO's accounts of his situation 
and motivations in contactir.g CIA and later defecting, 
his personal life, military service, positions in the 
KGB, persor.al participation in KGB operations, kn0',1-
ledgeability about KGB activities and the ~ay he learned 
of them, and his associat1.ons with KGB personnel? 
- If there are grounds for doubting the general 
accuracy and completeness of these accounts, then vhat

In assessing the bona fides of NOSENKO, the classic method 
has been used: evaluating his production and sourcing, examining 
his autobiography, and appraisir.g him and the circumstances of 
this operation. These points, • .,it:; the conclusions dra·.m from

of the sources who have corroborate<:! ~OSENKO's background and

hypotheses which could explain NOS~KO as a source. The final
