DTDORIC Operationa 
SWitzerland 
1. As addressees are aware QRPBONE/1 has officially been 
denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order 
was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A, 
which was then receiving money frOCl the Chinese--in violation of 
Swiss neutrality. A ci-i\ar order was also issued at that time 
for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A. 
2. It is nOW' some six years later and ORPHONE/1 (at least 
overtly) is employed as a .legitimate journalist. Be is not a 
member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss a•1thorities-­
although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of 
leftist individuals in pur.-uit of his operational tasks. QRPHONE/1 
has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland-­
in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that 
if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should 
also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1 
obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future 
operational benefit could Le gaini':od if QRFIICNE/1 wer~ again .ililc 
to enter Switzerland. 
3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report 
written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the swiss Embassy 
in London on this matter. We are also forwarding under separate 
cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he 
formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.
