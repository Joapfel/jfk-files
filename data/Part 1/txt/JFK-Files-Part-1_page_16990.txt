to rcn1a1n 1n the Secret S•~rvice ,11.;ents' duty room. No Lribcs were n..:cessary to 
obtain his rcle.,.sc; howc·,er, p-.:r LI MEW 1 11 rcqt1(;ut 1 $ 500, 00 pe11os·wcrc f;ivcn to

L-l0's detention, the source was also rcoponsibl1.: !or all equipment and £,lm bcint.: 
. returned intact to L- 10, 
11, T.ESSAROLO 'WU aclvised, as soon at1 LIM..i:W bcc,'\mo: involved in the cas , 
that the crimmal lawye·r should not pursue the matter any further, Two bottles o! 
11cotch whukcy were g1v1::n to th.: lawyer throu~h 'l'I:;SSAROLO for the £cw tasks he 
had alrcacly performed, 
12, After his release, L-10 rcportccl that he was not intc1·rogatcd and that he 
did not reveal.any data about C'th1er operations he ha11 workc,I on nor did he give :the 
n;imca o! ;;nybod;( conn(;ctcd with operational activities. BascJ on the devclopn1,:nts 
in thu caac, th-: St,1tion haa no reason to doubt th,: v<.:racity oi L·l0's statement,: L-
10 was rcprimanJcJ !or his Uflc oC stateml·nts to the Secret Service about being • 
employed hy OD.ACID. ik wa,; told that the revelation of such employment wa11 to 
l,c rnade only b)' the Station and that hcnc,~Corth he is never tu uso such a cover 
11tory. L-10 wat1 al!Jo rqirirnanded for hi11 lack of judgment i11 rc111ai11ing in an area 
whurc there was a atronL concentration of police; it is bclic,·cd safe to asuun1c that 
-L-10 will never 1na.itc this flame mistake, ag,\in, 
13. In rctroupcct, it io interesting to note that L-10 1 2 use of the ODACID 
employment story 1>1 poas,bly rcspo11s1bl.: for hia not bcm,; i11tc1·1·ogatcd and thus 
compromiu1ng other operations ;1nd individuals, This case has pointed out to th,:

local pvlicc-typc organizativ1:a no that th,, Station, r;i.thcr than ODACID and OD£NVY, 
in th1,; firAt to learn 0£ incidents of this iype. Considci·ing th<.: nmltiianous activities 
ha•dled bf the Station, it rnuut be assumed that the police will occasionally appre­
hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to hanJlc such cmcrgeucics.
