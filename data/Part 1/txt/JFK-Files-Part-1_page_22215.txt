"NOS~;i(O' s Claim to Have Been a K~omol· 5<:?,:r~tary in the 
Second Chief Directorate, KGB 
"NOSENKO claimed to have become a meMber of the Komsomol 
Organization (K/0) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March 
1953, tor.ave been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization 
of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have 
served in tr.at capacity until the fall of 1954, when he was re­
moved because he used operational-l!llias documents in obtaining 
treatment !or a venereal dise~se h~ had incurred. He claims to 
have been ex.:luded from the Kornso~ol, without ~rejudice, when he 
attained his 27th birthday in October 1954. 
"Asked to descri~ now he transferred (ro:n the Y.c:n;;omol Organ­
ization of the tlaval Intelligence Po3t in the Baltic to the l<om­
somol Or-ganization of the KGB, NOS~Y.O g.:ive an er.tirely incorrect 
descriptio~ of this procedure, both as regards deregistration from 
th~ K/0 in the Baltic, and registration with the K/0 in the KGB. 
P.-- stated that he «as issued a new Kornsomol registration card by 
the K~B K/0, without re:erence to the pr~vious K/0 in the Balticr 
this is impossible. 
"NOS~KO gave an incorrect account of how a K/0 secretary is 
elected, stating that he was elected at a meetir.g of the K/0. In 
fact, the K/0 meeting can only select the K/0 com:nittee, which will 
convene separately to elect the Secretary. 
"NOSENXO could not describe the duties of a K/0 secretary in a 
specific oanl"er. 
"NOSENXO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB 
IC/0. The secretary of the SCD K/0 would be directly subordinate 
to him and vould deal with ~im frequently. 
"NOSENKO was unable to dezc~ibe his dealings with the KGB K/0 
or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he 
dealt there. • 
"NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximu..~ age for a Kom­
somol member was 27. In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (it 
was raised later). This point is important, both because NOSENKO 
should kr.ow exactly if he had served as a K/0 secretary, and also 
because it refutes his story that he was excluded from the Kom­
somol for over-age in 1954. 
"NOSFl-K0 maintained that all tr.e members of his K/0 paid dues 
in the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries. This is 
incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding 
scale determined by wage group: at that time, Komsomol members 
earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percentr those earning 
500 to 1500 rubles paid l percent,and those earning over 1500 
rubles paid 1.5 percent~ The K/O secretary coll1fcts the dues, -• end must· kr.ow the- right-amount.-··- --- ---- - -- - -- ----- - - - --- -- -- --
"NOSE:l.KO did not kr.ow whether or not a Komsomol Congress 
- took place- while -ne was T}o secretary-, --saying- that they- fook -
place every year. In actual fact, the 12th Komsomol Congress 
which convened in March 1954 was the first since 1948: at this 
12th Congress a number of changes were made in the Komsomol Rules 
(~). As secret,ry of a K/0 NOSENKO would have been involved
