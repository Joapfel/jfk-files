I. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Starioo. ~rations 
During the period coYered by this project review, LIFE.-\ T.contlnued 
to support the Mexico City St:1tion rhrough its timely p.roduction of leads 
whlch were especially useful,· ~d in most cases es$em:iai. in assuring 
the success of other Station operations .. The following is a list, 
necessarily selective, c:,f the use mad~ of leads frorri, anJ support of 
other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT. 
:··,: : ~lFEAT/LlMERICK': 1) Of special note is the s~n pro-
vided to the Station's AEO.,tPULSE operation. Le.a>li and .,. 
information rendered by LlFEAT enabled the r~..sjX)ruf.ble __ 
Case Officer to prep.ire adequa:ely for this rccrnitrnent a::tempt 
of an officer of the Soviet Emlxlssy. Following rhc a.::rual 
attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERlCK was u.set.l a3 a s~ricy device 
to protect the Srntion ass:!ts employed ir. the opera:ioo. 2) As 
noted in I A. (5) a~v~, Pro~ect LIMES:\ wa.:;; p:-ovi~-.J with 
continuing support by Project LIFEAT. Not~le a'.lloog the 
lnformation and leads provided were those concernlng specific 
properties which the Soviets were interested in r..!nting andjor 
buying. 3) LIF~T has provided a cht>ek on dolule-agent 
UTARDY-1; giving verifieo:ion of his actlvities a.."ld contacts. 
A similar check has also been provided on the activities 9f 
informant LIPAGAN-1. 
LfFEAT/LIVERY: 1) Tnis phase of LIFEAT closely 
supported the projected LITACIT physic.al peneaatioo operation 
aimed at the LIVERY establishment ln Mexico City. LIFEAT 
provided essent~l information on the rosters of night duty 
officers as well as background information on the target. 
2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the in:i!alla:ion of 
technical survellla.ucc against LlTACH. Wit~ the information 
pr0vided by LIFEAT, this op.?ra:ion would Juve bee:1 extremely 
hazardous at best, and probably would have bt.--en entirely 
impossible.. ff:~ ~f.' 1 f
