NOSE:i'.KO has stated that his original approach to "sell two 
pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most li~ely to 
be successful. NOSZ:;-.;KO bas stated that he wanted to make a contact 
with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the 
time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a· ".<GB counter­
intelligence officer who wanted to give information," he very possibly 
would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his 
first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information" 
and began to talk quite freely on other matters. 
If NOSE:-.KO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 196Z 
contacts, would have been very carefully brieied and that his remarks 
or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any 
suspicion in regard to the bona !ides C'f NOSENKO. Instead, a current 
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 196Z 
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite­
likely typical of a braggaciocio element in the personality of :;-.;osE:,KO 
and may also have been evide~ce supporting the statement by NOSENKO 
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in 
Geneva.
