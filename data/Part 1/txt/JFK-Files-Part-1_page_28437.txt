KEMORANDUll FOR: Secrot~ry, CSCS Board 
SUBJECT a Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 • 
Mr. Tennent B. Bagley 
1. It is recommendod that Mr. Tennent JI. Bagley be-pro­
moted to GS-17. He has b~en in grade as GS-16 since ~une 1965 
a11d bas eorved as COS in l3russols since August 1967. His 
-previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, 5D Division. 
2. Tbe reasons for ~his promotion nre amply covered in lllY 
fi tnoss 1•eport of this ~amo date. I havo just returned from nli 
extensive trip through ~ho Eu~opean area, during which 1·nad a 
chnnco to seo and· -t~lk with n vory largo number of offi~ers 
under both official nnd non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one 
of two whom I nm recommending for promotion ns a result. lle is 
one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination, 
intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very 
few of bis collenguos can mo.tell. He is one of those on whom 
tbe,future of tho Organization is going to depead, and I believe 
that the promotion is moro than justifiod.
