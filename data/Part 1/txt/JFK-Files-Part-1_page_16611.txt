3. For the record, I should like to note that in the two and a 
half years since I had last seen· Subject he had aged over 15 years. 
When I last saw him he was a round-faced, dark-haired, boyish person 
and has now been transformed into a very grey, very puffy, 50 year old 
man though I understand his chronological age is something short of 40. 
These observations 'Mad nothing to do with anything except they might 
indicate that Subject is living under a great strain. I derived the 
impres.sion, which coincides with that I obtained the first time I met 
with Subject, that he is constitutionally -oblique in his approach to 
matters. He is a very "difficult person to corner. I am firmly 
con,·inced that to date in this operation, if it may be called that, we have 
• never come close to placing Sub_iect in the corner and that it is high time 
we do so. I do not imply that he is a man of ill will, rather that 
instinctively he is a man who slides off problems until such time as he 
feels he has sufficient evidence or is in the right posture to solve them. 
I should think it would be our task to exploit these natural capacities 
while at the same time attempting to assure that Subjectt, not sliding 
away from us.
