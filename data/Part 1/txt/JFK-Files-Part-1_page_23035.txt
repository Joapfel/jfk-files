b. Subject is President or Director of the 
N-:--.1r1J1,liysiolo~y institute (formerly lligllcr Nervous 
Activity Instit,ute) 1 Academy of Scic:11ccs: ~ubsource 
thinks that SubJect is nlso Professm· of f.!edical 
Psrchology at Havana University. Subjl:ct is a very 
well trained psychiatrist and has al~ays cnjofed 
gren t prestige as such; never-the less, he hns always· 
been reput_ed to have very low morals, aud in medical 
circles is "famous" as n woman chaser. He is widely 
reputed to attempt to seduce hi~ female patients nnd 
his collengues' wives. Major Bernnbe On DA Z , 
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers 
Subject to·· be a vulgar political schcm1+1· utterly 
lacking in personal prestige among Cub:111 "new" 
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers thnt 
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice 
for l1is ON n personal benefit.

c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly 
abandoned the Immediate Action medicnl doctors' party 
and joined the recently organized Revolution.try Medical 
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960. 
In medical circles, Subject is reputed Lo collaborate 
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, hut subsource

employe<:'i ai a professor at Havana Unjvcrsity, is 
a good psychiatrist about 70 years old who has always 
been.a leftist but is not the type of immoral person 
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Dttstamante travel 
together to almost all the psychiatric congresses 
held nbroad; according to Major Be1:naue Ordaz, the two 
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric 
Hospital, and base their desire on the f:lct that Ordaz 
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they 
will never be successful jn replacin~ Ordaz, because 
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel C:tstro and 
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his~
