reported in full to,~ondo~ by the@ritisii) representative in 
Rio. This report and other questions that arose early in his 
career .(his contacts with a cousin who was.a Press Attache in 
the Polish Embassy in Rio) were, however, just the earliest 
elements that aroused suspicion . 
S. Because he became so well-known to so many Agency 
officers, his name and reputation have become subject of 
discussion on many occasions. One senior oper-ations officer 
stated in 1975 that a Soviet agent could not be m.ore beneficial 
to the Soviets and the Communist cause than SZULC has been. 
Although h·e presented a generally anti-Communist view prior 
to quitting the NYT in 1972, it is noteworthy that he arranged 
extensive, favorable TV coverage of the Communist-dominated 
Ligas Campesinas in Northeast Brazil and that one of the most 
important anti-Castro operations,· AMTRUNK, in which he was 
irivolved from the beginning, was disastrous for all participants. 
More indicative of his true beliefs, however, are the articles 
he has written since Watergate. They have become increasingly 
critical of the CIA and of the USG generally and have damaged 
U.S. image and prestige. 
6. The notes below are somewhat r~ndom examples of 
elements in SZULC's file that bring him under suspicion. As 
mentioned above, they . in no way point to a firm con.clusion. 
For further information on SZULC during the period 1963 - 1964,

in 1964.
