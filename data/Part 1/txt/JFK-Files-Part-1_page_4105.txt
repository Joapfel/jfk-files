collected by the A~'i~~!•L~D tend to affect tb~ latters • morale 
·and ~onfidence in Kl13ARK because the A.YLlLACs believE- that 
anything AKBIDDY-1 does iii don.:: v.-itb Kll3ARK support and blessing. 
As Headquarters is aware tbe great fear of the AYLILACs· is that 
AMBIDDY-1 will get all the actio~ and all the glory. However, 
in view of the current ICUBARlt/Al!BIDl·&·-1 relationship the 
AIILILACs have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis i& not 
ezpected to arise. On tbe other band, if AKBIDQ"i-1 were to 
re-act_iva.te part ol his action ·force and conduct a Taid 11ttlizing 
aoa-lWBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then 
be very difficult to convince the AMLILACs that KT.i'BA~ vaa not 
involved and their morale and confidence would be badly sba.kea. 
This situation 1s brought to your attention siaply to show what 
effect such AMBIDDY-1 activities wo11ld have on this Station's 
painstaking efforts to retain a superior and ~xperienced commando 
capability under already difficult psychological conditiou.
