(~) 1nc &tory is vague, un~ubotantial, and contra­
dictory; nc 6\.!bstancc has been ilddcd to the 1:-u.sc outlines 
of the story despite frequent questioning. One might expec 
of an educated or reaso~ably in:clligent person some recol­
lection of ~ilitary service co~p!cted 10 years earlier--the 
locations whe.:e he terved, whether he did or did not have 
TB, how and when he entered or tra~sferred from one place to 
another, and wtat he did or .what he e,:pcrienccd, 
( 3) NOSE!-;KO' s kn,;,·..,lec!ge of ~ili.tary procedures, of 
tho n~vy, and of th~ units with which he served is practic­
ftlly no~-exi3tcnt. He has provi.<leJ no reason whatever to 
ronke one believe that he actually w~s n naval officer. 
(4) The functions he claims to have fulfill~d involved 
no dire.::t involverr,ent or personal respor.fibilities: They 
sound like the bare outlines of a legend, not like rcu.l life 
or perso~al er.periencd, 
That this period is fictitiou1 is su?ported by the findings 
of the psycholo3ist (Pages 605-611). 
NOSE:;KO' s dtscription of his n,wal GPU service cannot be 
accepted as true. On the basis of his statc~cnts, it appears 
moreover that he was never~ naval offic~r. nor ari officer of any 
other rcg~lar milLtary Gcrvice. 
Since NOSFNKO·clai~s that his G~U status and service provided 
him the platform for -a transfer into the JI.GB- (without such for­
malities as medical examinatiQn, perEonnel interviews or gue9tion­
naires), this conclusion is relevant to his clairn of KGB staff 
status from 1952 or 1953 .
