1. We enclose ierewith a reproduction of a letter ·t,0.;_;.:--­
dated Havana, 29 November 1966 that was received by ~~Y­
AMSCROLL. We bf/1.ie~ that the letter, si~ned "Carlos", 
was written byv.Jose4BREVIL, Manager of the International ,-Lt.Jd,; 
Department of the National Bank of Cuba. We say this ,~ ~ 
as in early .November: AMSCROLL mailed a copy- <>f~·-its"'newsletter J~'-"~ 
to BREVIL using as a retur.i:i address the one used by the , v ___ • 
writer of this letter; this combination of name and return

Station had obtained BREVIL's name and position in the 
National Bank from a refugee debriefing report. 
2. There are no Station traces of BREVIL. However, 
the tone of the letter is.ffiendly and it might therefore 
.l>e useful to index this inf.ormation in the event that BREVIL 
should travel abroad.• 
3. The Statton examined the envelope for•evidence of 
tampering.· None was found, though this is not conclusive.
