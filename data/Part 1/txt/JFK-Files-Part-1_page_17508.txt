targets which would' provide pos~tlve iiltelllgencc, leaves ll readily available fof'• 
recall Into the Sovlet'-Czech coverage;· It is the Station's flrm opinion that the 
LIFEAT project provi<;les a·st:Ibst&ntlal and vital contribution In fulfilllng the 
several priority objectives of the Stalion's Related Mission Directive. 
•• ·c • There Is attached a list of the ~1s produced from LIFEAT provided material 
during the period July 1961 t~rough May 1962 as a by-product of the project's 
prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations. • • 
II. Progress of the Operation 
Tne objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and ,ire there­
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time. For this 
reason percentage figures as to compleLion o_f projel.'.l objcclivt:~ cannm be drawn. 
However, an Indication of the coverage provided In working to·..vard fulfillment 
of the objectives can be noted In that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced 
In the period July 1961 through May 1962. LIFEAT has been In daily operation 
during the review period with the average number of lines covered per rr.onth 
bdng 20, wit'1 a high in March 1962 oi 28 lines covered. 
lll. Planning for the Future 
As was Indicated at the rime of the last project renewal, LlFEAT hopes to re­
main uncommitted ro coverages that require the expenditu:-e of a great ponion 
of UFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target ... such as Soviet 
Embassy coverage. It is add~d emphatically, however, that should che need arise 
for LIFEA T to again assume such responsibllit ies, it Is fully able cc, do so. 
Until' such time LIFEAT will continue co enjoy greater flexibility in the employ­
ment of lts assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to 
reveal its interest or operations co the.liaison-forces involved In the LIENYOY 
operation. 
As co particular areJs of Oi)erarions, the Station has hopes of employing 
LIFEA T assets in "hot mike operations which require a:Cce~s to telephone
