By the·endof this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhausted all 
his combativeness and appear~d very depressed.

RUIZ will soon be ~oing on home leave. However, the forcer 
close association noted upon RUIZ's arrival is gone·and 
:they are more distant and cool. GALLO at one point in 
this. same .4 .Jui.,- QUDOZE Report mentioned how he had looked 
:forward ·to workiug··'li·ith RUIZ .and QUDOZE had shown an 
initially close wo1·king relationship between them with· 
daily discussions of the problems of the Mission and the 
events of the day. Now, their relations~ip is cool,

GALLO's friendship with Emilio RmtERO and saying that 
GALLO only wanted to be out meeting people and not 
preparing written me~os on his work!
