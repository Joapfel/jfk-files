!J.Sl&)RAIIDU1! FOR: :!.ecord 
SUBJF.CT Project HUMANOIJ? 
1. }. total of !593L..OO was orieinally requested for this pro,iect 
for the period 1 !I.arch 52 to 28 February 53. TI:e amount actually 
approved 1-;as ic000.oo (Fon:i No. 51-91, project folder Y. 
2. $5100.00 of the approved amount was to provide for the compen­
sation of four agents who were to be reil:lbursed as follows: 
Htll!.A NO ID 
HUl~NOID-1 
HI.JW.NOID-2 
HU':.:ANOID-3 
1600.00 (colones) 
150.00 ( II ) 
250.00 ( II ) 
900.00 ( II ) 
3. The funding require~ents for agent s3laries were calcullted 
(by the Headquarters case officer, Too Barrett) at a rate 8 to 1 (e.g., 
HlllU.NOID was to receive ¢1600.00 or t,200.00 per i:.onth). 
4. However, the·rate of exchange has fluctuated since the origintl 
funding estwtes were made. The· present rate is 6.63 to 1. Accordingly, 
·lhe monthly pay scale for HU1!A110ID in U. S. currency would be approxi­
~tely $24.1.00 (or tl6oo.OO). The pay scales of the other agents are 
similarly effedted. 
5. This situation was explained to the Budget office (l!r. Bauer, 
extension 2017) and the Plans office (!lr. Ziegler). t stated that 
dollar expenditures would be in excess of the amounts provided i~ the 
project if we were to continue payments to the agents at the colon 
rates previously established. l!r. Ziegler informed me that we C4?uld 
nonetheless continue the present colon pay scale. He further advised 
that budgetary adjustments could be ma.de at a later date when it became 
evident tr.at the project allotment would definitely be exceeded du~ to 
currency fluctuations. A project amend.cent is not then required at 
this tilte. The station may be advised to continue payments in colones 
in the amounts shown in paragraph 2, above.
