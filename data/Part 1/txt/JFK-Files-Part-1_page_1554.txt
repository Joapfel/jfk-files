1. • On 2 ·April 1964 we had a discussion with the Depar~ent 
of Justice on- the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred 
• :···.·upon arrival at our request and who are th.en paroled to this Agency. ·-. 
It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible 
fo~--t~g any ·action necessary to carry out the terrn!!_Q_!..the parole. 
• • 2. As you know,: a basic parole agreement was executed by the 
-Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up 
• __ conditions ·for authorizing parole in any one case, the ·agreement states: 
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will, assume-:·.-: 
. :;.· responsibility for care, supei:vision and control of a.kind and degree it 
believes co~sistent with the internal security nee~s of the United States 
during continuance of their parole status. 11 This means that the 
responsible Agency officials must take the rninimwn action necessary _ 
. to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word 
•11minimwn" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely mea_ns that good 
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.' 
• ' 
3. The agre.ement further provides that upon-completion of the 
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if 
internal security :reasons so require, the alien will be removed fron1 
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such·_. 
case, the A ~~ce in advance of each propo_sE:d •
