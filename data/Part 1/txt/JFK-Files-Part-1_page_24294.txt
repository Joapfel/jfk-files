MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/JJ3 
SUBJECT : Cbicom Aspect of QRPHONE/l's 
Operational Potential 
1. In continuing my efforts to probe operational 
areas·for the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at 
length on 3 January witb his former case officer 
(Mr. Richard Berkey) and received a very favorable 
prognosis regarding QRPHONE/l's mobility (i.e. bis 
possible move to another European city or to Africa), 
bis agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional 
training), and the prospects of making himself attractive 
to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training). 
2. In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length 
today with Mr. Andrew Ness, th~ FE Division expert on 
long-range Cbicom and CP penetration programs. I de­
scribed in detail QRPHONE/l's background, current status, 
and the variety of plans we have in mind and received 
Hess' reactions as follows: 
A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE 
bas demonstrated thus far will never result in bis 
becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the 
Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose. 
While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential 
FI source, the Cbicoms would not even do that. 
e. Cbicom officers abroad are still totally 
obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic 
and tactical application to a degree significantly 
more zealous than their Soviet counterparts. 
Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets 
the Cbicoms discard persons of shallow substance as 
far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned. 
They are interested in only those who have a serious 
intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and 
a serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists 
of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen 
as only of marginal use to the Cbicoms and certainly
