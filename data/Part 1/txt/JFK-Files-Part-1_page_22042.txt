(a) Introduction 
In 1961· CIA learned fro!!! a Polish source who· furnished 
much reliable and sensitive information that, wi·th the.assist-·­
ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB), 
the KGB in November 1960 began using a female agent against 
Joseph MORO!m, a U.S. Department of .State cede clerk assigned 
to the American E~;assy in Moscow in ~ugust 1960. The·worr~n 
accompanied MO RONE on a train trip from :-ioscow, became inti-
mate with him in ~'iarsaw, return~d tc Moscow twice in February 
1961, and there had sexual relations .with him. The compromising 
scenes of MORONC and the Polish UB agent were photographed. 
This information en the KGB operation was received by CIA soon 
after the we,·,nan's second visi:: to Hoscow. On the basis of this 
report, !-!ORONE was interviewed and polygr.:tphed in Oslo in May 
1961, and he was transferred to Lisbcn from Moscow in August 
1961. 
NOSENKO gave·a fe\l details on the same case, without men­
tioning the name of the KGB target, during the 1962 meE:tings in 
Geneva. In 1964 ana 1965 he furnished more particulars on the 
~-10P.OHE case, identifying three KGB agents (besides the Polish 
female) \o.'ho participated in the operation. ~OSENKO, ho,,...o:?var, 
said that two cf t~em added no infor~ation of usa to the KGB 
against MORONE, and that he was unable to remember what the tnird 
agent reported: statements by other sources indicate tha~ re­
garding MORONE all three ~gents could have acquired information 
of operational potential for the KGB. NOSE?JKO has not reported, 
a!l have other sources, that. a fourth KGB agent r.amed Ella u;>\ANETS 
was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SKVORTSOV-­
posing as tUCHAUD--\s·as with MORONE at J\.-nerica House on at least 
one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was approached 
by the KGB (see above). NOSENKO has ccnfused the MORONE case 
with another by saying that a fifth KGB ag~nt was directed 
against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the 
lur~rican code clerk ZUJUS (see below). The sensitive source of 
the original report on MOP.ONE stated that a KGB officer "VOLODYA" 
"'(Vladimir, last name unknown) personally met the Polish female 
agent when she arriv~d in lfascow, and NOSENKO said that the 
KGB officer was his subordinate KOSOLA!'OV. NOSENKO at first 
claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re­
ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed 
him that travel records on NC•SENKO made it impossible for the 
technician to have spoken to him as he described. According to 
NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before th(? KGB could. 
take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates 
MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities' concern 
over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents. 
(b) NOSENKO's Information 
At his first meeting with CIA on .-9 June 1962 NOSENKO made 
a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a 
female agent of the Polish service in contact with an A.~erican 
·from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting Warsaw. 
Later, NOSENKO sald, he br;;,ught the same female to Moscow--in - . 
order to obtain further compromising materials on _this American .
