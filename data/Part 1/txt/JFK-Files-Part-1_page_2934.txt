not recall. Along with a large group of KGB officers, NOSENKO 
received a commendation from GRIBANOV in 1960, he said, "for 
good work in general". He received in 1961 the Order of the 
Red Star, he statec, with a group of Second Chief Directorate 
case officers "for general good work"; IVASHUTIN made the 
presentation, which included a medal and a certificate which 
the officer may retain. 
Comment: A week later, NOSENKO said that he received this 
award in December 1962. He said he recalled 
that the presentation was planned for the KGB 
Anniversary on 20 December, uut the presentation 
was delayed and not made until the end of the 
month. 
In 1962, NOSEtn:o claimed, he received another :cor.unendation 
from GRIBANOV for "general good worJ:", and_ he also received 
the Unblemished Service Award for ten years' service. 
Comment: At this juncture his interrogators reminded 
NOSENKO that his most recently claimed date 
of entry to the KGB was March 1953, and that 
in 1962 he would only have had nine years' 
service. :tlOSENKO said that he could not under­
stand why, Luthe was certain he received the 
service award after his return from Geneva in 
1962 .. : .(The date is consistent with NOSENKO's 
earlier retracted claim that he entered the 
KGB in 1952.) The following day NOSENKO 
announced that he recalled why··he received the 
medal in 1962 rather than in 1963; the medal 
was awarded to servicemen as well as to KGB 
officers, and prior military service is taken 
into account in computing KGB officers' time
