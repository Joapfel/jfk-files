M,IIE! ... for Junch, dinner, or Just drinks. T,u_is Gomez 
inv•ted us this time to his home in 2txa.aJ Pedregal for . 
lunch. • 
After I had ma4e a point of not sitting near Val, 
sev_eral women wan-ted to change places a.nd val and • 
·another person changed_ places putting Val next to me • 
.He opened the c,id ,iss·ue by saying that·. he asaUine(t • 
I was ·working tor the compa·ny-. He said that he had ·seen 
me_ per~.onally•aeveral times• at sanl:>orns with American 
intelligence officers.· I a~ked who he saw me with_. He . 
avoided the quest1on. t ·then volunteered that it must· 
have been Bill spruce, wit:h whom I frw.iuently have 
lunch• He asked_ what section Spruce was in. I answered 
the econonrl,c. He seemed disgusted, and s&4d Spruce. 
wasn't worth anything. 
Val then said that he wanted me to kno,,, that he 
was prep..,red tQ pay a lot of money for any information_ 
I might obtain for him. I _said I'd talk to Spruce about· 
it and see if he had., anything to seill so that I could 
take my cQmmission. I added that Spruce _woul<l probably 
faint or tremble with terror-.;.this pleased val greatly. 
I then asked val if the .Americans bad ever offered 
him any money for his .tnformat.ton. Hie averted my eyes • 
and answered •not yet 11·/

that he saw me even tlie\one time. •

Val is doing· the only thi.ng he knows how, and ·he knows 
it, and· he must realize that we know it. Hence, defection 
for him is out of the::quesUon. He. would only make.a 
short-term profit in <toi~g so. •
