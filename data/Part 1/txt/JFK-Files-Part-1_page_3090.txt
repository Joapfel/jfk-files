3. A~ OX!l1:l inod in Ret-ironce A we briofttd BIOGENESIS 
in tho oarly nrto1•110->n or 25 Janunt'y. BIOGnNESIS :i.Jnm,~diately 
iSS\1ed il\st1·uctio~ that tho portero of tho building be 
RP1n·oncho<l. This wa,; accomp·1Tshadsuccessfully in the 
lnt\' afto1•noon of tho snmo d.,y. Unfortunntoly the portero 
did not hnvo a koy. The snml: nir~ht a BJOGENESIS team of 
.thrh.t (including BIBAFFLE-3 nnd BIOGENES1'3-l4) nttomptod 
in vain to i1ick tho tock. I11 the coursl, of this lock­
pkking oxorc i!:1e PIBAFFLE-3 had to identify BIOGSNESIS 
intci.·ost in tho npai-tmont to tho owno1• of tho noighboring 
apnrtmont. Foi-tunatoly this individual is wealthy and 
was coopoi-ntivo. 
• 4. Onco wo had boon forced to tompornrily withdraw 
(ALFERYEV occupied the apartment on 27 Janunry), we 
obtainod through BIOGENESIS the bluop:rints of the target 
. apartmont nnd tho apartmonts Which nbuttod. A study of 
~hoso bluoprints shows that the apartmont balonging to 
•• tho woalthy coop•Jrntivo neighbor has a mnid's room which 
sharos tho wall of the living room of ALFERYEV1 s. 
apartmont. wo pointed this _out to BIOGENEs·xs and suggested 
that thoy Ollliat tho fr1•ther cooporntion of the owner in 
ordor that a microphono could be installed through the 
C011111bn wall. Unfortunat.:?ly tho owner had doparted for
