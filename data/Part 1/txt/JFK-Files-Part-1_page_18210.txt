, ~~,.;y ,.st.:itcs of the Center~South. (Parana, • Sao Paulo, and

parties~ the PDC wns unable to campaign under its own banner 
in th~- presidential and parli~eptary elections of late 1966. 
Expar\clc:d political activity will p-robably be permitted after 
the seatin~f of.' President Costa c Silva in March 1967, but it 
is e.'\..-:,cctcd that the number of legally recognized political 
· parties will be U.rilited. It appears ·likely- that the PDC will
