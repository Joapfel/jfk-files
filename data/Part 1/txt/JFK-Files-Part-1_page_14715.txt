[ 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 [ 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RE.CORD 
SUBJECT: Poasible DRE Animus Towards President J<ennedy 
1. This memorandum makes record oC a recollection 
which has been brought to mind in recent weeks since my return 
Crom Yugoslavia in late November 1966. 
z. In Spring 1961, upon returning Crom Berlin I was 
assigned to JMWAVE. One ·oc the cases on whi.ch I worked Crom 
then until shortly before my reassignment to Headquarters in 
late summer 1963 concerned Cundini? oC overseas elements oC 
the DRE (Student.Revolutionary Directorate) which had its main 
oCCice in Miami (the case officer Cor this group during this 
period was Mr. Ross CROZIER, since resigned). 
3. I believe that it is this group, the DRE, which has been 
referred to in investigations into the President's assassination 
as the Cuban Student Directorate, whose New Orleans represen­
tative is said to have had contacts with OSWALD. 
4. I have assumed that, since the time I was transferred 
Crom Miami and scheduled for my next assignment as EOBJ;t,=1-­
i Q fz.agreb] officers better and more recently informed than myseU 
'have probably examined in detail all aspects oC the DRE involve­
ment with OSWALD, in order to rule out any slight possibility 
that compro.nise oC the CIA sponsorship of this organization 
might in any way embarrass the Agency. Recent news reports of 
investigations centering in New Orleans on the assassination have 
once again brought to mind the c~ncern I felt in November 1963, 
by which time, however, I was far removed Crom curren~ knowledge 
of the operation.
