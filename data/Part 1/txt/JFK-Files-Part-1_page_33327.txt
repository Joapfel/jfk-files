PR po!icy resolution which !he dissidents described 
a<; "complete:y removed from the characteristic and 
distinctive ideology of_ our partY'.' and opposed lo 
"the inlcresl of !he middle social strata" whom the. 
_party had alwJys represented.' For a lime, the PIR 
continued lo support the A·llende governmel"t, but 
within a year it had entered the ranks of the opposi-
tion. • 
In July 1971, the Christian Democrats had voted 
In lavo( of the constitutional amendment n~tional­
lzirig ttic copper mines, but from lhJt point forward, 
the pallern was one of polarization of Chilean politics 
and·sociNy into two opposing blocks. The Allende· 
forces controlled the f"~P.Cutive and pursued an in­
creasingly vigorous ideological purge of th_ose who 
were nof entirely sympathetic to the gove/nment. 
The opposition controlled • the legislature, and in 
October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the 
rightist parties aticmpted to assert legislative con­
trol over the-expansion of the public sector by voting 
• fn· favor of a· constitutional amendment limiting the 
use of the intervention and requisition procedures 
arid requiring that all transfers of private enterprises: 
to the "social" or mixed sectors be carried out In 
accordance with specific legislation adopted by the 
Congress. Tl'lis legislative act, ,eferred to as an 
amendment on the "Thrc,i'•Areas. of Property," be- I 
came the focus of a continuing deadlock between 
the Presideni and Congress that lasted . until 
Allende's overthrow in September 1973. • 
Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or. to 
call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the 
Congress appeared to the congressional opposition 
to be a decisive indication of his determination to 
bypass the legislature In carrying out the Popular 
Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of 
the amendment onward, the Christian Democrais:­
began to cooperate with the rlghtist parties in- op­
posing the executive. One method was to impeach 
ministers for violation or (more often) nonentorce­
ment of the law. The first of many such impeach­
ments took place in January 1972. Another method 
was to present a united electoral front against the 
government. Informal cooperation between the 
rightist parties and the Christian Democrats ied to 
striking vicloril.?s in two by-elections in January 1972, 
and a month 1ater these groups formed the Demo­
cratic Confederation (Conlederacion Democratica­
CODE) to prepare joint lists for the 1973 congres­
sional elections. A third area of cooperation was in
