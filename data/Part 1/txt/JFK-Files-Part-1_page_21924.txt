2. v~nereal Di~ka~e 
The incident which NOSENKO ~as most often cited as an 
example of his irresponsibility 1!'1 the period p!·ior to 1956 
involved his illegal use of KGB al.ias documents to cover treat­
ment for a case of goncrrhea he contracted in 1954, at tl1e time 
his wife was pregnant with their first child. The:_ CIA psycho­
logist who questioped ~;osENKO in l!ay 1966 submitti;d the follow­
ing summary of llOSENKO' s statements about this incident, which 
are about as given e~rlier (during the April 1964 i~terroga­
tion) : 
"A girl friend he had kno;m in Leningrad since 1945 car:1e 
to visit relatives in l·'.oscow in 1954; ,.She .called r.im, and he 
spent some time with her. She was not a prostitute, and he 
had slept with her before, so he thought nothing of it. Later 
he developed what he feared was a venereal disease. Since his 
wife was pregnant, he was safe both from discovery and the 
danger of infecting her. He searched franticaliy around Moscow 
for a private doctor who treated such diseases, tut could not 
find one. Some of his friends at the office suggested a central. 
clinic that would require no documents. He went here but when 
confronted with a request for doc-..;ments, had the choice of 
showing his KGB certiiicate or using a false passport he had 
for business. He tried to talk the doctor into letting him 
go home to get his documents, but the doctor said ~e would have 
to be accompanied by a member of the militia: otherwise he 
might not come back. :Ie was required to take treat.-:ient of a 
communicable disease. He was forced to cive the false document. 
He .. came back for treat.--;;ent about three times and was ordered 
to report back in two weeks for a fi~al check. They also 
demanded the name of the girl, but he claimed he had only just 
met-her and did not know who she was. He forgot to go back 
and a nurse visited the safehouse about two times and left 
a·notc for him to report. However, he did not go to the safe­
house so knew nothing of the note. In. the false passport was 
a listing of where the named person worked, a fictitious 
factory. As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request 
for information got into the hands of the section which made 
the docwr.ents. llOSE::i{O was called before the deputy chief of 
the Directorate and severely criticized. ne explained ~hat 
had happened and was given five days of house arrest. However, 
the chief of his _section had also gotten word of t~e infraction 
and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even 
talking to him. P.e told his wife he was going on a trip and 
moved into the administrative room near the office to serve 
his term. In the meantime, the Secretary of the KGB Party . .
