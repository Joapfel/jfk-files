COF/.f.MTS (Con'd) E<Ctivities and person&litiea and his n·asp of the 
V?rious rr.volutionary r::ovements :rnd !'i.rurcs• has been 
freely shareci with the St.:;t'.on Chief •. These "briefing·: 
rneetingsR represent an intan~ible contrib~tion to 
the ovPr-all performance of this StGtion. ~~bject 1s 
ear,er to expand l!i5 operntio:is, and, if her.dqu&rters 
approves the removnl of present opcrr:tional r~stric­
tions, it is believed he can he riven further 
resnonsi bili tie:,, purticularly. in the recruitinp- of 
additional sub-ap:ents. This St1,tion is presently 
interested in &Ccomplishin~ a parallel penetration of 
the Col2iunist Party, in expandinP, routine investir,a-
tive coverage, and in (evelopinr additional sources 
on political r.iovements. lt is believed that su~ject 
has potential in e;,ch of these ficlus. However, as· 
reported previously, lfiJ!.-.ANOll> is beset with financial 
problems which uncicubtcdly iletr,,ct fror.. hi6 full 
workinr· efficfency on matters ·.Jf interc:;t to us. His 
GI subsistence is currently terminnted· -:uring the 
school vacutiGns and a certain portion of his tin-;e .is 
devoted to odd jobs in an effort to au~ment his 
income. The forr.,er Chief of Stc1tion rccol'fi."'.cnded an 
increase fro!".! 1,000 to 1,500 colones in July, 1951, a 
recommendation in which the writer concurred. However, 
in the event current o~crntional restrictions a~e 
rel:loved, it is desired· to rP.comr::cnd at this til!:e an 
increase to sixteen hundred (1,600) colones per month. 
The additional one hundred coloncs pernonth is 
sur~ested in view of the fact that subject has 
borrowec r:oney in recent ~onths to t1eet hos~ital bills, 
anc because he has been aware of and prob~bly counted 
on the raise reco~ .. end;:,tion of the former Ch.i ef of 
F _,. _ , Station. Further, if the restrictions arc lifted, it.. ~i
