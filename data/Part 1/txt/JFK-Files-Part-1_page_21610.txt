American Emba.osy Section :nor a. senior oiiicer or 
supervisor in the Section during the period 1961-1962. (sic)· 
F. NOSEXKO's claims·, tha.t in l962·he '!"as Chief 
of the American-British Commonwealth Section and was 
thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Departnient, are 
·not ·credible. 
G~ ,;'N<:>SE:::-.."KO has no valid claim to certainty, 
:·.that the KGB recruited no American Embassy ;>ersonncl 
between 1953 anci ilis defection in 1964. 
These findings dii!er somewhat with respect to degree of ;,rooability 
• or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of available evidence 
in ea,c~'instance. II 
"The··above judgments, i£ correct, rebut preswn;>tive evidence 
of NOSE?\"KO's bona fides. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts 
of his- life and KGB service are so extensive as to make his claims 
as a whole·_unacceptab:ie.
