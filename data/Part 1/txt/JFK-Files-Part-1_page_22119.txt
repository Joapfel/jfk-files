Resident in Cuba, ~.I. ALEiSEYEV, handed hi~ a package with in­

that t.l-.o pack.:']e was +:.,:, i,~ d~l i•,ered "urgently" to Che GUEVARA, 
who was tour:ng the Satellite countries and was then in Berlin. 
h'hile the delegation ::::ontinc:!':::d on to Mosco•,1, NOSSUKO therefore 
was driven to the Soviet Embassy in The Hague, and in the late 
evening of his second day in The Netherlan~s he left by train 
for East Berlin. When he arrived, however, he found that 
GVEVARA had left Berlin for Hungary. NOSE~;KO refused to go any 
further. The package was delivered to GUEVARA's deputy in 
Berlin 0 and NOSENKO then returned to Moscow. 
CIA tr.;.vel records show that NOSENKO, listed as a mineral 
engineer, transitted Am.sterdam en route to Cu!:>a on 15 November 
1960: and that he ~ransitted Caracas from ,\rnsterdam on 17 Novem­

en route to Havana. 0 Our records also show that NOSENKO again 
arrived in Amsterdam en route to Moscow from Havana on 13 Decem­
