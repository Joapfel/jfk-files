COLITSYS (from personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son 
of the former Minister of Shipbuilding, uaa a KGB officer 
who had worked in the American D~partment and the Seventh 
·Department of the Second Chief Directorate, GOLITSYN, while 
on his own First Chief Directorate buaineaa, met NOS!NKO two 
_or three times in the American Embassy Section in 1953, 
and had sepn hie occasionally at work du~ing 1958 and 1959. 
When COLITSYN asked him where he vaa working in 1959, NOSENKO 
~eplied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.· 
JOSENKO served in th~ American Embassy Section from 1951 
_until 1957 or 195~, and waa specifically responsihl~ for 
KGB coverage of American military paraonnel in Moscow during 
1953. For th~ remaind.ar,of hi9 service in the Embsasy Section 
~~til 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same responsi- • 
.b.ilitfes or r.,ay have bl!en working against other Embaasy 
~ersonnel or correspondents, but he was definitely in the 
.~merican Departcent ~uring the entire period, In 1957 qr 
1958 SOSESKO vas transferred to ihe Seventh ~epartment, and 
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. • NOSENKO did not 
work in the A~erican Department oi the Second Chief Directorate 
~~erican Department at any time during.1960; GOLITSYN visited 
the Embassy Section on at least. three occasions from· early 
1960 to early 1961, and would have known if NOSESKO had been• 
in the Section, particularly if .NOSENKO had been Deputy Chief. 
C,I. CRYAZ~OV was acting aa assistant of the Chief of th• 
Section during this period. •
