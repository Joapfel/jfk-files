Mr. Phillips brings to this assignment (his first as Chief of Station) 
a wealth of CA experi.eric~ gain~d through many year.s of operatirig in the 
Western Hemisphere aµd-other areas. As a propagandist and general CA -
·opehltor h_e must ra~ hlgh:among all Agency personne. Consequently, 
it was indeed fortunate that.his assignme_nt to_ the Dominican Republic came 
at a tirne when a persvn of his talent was badlr needed. Arriving shortly 
after the American interv_ention he has had.the difficult t~sk of ferreting 
out information in great deta-il about an entirely· riew gc:"·eri'unent, 
diplomatically handling the ·delicate _coordinations with other U. s. 
Government agencies in a crisis and. highly emotional situation, ~vhile 
administering a rapidly expanding station composed i~ large degree of 
young men long.on initiative and intelligence but somewhat lacking in depth 
orexpcrience. At present he is engaged in a falrly large and vastly 
importunt election operation which is of concern Lo the highest authorities 
of our government.

I heartily endorse the rater's comments. The Santo Domingo 
Station, under the excellent leadership of Mr. Phillips, recently 
completed a most successful and significantly im?ortant political action 
operation. It was a well-done Station operation but great credit has to 
go to Mr. Phillips personally.
