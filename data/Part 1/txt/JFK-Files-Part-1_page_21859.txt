Case Of course. 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: Never in my life I will go in contact ( 1111 th _ 
CIAI in MoscQW or t!te USSR, never in my life. 
I a)so know about L~ngelle and POPOV;• I know 
this matter. When it was abroad it was fine, 
but when:you decided to.meet him in ~o~cow ... 
You want more than I came with the intention 
of saying. You want to change this to a long~ 
. term relationship. Understand me. I am no~ 
the chief of a section. Before my de~arture 
[from Moscow! a decision was being reached--
and I h2ve just 8poken with my wife in Moscow-­
I am supposed to become the deputy chi~f of a 
department. Do you understand what this is? 
Case Why are you telling me this? 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: 
Case 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: 
n.~causc I wanted to co'me [to CUI only for a 
business cieal, to r;ive y'ou these two ca,es, 
to receive money for this, and that's all. 
Goodbye. Perhaps, sometime, when I come 
abroad, we will meet one another and perhaps 
I will give you sorneth 4 .·.~. God knows. But 
I don't want t~ do this now. I don't want 
to and I am not prepared within myself for this ... 
I am ~iving two interesting cases. The most 
interesting ones. I say to you honestly, the 
two most interesting on~s. In the first of 
them l•~~DUEY"** I, I took nb part. In the second 
[BELITSKIY***I I took part, even here. 
I want you to understand that these two matters 
that you spoke to Mr. MARK about are of great 
importance to us. But I don't have to tell you 
that. You know that. But we are not going to 
play like children. You know ,erfectly well 
that it is worth every franc... What I want 
to tell you is this: of course I will ask you 
more, and of course l want to know as much as 
you know. If you refuse to answer, that's your 
business. 
I will tell what I am able to tell. What I 
know, I will tell. Of course, you yc·ll'self 
understand that there are things concerning our 
internal system that I cannot report to you-. 
You yourself understand this.
