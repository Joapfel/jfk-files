REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:. 
Although I would not' differ from tho evaiuativo 
comment on this "rifCfc~r, I would bo inclined to rate his 
ovor-·au perfor.inance a's highly PRO.FICIENT rather than 
Strong, in view of his broad experience and ~radc. This 
officer has ha1·11 series of personal an~ taxing problems, 
bcjond~bis -control, whi~h ~~vo tended to dull his cutting 
edge just enough to bo noticeable. •
