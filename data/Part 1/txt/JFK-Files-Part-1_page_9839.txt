Reference: BDA.-31821, dtd 3 April 1967. 
1. CID 15 April 1968, circa 1410 hours, tbe audio installation 
described ill reference was d.mctlvated. The SP'l'-2A vas recovered 
by ll'alter W. CORNBUllY and returned to st~ti.on stock. 'Ihe !.l' equip-
aent, 1111 SPR-2A and 1JJID 4000 L, rill also be returned to StatiOD 
stock. ; i 
2. Inasameb as LIRING-3 and LIRili0-4 were terminatiag their 
•1eu.e~ Oil tbe target apartment, it was felt tbe SPT-2A carrier 
carrent transmitter would have to be removed because of its Bhallov 
conceahlent. To con ti.Due tbe assessment of target persooali ties. 
bOB"eVer, we wanted to wait until alaost the last ainute. The week 
of 15 April 1968 was selected as an appropriate ti.Jle by Wallace B. 
ROlrT05, wbo ts in coatact vitb the targets. 
3. At about 1300 boars, 15 April 1968, Walter V. ™*• and 
011vin" D. CiiiuC'd entered the ~ aud ,n,re greei..ed DJ LI:iu5ui viao uev 
we vere caai.Dg but did not kDov why. A ch~k of tbe audio device 
revealed that LIBili0-4 and a young (teen-age) male relative were in 
tbe target. '11lis was as expected. At 1330 hours, LIBUT0-4i left._ 
tile apartBellt, alone, for a luncheon date ritb ROlfTOlf. She returned 
a few ii1liuteii later 6iid iinide the .male relative aceump.uiy ia!,i'. (iws 
was obviously at toe illsiatence of aOfn'O:i.) The telephone mber of 
tile target aparuient was tried a few ai.Dutes after their departure 
I I i I. 
IIDd was aot IUl.S1'e?'eCJ, again as expected. At 1400 hOUTS a telepboue i 
call was received ill the LP from tbe Station aa a relay frua EOW'l'O!f i 
that the targets were safely eDBCOllaed for at least tbe De:1:1: bom-. I
