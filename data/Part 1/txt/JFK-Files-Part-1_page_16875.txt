MllHARSHers undoubtedly assume we have a LILYllIC-likt" facility, and 
act accordingly, nre another vital clement of the Rl:DTOP program. 
LIEMPTY-4 
9.. LI~MPTY-4. has continued to develop and to print all of 
~he· LICALL,\ and LILYl!lC photographs, He has been met regularly by 
Bruce H. FJ::.RN/\LD (taking over !or GtRi·:KD~) since 26 November 1969. 
The first- _few meetings· at that time (late November and early 
DecembeJ'.) were arranged by 1':ImNALD by telephone to LIEMPTY-4 and 
pri~arily concerned LIJ:l.lPTY-4's rcpof"ts on GJ::U~DK's family problems 
• ~ind .rela:ted security ar_rangemepts. Sinc·e mid-December, LI.t:MPTY-4 • 
re,:um~d a r~gular: ·sch~a~l~ ..(usually weekly) of meetings at 
pre-arranged- sites· an·!) times. LIJ::MPTY-4 has bo~n gh"en a special 
extension i11--tbe ~tation to which he may call as "Dr. Carlos" to 
, leave a m~ssage: for "V_ictor''- -(.FJ::~ALD) •. FERNALD can change meeting 
plans by di·rectly calling LII::MPTY-4. The only personal problem 
direc.tly invo'iving LIE~IPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required 
his ~earing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks. During 
this~'period. when LIEMPTY-4 bas been unable to drive, FERNALD has 
been meotir.g LIE~n>TY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films 
and prints, at LIEMPTY-4's office, under a suitabl~ ·pr~toxt and with 
appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services are 
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continui~g basis, 
process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab. 
SECURITY 
10. Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's 
personal problems, thore have beon no security problems during the 
reporting period, 
FUTURE PLANS 
11. As for GERENDE, the Station has roached the conclusion 
that be must be terminated. '1his is not an easy decision to make, 
nor ~ill it be easy to confront GEHENDE with this decision. He 
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVUOCK. However, 
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able 
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant 
security risk poscd_by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk. 
To try to molify her ·by promising•h~r a portion of bis salary is 
probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her 
attitude has progressively hardened. The Station, therefore, 
intends to terminate GEHENDi~ prior to tho end of FY 1970. GERENO~•s 
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary·per 
full yenr. This wo1.1ld come to $8,750 (-USD). For \'nrious reasons, 
including the need to 1>reserve the security of the operation by 
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be 
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GEIUlID.t,; about $10,000 
(USD). Furthermore, it will bo necessary to inform LIEMPTY-.l9 of 
the termination, and., to keep her from revealing what she knows, 
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herself. The 
Station does not believe that it would boequitable or mund from 
a security poin~ of view to use tho money which GER~DE himself has 
earned for this purpose. Therefore, while tho figure will remain 
negotiable, the Statiou believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD) 
would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in 
the LltA!.V'l'Y Proj~cl 1u·~ . .:u.i.T.:;ntly osti1:1:1t~d at slightly lPl'IR than 
$33·,ooo (USO). The Project has been approved io the amount of 
$38,970 (USO) leaving·unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It 
is therefore requested that tbe LIEMPTY Project be amended for 
FY t970 to provi9e an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the 
_GBRENDE termination. Funds will be avail-able at the Station.
