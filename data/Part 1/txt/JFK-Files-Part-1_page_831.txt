91. AMFAUNA-14 says that the AMHICK team performed very well, The 
pickup in the park was done excellently, The slight delay while they 
looked her over, she says, was due _to the fact that the men had ex­
pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minute 
1n case the other woman should show up, The AMHICK team said that the 
bad also been briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun.

be under surveillance, so she thinks Lolita might have taken them 
directly to AMCUTLBR-2. In any case, she knows that messages sent
