this, NOSENKO himself ha.s statec: -::~'"1.a.t :.t did not occur to hi.--n to· tell 
us because the stake out had long sir .. ce been dropped, it had revealed 
not1_1ing suspicious on the part of ABIDIAN or anyone else, and ther~fore 
he had regarded it as insignificant. 
This is not implausible. Al1o_t:-ier possible explanation,. however, 
derived from the already noted inability of NOSENKO to pin down a date 
for the visit, is that he learned of the stationary surveillance post if not 
of the visit itself after his meetings with us in _June 1962 .• It shouid be 
noted in this context that with the public e~posure of the PENKOVSKIY 
case in the fall of 1962, the Pushkin Street deaddrop undoubtedly became 
the subject of widespread interest within the KGB. 
That NOSENKO is at a minimum still_ confused about the visit 
of ABIDIAN to the Pushkin Street deaddrop and its consequences is clear 
from the record. While it is entirely possible that NOSENKO has con­
sciously exaggerated his involvement with the v~sit and its aftermath, 
it is also possible t...1-iat the evident distortions of his accou... .. ts of fn.e 
affair derive from honest confusion. 
Current interviews and a· check of the tapes of previous i..""lter-
views leave no doubt foat NOSENKO was aware of the visits of ABIDIAN 
to the upper Gorkiy S-;;ree~ area circa March 1961. T:-iese visits by 
ABIDIAN were for cover purposes and p:::eceded his start of operatio:..:al
