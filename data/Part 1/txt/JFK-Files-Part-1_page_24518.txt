RD'DDCE: BPI.A 10070, iG !fay 1969 
1. As requested by the Station in Reference, we have had 
translated tbe letters written by Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV, 
and the translations aTe forwarded herewith. 
2. The attachment to LEOHOV'e letter of 2 May, and all but 
the postscript of the 3 Hay letter are, .as the Station pointed 
out, apparently pure propaganda. The same cannot be said, however, 
for the 2 May letter, which is full of less tnan laudatory comments 
on Lisa, its climate, and tbe insect population of the Hotol Savoy. 
Of even moro sigoificnnc'e are LJ:.'OliOV' s opinions on the VALCARCELS, 
which appoar in the 2 M,1y letter, and the revelation in the 3 May 
letter postscript of the precarious financial position of the 
magazine. One wonders why an intelligence officer of LEONOV'S 
experience and intellect would include such matters in letters 
sent through the open mail.
