·••· Information.from NOSENKO· 
At the first of the i9'34 111eeting·s in Geneva NOSE!,KO 
described the provocation and arrest of Yale -Ur.iversity 
Professor Frederick B..\RGHOOR.'i' • in ·late 1963; he was qU€is­
tioned farther on this case on· 3 Fcbtuary 1964 arid again 
v,·hilo· waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United Statos. 
NOSE~lCO's most cor.prehansive statement, from which the 
followin~ paragraphs mere largely dr~wn, was ~ade on 9 June 
1964. * On this last occasion !;OSE~l(O said that the pur-
pose of the KGB os;er11t1on again!:lt DARGHOOn~ w&.G to retal 1.ate 
for persona non grata ection taken against tu~ee Soviets 
i 11 :Sew York 'Clty-rn-t'hc case of John W. BUTE~1!-:0 and to • 
secure a hostage in exchange 1·0r a fourth Soviet in the, 
Bl'TE~KO case who .,.-as jailed. In Geneva, however, NOSENKO 
maintn1ner1 that the oµeration against BAflGIIOO?.~ "w11s to 
discourage future arrests such as that of IVA~OV [the 
jailed Sov!otl, not because of any spacial importance of 
IVMmv hicself." 
NOSENKO said that in 1963 four }:GB First Chief Direc­
torate officers assigned to the New York Legal Residency 
were caught in operational activity in the United Stntes. 
Of th.a four, three had .diplomatic irununity, but one was a 
chauffeur and had only a service passport. The three 
Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by tho 
lu:ierican authorities an<.l then released. IV .. \XOV, the chauf­
feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.•• 
GRIDANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, 
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed 
by KGi3 Chair!llan SEI.UCII.\STNYY to take "necef.sary measures." 
GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G. 
KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Departm~nt; and G.I. GRYAZ­
NOV and Ye.~. RASHCHEPOV, both Deputy Chiefs from the Ameri­
can Departr.cnt. After explaining tho arrest, GRIBANOV 
askod what information the Second Chief Directorate had on 
any American--U.S. Embassy enployce or tourist--that coulu 
•The detail of NOSE?.1m' s information on the B . .\RGHOORN case 
reflect~ both the extent of the CIA debriefings and th~ 
depth ot his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact, fur-
nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting 
with CIA. NOSENKO was also able to describe at length 
BARGHOORN's professional backgroun<l, which gave rise to KGB 
suspicions of intelligen·ce affiliation, and he provided the
