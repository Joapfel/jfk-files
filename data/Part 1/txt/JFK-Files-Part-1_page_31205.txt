Mr. Wigren is a conscientious .and cap:,ble research officer 
with a good g1·asp of his material and is able \ft\llp1ao-,.«:nt it 
effectively to a·udienccs o{ widely varied sop his tlca tion. Since 
his last report, \ the basic orientation o[ SR/CI has changed, and is 
now dir<'cted almost wholly to the creation and exploitation of opera-
tions. The 9rgani'za tion thus needs more uqi•1n l l y than ever the 
digested operational experience which it ii,; Mi·. IU1,:ren's j_ob to 
produce. This has made it_ 1)ecessary. to apply strict priorities 
,- based· on op~rational need and 1:-elevancy. which has L>ccn dlf ficul t 
·for Mr. Wigren, who has no direct operational expe1· ience .. He 
has not been able to get the niost out of hi::; pcopl<.!_, nor give them 
the sort of .clos~~ind·consistent guidance which ·some of them rcqu.1.rc 
in the. f-ace .,of· changing or sudden rcquJrcments. lie has a tendency 
7 ::.; 'tO be over-c:oncerned with'organizational and L>ur('attcratic exercise 
to the expen~e of substantive production. Nonetheless, his real·· 
qual-ities caine to the fore recently when he produced well and used 
·his staff effectively on an important and complicated projqct. 
He 1s a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr~ Wig~en performs his duties with maximum e·conomy.
