, b. ··lC!vertheless, he hns recetved some ra·ther telliag 
critlcls= of ii pr~fcaslonal nature, even though 1~ is 
unknown whether this criticism also touches on his personal

. careful ia whstever he does, avoiding mistakes that would ea­
danger his pdiition, aod~voiding any real ~r fancied 
provocat iOD. · • 
.c. There seems to be litt.le question that AMAUT0-1 is 
•pproachnble, although he would probably resist any 
·indirect approach in which ''cards ar·e not laid on the tnble." 
It, appeai-_s very_,likely that ht's character is basicaily incom­
. patible .. •~V~- the system he serves (with profound mis:tivinga

perhaps me~·n1ng· that he would not accept a PCS asaigDJDent 
home. (T:be attacbJBelit hereto shows him describing a • 
compatriof who wigbes to return ·home as· "a fool.") He bas 
said himself that he believ~s AMTHUG-1 plans a major purge 
for mid-197O, and he might consider bimself as a victim of 
that purge, • 
e. A fact·which might affect timing is the arriv~l of 
a child in MaJ. If he were to persuade his wife (and his 
government)· to have the child in Spain, rntller than return 
home for it , he ·would have· a good excuse for requesting the 
presence of his oldest child (the only one who is· aow at 
home). If his wife returns home for delivery, he would (for 
a time at least) have three hostages in PBRtn!EN instead 
of one. • 
f. UYGA-19OO6 reported a 1964 at-tempt to get at AM.AUTO-I 
through his wife's relatives. The consensus at the time was 
that AJ4AU'IO-l is prcbnbly illllll!tne to this type of approach. 
~eadquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed, 
"traditional" recruitment build-up. 
3. In lillfl with the obove, Headquarters suggests to Madrid 
certain lines of action which might be followed in an atte~pt to 
know more about AilAUT0-1. These nctions might seem somewh:1t easier 
from our perspective tha~· they,.?ctually are in the field, but we 
propose the111 for your consideration. 
a. The man handling the new construction work (paragraph 16 
of the attachment) should be checked out. 
b. Tho established pattern of lonely automobile trips 
outside the capital· (see paragraph 22 of the attachment) 
might.be instructive t·o follow down. At least, the situation 
might offer ,,a chance for apJ)roach or for subseque~t handling. 
c. AltAUT0-1 's desire to see more pf!ople at home, and 
the indication that he diecusees important matters at home 
becomes doubly interesting with the possibility of a vacaat 
house next door (see par:igraph !8 of the attactu:aent). The 
pt1rson who owns the 111artment buUding mig'lt offer a fruitful 
lead. 
d. The apparent hoetility of the current maid (see para­
graph 24 and 27 of the attachment) might offer further 
exp1oitat1on.
