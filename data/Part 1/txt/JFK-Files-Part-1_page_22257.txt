The only other evidence avai:able is analytical. POPOV was 
transferred to the Ille1als handling unit in Derl1n on 28 June 
1957, an a~sigr.ment of high sensitivity. Until mid-August he 
hanaled fi.vr.: Illegals, thereafter only one, TAIROVA, in October 
1957. • Following home leave from 12 December 19:>7 to 19 January 
1958, he was aoain transferre1, this time to a position where 
Illegals and productive GRU sources of 1ntelli~ence were not ex­
posed to him. Between .March and November 1958 there were signs 
of a KGD investigation of the Ille~als handlinqunit where POPOV 
formerly served, and he was recallt:d to Moscow ·tn: november of that 
year. Th<?se facts can be interpret: ed as follows:' 
- POPOV's status as a CIA so~rce was not compro~is~ before 
his transfer to the Illegals handling unit. 
- POPOV's status was comprcmised before his recall to MoscaJ 
in November 1958, probably before his reassigr.ment from the 
Illegals hendliny unit in January 1958, ar.d possibly some ti.roe 
earlier. The latttr possibility is apparent from the Soviets' 
knowledge that the TAIROVA couple was under surveillance in 
December 1957 (and until Harch 1958); it is also noteworthy 
that, after having m~t five Illegals in less than one and one­
half months prior to 13 AugJst 1957, POPOV subsequently was 
involved personally .,..1th only one other, TAIROVA, in October 
1957. 
- The KGB, realizing that POPOV was a CIA source, chose to 
keep him in Derlin until November 1958 in order to investigate 
the possibility of his operating in conjunction with other 
CIA sources. 
This line of reasoning, if accepted, would confirm GOLITSYN's in­
formation that a KGB agent compromised POPOV prior to the arrival 
of z.HUKOV in Berlin, an arrival date fallir.g some time before 
23 November 1957.

••***Since such orientation papers are written for general circula­
tion within the KGB, it is doubtful that KGB security prac­
tices would permit their canter.ts to reveal sensitive infor­
mation; other sources r.ave indicated that orient~t1on papers 
sometimes are sanitized; this particular paper, however, 
reportedly did state that the KGB learned from an agent in 
about 1957 (GOLITSYN's estimate) that A~er1can Intelligence 
had a source which had provided GRU information. 
******This date, which is c0nsistent with that cited in the final 
sentence of the preceeding footnote, was derived from the 
time when POPOV reported the presence of the KGB officer 
ZHUKOV in Berlin; according to GOLITSYN, ZHUKOV was sent to 
Berlin after POPOV had been identified by a KGB agent as 
being a source of CIA.
