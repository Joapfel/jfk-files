1964 and said that he wanted to c~~e right over as he bad 
somethlng i~portant to say, The meeting witn CIA opened 
as follows: "I was thinking last nigh: and I realized 
that 1 have made a Qistake ano it bothered ne, so I 
wanted to be sure to call it to your attention toJay. Re­
member when I told ro~ we we?'e working on Ji~ STORSBERG, 
. the code clerk, and after that a replacement ca:e for him? 
And I said that we wante:i to get a. hold of hi:n because he 
vas ahomosexual? It was not ZUJUS, but it was KEYSERS. 
In· other words, everything 1 said. about ZUJUS ap;,lies to' 
lEYSERS." 
"I don't remember having any face-to•face encounters 
(vith Americans) except ,...hen KEYSERS was leav~ng," NOSESKO 
stated on 17 April 1964. "When he was being taken to th~ 
airport we decided, 'Why not try, in case he's alone; vhy 
not approach him and ask'hi~ if he wants to stay?' And sure 
enoush he stood there with these two officers and then he 
walked into the restaurant alone ••• So 1 i~~ediately ap•
