12. DEpartment of Medical Dot any. This departi.1cnt is headed 
by a very1TiwII 1gent ancl-cuTfiu·ea"Spanish ag1·011G•.: ,.:;t narucu 
Guillermo Citl who has been in Cuba since 1940. It is cifecting 
a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to dete·,·1.ii11e the 
pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cul,;1n plants. 
The department works in coordination with the experim<mtal 
station _i.1 Santi:-.igo de las Vegas th-at is directed by the eminent 
92-year old Dr. Juan Tomas Roi~ Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban 
expert on Cuban and tropicnT!Tora and one of the greatest 
authorities in the world on medicinal plants. In addition, the 
department has the cooperation.of all the experimental agTon­
omical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of 
any plant considered worth investigation; the department con­
ducts an exhaustive analysis of such samples. The research has 
two objecti'-'.cs: 
a. The utilization of tha curative properties of the 
plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national 
raw materials and can replace many imported pro­
ducts. 
b. The launching on the ~orld market of competitive 
pharmaceutical products, following the example 
of Red China and Dulgaria . 
13. The work of the Department of Medical Dotony will pro­
bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com­
peten~e of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) th~ ~xtraordinjry 
impulse that has·been imparted to its research program, and

As of September 1966, a department that would do research on bio­
mechanics was being organized within the CNIC. Th~ Cuban Go~ern-
ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the a1,pli-
