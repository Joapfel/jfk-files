eflective s~pct'visor. He brings to the performance of his duties 
broad knowledge and ex~erien.:e of security procedures ar:.d !-' radices. 
He has been most dfr-.::ti.v~ in keeping a close rein on budget.1ry 
obligations within his Diredor:i.te, 
-1. Mr. O'Connell is p~·rsonable and articulate and is able to 
express himself wdl in b...1th writh-n and oral form, His ca re,: r 
is marke.d by steady ;i,h-:in,:.:-nwnt and consistently high level ,J,~r­
formances, He posscs»es all of the requisite qualities of a s,:'1ior 
Security executive. Ho\\"'c!\·cr, I feel that he has not as )·ct a?,,lic•d 
all of these qualities to th,dr maximum potential in his p,.'rfor:11ance 
as-DD/PTOS. Mr. O'wnr:.dl has one Division Chief who is cx:r:i.­
ordinarily capa.hle and dfrcti\'c in producing results. Com·c ,:icly, 
however, he presents <):r:,e .._-,_f the most difficult supcnisory j):-,.,1,lcms 
in the Office be-cause ol certain personal characteristics. I don't 
feel, and I bclil,ve that :i.!r, 0' Connell would agree with me, t1:o,t 
he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I 
am convinced, however. that h .. - is fully aware o( th<> problem .-rnd 
is working hard to achic,·c t!te proper supervisory balance. I rHe 
his performance. on b:i.b:~.:-.:-, .:is STRONG wilh many outst.c1diC":-s features. 
I have complete confiden.:: .. • in ~1r. 0_' Connell's ability, judp:11:·:1t and
