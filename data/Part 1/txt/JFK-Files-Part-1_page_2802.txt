Comment: NOSENKO's information is substantially correct, 
that no letters were mailed for one and a half 
years after LANGELLE's expulsionf and that 
AB¾DIAN mailed two or three letters, including 
ones to the Baltic area and to Odessa. No 
letters were mailed from February 1960 until 
ABIDIAN mailed one on 1 April 1961, and of the 
three letters ABIDIAN mailed, one was to Odessa 
and one each to Latvia and Estonia. 
CIA has conducted tests to determine whether 
a substance such as metka was being used as a 
KGB control device. Ultra-violet, che~ical 
and microscopic analyses developed one possible 
use of a metka like substance. Analysis of an 
article of clothing of a foreign diplomat in 
Moscow who served as a CIA support agent 
produced a sharply positive reactione 
NOSENKO later described how metka was applied to ABIDIAN's 
clothing by his maid and how, in particular, this led to 
the discovery·6f ·the-letters ABIDIAU mailed to the agent in 
. _ Odessa _aJ?-d to his parents in the U.nited States. 
·"ABIDIAN!s maid in Moscow was Tatyana FEDOROVICH. 
She was an operational contact reporting to ARTEMOV. 
She started to work. for ABIDIAN a few months after 
his arrival, perhaps three months but no longer than 
six months _after his arrival~ I met· her shortly 
after she began to work for A.BIDIAN in order to get 
acquainted with her, in order to evaluate her and 
give her general instructions· about her work for 
ABIDIAN. • I do not know the exact date of this • 
meeting but it was before the fall of 1960. I 
wrot1= the operational plan on ABIDIAN in circa 
October 1960. At this time FEDOROVICH was alre·ady 
working for ABIDIAN. This operational plan stated 
that FEDOROVICH would continue to put metka regularly 
on ABIDIAN's clothing.
