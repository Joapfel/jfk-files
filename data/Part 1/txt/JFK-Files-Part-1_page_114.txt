promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by 
the Identity 3 managem~nt. AltCARDON-1 is by no means an expert 
on Latin America, but be is developing bis knowledge on the area 
and, at the moment,· be gives every indication of wanting to be a 
long-term Latin American specialist. QDELF has been questioned 
about AMCARBON-11 and he bas indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded 
in the journalistic.trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has 
a keen mind .but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American aff~irs. • It ·is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse 
of time, AMCAROON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin 
American specialists in u.s. journalistic circles. AMCARDON-1 
has a working·-collDJ'land of Spanish, and be is constantly attempting to improve his-language fluency. It is REUTEIIAN's opinion that AMCARBON-1 bas developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist, 
and he will c~ntinue to grow in this field. Thus, he is a contact 
who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing 
in mind that he does have long-term potential. • •

traditional pattern of source protection which is common to 
newspapermen, .intelligence officers and law enforcement officers, Al,iCARBON-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his 
sources. On_ the_othex hand, when .pressed, AMCARBON-1 has identified 
some of his sources to REUTEMAN, in order that meaningful evaluations 
coul~ be made ~f that information which AMCARBON-1 had pass~d to 
Jt~Rlt. As a r·esult of these occasional witting iden~ifications
