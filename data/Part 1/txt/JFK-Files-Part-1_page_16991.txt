ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPM£NTS .. OLIVER G. SCANTLING SEGMENT -----
j 2. Af:ect Information - Oliver G. SCANTLING has contlnu"d to p;;!rforrn his 
' assigncotasks in an our:;t anding manner. SCANTLING's poise, common ~e1we, 
education, idL'Ology and native ability for the pursuit' of clan.Jestine acti vit lcs 
make him one of the most v aluablc support.a ss...:ts available to the M;.:'xico City 
Station. The fact that SCANTLING has full time oven occupation as Chief 
Engineer and Pnxt.1 ct ion Mnn:1ger for .1 lo cal 111 anufactur Ing coa1pan y adds to 
his long-rant!'-' potential as a KUDAHK agent. On two occasions during the past 
six months SCANTLL\JG has indicated rn his Ca s<.! Officer that he would li ~e to 
resign from h~s O\'Crt position and devote full time to his KUl3ARK ope r.uional 
duties; howe\·~r, the Case Officer has discouragl'd him from doing this on tlte 
basis that he h:1s more long-range potential when his cover occup.uion is legitimate. 
Of course, SC'.ANTLL;\IG would be more valuable if ht' could work full fr~1e for the 
Staci on, l.Jut not suffic lcntly so to warrant his resignation from his oven job (his 
monthly sala1·)· in his overt job is iu excess of $tl00.00 U. S.). The ualy 
signific am limit :ui on that SCANTLING has evid ... ·nc ~d to hi;-,; prcsl.:!nt Ct sc Officer 
Ts his occasional dday in pre~ar i.ng written reports of investigations and other 
mace ers rcqu iri n:_.?; reports for the files. However, this Hmit atilm gradually is 
being overcome and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports wili conti.nuc to 
be factual, eurr:prchen '?Ive ancj soon will be prompcl y submit tcd. CS £t]P\'

using sqch perish;tble lead:;, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches
