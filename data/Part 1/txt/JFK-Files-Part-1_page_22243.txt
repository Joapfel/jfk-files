NOSu!KO was the first source to report on t~e KGS recruit­
ments of 22 tourists ,non~ with access to classified materials 
and on 11 of whom there -.,as previous deroga<;or:,• information): 
four correspondents (one said by Nosi:;;<o to have becor:,e inacti•:e 
and on two· of whljffl there -.,as previous derogato:-y informat.ion~; 
the American Express Co!'.',pany representative in Mo.s::cr,;; a_ contc"c1. 
employee of USIA -.,ho had earlier declared his intent to marry d 
Soviet national; and two agents whose na~es were not knmm to 
NOSENKO but who were identif.lable. The latter two agents were: 
- Duyle w. Sl-U'Il-1 {KGB cryptonym "1'.!\DP..EY"), a cipt,er 
machine mechanic at the U.S. Ernk><"l&sy in ?·'.osco._. recruited in 
19S3. Despite NOSE?n<O's statement tnat ",·._-.;~RE.Y" 'was current­
ly supplying valuable informdtion in Jur.~ 1962, SMITH lost 
his accees to classified infonnatio~ through retirement from 
the U.S. Army on 30 Nowimocr 1961, or about six months be-fore 
UOSfflKO first reported on him (Pages 413-4:!6). 
- u.s. Army Sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSC~~. vho with his 
-.,ife Hedwig began collaborating with the KGB in 19S2 and 
who made James MINTKE!'t81'UGH an egent of th~ KGB in 1953 
(Pages ~27-462). Hedwig JOilN_St~ disco;;.tir.u~ her role in 
the operation in 1953, clthough thereafter remaining knov­
ledgeable of the KGB activities of her husband and MINT'Arn­
BAUGH1 according to MINTK~BAUGH, who lost access to classi­
fied information in 1954, he had no direct contact with the 
KGB after the late summer or early autU.T.1\ of 1963 (abo~t 
three to five months before ~OS~KO first gave the lead on 
JOHNSON) 1 JOHNSON was still on active d'.lty vith the U.S. 
Army and in contact with the KGB when NOSElil<O reported in 
January 1964 about the existence of this agent. 
Thus from a total of 30 original and identifiable leads, only one 
agent had access to classified information as of the date when 
NOSmKO's reporting on him began. By the criteria given in the 
preceeding paragraph, the si~gle operational lead from NOSE:-c'l<O 
wp!~~_could have da~aged Soviet interests was that which un­
covered JOHNSON. 
It is d~ha.table, however, whether the Jo~:so~, lead cor.sti­
tuted a serious loss to the KGB. In the first placg, if JOnNSON 
can be believed, he gave the Soviets but one classified docu.~ent 
-.,hile in charge of the "C'.assified Control Center" at camp Des 
Loges between August 1963 and May 1964. His KGB case officer 
later told him, JOHNSm~ said, that the inforraation he could pro­
vide vas not worth t-he risk involved and that no future attempts 
of this sort should be made. JOHNSON also stated that he felt 
his espionage work at Camp Des Loges had not been very profitable 
for the Soviets, adding that his case officer had shown dis­
interest in his proposal to obtain for the KGB a top secret 
document he (JOHNSON) thought_ of greater i.~portance_ th~n_ any 
other to which he had access. (NOSrnKO indicated that JOHNSON 
lost his access in the spring of 1963, while at the Orly Cou£ier 
Transfer Station.) In the second place, as the KGB knew, t~e 
behavior of Hedwig JOHNSON, a mental case, was unpredictable. 
Finally, the JOHNSOU couple and MINTKENBAUGH repeatedly dis­
regarded the KGB's instructions to compart.~ent their activities 
and to observe other routine security precautions. The KGB 
seems to have evoided full exploitation of JOH!~Sv:; in the latter 
stages of the operation, to have been conc~rned over Hedwig's 
mental condition as early as 1962, and to have regarded the
