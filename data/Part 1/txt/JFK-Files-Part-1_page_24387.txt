of his relationship with hi~ many contacts. ORPHONE/1 m.'lkes e·1ery effort 
to overcome _this limitation and in•this regard a plentiful supply.of·back­
ground information greatly fa.cilit.ites l"1is elicitation of added details 
fro~ his infoni<lnts. Ho-~evor. this li::u.tation is one which will always 
be.with us in the caso of QR.Pii0~/1 and it iG qpc which can so:nctirnes be 
p.irticularly frustrating. During the past quar'ter QRPU01'E/l has been the 
source of 11 intelligence reports preparAd uy LCPIPIT/Rcporto. 
SPECIFIC REOUIRE!·:E:~"TS LEVIED u'po:-1 1.GE!;'i' i?O?.. El;"SUING PERIOD:. QRPllONE/l 
will ~ea trip to Italy in late Septeiaber ~nd early Octo!lcr in order to 
survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. This 
trip is one which has been requested by Roi;ic Station. (The trip w,i.11 have 
been completed by the time thir. report is received by Iicadquartero.) 
QRPBOBE/l's contact with an official of tho Eritrean Liberation Front led 
to a TDY by AP Division officer Geoffrey D. DRANSTON to brief LCPIPIT on 
the ELF and to discuss possiblq operational explo,itation of this contact. 
QRPBe>m:/l's trip to the United States bas been deferred until spring 1970 
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's roturn will be 
relatively unlikely. 
An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by 
ORPHONE/l's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation 
movements. Head~uarters views on this matter were requested in O~PA-2044. 
A re-scheduling of ORPH~E/l's trip to Germany has been proposed and 
Hear.quarters and Bonn h~ve been asked for guidance/requirements. 
AGENT'S PERSO~ RESI'ONSE TO ASSIG~r.•U::!-.'"TS LEVIED INCLUDII;.c; MOTIVATION, . 
PERSONAL SECURI~'Y. ETC.: QRPHONE/l's response to assign.~ents, like h1s 
performance, continues to be enthusiastic ~nd energetic. Tho co:nments 
made in previous quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation 
remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and LCPIPIT are able to judge. 
AGENT'S PERSO~AL RESPONSE TO CASZ O?FICER rL1NDLING OR CRITIQUE 0~ HIS 
REPORTI~'G TECHNIQUE: QRPH0:-«:/1 has a very pleasant personality and re­
lates easily to others. This is a p;>sitive factor in his elicitation'of 
information fro~ his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a 
pleasant and uncoraplicated experience. ORPHONE/1 accepts case officer 
handling - including direction and criticism - well and in a constructive 
vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. Please see pre-
vious reporting on this subject for added details. • . ·. -~: ~ --
ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDIKG PR01<:o-r10:i-s, TRAINING: A new means of 
funding QRPHONE/l's salary is no« being devised. This has been the subject 
of several items of correspondence between Headquarters and_LCPIPIT. We 
plan to consult with the SGFLAG representative in Bern on this matter. 
·, I ORPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his Chicago bank (an 
~ 
apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high 
service charges for the performance of ro~tine transfers.. :Cf he is not: 
) / able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him 
to change banks. 
At LCPIPIT's insistance QRPHONE/1 has beg'.in to invest a portion of hie 
monthly salary in a rcp.1table Mutual Fund of his choice. This modest 
investment program will enhance his financial security i11 the event of 
termination and/or a rainy dayu. _
