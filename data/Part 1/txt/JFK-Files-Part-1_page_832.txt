on 3 November for the purpoae of coordinating their cover stories, 
AIICUTLBR-2 did not seem very interested in coordinating stories or

Besides the dangers of the trip, she would he leaving her mother and 
father in a dangerous position, because the DSE had forced her to 
■ tarn a coriteiu,ion implicating them. While .!!ihe appears to be trying not 
to be overly critic,l of AMCUTLER-2, she hae commented that AMCUTLER-2 
knows far more members of the AMFAUNA net than she herself does, so 
that the reasons requiring the exfiltration of AMFAUNA-14 should be 
even more compelling for AMCUTLER-2.
