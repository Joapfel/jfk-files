FITNESS REP.ORT - Frederick C. Randall 
Section 1> - Narrative Comments 
me an unsolicited letter of appreciation for his -efforts 
as their supervisor~ We have all felt that one burns out 
in this kind of thing after about a year and a half; Fred 
and som, of the fir~t people to come aboard are a bit 
ground down, but, if anrthing, the quality has impTo\-ed-­
wi tncss the fact that wo have yet· to lose a case -in court 
or to be forced to release a document we thought should., 
be denied. • 
Addingtothetomplexity of Fred's life during this p_criod, 
was in~roasing J~volycmcnt in non~FOIA -litigation support, 
(c.~., ITT/Chile, the. Socialist W9rkers Party case, {'t·c.)· 
both to mo and to SA/DD0/0 •. Additional administr:ttin~ • 
complexity results fto~ my having changed staffs, w~ile 
being asked to retain• tho llDO Information Review Officer' 
function. llcnce, split llaily support to me as well as 
periodic support to SA/DD0/0, poses n potentihlly ticklish 
situation with Fred's oq:m\izational supervisor who is 
Chief, ISS. In fact, Fred wnlks this tightrope quite 
well. 
Final tr, Fred has pcr:;istcntly tried to convince others 
that_ there is II critlcar ·nce_<l for a centralized c:1pability 
to assess the total Agency \mpact of <le~cntralized inform~­
tion release, whether to FOI,\ 1 con.gressional, judicial, 
news media or other non- in tell igcnce requesters_. llis 
efforts are about to hear fruit, sihcc this will be an EAG 
agenda item next month. 
t~hcther it's bringing his pr0fcssional overseas backgnrnnd 
to bear on the-analysis for release process; pfotccting 
sources and methods in tho. _now "open sunshine" context_; 
trying to save rqsources and ensure efficient proce\h:rt-s; 
deal effectively and impressively with senior offict'.'r~ in 
this Agency and others; 9r supervise a collection of 
dedicated and hnrdworking people, firmly but with ~ood 
!1UJT10r an~! un,lcrstanding, Fred has done, an Out~tanc!in~ jot,. 
lie 1-till be \'cry hard to repla:=e, and yet, he should mon~ on.
