10. Pl::RSO'.IALITY, CHARACTER, A.'HI llABITS: 
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy 
in Mexico, he a~peared t~ b~ fairly well educated and was 
not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the 
exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV. 
(201~02897S). On one occasion Subject was reported to be 
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy 
Stepanovich VI_SKO with h-er arithmetic homework. On a'nother, 
Subject wa~ asked about methods of-producing metal wire, 
a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of 
his having once work_ed for a wire factory. 
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he llked to 
·-.listen to. lie also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets., 
Subject told."Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage, 
because he was bringing a big car back with him. lie also 
asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the 
._apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can 
of paint _to .take ba"k to Moscow with him t.o repaint "the 
~oskvich''. Subject and his wife were both buying watches 
just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears 
that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.
