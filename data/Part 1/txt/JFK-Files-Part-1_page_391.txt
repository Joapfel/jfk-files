OFFICER'S COMMENTS ( Number each commerit to show from whom 
INITIALS to wham. Draw a line across column ofter each commP.nt.) 
Rodger: 
Per your telephonic request of 
yesterday afternoon, here are the 
last known addresses for "Pete," 
Bagley and Newton C' ., . Miler. We 
have no phone numbers. 
Mr. Bagley retired COVERTLY so 
Shep's and my recommendation is 
that if he is contacted hi? should 
be approached in a discreet manner 
so his cover is not blown. Acldi-
tionally, he has retired in Europe 
so it might be wiser not:· to inter-
. view him at all unless it is 
absolutely necessary. His last 
known address is: 
56 Chemin du Gros Tienne 
1328 Ohain 
Belgium 
(NOTE: Rodger - please call me for 
additional information on "Pete".) 
Mr. Miler retired openly; his last 
known address is: 
Star Route, Box 3114 
Placitas --·-
