(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960) 
CoiTII!lent: In a 22 Nove~ber 1957 interview with the FBI, 
0l@URGI! had recounted how he was compromised 
and recruited Ly the KGB\'hile in the USSR in 
June 1956. His version substantially confirmed 
• that~rovided eight years later by NOSEUKO. • 
Qb~URG!J. asserted (contrary to NOSENKO's account) 
that the KGB officers knew a good deal more 
• about him than what might have been acquired 
Ob during l]uR<i!)' s visit to the USSR, including 
· do details o!= @URG~' s close relatives, his work 
og to with the ~ussicuml in (!om~, his earlier travel 
. to Brazil, his mi1itary service in Korea, and 
his acquaintance with Alexander KERENSKY. •

?IDSENKO (from a photograph) as being the 
junior of the two KGB officers who recruited 
him. The other KGB officer (KOZLOV) was 'the 
control].ing figure and was in command".

Department. . 06 
NOSENKO Is claim that:·fBURGD' s compromise 
and recruitment was bas€d.onry on information 
routinely acquired from[fURG~'s visa applica-00 
tion and from apparently chance meetings with 
KGB agents on hi~ arrival in Moscow, is 
contradicted by@URGI\'s description of the 0, 
KGB's familiarity with his personal life. 
NOSENKO cannot sustain his claim.of having 
personally trace~(!3URG!)through First Chief D6 
[Foreign Intelligence] Directorate files (the 
probable repository of information on~URGIJOl 
which the KGB recruiting officers used). 
NOSENKO, as described elsewhere, is unfamiliar
