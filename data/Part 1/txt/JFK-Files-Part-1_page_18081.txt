A.· Current Objectives·, 
There have.been no changes in the -objectives of the LIONION Project aa 
·set forth in the renewal requ~ot of last year. 
:Howord·A •. TIU:CKJJ:;R has aosumed the dutieo of Case Officer for LIONION oince 
the deportur:e of Lawrence F •.BA.RX.ER. in August 1966 ~ TRECKI.ER is known to LIOHION•l 
and· 2 as "Jose" or "Joe";· TR.ECKi.Ea.· meets with LIONION•l at least once each 
week and sees LIONION-2 only .if he ~islto the LIONION basehouse. With the 
departure of Hugh T~-PMrlCorrt: (P) in Aaguot 19!>6,· \,/alter w. COIU,i>llli., (P) 
assumed-the· duties of technical consultaa, for the project. CORNBURY is known 
to LIONION•l and 2 as "Jack"~- LIONION•l is being given a pay increase· of 
$8.00 (U.~~) per 1110nth effective l January 1967. There are no other changes· 
contemplated for the coming year. 
c. Intelligence Productioni 
The intelligence production is the same as that reported in the rene~al 
request for last year. It is difficult to estimate the intelligence value in 
numbers of reporto oo there are so few positive reports made from this type of 
product ion on _the photographic end of the project. But this photographic 
coverage io of ine·stimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the 
PBRUMl::N target. Should·_the LISAHPAN operation become active, port of LIOHION's 
time will be uoed in support· of ·that operation. • 
o. Effectiveneos: 
The Station's estimate· of the value of this project has not changed from 
that expressed in ~he .renewal request of last year. LIONION has further es• 
tabli9hed ·h!o importance to the St~tion's ~pcrational ac:ivities by demonstrating 
his ability to s;>ot" surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physicai descrip• 
tion provided by the Case Officer. If the planned LISAMPAN nctivlty gets underway, 
LiotlION observations and insiJht into dctivities of LlRING will be increa1:1ed 
greatly. • • • 
The apartment _spotted by ·LION10N•l and obtained by the Station across from 
LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled ___ to be 
ut.ilized in the LISAMPAN operation. The location of LIONION~l across from the 
targ_et and his background k.novledge built up over the years are invaluable assets 
to the ·station's coverage of the prilllllry target of the Related Mission Directive.
