. 
The kidnapping of which the noted'.doctor and_ rancher Ernesto Gonzale;: 
Caicedo wa~: r.ecently the victim in Cali has served to confjrm, tragically, 
the existence of a vast co:nmunist plot to subvC:rt the constitutional order 
and to plunge the country again into a wave of terrorism and violence which 
appeared to be buried forever. 
In fact, this newspaper, like the other dailies in the capital, re­
ported in its 12 and 18 July issues, on the basis of official statc:::1-::mts, 
that the Department of Valle had been selected by the pro-Soviet can.~unists 
as the scene of the continued wave of terrorist attacks and assaults and 
kidnappings recently begun in the Department of Antioquia. 
Following the kidnapping of Antioquia rancher Ruben Norena, the kid­
napping of Doctor Ernesto Gonzalez Caicedo has now occurred. the cOll!Clunist. 
bandits are demanding the enormous sum of 4.5 cillion pesos in ranso:n. 
thus the chronological stages in the newisubversive plan arc being carried 
out, beginning with the steps which are obviously designed to obtain the 
money necessary to finance the bandiL gangs in the_ rural areas they have 
already selected.
