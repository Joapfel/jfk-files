and social· life in Costa Rica -lends-itself to 0 1.ll" need for a· 
career agent in that area. His financial. positiori negates. his -
accessibilit7 to high-level information; and our recriirements 
for Costa Rica sho,tl:i not be satisfied through outright subsid.1- • 
zation of an agent in order to plac_e hiM 1n a position of infh.;. 
ence. His wile's knovle1ge of his work for us is lazii,Jntable a.'ld 
her Costa Rican background with substantial local political ties 
should be su.fficient reason to beU,- any further consideration on. 
our part for increasing his loiovledge of our operations. Admit­
tedly, he has performed a satisfactory service for the San Jose

to our effectiveness there. •with respect to his knowledge of 
future possibilities vith us, we cannot be held responsible for 
unauthorized commitments that ma::, have been made by the previous
