Reyes was currently workinc at the Vendimia and felt that he should 
meet Reyes e.i;ain to pass along the story that he had c:iven to ~I:tll'7G/11 
that he was unable to locate LIRDiG/3 or LIRING/4 in the.: hope 1

·that Re7-es 
would disclose LIRING/3's arrest. . 
2. As soon as Rowton met Reyes the latter invited him to·. a corner table 
with what appeared to be superficial cordiality. He asked Aowtbn hov ae 
had located him and appeared a little surorisP.d wh~n ~nwinn ~or~ ~~ft~ 
LIRING/11 had given him hthename of the night club EL~d the addfess. Rowton 
then alleged that he had been away for tee past three months i S~itzerland 
and Canada and just the previous week in r-:onterrey and Nuevo L redo trying 
to buy a car (Ro<iton had given the same story to LIRiliG/11). F. -... ton ec,ntinuec 
that when he returned he had been unable to locate LIRIHG/3 or his vi.re and 
.that they had not replied to bis letters from Europe. 
). Reyes then revealed that LIRIN~i3 had been arrest~d in Guat mala and 
charged with the murder or three menl Rowton feigned surprise, hock and 
fear ~t this nevs. He told Reyes that this might have serious onsequences 
for his commercial contacts, whosP. names LIRING/3 ~ight reveal c~ ~ell as 
tor himselt. Reyes then said be thought LIRING/3 was very stup d to cet 
himself arrested in such a country where anything can happen inside as well 
as outside of jail. In reply to Rowton's query Reyes stated tb1t LIRniG/4 
was probabl7 in PBRUMEH. · .. - - - -
4. When Rowton remarked that he could cot believe that LIRING/ 1 had refused 
to tell hia the news about LIRING/3, Reyes replied that ~twas quite possible 
that LIRING/11 did not know &bout it, especially since he, Reyes, had just ! 
leanred about it some three days previously. A.t this point thJ conv-:rsation •
