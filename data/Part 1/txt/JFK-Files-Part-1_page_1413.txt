;;.,_ y 
Method - This account is funded through the~ank -
and Hall covert account at The First National 
Bank of Miam:!:J by the following method: A check 
in the total amount of the deposits is drawn on 
this account. A credit ticket is obtained by our 
cleared contact from the cash vault. This credit 
ticket together with the appropriate deposit slips 
for the various corporations is then turned over 
to a teller, where it is combined with all other 
transactions which are processed by that particular 
teller on the given business day. Since the number 
of transactions handled by a given teller may go 
as high as 250 to 300 there is slight chance of 
the deposits being attributed to the particular 
credit ticket which accompanied these deposits.
