If the ~ItlTERSjopcrat:.on plan ·,1ere a draft like tr.e o";hers jn. 
this collection, the at.ave co:":.flfc:tin,i and co~fu~1:-.g ;:,dragrap,s 
might be explained as var1atic..ns jotted <lo-.m as po~siole .ap­
proaches to pre~cnting a plan for the future, as ye~ undecided 
i~ direction. This document, ho~ever, is the one whlch--to 
~OS~tKO's puzzlement--had bE:er. approved and sigr.ed in draft by 
KOVSHUK, as Chief of the u.s. E.T.bassy Section, ~.:neric.an Depart­
ment, KGB Secor.d Chief ~irectorate. The preparing case officer, 
KUSJ<OV, had furthermore indicated to the typ·ing po:,l that it was 
to be typed in one copy, which ~ives th~ do:u.~ent the ap~a~ance 
of a draft which had been or vas about to be made a matter of 
official KGB record. 
The foregoing review of errors, contradictions, and dis­
regard for security cor.sideratio~s in ~repar3tio~ COttStitutes 
evidence that this is ~ot a genuine KGB draft cocU!:lent. 
(iii) T!.~ Summary or. L,'\.'.:.;t:LLE 
A second docu:'!lent, a handwritten r,ote in ,.:hat !:OSENKO 
identified as OiEREPJ.::ov·s own handwriting, alsc is pertinent 
to the authenticity of the papers and of ~OSESKO's acc~ur.t on 
OiERL"PANOV. This :!.c. a short su.-lT,ary oi the operational activity 
of the CIA officer LA~GELL~, covering the compr~mi3e of POYOV. 
The docw:ient says in purt: "Ir. January 1959 a letter "'ith secret 
~riting mailed 'ay a :o-~urker of tr.e Ern:>assy of the ~SA i~ ~sco~, 
WINTER~, was intercepted and was addressed. to a Sovi,;:t citizen, 
POPOV, a worker of the General Staff of the Soviet J..I~y. Accord­
ing to the contents of the letter, it was clearly established 
that POPOV was an A"t"2rican ager:.t .•. •• 
This coincides precisely with NOS~KO's accour.t of POPOV's 
compromise (see Pdyes 532 and 663). Unlike GOLITS'iN's recollec­
tion of the official report which he read, there is r.o reference 
in this document to ~he rep~rt of about 1957 from an agent source 
that there was a lea)t of GRU information: r.or is there reference 
to the indication that the KG~ knew that LANG::LLE had been posted 
to Moscow in order to ha~dle a special agent, for this reason 
placing LAllGELLE un1er heavy sur~e1llance. If botr. of these 
iterr.s were in the official report which GOLITSYl~ read, their 
omission from the s-.;..'TIJary report ir. what purports to be ~::RE­
PANOV's hand.Tit1ng is r.ote~orthy, particularly since Oi::R~P.1-..~OV 
was supposed to have been in the same office (rOQ("l) as the casa 
officer ~orking against LA.~GELLE during the tirne the LA~GELLE/ 
POPO'/ cperation ·-as investigated by the KGB. The latter posi­
tion should lend authority to O!~~EPANOV's version of tr.e com­
promise and terminatio~ of the case: yet GOLITSYS--informed 
only from the official, and pres'..lmably sanitized, accou.~t--had 
more detail, as well as conflicting infer.nation, on the same 
case. While it is reasonable that a sanitized case s'.lr!1tlary 
vould conceal an agent source of a lead by imputir:.g the dis­
covery to surveillance, it seer..s less likely, and indecc un­
necessary, to conceal a detection via surveillance by imputing 
it to an agent source. In th'Js supporting NOS~KO ar.d others 
as to the cause of ~0POV's cCX!ipromise, and contradicting 
GOLITSYN (who is supported by other evidence acc~lated in­
dependently), this ~ocument too.appears to be a KGB fabrica-
tion. 
The authenticity of another passage in the sa:ne document is 
likewise open to questi~n. This is the description of LA.~GELLE's 
tvo visits to Lenin Hills, which the documents stated were for
