Copy of letter from Edward G. TICHBORN ' 
''On or about September 10, 1966_ I had a meeting with three or 
four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were Jerry Droller,· 
11 
Jack Kaufman, Paull Kittredge and someone else) and I informed 
these gentlemen thai my moving expenses had been considerably 
more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that 
rather than ask for an additional amount, I ~ished to serve a 
moratorium of loan payments for six monu;s, One of these 
men (with a nod from aother) said "okay--d9n't worry about it--
just don't ask for an additional allotment. We '11 take care (?f it. "
