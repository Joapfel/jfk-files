the previous sununary that the travel of NOSENKO to Cuba in 1960 
damaged 1-.is claim that he was supervisir~g operations against Embassy 
code clerks at the ti...--ne. To accept the validity of this judgment is to 
say that no supervisor in the SCD woulc. be permitted to make a trip 
abroad unrelated to his superviso:.:-y function, a judgment for which 
the re is no supporti.."'lg evidence. 
As regards the trip of NOSENKO to Bulgaria in 1961, fo:.:- which 
there is no collateral information, the previous sum..--nary conaluded 
that his account of the t:::-ip was untrue and argued that such a trip to 
Bulgaria, if it did take place, at a time when he claimed the operation 
against !S-TORSBERG/was reaching a climax and his subordinates were 
"apparently planning to exploit 1KEYSERS') newly-discovered vulnerability, 11 
it would indicate that the presence of NOSENKO in Moscow was dis­
pensable. There was, however, no evidence that NOSENKO did not 
travel to Bulgaria and only highly speculative reasoning as to why his 
account of the purpose of the trip was untrue. 
As to the 1S TORSBERGJ case, while it cannot at present be proved 
that the recruitment pitch took place before NOSENKO left for Bulgaria, 
it can be stated, on the basis of reporting from 1 MORONE; that it had to 
::iave taken place before fae time NOSENKO returned from Bulgaria.
