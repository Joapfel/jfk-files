NOSENKO in the absence o.f any evidence that he had any KGB mission 
. o:c rr .. issions to fulfill comes within t::a above catego:;:y, pa:.:ticuiarly since an 
ove:.-all assessment of his infor:;.na.tion leads to the conclusion. that :full 
exploitation of his fr..:fo:.-:::nation wouid be q;iite damaging to the KGB. 
' 
Conside:cation of the above possibility must also include an 
• ' 
' .! evaluation of the deterrent effect on the prospects of future recruitments 
by the KGB caused by legal action taken agaL-..st individuals exposed by 
info;;:mation from the dispatched agent or officer. The dcterrant effect 
on others of the conviction and sente:..cing of person&• who have committad 
f9 a crime or: crimes has long been a part of the legal theory of why pe:::sons 
who commit a. crime should be i:;:-iiprisoned or pu;iished. 
The deterrent effect on others of the trials and cor .. v~c-cions of 
William VASSALL, Robert Lee JOHNSON and James Allen Y.uNTKEN-
BAUGH should not be u..--iderestimated .. The KGB also could not have 
known that information furnished by NOSENKO would not res1.:lt in t:-:..c 
trial and conviction o:£ other KGB agents or recruitments concel·ning 
whom NOSENKO had so~e knowledge.
