NOSENKO has described eleven KGB appr.oaches· t·o Americana 
based on compromising evidence obtained witb ·the assistance 
of VOLKOV and/or YEFREMOV and several other cases in which 
Americans-were suspected of being ho:nosexual6 on the basis 
of the evaluation of these two. ~dditionally, CIA records 
indicate that at least.six Americans, not reported on by 
NOSENKO, have had contacts with:one or both of these agents 
in Moscow. Of these six, three were CIA agents, one a U.S. 
graduate otudent, another a psychiatrist ~isiting Soviet 
institutions,· and the last. Cha_rles W. THAYER; the v.-ell-known 
diplomat and author. ~1th orie or po~sibly two exceptions, all 
the contacts of VOLKOV and YEFREYOV: reported by NOSE~KO.or 
other sources took place during the period from April tc, 
:lovembar 1959.. The known except ion· was the KGD approach to 
W.E. JOHNSON in January 1962;~ the possible exception wns . 
the contact with the Americ~n psychiatrist, which took place 
in 1959 or early 1960 but cannot be dated precisely. Finally, 
NOSENKO hna described the contacts between VOLKOV; YEFREMOV, 
and the American Robert BARRb'TT in the. summer of 1959 but 
does not know of their contacts in the summer of 1961, 
shortly .before BARRETT was approached on the baDis of com­
promising information obtained in 1959.** 
3. Other Soviet Agents 
The Tourist Department, just established when NOSE~lCO 
was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for 
operations against American and British tourists. Conse­
quently, NOSENKO said, ho and the other case officers bad 
to "start from the beginning." • 
As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow 
officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these 
were not agents, he explained, but "Just persons known to 
the KGB so that a KGB ma:1 could approach one of them with 
questions about somebody or something." NOSF.NKO began to 
collect information on these individuals and others with the 
aim of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955, 
he estimated, he bad. a .network of about eight agents, all 
of then Inturist interpreters. During the following four 
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied: 
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another, 
some would leave Inturlst, and "things were sort of changing 
all the time, baci and Forth." In 195q, NOSENKO said, he bad 
about ten agents, i·n 1957 there were about 12, in. 1958 about . 
•efttht, and at the end of 1959 (when he was preparing to return 
to tbe American Department) he had approximately 12 to 14. 
_NOSSNKO has provided information on five of these agents, 
all of whom he says ha recruited from within Inturist during 
1~55, These were: • 
i -Larissa SOBOROVA: An,Inturist i11terpreter and.one of 
1 the first Inturist agents recruited by. NOSENKo.· SOBOROVA
