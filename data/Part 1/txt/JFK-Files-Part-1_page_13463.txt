Pico N:porta that thero is a good chance th~t Dagoberto Gon..alez( Soc.Goo.of 
Trabajadores Copeyancs) vill be olected as VLASC ~resident at t.he nert·cu.sc

Pico cou,idera Gonzalez as a staunch anti-communist and better disposed toward 
than ,?,aspero. H.i1 thinks th.lt flanked by Gonzale::& and G9ld ·sack, MaspeN loQU 
no,t hava so r.:uch to nay and his power will be limited. Gonzaln is appanntly a 
much more forcotul per-sonali ty than Gold sack, vho doesn I t havo onough guts to 
oppose Maspero. 
8. Pico boliet'lSs that Maspero is less aggrossivs and anti-US as he used to be. Htt •• 
thinks that tbs pre-ssure from CISC and ISI plus a strong anti-communist posture 
. pf ;the a!!iliatea accounts for this• 
In the cablea received fro.n our Colombia office thore is A strong criticism of 
Pico a! a sort of Maspero's stooge. After discussiong this topic several times 
with Pico I think that his opinion of Maspero ~ is , 
• elvGv.\-!,l . 
M.aspero 1a a forceful, d,tnainic and well p.e~;:,;i:r&d' leader. l.s.,:i4i Argentine and 
ex-peronista. he has more drive and is a better organizer than the others 1n 
CLASC. &sides ho bffers CI..ASC a prC\lllise of bringing CTG into llJl alliance "1th 
them, a feat which only he can acco:nplish. For Pico I s taste l'iasparo is too 
decuiogtc a:id he doesn I t. like hie anti-US and so.rt of co.a."lios attitude, howenr, 
Pico cltl."ls that Y.aspero lately is !.lUch moro aware of co=.1e daflier. kl Maspero 
is tdthout doubt. tho most powerful single individuaJ,. in ClASC Md as Pico pos1ti 
is weak(his Federation is not cro.ited yet and he has to l.:e confinnod as Secretar 
General) h~ sees no use of bucklng Maspere especi:dly as n<> organized am. strong
