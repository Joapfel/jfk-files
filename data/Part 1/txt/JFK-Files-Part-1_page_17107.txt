dispatching base for the LIEHBRACE surveillance tea!!I. 
s. The photographs from all these operations arc of 
value to the Station in their operational plannin~, for 
identification by surveilhnce tear.is, for mu~ t-ooks, which 
arc often used by survcillnnce teares and singleton agents 
in identifying Soviets, and for llcnJquartcr's perwtnent 
files.· 
6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last 
year nt the tine of the Project renewal that th~ radio dis­
patchin~ from the LIMITED installation might have ~nJ~ this 
base n tar~Pt for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth 
with tha Office of Com~unicntions, TSD, and SR Divisions. 
The Statio~ has hecn alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa­
bility and they have developed a si~nalinR syste~ anJ inter­
car communications system that 1dll leave the LIE~!BR.-\CE 
surveillance cars on the air for a r.inimurn of ti~e, and 
with limited open conversation. The result of Headquarters 
and the. Station's research on this problem resultrd in the 
conclusion that, if n surveillance team is to orerate with 
automobiles, radios l!lUSt be used if there is to be efficient 
surveillance, and regardless of \\"hat presently a,·sila~_le 
type of scr:tl:'.bling or coding is used, radio is susce:>t1ble 
to monitoring by the opposition. It ~as therefore c~ncluded 
that if the Station is to use the LID!BRACE teru:i a,:.:tinst 
members of the Soviet installation, LDIITED must ccntinue to 
be used as the radio disp3tching center and the risk factor 
must be accepted until ·so~e new, more secure yet efficient 
comrno syste~ is devised. 
7. The reportin~ en the adr.1inistration of this rr~ject 
is handled through regular quarterly progress reports. The 
appropriate ~ovirt, er, or other Case Officers handlr the 
reporting and exploitation of the rroduct. During the past 
year there were no ·positive intelligence reports fro~ tbis 
Project. 
8. Both SR and l\ll Di\'isions recommend renelial of this 
Project.
