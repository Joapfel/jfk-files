. "Present locales do not meet the Spanish min~mum re~ 
quirements for working ·space. CURBELO brought from Havana 
proposals for the leasing of a loco.le for the Commercial 
. Office with a rental fee of $2,000 a month. We discl!csed 
this proposal at a meeting of comrades here and it was 
.rejected int.he belief that it was more advaqtageous for 
us to buy. We also discussed this with Fermin GUTIERREZ, 
who visited_the CoJll!llercial Office and to whom we poin~ed 
out that in view of the ~yatem of payment here in Spa1.n 
it was .better to .purchase a building, 81 nee this transaction 
at no,time would affect our system in our trade policy with 
Spain~ 
. . "To the point of ·being pe-reistent we should like to 
request a building for all services: the CUban or.rice, 
the Cbmmercial Officer .the Consula_te-Embassy Oft'ice, plus 
~ J,iving qua~ers on th" top floor ror the diplomatic 
·Representative, something with which I am not in complete 
accord.·. In summary, a building which would offer maximum security 
and freedom of movement. The Commercial Office would occupy 
the first floor, _ the Embassy, the aecond noor, and the 
third floor the living quarters·for the Chief of the Mission. 
Thie would res.olve .all our local problems and. our re-
preaentation in Spain. • • •
