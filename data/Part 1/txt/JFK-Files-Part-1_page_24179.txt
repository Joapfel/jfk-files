Info ReQuested from STEBONY/1 /

1. JAGVAK, ln acknowledging receipt of the processed STBBOHY/1 
material that we forwarded to them, have also asked for "further 
information about Francois MASPmc> and Professor Nguyen KI!:i. We 
sbould be most grateful for any further identifying particulars 
for both llASPERO and KIRN and with regard to the latter, we should 
particularly liko to know his frosent posit~on in connection with 
wAfrica, Asia, Latin America Revolution' and whether he still holds 
a teaching appointment in F•ce." 
2. JAGUAR'& note was shown to RODIGAST in London on 12 August, 
just before RODIGAST met with STEBOh-Y/1. LCPIPIT please provide 
anything that can be bad for passage to JAGUAR. 
3. As should be fairly apparent, I think, from reading the . 
material we passed to JAGUAR, plus the fact that there has been 
no "Revolution" for lo! these many 110nth■, the status of anyone 
connected with the magazine is about as uncertain as the status 
of the magazine i ts·elf. Nonetheless, we 'Ifill be happy to let 
JAGUAB know as much as we can.
