REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION. 
A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal 
advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia 
from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinik, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's 
application and the issuance of a vias. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each 
other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.
