1. Inquiry made of Humanist regaraing the statements 
he made before the police ciuring liis interrogation reflects that 
he reportedly refused to testify before the police but made his 
deposition before the Procurador as to his part in the technical 
installation wh:;ch implicated only the writer, and this only after 
he W?S told that Roddy had been identif_ied. Humanist's testimony, as 
well as the line of questioning to which he was submitted, revealed 
the authorities' concern and their efforts to ascertain whether· he 
had been enga~ed in or knew of.any other similar installations on 
any other people. This he denied and maintained that the only 
instellation was on Juan BOSCH. Humanist claims he made no_~ention 
of Humanoid, and he believes the police know nothing about him. 
2 .. Humanist's claims also tally with the account of 
his confession as given writer by ?,ranuel VE!!TURA, Presidential aide. 
Humanoid has been on the alert and has noted nothing of a suspicious 
nature which would indicate his activities being under observation 
or investigation. • This matter of suspending his operations, as
