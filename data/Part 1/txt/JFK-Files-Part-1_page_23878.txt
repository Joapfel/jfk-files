9• Hov about hie ideological mot:lva-Uon? ii'tt had hoped for s0111e 
aore conorete exprtoeaior, than ,re got, on this score, but what ve have 
{ 
is not too bbd. rl~ states !hat be will not be "intellectually dishonest"• 
to the i,oint of beoo~1ng a "~rofeesicnal anti-Oom.munist," by 1r.1ich he 
means a propagandist. At the same time, he agrees that he has no 
d.eaire to be a professional revolutionary. Again we note that he is 
not blindly or unduly critical or ODYOKE. Granted, he criticizes many 
elements of ODYCK~ ~cl!cy and tends to defend some enemies of CDYC~. 
A failure for him to do so woi;ld be euffioientlv remarkable to make 
us totally suspicious of him. !;ote further his
0 
commor.t that he would 
havebeen puf'eotly willing ~o talk to us a year uo in Faris fr t1:c_ 
,Jiiiii""fashlon aa, be bes he:NL. 'This would· eound rather suspic1.01.1s and 
diffiouli to believe, vere it not for the fa~t that h~ did ~hov hic­
eelf to be candid and cooperative in hie P!\ria intervie~th a PBS"lr.lO 
officer. 
10. ?.ow badly . l>lc;,-n !e G!3.Sor., then, it ve &r~ t~,ir.ld.r.g of usine 
biir.. After all, be ias b6en p1.1blicly h.belle,1 a "•nA 11e;"!r.t." Con.ld he, 
th6n 1 vorlc for ::rJBA?J: euccessi"dly? Gl3SO!i himself ie certainly a better 
judB9 of that tt¥ th9 London Station, and ve feel that there are only 
tvo indices that can be used to Judge ".;l;e matter. Th~ first and tiout 
im:nediste j s GT:ESON'e own o;,inion, einot1 te hae live-i ri tl: the r,rc,blem, 
and hae tested ti:16 id9a in p:..•i,.ctice. F.e fe~l,. that he oould still 
operate ("1raov6" is hie tern) in 1110et cf the dedr'.lble arP.es success­
fully, provided t.e has adequate cover for beine where he is an'1-'4otag 
vhat he does. l"~e a&cond indu would be for.!:!!. to test hie continuing 
access to tax-eete of int~r~st. It should not talc~ too lone to make 
B'uoh a test without FUttine anything into real jeoi)nrdy. 
11. Cover tor Gri!SON, of course, would be a serious problem. He 
himeel~ proposes the o:r.ric~s e.nsver1 eoue kind of vaguely left 
joumalis~ic tie-up. Ve should think that B1.1ch cover could be arranged • 
And we pro~se to disuoss a nuitber of pooeibilitiee vi th Eeadqusrters .. 
in due Uaae. 
12. Utiliza".;ion and lcoale are moat cloeely related, of course. 
i'rcii our vantage point here, it would appear that Algi.11rs woul"- be the 
iroet deeira'ble home base for Gl'BSC'N. '!fe could range out from t~er'3 1.nto 
f'..n-c;e or the rest of !fries;. (ti,a two best targets, ;!.a,arently) atid 
aaintain a regu.le.r now of information on Algeri!UI affairs vhile "at 
home." He bas spoken several times of the ease vith vbioh he is integrated 
into the Algerian• enviroffl!l9nt, and he has a fairly vell establieh9d base 
there from wt.ich to exrv,d bis operations. He bas said that he would be 
,rilling to go there, or Franoe, or r.iost any other place where bis 
children cc.n continue their education in French. And Algiers appears 
to be, for the foreseeable future, a worthwhile target in its own ris}lt, 
as well as the site of a growing numbert of inte~tionel front ol'pnization 
meetings, for vbich GIBSON would appear to have excertionally tine 
credentials. As he says, he o-,ul.d go eleevbere in Africa, but Algiers 
is where he would tit beet. V~ would be inclined to keAp him, for the 
11:oet part, away tr0111 the Cuban milieu (except, perhaps, incidentally) to 
avoicl attaining hie reportorial objectinty. In ~he African, aircpean, 
and. international front areas, ve suspeot that careful oheokiq would 
ensure suoh objectivity- • 
.13. Hie utilization could beat be considered on a 'straight 
inforaation-oolleoting basis. To use h:l.lll as a propaganda. tool would be 
not onl7 repugnant to him but destructive of' hie utility as well. 
Pre111111abl7 he oould be permitted to continue to write, not onl7 tor 
his overt emrP.fere !in a straight neva f9sb:lon}, but perhaps oooaeionally 
~or leftist perio~ic-J.a ot hie own chcoeing, in order to maintain his 
own cover. (This ia, admittedly, ■eeing rathel' far into the f'uture.) 
We do feel, however, that GIBSG!i could be an admirable and highly- valuable 
col~ector of positive informe.t:ion on that whole apectl'UJII of the le_ft with 
which he ia already so tuiliar.
