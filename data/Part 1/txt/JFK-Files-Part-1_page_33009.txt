8. I bl'lievc that 011r chances for succ('ss in this 
operation <1rc re<1sonnbly r;ooc for the follo1dng rc:isons: 
(a) _N!Cl!,\LK._-5 is ~ttfficie:r.tly cour:igeous to r.1ect i\'.-'.l'.'OLr-1 
in the Cuban :\n1':-1ss:1Jor's office in ~!:idrid, if ncccss:-iry; 
(b) A~-ll'.\1 LF-l is a trusted col lear:ue nnJ follo1-:cr of • 
M!Gl!OST-1. ror this reason and in the belief that ,\'.-!Gl!OST-1 
was a1,:iitir:g the mcss:1gc, he ~.-oulJ find n way to dcli\'cr the 
mcssa~e t:norcncJ to :\'.-!C!1/JST-l; (c) .-\'.-IC.l!OST-1 fror.i all 
available reporting, background reateri:-il, sr traffic, we h:ive 
reason to bclin·c that N'.C!!O~T-1 is not held in the confidence 
of the Sc,·icts nor docs he respect their presence in Cub:i, 
a presence which can only be interpreted as promising 
diff.icu!tics for .-\'.,:GliCST-1; :wd (d) Bl•na fides for the 
originator arc contained in a copy of a letter from .-\~!GHOST-2 
to her relatives 1,hich she signs with the name "PUSl!Kl~."
