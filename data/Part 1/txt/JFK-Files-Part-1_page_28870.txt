Stan Archenhoid, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators 
with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo 
verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has 
appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached 
memorandum is what Archenhold wants • 
. Conein's service was verified with ROB; his "honorable service" 
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contra.ct, I dis­
cussed the c:i.cc ..,.,.ith Dick Biladeau of Cf'ntral Cover. CCS had 
opened up Conein last year and Biladea11 approved release of the 
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart­
ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being 
considered as a consultant for BNDD. 
Archcnholcl offered to carry the memoran,l1m1 to DEA .
