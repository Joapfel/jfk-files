1. Project LIO!:ION is considered by StRtion f,'.exico City as 
essential to ito PBRUI,:gN o.pera.tions. It has consistently proven 
highly effective Md reRponsive to Station :req_uire:x:ente of both 
• long And short renc;e nature. LIO!i IOl:-1, the Project's or.ly full 
•time agent, continueo to fn!'nish on a timely buds, infcrmation 
on the persorial it iP.s and ectivi ties of the tnrget personnel. 
T,I0HI0H-2 continues to hAck!'ltop LI0!HOJ.:-1 ru_1d sucstitutc for !~1m.

Ahle to man the LJ0rI01 haBe full_ time, and her sir,ht ie

monitor the LISA!.:PAN/DOG traffic. LIIWI0F-.2 's. role as a · 
backstop to Lim::i:0l·!-1 insures cor.tinuo\.1s coverot;e of the target 
duririg dstyl ight hours, five day~ a week. Lil)LIOJi-1 's more than 
sb: yeara of experience_ working on the same target continue to 
produce an increAsingly co!llplete and accurate identification of 
the star1· find visitors to Ll:,11\G. These years ol' experience r.ave 
developed an agent knowledp,eable of \'!OFIRi.: oi:erntional and

2. The add it ion of LISM:l'AJ;/DOG to the 1r01;rm.; besehouse 
has noticeably. increased L1or;1rn:-l 1s ability to irlentify new 
visitors to the target and at timee, determine the !1.aturc • of
