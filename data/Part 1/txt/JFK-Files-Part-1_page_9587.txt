1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7 
January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the 
meeting through contact with an attornty in IDpl B. IDEN A spoke for 
several hcurs about his life since retir':!ment in 1971. What follows is 
a long summation of his c011Dller,ts, ,md at the mero's cor.clusion his reasons 
. for. bringing this situation to our attention. [Fonrarded under Separate ·cover l~ - • • -,,. --
2. IDEN A, who had a major role in. the.Bay of Pigs.activities, and 
who was associated with .JMWAVE during the. perioo,- .1.961--68, has ;.1aintained 
many contacts t.ithin the Cuban community in Flor-ida:. . LNCOLLAR, which 
was aware of the· involvement of some ex-B!µIEP.ALD a~sets (Cubans) in the 
drug il!lportation business, had been unable to p,metrate this group in 
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantil:ie, had moved to Key ~est, 
Florida, purchas_ed a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a 
respected member of the community. 
3. In 1ate 1S~3, a former BKHERALD asset (AfITABY Project) who ·had 
been t,e,rminated in 1963, IDEN C, c:u1e to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he 
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (wtere he had been jailed for drug 
running between Cuba and WODUAL), .and said he had information on drug 
t-raffic. He asked IDEN. A to contact someone in L.'i:::OLW and indicate 
IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDE.. ... A replied he was retired 
_and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (A..'!TABY-27), another 
former asset, flE!"1 to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed 
him L.',COLUR haa··sent him down to check on IDE. ... C. IDEN D identHied 
his Ll,COLLAR contaci:: ·as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD 
contract employee. At about this time IDEN r. a former BKHERALD staff 
employee, moved to Key West and ·informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was bei11g 
staffed with BKHERAID employees• in its Intelligence Division, and that 
the leader of the division was IDEN G, another 13.IGIER:'.LD staffer. 
4. A few months later, IDEN'A received a call from IDEN H, another 
BKHERALD retiree, ·_.ho asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished 
to purchase for a relative of hi~ .iife, the relative residing in Venezuela. 
He photo 6raphed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it .was apparent to 
.I.DE~ A he was LNCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN. F appro·ached ID£N A and said
