NOSENKO was questioned oa 31 Ja.auar7 1964 about th~ 
so-called .. Hoscow Signal." (This ls an ''S'.' band .signal 
that ha& been directed against the top floors--the "secure 
a.rea"--of the U.S. Embassy siccc· the early· 1950'a from Ill • 
apartment building located about 20<t feet away .. Detail~ 
loveati·iation of tbe signal h.1.s been underway sinco Octo­
ber 1962, but its exact nature and purpose have not yet beeri 
established. Although there lit sooe specule.tion that the 
eigoal is meant for ~ ba·ras1n1eot purposes onl~•, the vie• DOW 
generally acce-pted by U.S .. techni~ians is thnt it has sosr;:, 
intellige:2ce-collect1on fun~tlon. So change in the sigrial 
bas beer, noted since· the disco\rery and the cutting of the 
cables referred to in the preceding section.) The inter­
view went as follows: 
NOS~NKO: There is a beam, there is a ray whic~ works 
ag~inst the Embassy. I.kDoY. 
Question: Do you know what it is? 
NOSE~: No, I don't. But I know that they work and they 
put things in, and they listeo and they do some­
thing, and they ... 
·Question: (Interrupting.) Is it successful, is it working? 
NOSENKO: Yes, they koep ,rorking:a11·tbc time. Perhaps 
periodically, but it's ~orking. Yes, there is 
so~ething in the ~ack-of the E~bassy on this 
Ch&ykovskiy Street, and there is something in 
front of the Embadsy, too. 
~Question: And it is for listening in? 
NOSENKO: No. it's in order to deprive you of working with 
stationary equip:lent. 
Question: What do you mean--so that our receivers wouldn't 
operate properly? 
. NOSENKO: Look, I'm not a specialist. I don't kriovi the 
details. I know only t?lat the work is being 
done in this particular area, in this particular 
direction. But what they do, I don~t really 
know. 
Question: But this is not for the purp>se of :obtaining in­
formation? 
IOSBWKO: Let•s say you go on the air. So we•.find·out 
whether you're listening in on some of our coa­
aunlcatlons or aocaethiog like this.
