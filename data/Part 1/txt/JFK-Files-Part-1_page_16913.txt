7. GK.'IBSD:S was nlso ITiven the task of locntinr; and developing 
.(in nlias) a ~irl who, por LH:NVOY, was hcin(:t cultivated by 
Ai-;RODJ.:~'T. .\lthou~h GJ-:JtENDJ-: had to be continunlly reminded of tho 
assi~n~ent, he did nn 8XCttllent job of meeting the girl and 
gainin~ her cunfidonco. It ls quite likely that he could have 
recruited the ~irl aR nn acceHs urent against AEflOD}~T, but a~ 
this point was rc>nchecl nnol:her ope1·ation ngainst AEROD.E:NT was 
launched and it wa~ not felt that nttempting to recruit the cirl 
would scrvP nny useful purpose, for the time being at lonst 
(nmoug othC'r thinrs, thero was no indication that sho had had 
any contact with ,H:nODl·:N1' for some months). Tho only flnw in 
GERENDE's pe1•formanco was tho time it tool< hi111 to r;et around to 
doing the job. It Hhould be mentioned, howover, that at tho 
snme time GE.REND~ had n number of pnissing porsonal matters to 
·attend to, includinK overseeing tho completion or his new houso, 
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1068, even though 
construction is still not entirely completed. 
s . .\men!: other aRaignments completed by GERr.'NDE in the 
roportiUR periort woro tho renting of an apartment for use ns a 
listening post; nnd inltiating a relationship witn a Russian 
translator \Yorking for the MIIRAVF.L cor.imittoe.

9, The star of tho LIEMPTY show, ns far as quality of 
pttrformance is conccrnod, contt.nues to be LJEMPTY-9. His 
fnvorable location and his perceptiveness continue to result in 
rcvealin~ photos nnd equally revealing commentary. In addition 
to the 2,90S oper~tional photos taken during t~e reporting 
period, h~ hss providod daily, weekly, and monthly summaries and 
'notes, ser.1i-nouthly attendance reports (of I•'JSTEAL personnel 
spotted by hir.1), various Rp_ecial reports, and special intcnslvo 
coverage of the following: 201-120123; 201-107668; 20l-27110Z; 
nnd 201-305870. 1\s of 1 May 19fi8 LIEMPTY-9 's salary was ra.tsed 
t'rom 4,000 pesos to 4,500 pesos per month. LII~MP1'Y-9 was also 
~iven perr.iission to havo a maid·'s rooll! constructed on the roof 
c,f his apart:i.ent. The original maid's room 1s LIEMP1'Y-!1's photo 
point. The ~sid, who has been with the family for 11 ye~rs 
(since she <r.?.S 10) eit:her Hlr.!eps in the hall, where she is in tile 
way, or in the bedroom of LIEMP1'Y-9's nine-year old son, which 
LIEllP1'Y-9 feels is bef~inning to bo not a proper arrangement. 
The room will be built nt a point on the roof away from the 
1-'JSTEAI. installation (so as to. arouse as little suspicion as 
possible), and tho fact that the maid will be Aeon going in and 
out of the rcom regularly should quiet any suspicions whlch mny 
arise. Construction work put LJCALLA out of action starting 
24 June, 't,ut it is expected that tho wo1·k wi 11 be finished by 
20 July.
