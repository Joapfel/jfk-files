RESL1".E OF THE INCOME AND EXPENSES OPEJUTIONS 
"PAULA AND SOSA" 
October 1 to 31, 1960 
In the financial statements and annex the analysis and s1;1b-analysis ot 
each one of the income 1and liabiliti~s during the month of October are 
shown. \ 
Receipts, -invoices, dep~ait slips and other papers are kept in our files. 
As shown on Annex "I-D", a Revolvi_ng Fund has been created for the Mili• 
tar7 Section, amounting.to the sume of $10,000.00, d·ivided into ti.ro parts 
of $5,000.00 each, the amount of $J,J87.81, ·was reinbursed to this Revol,I 
ing Fund, as per Annex "I-D". 
The amount of tso,000.00 which appears as "Transferences" in Annex 11 I-M1' 
corresponds to the tranafered·amount from t.he account of "Paula and Sosa" 
to 0 Rasco and Paula" account • 
From this amount, we h~ve paid in advance the Uovember payment of the 
military dependants. 
In relation to "Checks to Justify", amounting to $69,286.52, as per 
Annex "l-P", these could be classified in two groups; one formed by 
those corresponding to amounts advanced acco:idir,g to budget to the 
different Committees and Delegations and the other, formed by certain 
expenses to be made, but specifically determined, '!!th receipts dully 
signed. The later could have been distributed to those accounts with-
in the cassification, thus eliminating them from the title "to justify", 
but have been kept as so, to be sure of the rrJ,lking of this expense for 
the purpose to which the checks were drown for, or its actual classific­
ation, if these expense were made for other purposes than those original­
ly aimed to. This is due to the fact that some checks were drawn for a 
specific purpose; they could also have been applied tA:!> acquire some 
other asset, thus ar,pearing at the end of the month a filse balance, since 
it would arr•ear as an expense, what it actually is an asset. 
Section design,1ted as "Transfert!nces" $50,000.00 is compeo;::,,'.,tl~ with an 
1ncor:ie for t.ne same ~mount., -..,hen m:1king a transference o.r runCls: to the 
"Rasco and Paula" accoun~ to pay through it the payroll of the ~lilitary 
Dependants, but th:r:ough a mist3.ke it was ~cposited aga i_n in; the same.
