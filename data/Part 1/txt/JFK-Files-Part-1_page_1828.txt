We recommend that. CIA personnel under the Department of 
State cover make greater efforts to truly live their cover. We. believe 
in this connection that the DCI should receive assurances from the 
DD/P. after proper .study, that CIA allowances for rents. servants 
and entertaimnent are in line with comparable State Department 
allowances. 
We recommend that the Agency more and more place people 
under\~r~{gn 5.e~~ co~er by the· "legitimate" method of recruiting
