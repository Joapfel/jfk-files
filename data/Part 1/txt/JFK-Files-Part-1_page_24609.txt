1. We would appreciate receiving Headquarters traces on 
Identity, suboequent to the negative results per ref. (A), 
and a POA for contact and assessment. We Are considering Identity 
as a poss!ble access agent in the R..IDl'OP field, opecificall:, 
against lUkolay Sergeyevicb LEONOV (20l-l:l2139), knowu KGB, and 
hie eventual replace~ent. 
2. As Beadq1.1.art-,u'S 1,; avare, the Station maintains an 
active intoreot 111 LEOHOV. • Per ref. (B), he has been a principal 
cont~ct and s~urce of both iunds and d0cumenta for Guatemalans 
tnivelling to the WSll and for Central American ext.lea, and he 
has also been linked npeatedly and prO'Llinontly with the support 
activity provided to Latin American COl!mluniSt parties. 
3. Although LEONOV may depart before Identity can be used 
e_ffectively ngainst him, wo feel certain that his replacement 
will be engaged in similar extra-Press Office activities of 
priae interest to us.
