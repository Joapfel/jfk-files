NOSE!'t'KO said that !'le carefully directed the work of GRYAZ:SOV 
. and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing their cases 
with them, taking p:u-t in operational plann1I1g, and approvir.e; 
or disapproving all operational measures. NOSn~o originally 
assert~d that he tad also read and studied all the files 
kept on the AMericVJ code clerks; under questioning on indivi"". 
dual cases, however, he retracted t!lese statccents acd said 
that ho zay tavc ski1DJ11ed some of the files, that he did not 
study nny of thr.~, but that in any event he read all the 
current incomicg materials on the code clerks fro~ oicrophones, 
ag,:?nts, and the lute and then routed them to the case officer· 
concerned. • 
CIA has two tvncs of information against which tho re­
ports from NOSE~l{O-~an be compared. The first consists of 
the detailed ccbriefings of code clerks retur~ing fr~m 
Yoscow, adcinistered routinely by the Departm~nt of State 
and the military services; it also includes the special de­
briefings and interrogations of the Depart~ent of State, 
the FBI, and CIA as a follow-up to KGB operational activity 
whic~ has become known from various sources. On this basis, 
CIA has accumulated a considerable amount of coll,, teral 
inforc~tion o~ the activities of the U.S. E~bassy Section 
im•olving United States code clerks during the period ?-OSEN­
KO said be was its Deputy Chief. The second type of infor­
mation is the reporting on KGB operations by GOLITSYN ...,·ho, 
from contacts with U.S. Embassy Section officers in Moscow 
and HelHinki, was able to provide several leads to ~hat he 
said ...ere recruited Aoerican code clerks. GOLlTSY~'s infor­
i;aation thereby dirP-ctly contradicts :SCSf:~;Ko' s st:itcment that 
the KGB had no s~ccesses in its code clerk rccruit~ent opera­
tions from the early 1950's to the end of 1~63, and none of 
the subjects of GOLil'SYX's leads have been positively identi­
fi~. Some of GOLITSYX's information has been g~oerally 
substautiatcd by other sources. lo one case, this confirma­
tion has co~e from ~OStSKO himself, whose informatio~ on-the

and on GOLITSYN' s knowledge of KGB use of PRI::1StnEl,1;D pre­
s,,nts an explanation of one anci possibly h•o of GOLi l'SYN's 
leads.• Another of GOLITSYN's leads, that concerning an 
operational trip by KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in order' to estab­
lish contact 11iith a code clerk, is confirmed by documentary 
evidence that KOSOL.WOV did in fact travel on the Helsinki­
lloscow train with l'.n American code clerk at the time and 
under the cover GOLITSYN reported. ~USE!iKO denied that such 
a trip was made by KOSOLAPOV. 
NOSENKO has been questioned in detail about each of the 
code clerks serving in )loscow during 1960 and 1961. His in­
formation concerning KGB activities involving five of these 
Americans (STORSBEHG, JE!\'NER, MOROXE, ZUJUS, anJ KE'iSERS) and

accounts of GOLITS\-X and NOSE!\1CO, particularly regarding the 
outcome of this operation.
