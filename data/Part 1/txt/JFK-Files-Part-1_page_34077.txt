Your circulars regardlnp, Cuban affairs and trading contain useful 
information but it seems that neither you nor the AI:J.erican Authorities 
are well informed. You know that, thr:>•1ih Anerican pressure, the Greek 
Covernraent banned,several years ago, all trading with Cuba for Greek flag 
vessels, except few which were on tlmecharter and were allo,·1ed to r:1n .. 1 
their charters, w·.ich finished a very long tine· ago. Slmll&rly, the Leban~ 
Cbvo:t'runent banned all tradln~ wl th Cuba r .::>r Lebanon vessels, f'e·, months 
ago, and only allow, subject special licence, their ships to carr1 goods 
trom and and to countries of the Arab League. Both countries passed laws. 
to this effect, and both state that infringement 6:6 the law carries very 
heavy fines sgalnst the o··mers and nasters, and wl thdra·:ml or the flag. 
Tbat is what the la~s say, but whnt ls actu3lly happening ls an:>ther 
mattor·. Greek and Lebanon flag vessels have contlnueti, since banning, 
to be fixed, have carried and are carrying cargoes, through a nunber of 
O\mers, such as !''ranklstas( Franco ~hipping Co. of Lisbon and .\thens, 
, per Purvis Shippln~ Co. London, their U.K. Agents), ~~a:llk o·.vning a!!out 
35 Greek and Lebanon flag Liberties and sl~ilar vessels, also Vlass.::>poulo, 
Livanos, etc., also ownln~ a great nunnber of ships with th~se flags. 
They simply say they do not care a dB!ln Rboat the ban, and continue to

remains wide open for these people. They do not even tr:-{ to hide, they 
just fix t~elr ships, m:>stly in the Baltic Sxchange, Lond~n, a~d Athens, 
but also direct with Charterers in Poland, iiunF,ary, Houlrgs.rla, 
Russia, etc. and with ?aris, and Geneve. The Govern:nents of Greece and 
Lebttnon, who made the law~, just look·on, doin~ nothing about it, and 
this means that the laws ·:rere made, f:>r paper Vlilue only. so:ne of these 
Owners fix their ships by name and flag, others j11st fix a contract 
to be carried by ships, to be no~inated later, and late~ they no~ln~te 
greek and Lebanon ships. Only tho last irew days, the fol10·.-1in3 were fixed 
on the London market: Franklstas, 50.000 tons sugar from Cuba to ingland 
for sugar t!erchants Tate and 1.yle, London, to be c&rrL.id in 2 or 3 :?1onths, 
and Frankistas has already no~inated the NICOLAOS F.(Greek flag) and 
San Spyridon (Lebanon flag), for 20.000 tons and the remaining 30.000 
tons are being no~inated also f:>r Greek anQ Lebanon flag ships.The sarae 
0-.mer just also fixed one cargo for •.:alI!lo(s·,,eden), and one to Gdyhia, • 
Poland. He is presently negotiating several other cargoes,~ his 
large Gre~k and lebanon flag ships, \lrlth the aforementioned concerns, 
includine another contract with D' Enreo of Paris, via Geneve. 
The AIS GIAN'HIS (Lebanon) v1a9 fixed with Dreyfus, L~ndon , fe,'I days 
ago, to carry a cargo or beans fr~~ Vera Cr~z and Tar.ipico to Cuba, and 
after for SUBar to Europe. Another concern tradinP, with Cuba is 
Tsavliris of London and Athens ,but this_ fir::i ls not trading witb Greak 
Lebanon flag ships. . 
The ·,·;orld thinks that you and A.':lerlcan Athorl ties lcnow all that goes on 
in Cuba. If so, it TJ1eans that neither you nor k'Jarican .'\uthorities koo,·,
