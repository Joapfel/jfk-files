(SEVEHTH Dl,;Pi\RTlm,1T - ;ranuary 1962-Janu.try 1964) 
:;osm1Kn' s Infor:nation 
SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex­
traction, a Russ~~n speaker, a~d ~ univernity professo~ 
in ?:ow York City. SHUBIN, who-h,:Hl visited the SoviL!t 
Union twice before, visited t~~ Soviet Union in 1958 
or 1959, while NOSJ::NK,') was serving his first tour of 
duty in the Se:vcnth Department. At that time, SIIUBIN 
was the. target of Seventh DC;p.'lrtr.,ent case officer 
/\.A. VETLI'l'SKIY, Nma.:,KO heard later that smmrn Wi\S. 
placed under surveillance, and ~h~n the KGB surveillance 
observed SHu13I~i .1s a passeng2r in a llini:;try of Defense 
automobile, the GIW \,as asked a~out t:1e l\:~erican. "They 
very furtively saiJ that they were interested in him," 
from· which be ,~GU co;1clUdc.!d that SIIUilIN was a GRU agent. 
In 1962 (sic) NOSEllKO was reviewing a list of foreign 
visitors to the Sovi'"t Union and he noted SHUBIN's name 
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU ~gent. 
NOSE!-JKO hirr.self telephoned GR.J General SOKOL0\11 s· office 
and inforn~d SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, acGording 
to another version, S~KOLOV's office was advised ~y 
others). SOKOLOV's office evantually apologized for 
having failed cnrlier to notify the KGB of the GRU 's 
interest in SHUBIN~ 
COtru'lCnt: 
a sensitive somlce 
Earlier, ~•identified arflD 
agent apparently identical with S!IUBHl 
and l'DI sources ren..Jrtcd Si!UBIN' s tr.:i.vel • 
to the USSR in SU:::'..;.,er 1961 nnd in 
September 1963. 
SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport 
between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited 
the Soviet Unicn durinq that period it was 
not as an American tourist under his true 
na~e. Consequently, he could not then have 
been the tourist target of the Seventh 
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed. 
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referri:ig 
to SHUBIN's vil?it in 1961, there is a.further 
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have 
noticed his name while· reviewing .tourist 
lists in the.Seventh Department, because 
he claims he was in the American Department.
