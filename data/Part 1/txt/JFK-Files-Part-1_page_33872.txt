This i:, in z:es~e-t--t.c tho ve1rious L:ib,;r Service Compnnio1 
mnde up of Enstorn ~uropeAn exilos now exi~tin~ in Oermnny. 
Thore h~ve boen Polish Lnbor nnd Guard ~oopanias ever 
since tho war nnd these nre whnt their na~~ 1~plie8. There 
hnve be~n set up, however, within the last year Czechoslovak 
and llulRarian Labor Service Gompa~iea here. These latter two 
represent an activity with which our friends are directly in­
volved. I h~ve been informed by them upon my in~uiry that 
should any reference be mnrle by oatellite propaP,andn to 
these ~ompaniea it is desired thnt in any RFZ comment upon 
it that these companies should be treated as being what 
their name implies. • 
The Czechoslovak Compnn7 included both ~zecha nnd Slovaks, 
althouch I.understand that the Slovak s~paratists here mnke 
violent efforts to hnve a separate one for the~selveo. The 
Bulcnri~n Compnnr is nt present mnde up nl~ost entirely of 
adherents or Dimitrov. further recruitin~, however, in this 
reopect is now ~oin~ on ~1th a policy of barrinc both Bulcnrl4n 
national Front nnd Dimitrov followers. 
In~ also informed by my friends here that active plan~ 
I 
nine is now under wny in rospect to the Y.ersten Amendment. 
r should much a~preciate it if we could keep informed of any 
developtu,nts tn' this re:.ipect here for possible use in RFE 
broadcasts and tor conversations with frien~a.
