3. ·.-Stat ion Real Property reports are also, with ofie 
exception (MEXI-11), up-to~date and they reflect curren};condi­
tions. M.EXI-03 doeH, of course, include LICALLA. Neve;-theless, 
the Station asked tor $1800 for rent-and utilities for fhe 
following reasons: first of all, ut111ti~s are an unrecov~rable 
e.xpenso r,o :::atter who own;:; the :,.part111ent. 5econdly, the·' 1·ent, 
l'!Ven though returned to the Stntion because i'f<Jl-'IRM owns I' the • • 
building, t1ust. physically he paid by the oc,::upant of LIC1U.LA. 
He, in turn, is reir.:bursed by the Station via G!::RENDE. j,LH!OUS.INE 
eventually returns the money, at which ti~e it is credited to 
expense. This could, of course, be handled differentJyt but the 
Station has always found it convenient to finance in tl1l~ manner, 
laigely becaus~ finances with iIMbUSIHE are handled on i'.semi-
·annual basis. The reimtrnrsement, therefore, often comes: many 
mcnths after the payment. [ '.

4. The Station n~gJected to cnncel !.,!.EXI-41, which 1,.should 
be done as it refers to LILYJHC in its old location, before the 
move in 1966. LILYP.IC is now MEXI-132, and is in the b(lllding 
o,med by LH!Ot:SINE. Rent payments ara, a.s originally i'ptended~ 
being used to ·help liq11ldate LlMOUSINE's d~bt, and, as ~nstructed 
in Hlli!S-4814, 15 June J.913f-, th" Station i~ cr~dHlng th1i:5 !'."lone}' 
to miscellaneous receipts. The;-tt can be, th~refore, no~ question 
of the need to include money for LILYHIC rent a!ld utilijt,ies .in 
;he: LIL\U'TY project. L1L1'1UC rer,t ls, and h'lS been sin,c.e the 
·apartment was occ_upied in October 1966, 3,000 pesos per1, _month, 
which. amounts to $2,880 per yea..1.· ($3,200 has heen requested .in 
order to include utilities). Heactr,uarters is corre·ct i'ti

stating 
that the agreed-upon fieure for the rent in this new bJilding 
was 2,300 pesos r~r ~onth. Statio~ fJ.les i~dicnte thaq ~he· 
reason for the increase (and this apparently w=is not r,;iported 
. to Headquarters") was th:i.t the banl,; which holds the :naj~r- part 
of LI.MOUSJNJ:;'s loan- had d':!tcrmincd that 3,000 pesos was; 'a fair 
price for the apartment. The Station had, of course, no choice 
tit1t to go along with this. J 1 
5~ The Station has no record of l!EXI-02, but it ~.s: likely 
that this is the old LIMITED npartment, which was Jnd~~d 
purchased by WOFIR~ (via I.B!OliSINE) in 1955. But sincif1that 
building was later purchased and razed by L!MOUSIN.E, t~e old 
LI:JITi::u ar,artrJent ceased .to exist. Tile LIL!ITED base hquse. was 
,ubsequently transferr~d to the building whi~h had pre~lously
