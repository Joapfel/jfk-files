of NOSENKO in Moscow at the time -::his pitch was rr~ade, it would appear 
that NOSENKO was com:;_:>arative:y free to go to Bulgada because this 
phase of the [~TOR.SB ERG] operatio~-i had been completed. 
As to the~KEYSERS; case, there is no apparent prob:er.n since

In short, there is no :reason to believe that the accour:..ts by 
NOSENKO of his trips to Cuba and to Bulgaria are not esser .. tially :true, 
or that if they are true they necessarily reflect on his claim to having 
been supervisor of code clerk operations.
