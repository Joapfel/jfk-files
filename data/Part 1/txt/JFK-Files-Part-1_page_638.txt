I b. AMFAUNA-31 AMFAVNA-l'a first mention of her • 
is in hio S'"/W massage No. 127 dated I+ Hay 1962. She hae 
provided infol"lll4tion on €9-li tary hos pi ta1,ftand haa a 
trusted contact (Idonti ty 7) (!_n tho G-21,1,4Sho also w•t . 
AMFAUNA-l'a cutout to Identity-12, who was a(Havana06 • 
contact)of thef guerrilla leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ)~ll In 
oarly Juno 1962-ahe was approached bY. Identity-a who 
claimed to be the new contact to thelRAMIREZ)organization. 
(See also paragraph 58 below.) On lS~arch 1962 AMFAUNA-3 
wes traced by ODIBEX who proposed to use ner in their 
Operation CASINO. A negative trace raply was given at that 
time. Headquarters is requested to ascertain whether ODIBEX 
has a valid prior claim on this agent. 
. ol 
c. MFAUNA-i+) He ia a high-ra .... king Cuban Army officer 
who has prov!-ded AMF'AUNA-1 with documJ.ntary informatior: which 
ought to be of some value, although J;~W;AVE has not yet Hen 
it, it having gone to Headquarters via~adri~ through the ( 
channel described in paragraph 11 above ~S--:2..He also claims to 
be receiving inform,a.tion from _Identi tv-9 and Identi ty-10 . 
. AMFAUNA-1 was introduced to AM.f AUNA-1~} by AMCOG-2 who in turr1 
was introduced to him by Ide'ntity-13,ol For a further 
discussion of this matter, see paragraph 56 below. 
d. AMBOA-1: The origin of AMFAUNA-l's contact with 
this agent, who nae also been recruited independently by 
JMWAVE 9 is uncertain. He first mentioned her in October )<½ 
1961 as his cutout to Identity-lij,(a Cubana Airlines pilot 
who had formerly been a contact of AMCUSP-1 and who subaequent­
ly defected. AMFAUNA-l's last mention of her was on 15 
November whe~ he reported that she had given him a map show-
ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villa~. 
It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her, 
( 
but sit.tee he has not repo~te_d having done so it is_ conside~ed ~ 
more ~{kely that she remains his cutout to(two Cubana AirlinesO 
pilotsJwho are known to be still reporting: 
(1) AMFAUNA-18: He was recruited in March 1962, 
and has ,~rovided AMFAUNA-1 wi th(passenger lists) zlf 
and the\!ocation of artillery emplacements)which 
he has (spotted from his aircraf"9.• -z qr t is nof'fknown 
how AMrAUNA-1 first met AMFAUNA-18, and it is 
possible that AMFAUNA-1 meets directly with him, 
It is only surmised that AMBOA-~ is his cutout to 
him. 
(2) AMFAUNA-19: He was !'ecruited at the same 
time as AMFAUNA-18. Althcugh AMFAUNA-1 did not 
explicitly say so, it can be inferred that he and 
AMFAUNA-18 are witting of each other's recruitment, 
e. AMFAUNA~5: AMFAUNA-1 first reported her aa an <\gent 
in Sep7:mber l961.J°t,She is the sister-in-law of AM(AUNA-23J, q 
former\!!aval officer)who had been an agent of AMFAUNA-1 as ~l 
early as July 1961 but had been caught and imprisoned for try­
ing to leave Cuba illegally.2Ushe has been the source·of ' 
information on Cuban ~irfields) and is the cutout to a group 
, 
of people e~ployed atLRancho Boyeros Airport}~4It is believed 
that the i~entities of all these people have not yet bee~ 
reported, but they seem to be effective. On 29 May 1962\ 
AMFAUNA-1 reported the arrival of an undocumented Soviet!plane 
"z~t Rancho Boyeros) and forwarded the passenger list which he 
. said one of his agents had obtained clandestinely. Following 
are the persons with whom AMFAUNA-5 is known to be in contact. 
ol . ·-
( l) AMte,UNA-20) her husband, AMFAUNA-1 has written 
that he has broken oersonal contact with this man.
