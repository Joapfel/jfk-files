• -.:hcthcr the KGB h,:id received an~• sigr.ificant information con­
cerning the use of ~ourism as opur~tional cover by CIA during 
1~60 and 1961, wi1en he was in the i.:;ierican Department, and 
~as then asked ~pecifically whether the KGB obt3ined docu­
rr~ntary informJtion on this subject from an agent source. He 
.replied "no" to both questions. 
•• This docu.'"nent was transmitted· fro~ KGI3 Headquarters in Moscow 
to the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki on 7 April 1961. In 
content it is similar to the general description of the docu­
•ment which NOSENKO said he himself wrote. NOSE'SKO sc1id in 
1964 that he knew GOLITSYN had passed CIA this report and that 
it had oeen written in the Touris_t- l)epartment.
