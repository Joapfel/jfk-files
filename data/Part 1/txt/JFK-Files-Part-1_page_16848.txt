means might be required to continue the KDFt\CTOR coverage.-. In 
February 1972 an apartment became available in the same-building 
complex which houses the l<DJ\BSINTIIE installation. Through the 
cooperation of KDABBEY-1, we were able quietly to rent the apart­
ment and install elements of the l<DCALVERT team as residents. This 
\. 
location affords as good, if not better, vantage point for ~ontinu­
ing phot(? covera.ge in the event the present l<DABSINTIIE location 
, bec~mes untenable. We are also exploring alternate locations for· 
I<DLITE.RAL to solve the problem we face with this element 0£ l<OFACTOR 
coverage (see b~low). 
i PROBLEMS 
. 11. The only known problem connected with the project is a 
', product of mother nature which is threatening the effectiveness of 
I<DLITERAL c9verage. Approximately ~wo years ago MHHARSH personnel 
planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to 
~he garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the 
point where I<DFACTOR-2, the I<DLITER/U, operator, estimates he only 
has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying 
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch 
to Head~uarters on the topic ·in the near future.

EVALUATION 
14. The support provided by the KDFACTOR Project to the Station 
RF.DTOP Progra~ is indispensable. We believe the project represents 
a professional collection effort being run securely and successfu~ly 
against a sensitive target with a minimal expenditure of funds and 
case of-fleer time. •
