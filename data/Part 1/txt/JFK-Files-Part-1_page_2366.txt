NOSEKKO has furnished information in regard to a nu.."'Il.ber of 
recruitments. by the KGB of non-Bloc nationals who were known: by . 
Western Intelligen~e to be pro-Communist or even con.. .. ected with 
Communist organizations. The .identification as a recruited KGB 
- . . . 
. . . . 
agent of an individual previously lmowµ. to be pro-:-Communist is of 
• co~sider':ble va~1:1e_ to Weste=!,"n Intelligence and may be considered to 
• have resulted in some damage to the 1GB. Admittedly, the potential 
to the KGB of an agent who is known as pro-Communist is less than 
that of a "politically clean" individu·al. However, "pr9-Communist" 
. . 
or even "Communist" are not synonymous with "recruited KGB agent." 
NOSENKO has furnished,additional information on cases in 
which there wa~ some previous but limited information; In a nmnber 
of these instances the additional information from NOSENKO has per-
mitted identification of the individuals of interest and the closing of an 
"Unknown Subject" case. In such instances the information from 
NOSENKO must be considered valuable to Western Intelligence since 
the incomplete information known previously would in many cases not 
have permitted ultimate identification of the individual of intere.st. 
This category of cases must be considered as having resulted in damage 
to the KGB and in benefit to VI es tern .I:o.telligence. . - . .
