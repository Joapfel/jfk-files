Dui·i11g the period under review; subject managed to gain full-tilltc 
e:11ployment as .;i senior executive of an !IDSPRIT~ <;overm:~nt subsidized 
scientific publication· at a time o( economic siowuow;, when jobs were 
not easy to get. He did this without help from ilcadquartcrs or the 
-St.ition~ such an_achievemcnt--is a tribute to Su!.>jcct's fluency in 
French, his ability to write, his general scientific know-how and his 
good buisness sense. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid 
by this company. In converting to full-time er,·,ploynent, a major ad­
justment, Subject's contribution to the Station oper.itions in tho 
HHII,\RSH and TPFi\ST fic:dds against .which he is .t,l.l:getted tcr.1porarily 
decreased somewhat. Subject continued, however, to r.,aintain contact 
with three local t-a·LJ·l7\RSH- officials and initiated contact wi;.:h three 
others. He also continued to sca1:ch for new leads to oersonalitics in 
the priority areas assigned to him. ~ubject has the ciipability to call 
on local scientists or tcch:1icia:w of just about an;i' nationality with 
the possible exception of 'fPFi\ST citizens. Ha has used this. near­
unique potential well.
