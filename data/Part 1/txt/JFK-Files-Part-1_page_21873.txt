gave a lecture en counterintellic;ence to the assembled members .. ,. 
of the Legal Re~idency. This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV's 
reques~. although it was only afttr some hesitation on·the part 
of the Lec;al .Resident that all of his subord_inates were brought 
together to hear NOSEN1<0; (In return for helping the Legal 
Residency to perform counter-·surveillance on.,_ several oc-:asions, 
NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed by GAVRICE!V to have the 
use of an operational car and driver to go shopping and. carry 
out other priva~e errands.) 
Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was ma·king nearly daily 
visits to the Legal Residency. During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO 
stated that it .as his close relationship with M.S. TSYMBAL* 
which made it possible for him to have visited the Geneva Legal 
Residency so frequently, both in 1962 ar.d 1964. "According to 
the strict rules," NOSENKO told CIA, "an officer in a status 
such·as mine Ehould not even go to the Resid~~cy: In this case 
it is only becaus~ I. am deputy chief of a department and GAV-_ • 
RIOiEV knows my position perfectly well (it ::.s no_t lower than 
his), and because I have such a sympathetic personal relation­
ship with TSYNB;.L." He then went on to say that TS'r.-19AL "sort 
of escorted me to the Residency. They could have simply said: 
'You are here o~ a mission, we have our own mission, and we 
have r.othing in common.'" But, NO.SENKO indicated, this was 
n~t the case, thanks to TSYMB.:.L's intervention. 
4. Association with TSYMBAL 
At the secor.d meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered 
information on TSYMRAL's KGB background and his current missions 
in Geneva, then alluded to his having spoicE::n with TSYMBAL in 
Geneva but without placing any particular emp'!-1asis on this 
relationship. 
In 1964, ho~ever, NOSENKO claimed that their rel~tionship 
was close, explained that it was TSYM9AL (again in Geneva at 
the same time) ~ho gained NOSENKO's admission to tr.e Legal 
Residency, and said that he had twice gone to see TSYMBAL off 
on train trips, once on 24 January when TSYMEAL went to Bern 
and again on 28 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome. 
NOSENKO told CIA he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960 
or 1961. At that time "We were looking over some candidates 
for recruitment and came across some whose background would 
have made them suitable for the Special {Illegals) Director­
ete ... Then when we came (here) in 1962 for the Disarmament 
Conference, I got to know him a little better - more from the 
human side. He seemed to take a liking to me for sc~e reason. 
•We had·met in Moscow before, of course~ but just in the hall·. 
or in the dining room. He used to say: 'Stop in ar.d see me,' 
and I "\lould answer:· •~ell, it's'kind of awkward for me to 
hang around the Special Directorate - what am I supposed to he 
doing here?' He would say: 'Oh, correon, stop in.• But I

TSYMBAL appeared in Geneva under,the iast-name alias 
"ROGOV" and was identified by NOSENJ<O as Chief of the 
Illegals Directorate, KGB First Chief Directorate.- Since 
1956, TSYMBAL was known by CIA to be the true name for 
ROGOV, and OOLITSYN reported in·l961 that TSYMBAL was
