KOVSHUK did havo a copy in his office, "bu:. an o!d rme, 1936,

to Pushkin Street, NOSl:NJ:o said the J(GB thou,ht that 1,BIDIAN may 
not have entered the building on Puahkin Street; yut he had earl­
ier given extensive Jetails about how t~ie KG3 had .1n.:1lyzed the 
precice number of seconds ABIDI/.N !lad b<?en i~sidc, to-'.deterrnine 
where tt.e drop, if an,, might be. As ano~her example, when he 
,.-as initially asked abou::. Gco;ge B~'I.KE, ti.·.! KGB agunt in MI-6, 
the context of the question ftas a dis~u~sio~ of S~cond Chief 
Directorate operations. NOSE!lKO labele<l it as :.uch ar.d said it 
•was not ao import.ant :is VAf.S/1.LL. • L::iter, when the narnc w:1s men­
tioned again, he asiwd: "Who's BL;J<E?" 
On other occasions, when his self-contradictions were pointed 
out or when he admitted ignorance of matters h-~ rlci<.nowledg€: he 
should have known, NOSENKO would fall back ~pen one of the follow­
ing lines of defense: 
- "What I know I tell ~•ou: what t rE:rr,,~mbcr I tell 
you," or "I dcn't know," "I car.'t ~xplain," ·- o~ a sh~ug. 
- The details, even if confused or contradiccory, are 
not irr.poi::tnnt. What i5 ir..portant is the "wi:ole" or entirety 
of the facts, their importance and their "rcalitr." It is 
this that A.~erican Intelligence should evaluate, not de­
tails. 
- He must be genuine becau~e otherwise •h~w could l 
have been working with 'SARDi\P.' and 'PrtO~HOR' 7 • (Johan 
P~ISFREUND •,.;hose KGB cr§pton}-r- was "?.R.OKHOTf,;" did con­
fim NOSENKO' s role.) "How elte could I ·'tell you abo~t 
S1'0RSBERG7" "The KG6 would not use a staffer as a prcvo­
cateur, • nor would.the KGB supply information on "live 
cases• such as the Paris case (JOHNSON) and ·JAS5ALL, _and 
reveal the nan'~S of its offic~rs abroad. 
- If A.":lerican Intelligence checked his story •fully,• 
it woul1 learn that despite all this confusion, he was genu­
ine. He repeatedly urged that his interrogators check 
via an independent pen< i.:li'ation of the KGB--there it would 
verify that his name is registered as the case officer who 
opened, held ar.d turned over the ADIDIAN file and thus that 
he was a KGB officer.* • 
NOSENKO referred to this method of corroborating him.at least 
20 times during the int~rrogaticns of January-March 1965. He said 
on 1 February 1965 that "maybe the Jay will come when you have 
a source to check and you will find out• (that he was A.BIDIA.~'.s 
case officer) .. Later in the' sarr,e interrogation session, he ~dd!Jd:_ 
•1 see how poo:: and :niserablc· I'm ·1ooking·..,-ith r~c;ard to ABIDIA.~'• 
file, but anyote who can check in [KGB] Archiv~s ~ill see.• On 
~ fcbruary he said,_ "I_ greatly wish that you will ha\'e as soon 
as p~ssible an agent in the KGB. It is simple to look at the 
•w•• the only such source at the time.
