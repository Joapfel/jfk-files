As recommended. the Special Projects Branch of DPD plu• tho 
necessary supporting unita have been transferred to DD/R. 
Technical Services Division 
Further study did not commend implomentaUon o! the Working 
Croup's recommendation that all TSO reaea:-ch and development be 
placed under DD/R. Tho DD/P made a substantial argument in_fa.vor 
of leaving all of TSO under his control in order to insure close and 
intimate rela.tions with the operating unite. Further. au argument of 
almost overwhelming proportions indicated that tho D0/R already bad 
some very major responsibilities without taking on the diverse and 
generally \UU'elated responeibllitiea o! TSD.

Other Research and Development 
After considerable additional study it waa decided to transfer all 
ELINT to DD/R, except for the direct command of certain field units 
which under all circumstances should be left under the station chiefs. 
Research and development in suppolllt of NPIC would fall under DD/R 
£or those very advanced items. but not for current production require­
ments.
