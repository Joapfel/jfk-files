FAILURE FOR THE JUNTA. 
F. CHILE STILL FACES LARGE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS ~EFICITS 
IN BOTH 1,13 AND 19?~ EVEN IF DEBf-REPAYME~TS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH 
YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE •4 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S 
HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANtE-Of­
PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY. 
G, HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE 
·THAN SO% ABOVE LAST.YEAR'S LEVEL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTH~NING OF 
THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT, PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY 
REACH A RECORD 750,000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES Of 
SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES, 
H, AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN 
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE RECOVERY Of DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS A' 
PRIORITY OBJECTIVE Of THE JUNTA, FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT EX­
PECTED TO FULLY RECOVER UNTIL THE 1974/7~.HAR~EST SINCE MOST CROPS 
ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS, THUS, 
CHILE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT GRAIN IN LARGE QUANTITIES DURING 1974•
