·sine~ ,,the NPD i's ,-a -legal' political 
organization~ military leaders 
are constrained from openly in­
fluencing members of the armed 
forces to oppose it. 
Many Germans are probably 
reluctant openly to admit their 
support 'for an organization like 
the NPD._ ~tis significant, how­
ever, that only 6 percent of 
respondents to a national opinion 
poll in January 1967 indicated a 
preference for the NPD. 
Leadership Problems 
The most notable single 
handicap confronting t~~ NPD is 
the weakness of its leadP.rship. 
None of its leaders po&sesses any 
great talent or stature. Cer­
tainly no indivi~ual with Hitler's 
demagogic genius has yet ap­
peared. ·The absence of strong 
leadership in what has b~en called 
a "fuehrer-oricnted part~" has 
left it divided and weak•~ned by 
factionalism. This was clearly 
demonstrated in March 1967 wher. 
'tr.en party chairman Fritz Thielen 
and Deputy Chair~an Adolf von 
Thadden engaged in a public feud 
which· further damaged the party's 
reputation. An outgrowth of long­
standing personal antagonism, the 
dispute was triggered by Thielen'& 
resistance ·to· Von Thadden's.at­
tempt'ed take-over as party chair­
man in Lower Saxony. Thielen 
ciaimed that Von Thadden's elec­
tion to the state chairmanship 
had been illegal and would hurt 
the party's reputation. The par­
ty's federal executive, howe,ver, 
turned the tables on Thielen and 
not only voted to reinsta.te Von -
Thadden but also to drop Thielen 
from the national chairmanship and 
expel him from the party. Thielen 
clung to the helm under a temporary. 
court order until finally throwing 
in the sponge in early May with 
an announcement of his formation 
of a new, rival part;, the Na­
tional P~oples Party (NVP). 
More of an archconservative 
than a neo-Nazi, Thielen was n·ever 
more than a fiqurehead. Real au­
thority and leader~hip--as well as 
ideological guidance--was provided 
by Von Thadden. Von Thadden is. 
a 45-year-old native of Pomerania, 
a member of a prominent and aris­
tocratic Prussian family, a number 
of whose members were prominent 
in the.anti-Nazi resistance. Al­
though Von Thadden applied for 
Nazi party membership he appar­
ently was n~ver formally admitte~. 
An ardent nationalist, Von Thadden 
aspires to become a German oe· 
Gaulle rather than a re-creator of 
the German Reich. 
Other leaders of some promi­
nence include Otto Hess, party 
propaganda chief, and Waldemar 
Schuetz, editor of the NPD's
