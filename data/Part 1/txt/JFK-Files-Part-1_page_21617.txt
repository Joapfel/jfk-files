It is interesting to note that the attached list contains the names 
• oi. approximately 20 GR.U oificel'S whom :'-:OSEi\KO relates to the early 
l 950's period.- In adciition, NOSE.-.:KO has, during current interviews 
and in other memoranc!a, furnished the names of additional Navy lntelli-
gence_personnel whom he knew in the 1951 - early 1953 :.:,eriod. 
Page 52 of the above summary anci other related :.:,ages question 
· whether XOSE~KO ever servc·d in the Bo.'ltic area with Naval Intelligence 
_and even question his geographical knowledge of the area. Attached is a 
copy o! a handwritten memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by 
'NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his.assignment with Navy 
. . :Jn,telligen~e ·in the Far East and the Baltic area. •The memorandum was 
... completed by.NOSENKO without any reierence material and a review of 
his diagrams ·indicates they are quite accurate. 
NOS:E~KO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic 
area wa·s at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recalled 
that the-former name of the place, an almost deserted fishermen's 
village, was Fishausen. The previous designation given by NOSEN<O 
for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsk. Primorskiy had 
caused t~e conclusion that his alleged.place of assignment was non­
existe~t. A further check.·in the-matter would have disclosed that the 
•. place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and 
·, 
... i.:1 -.~t·the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen.
