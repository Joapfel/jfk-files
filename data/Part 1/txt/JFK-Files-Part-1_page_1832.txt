ITKIN, Herbert 
Subject States: 
22 November 1968 
When he was first admitted to the bar in 1953 
he was employed by the firm of Delson, Levin & Gordon 
in New York City. (Now Delson and Gordon.) Itkin 
alleges that one partner, Levin, had close ties with 
Alger Hiss, Cyrus Eaton and other of similar persuasion. 
Because of the viewpoint of the law firm, Subject states 
that he began passing information to .Senator Joseph 
McCarthy. However, in the Spring of 1954, Senator 
McCarthy told Itkin that he was getting into trouble and 
allegedly reported that he had passed Itkin's reports to 
CIA. Itkin then states that a meeting was set up for 
him either in June/July/or August of 1954 with Mr. Allen 
Dulles. This meeting was at the Bellevue Stratford in 
Philadelphia. His contact was reportedly a man known 
as Philip Harbin. 
At this time, Itkin says he was able to report on 
matters affecting U Nu, then the Prem~er of Burma, the 
Indonesian Foreign Minister; and the owner or editor 
of the New Delhi Times. Itkin also claims to have had 
personal contacts with Luis Gutierrez, Consul General 
of El Salvador, and with a number of other people who 
had Guatemalan contacts. Itkin says the only money he 
received from Harbin was $5,000.00, which was supposed 
to be repayable and for which he gave a receipt, he believes 
sometime in 1957. He said the money was not,¾'epaid. 
Itkin states that he met Mario Brod in 1961 and 
that Brod was represented to him as a former Colonel 
in the OSS who had intelligence connections. From then 
on his contact was Brod and apparently Harbin dropped 
out of the picture.
