1. AMTlKl-1 has contacted the bank regarding the Social 
!kcurity numbers requested and has been advised that, although 
the bank is not obligated to insist upon Social Security or other 
identifying numbers for- these accounts, it does feel that AMTIKI-1 
may ultimately be subjected to nn inquiry_ from tho Inte1·nnl Revenue 
Service. Their_ reasoning .is based primarily upon the fact that 
th!::: accounts, while trust accounts for our pu1·poses, are not true 
trust accounts in ·that no trust agreements are of record at the 
bank. (Trust agreements could not be signed, of course, since the 
individuals were not and are not available to Sign.) 
2. In order to protect AMTIKI-1 fr9m any possible IRS 
investigation and, rather than pursue the r.iat_ter further with the 
bank. for which ve have. no cleared contact, it is suggested that 
these accounts be closed out over a two or three month period and 
re-established at Headquarters through the appropriate DTEARN 
channels. If the accounts remain here, it will be necessary to 
prei:,are new signature cards for each account removing Humphrey o. 
TIMA)i11S as a signatory and adding a JMCOBRA asset as ·an "inside" 
trustee for control purposes, or to remove AMTIKl-1 entirely and 
establish the JMCOBRA asset as the sole trustee. 
3. Please advise.
