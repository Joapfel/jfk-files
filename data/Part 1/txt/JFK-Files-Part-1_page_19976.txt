~Alt Roa,. 
.-: Mr. ·vi tale continues to do an exceptional job in assisting 
hh office on a most complex project. His longevity on the 
project; ~oupled with his: continued objectivity, makes his 
s~r~ices increasingly valuable. this is in contrast to many 
of his colleagues who have transferred because of the many 
extreme demands and frustrations caused by .this extraordinary 
.project. Mr. Vitale continues to be a. most loyal, cooperative 
.and willing worker, -getting along well with all hands. His 
maturity and many years of experience in his field, in addition 
• to his grea·t general knowledge, make him a most valued employee 
when ·compared to colleagues of similar rank .. It is because of 
this that I ·have again rated Mr. Vitale very high. In addition, 
·and fully realizing his limited potential as a senior operations 
officer, !--feel he is still ~dergraded and should be promoted 
to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.
