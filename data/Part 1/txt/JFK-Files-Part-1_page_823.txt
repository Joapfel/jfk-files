l'beui ■he bad a headache, he ordered i\&pir:I,,. fer her,. HEhsaw to it that 
■be received ■oft drinks when she wanted them, and he seemed to be 
boneatly distressed_ whenever she wept. AJU'AUNA-14 believes that it hag. 
beon tbe DSB's -intention from the very be&inning to recruit her, be­
cau11e •be doubts that all DSB prisoners au, treated as well, 
' 48. Tbe first SW meosage which AMFAUNA-14 wrote while under DSE 
control was dated 10 October, the day of l'.t1:11r release, The DBE officers 
uked ber what her control signal was, and she replied that it was a 
nbrio, but also included her true control signal. She deliberat~ly 
auabored ber first controlled SW message no. 2, to conceal the fact 
tllat abe bad already written several messages containing intelligence

f. obliged to write each one in duplicate, one·'of which was mailed and the

·.A!IIPAUllA-14 explained that there were two different SW systems, one for 
outeo:ing aail and the other for incoming, "Carlos" then asked her if . 
there were any aignif icance to the size of envelope used, or to the waY., 
tbo letter paper was folded, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not think so. • 
. AID'AUNA-14 feels that "Carlos" and ABAD never completely believed that 
abe had an SW system, because none of the letters which. she received 
diaeloaed SW when developed, and none of the letters which she wrote 
■bowed any traces of SW when held up to glancing light. 
47. "Carlos" was the DBE officer who maintained contact with 
Alll'AUNA-14 after ber release. For two or three weeks he saw her every 
daJ at ber apartment, aometimes for only twenty minutes, and sometimes 
■taying for several hours, frequently late at night. Occasionally he 
called ber at her office. Finally AMFAUNA-14 told him that she bad to 
pt up early in the morning to go to work, and asked him to visit her 
early in tbe evening, which he agreed to do. At the time of the in-
• .. tercepted AIIGLOSSY landing in Pinar del Rio, "Carlos" "did not visit 
''Alll'AURA-14 for five daya. When he finally returned, he was dirty, 
■waty and tired. Re dictated an SW letter he wanted AIIFAUNA-14 to 
-HDd to JroBARK, and while she was writing it he fell asleep. 
·,a. AIIPAUlfA-14 had to prepare written reports for him, which she 
:. ·'•i~- with tbe pseudonym "Dolores." He told her never to call him at 
• DIB'··ieadquartera, because he was never there. Once he brought her a 
book on Marxism to read, and promised to take her someday to visit a 
collective farm in Pinar del Rio Province. 
49. Despite his tjccasional efforts to get her to pick up the thread 
of tbe AIIPAUXA net, _AIIJPAUNA-14 believes that the primary target she was 
.intended to work against was the AJICOG household, From remarks made by 
both· ABAD and ''Carlos", she deduced that they already .had an informer 
in tbe house, but that they were not satisfied with his production, 
• Toward the end of her period of DSI -controlled activ!_~.{{G.°_i~l)e ·fel.t that
