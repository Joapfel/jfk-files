First Section, Fi.;rst Depa:..4tment. This information was 
furnished to NOSENKO primarily because of his friendship 
with GR YAZNOV and not as the result of mutual operations. 
However, NOSENKO learned of certain o.i the cases or 
was furnished additional details as a result of a request 
from the Seventh Department to the First Section, First 
Department, for assistance or vice versa. 
Ce:..4tain of the~4<£ cases listed were cases of the Sev~nth Depart­
ment prior to 1960 or in 1962 - 1963 when NOSENKO was in the Seventh 
. . 
Department. Certain 0£ the cases wer~ cas~s in which the First Section, 
First Department, was involved prior to 1960 or 1960 - 196i. The 
knowledge of NOSENKO concerning these two groups of cases does not 
materially support his claimed positions in the First Department and 
Seventh Department, but does support his claimed assignment to the 
Seventh Department prior to 1960 and in 1962 - 1963, and his .claimed 
assignment to the First Department in 1960 - 1961. 
It is difficult to specifically comment conce:.ning these~ 421 cases 
since they do not fall into one or two specific categories. Instead, faey 
constitute a rather motley group of cases remaining after completion of 
the detailed sections of the previot..s s~m::na:.:y. Included are Fi.:st 
Department and Seventh Department cases cove:drig a pe:::iod of ap;.n·oxi-
