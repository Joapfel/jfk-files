nnd efforts io get"Tt printed o.n n comm~rclal printing press in 
Havana appear to be successful, Regul,\r couriers arc being trained 
for delivery 0£ the newspaper to the provinces. PEREZ alio 
reported thei"I• progress in mounting two clandestine radio trans­
mitters for Agit/Prop purposes, one in Las Villas and one in 
Havana. These are powered by llO volt generators usually found 
on a small farm. It is projected to. trnnscit a re.,.,11ar propram, 
probably entitled "Telc-periodico Trinchcra". • The report does 
not explain what counter mc·asurt'S w1l1 be taken to prl'vcnt GOC 
detection, . Finally, _PEREZ describes an Agi t/Prop progrnm already 
in progress: - Firet n plan for printing and marking walls with

;u1·ing the reporting period no changes occurredOJ~ AMilARB 
personnel assignments. • With the exfU tration of A~IHINT~~from 
. PBRUMEN it is hoped that it will be possible to negotiate with 
Al!BARB the still ·unsettled question of AYBARB.funding.· We will 
repor·t further to Headquarters as soon as an ag1·ecmcnt is reached 
with AlllBARB on funding of AMBARB representatives in the field by 
local KlIDARK Stations. For the present it can only be said that 
t;,e AMBARB leaders are st1·enuously resisting any effort by JMWAVE 
to increase to more than eight the number of their people whom 
they will permit KUBARK to fur,d.directly rather than through AMBARB 
Heidquarters in Miami. 
The inspection tour of A!IBARB-16 to delegations in 
Latin America resulted in the general.report. forwarded for your 
information as Attachment D: in 1·eading tais ·report, it is useful 
for reference purposes to exam in-• Attachment E, a 1·ep~rt which the
