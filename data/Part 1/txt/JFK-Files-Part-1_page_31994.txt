an oxcollont Jud~o of mun (and women) and their quality. In his 
dealings with l,Nf'ALL, its various l,NDUZZ a"'•.:ncics and their 
dh·cctors ho has held up the Base's interc.-stH and image well while 
scckin..: ·fair and practical answers and solutions. He has n good sense 
of ccoriomy in mo notary as wcl 1 as other at fairs. As he becomes 
--- more· senior and more exclusively a supervisor and cxecutfvo ho should 
bccomo 111ore and more effective. 
Subject is an excellent operational ~anagcr and agent 
handler who gots the best out of his assets. He is p1•obably not 
so Htrong as an.opQrational starter and d<::vcloper and this nppoars 
to bo duo in part to an instinct to avoid exposure and eschew the 
glad hand. On the other hand, he has undcrtakcn two rather 
difficult dovolopmcntal operations startin"' trom scratch during 
the past six month.<1 a:nd has at least prove:n that he can do this kind 
of work when it is necessary. In both these cases ho m:iy have

his doparturo but th-ht is understandable. His written work is 
well c9ncoivcd ·and co~scicntious _and pcrhapo even some-what above 
a vcrngo fc>'r c_ase oft ice rs o·r his grado and ex per ioncc. L iko most 
BKIIERALD o·rricors, however, he docs not take i;ufficient pains to 
ac.hiove simple, clear, forceful expro!:H:1ion vith the result that, 
whUo.:his ·best cftorts arc effective his sc."(;ond best is apt to 
result in lack ·of organization and clarity. He should work ~n this -
n suggestion might be that he practice avoiding metaphors and 
adopt a straight dccl:u-ativc sontenco style. 
Iil conclusion, Subject's performance has been first clnss· 
in th_e most important respects and his relatively minor wonknossos
