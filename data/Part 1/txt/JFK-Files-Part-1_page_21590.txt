A theory which has previously been given consideration and 
warranted foll consideration w:is tha.t if :-;os.r:.::-.--xo was disi)atched, 
his mission was to confuse leads furnished-~ J\..,-.erican Intelligence 
and/or to denigrate the. value of information furnished by GOLITSYN. 
In connection wi~ this theory, it should be noted tilat NdSEX-rl:O_during 
current interviews has not made any remarks which could in _any way 
be construed as derogatory to GO.LITSYN'. fa addition·, NOSENKO does 
not claim to have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently, 
when some toc>ic peculiar to the FCD has been. broached with NOSE.NKO, 
·his immediate reply has been to the effect that "l didn't work in the FCD,"

or "You should ask GOLITSYN about that." 
In--connection with any consideration of.whether the contact of 
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have .been initiated by 
the KGB as a result of the defection o~ GOLITSYN,, the ti.-ning oi certain ., 
e~en::s should be noted .. GOLITSYN defected on is December 1961, 
NOSENKO departed from Mos~ow in March 19DZ for Geneva, -Switzerland, 
where he remained until 15 June 196Z. 
It is_ felt that it would have been practically impossible_ if not 
. . . 
impossible fo_r KGB ofii_cials to complete an assessment of the.actual or 
• po_teJ1tial damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSYN, •
