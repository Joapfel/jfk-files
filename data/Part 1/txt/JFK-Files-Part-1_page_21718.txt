KGB pur?ose in running the o,~cration was to-lure American Intelliger.ce 
into meeting BELITSKIY insi~e the USSR. 7ne previous summary stated 
that NOS:C:NKO did not know when the BELITSKl :· o?oration started 
(Brussels, Belgium, 1958). clicl not kr.ow the nature o! the British 
involvement. <lid n: t know the O?eratio:r..al details ar.d contact arrange-
ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, and did not know BELITSKIY 1s pattern 
of activity in ~~oscow or Geneva. 
NOSE~'KO during current interviews has indicated an awareness 
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use 
BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit­
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in London and still states that the 
primary ?Ur?ose 0£ the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in 
contacts with BELITSKIY witi:-,in the USSR. The latter was considered 
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in 
Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to 
• BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY 
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR. 
There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the 
BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis­
crepancies betw~en the statements by NOSEX-.i.<O on the BELITSKIY 
case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKOtJOfilzz
