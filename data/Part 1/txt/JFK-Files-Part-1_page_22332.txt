of International Relations to a position in the school of the 
CPSU Central Committee and ceased agent work. Altt.c-~:-;h she 
was inactive, NOS~NKO continued to be registered as ~.er case 
officer until 1964, when he defected. 
(i) FRIPPEL 
Having left his assignment in Moscow in early 1961, FRIPPEL 
(Pages 129-lJJ"and'Pax\ VlII.D.5.) returned several ti.l:te& to 
the Soviet l'nion in 1962 and 1963. NOSEHKO, who remained his 
case officer although FRIPI·EL now lived and worked in New York 
City, met him each tillle. FRIPfEL said there were three such 
occasions, in February 1962 when he re.et once with NOSEUY.O and 
, CHELNOKOV in Odessa, and two later times in Moscow and Odessa, 
when NOSENKO came alone. NOSENKO ucnie4 that he met FRIPPEL 
in Ocessa in February 1962 with CllELNOKOV, but said that he met 
twice with him alone after returning to Moscow from Geneva. 
The first of the~e meetings was in the summer of 1962 wh~n FRIP­
PEL was accompanying a group of American newspaper editors tour­
ing the Soviet Unicn. FRIPPEL said !-IOSENKO called briefly at 
his hotel room to enquire what questions 'the editors planned 
to ask KHRUSHCHEV during a planned interview. W~cn FRIPP~L 
said h~ did not know, NOSE!~KO departed and FRIPP EL later re­
pqrted that he did not see NOSENKO again on this trip; (NOSENKO 
s~id he called again after the interview to learn the •reactions• 
of the editors.)' The oecond meeting was in Odessa, when FRIPPEL, 
vi.sited t.he.S_oviet Union as a guide on a tour ship. According 
to FRIPPEL, it was on this occasion that NOSENKO apparently made 
a phone call to ask permission to go aboard FRIPPEL's ship, and 
it might have been at this -~~eting or the e~rlier one that 
rmsENKO told him something of his personal background. (I'RIPPEL 
knew a considerable amount of information about !-.OSENKO's father 
and fc:Utlily.) NOSENKO denied the possibility that he would have 
to request permission to board the vessel and said that if he 
had told FRIPPEL anything about himself, it was when'- he was 
drunk. Both FRIPPEL and NOSENKO agreed that FRIPPEL provided 
no information of value during any of these meeti~gs . 
(ii) SVENCHANS~IY 
NOSENKO has cited SVENCHANSKIY, KGB cryptonym •ANoo,• as 
' an example of the Second Chief Directorate's use of foreign 
travel agents to signal the KGB when an interesting tourist is 
about to visit the Soviet Union (Pages 295-298). SVENCHANSKIY 
was recruited for this purpose, NOSENKO said, in 1961 and used 
to send open-code signals to the Tourist Department by marking 
visa applications whenever he spotted anything significant. 
Some of SVENCHANSKIY's ,signals had been,considerec, NOSENKO 
said, •of definite operational interest.• In September 1963, 
NOSENKO took the case over from th~ previous hancling officer, 
NOSKOV, ahd his name was listed in SVE~CHANSKIY's file as the 
responsible officer. 
NOSENKO first said that he had read SVENCHA..~SKIY's file 
and then changed this to say that he had only skimmed it. He 
met twice with his new agent, once in September 1963 and once 
later in the year. On both occasions, NOSKOV was present.
