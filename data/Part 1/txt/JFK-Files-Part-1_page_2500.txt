the KOSOLAPOV ~GARLAND) trip. 
The position taken by NOSENKO on this point is that he accepts 
the statement by the L .. terviewer that KOSOLAPOV made s~ch a trip, 
but he says that he, NOSENKO, simply does no~ know anything" about 
it. He adds only that }.ad anyt}1ing significant developed in the study 
of :GARLANI?,\ he .would have been aware of it. 
NOSENKO, as supervisor of the group working against code 
clerks, should have known of any trip of KOSOLAPOV to Finland in 
1960 or 1961. NOSENKO hi..""nself was out of .Moscow o:;:i a trip to Cuba 
from 15 November 1960 to circa 17 December 1960. The possibility 
exists that this could have accounted for his lack of knowledge of the 
trip of KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki and return to Moscow on 16 November 
1960. However, NOSENKO has not attempted to use his Cuban ti-ip as 
a possible explanation for not knowing of the November KOSOLAPOV 
·trip.
