This wave of economic prospcrity-eombined 
with the abs~nce of the political repre~sion that 
some rightists had predicted would r£:sult from a 
victory by the Marxists-led many, particularly in 
low Income groups, to vote for the candidates of the 
Popular Unity coalition in the April municipal elec­
tions. Allend~'s own Socialist Party bettered its elec­
toral showing in the 1969 congressional elections by 
n~arly 100 percent (a jump from 12 percent to 22 
pcrceni of the total!, and the candidates of all the 
PJrties supporting Allende recei\"ed about 50 per­
cent of the vote, as comrared with the 36 percent 
wi,hich the President himself hJd received only seven 
months before. Yet, gratifying as the results were, 
1116 COJlit:on was still a few votes short of the abso­
hne majoriti that Allende required to win a plebi­
scite on a c',n-:.titutional amendment. He was later

Political Pobri1.a1ion 
The hardcnin~ of the Christi:in Democratic posi­
tion began in mid-1971. It was .:iccelerated In June 
by the assassination of the former Christian Demo­
cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by 
extremists, at least one of whom had been releJsed 
from pri~on by Allende upon his accession to power. 
A month later in a by-election in Valparafso, the 
victorious Christian Dt?mocratic candidate received 
the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the 
Right led to the secession from the PDC of eight 
deputies and a number of otller party leaders tci form 
the pro-Allende liquierd:1 Cristian.J (Christian Left). 
This was counterbalanced hO\vever, by a split in the 
other direction within th~ Allende coalition. Five of 
the seven Radical senators (including !\vo former 
presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies 
left the Radical Party (PR), and formed the Partido 
de la lzquierda Radical (Party of the Radical left­
P1R) in protest against the P.!Jno:ist orientation of a
