Tbe Fidelista youth were not Marxist. They are ■ore so today tbaD 
they were before, but they have had this experience of dealing with the 
Uaited States - - I have bad a lot of argupeats with them about it. 
For i11&tance when they came to the United States iai- - i8 Karch of 59, 
you remember, Felipe Paaos (?) came, Fi~el went to Washington and be ~eat 
to Mew York and it was extraordinarly badly handled. Christian Herter 
wouldn't see bi■ at the State Department. Be insisted on taking a hotel 
suite, rather than do that. lertainly it wasn't an official visit but 
a lot of people have gone to Wasbiagtoa u• ... Thea it was a question 
of whether the Cubans wanted aoney or aot. Tbe Cubaas claimed,

conceraiag take-over'. EAcb time, they were vetoed by the State 1>9partmeat 
or someone else, who said don't go into this, because w~ want to have a

It was provocation and counterprovocation. They would do s011119tbiag 
tbea there would be Allerican •stt•• reaction, then a Cubaa counterreactioa 
until it was real escalation, diplomatically, to the point at which it 
fell completely iato the hands of the Russians. That could have been

peaceful coexisteace, and said that there bad never been disagreeaeat 
with the Russiau over the missiles .xxxxxx•~ In actual fact they were 
boiling. TbeJ were furious about tie missile business. Thia left a bad 
taste ia their mouths. The Bscalaate busiaess, you bow the~

displace the romantic revolutionaries, if you will. It failed but that 
didn't meaa that Carlos Rafael Rodriguez aad ■ore capable technocrats
