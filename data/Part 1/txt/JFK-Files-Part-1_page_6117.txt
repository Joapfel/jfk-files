I 
c. On 19 March 1976, IPS wrote to Ms. ~uller 
an~~ncloscd saniti~ed versions of four document~, 
three of which were UDO documents. Deletions had 
Bcc.n madn unJe~· (b) (I), (b) (3), and (b) (6) of the 
• FOIA. Two additional ODO documents (those referred 
by the fflJ) were denied in toto under thn same 
exemptions. The ~xcmptions were explained, the 
denyiriP. officials were identified by name, and • 
Ms. fuller was advised of her right to appeal. 
Ms. fuller was ~lso advised that FBI ~nd INS ori­
gi_natcd material was being referred to the FBI and 
INS for their direct response to her requ~st. 
fN.B. When JPS listed the four documents_ they _ 
erroneously listed the ncputy DirE'ctor of Security 
as denying llocumcnt 1. and Chief, Services Staff 
as responsible for documents 2, 3, 4, S, and 6. 
In fact, the Deputy Director of Security was the 
denying official of document 4 :ind Chief, Services 
Staff for Jucurnents l, 2, 3, 5, anJ 6. OGC should 
point out and coHect this error in their letter
