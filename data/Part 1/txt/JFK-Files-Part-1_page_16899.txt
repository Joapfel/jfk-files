3. • After several largely nbort i ve attempts to get GERENDE to 
follow up <rnerational lends (and after noting, at the same time, a 
fine job-he did in recruitirig LIRICK-13), the Station decided to 
preso·nt ~:a:RJ:l<ID.E with .wlia_t amounted to an ultimatum: Following a 
six-week lEfa.v-e at ·the ·bQi;De of relatives in the US, be was told that 
in recognition of his past services he was being given a salary 
increase. 'to. $7, o·oo U~ ptir. annum (which ·may not seem like much unt 11 
it is realized ttia f GERENDE pays no taxes on this, and has tbe use· 
of a QP car, to.boot). He was also told that·be would be given a 
number of-leads to follow up (in some cases persons to whom be bad 
n·a tural access; in ·other cases leads which he would !"ollow up under 
cover and~.in alias), <ifs we11 ·as· agents to handle ( in alias). It 
-would be up to· hiat"•;.to"take- advantage. of this opportunity to perform 
up to·bis level ot·'iilftt'ity; if be did.so, Headquarters would be 
williµg to work_ out an .annuity program wbic~· would relieve bis 
·,ior-ries about eventual retirement·. If be did not put out, be could 
·- _'expect to be te1•minat"ed by t°be end of FY 1970. GKRENDE expressed • 
. ') . ~is gratitude and .bis williagries_s ·to put his shoulder to the wheel, 
, ·and, in fact, he bas doiie· .. so_~ • In Oct-ober 1969 he took ·over the 
tiandlfiig-ofL'"lANVI_L-1-fr·omOliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station ba.s 
started to give him leads to follow up. His performance bas improved 
in ever/ way--his punct~ality hac improved, bis written reports 
are continually improving, and he bas made the effort to devise 
approaches to the various leads ·and to start to follow up on them. 
4. The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24 
October, when GERENDE reported that his wife wanted a divorce. The 
- problem is basically one of incompatibility of personal! ties, 
. exacerbated by the fact that GEREND~•s operational activities 
resulted in bis being home more often than a man who works a normal 
office day. GERh'NDE's wife had taken a long vacation alone earlier 
in the year, visiting ·her parents, and the leave taken by GERENDE, 
referred to above, followed his wife's return and did not include 
-her. Both times GERENDE bad the four children. Thus the news of 
\~ the divorce request did_ not come as a real surprise. The problem, 
t however, is that both parties want custody of tho children, and tbe 
I<; dispute becomes daily more bitter and more violent. The station 
. ;, f bas taken the position that security of GERENDE's operations must 
. -., /be preserved at al_l co~ts, hoping, of course, that tt,e divorce can 
~ (P, be avoided. At this writing, the outcome cannot be guessed. II 
·/ 1:1 / the_ bitter fight results in· the surfacing of GERENDE's RVROCK 
-:: \ . .3 employment, LI LYRIC and LI CALLA are faced wi tb at least a:me threat 
'= of exposure. • Tbe MHHARSHers are quite aware that a LILYiUC-like 
facility exists; whether they suspect Ll~ALLA is a moot question. 
LICALLA is in many ways more useful, and the MHJIARSHers could put 
it out of business very easily by making their wall higher. Little 
could, or probably would, be done to prevent LILYRIC from functioning. 
\"\, • 5. Other than LIANVIL-1 and the LIEMPTY assets dinctly 
~ handled by GER~E (LII,,YRIC and LICALLA personnel and LIEUPTY-4) 
-~·other Station assets whose security might be affected by GERENDE's 
i\ current problems include LIENTRAP, LIRICE-13, and the PCM OP. 
}", GERENDE is also nware of the. fact that soma sort of ope.ration, 
K. resumably technical, is or bas been conducted from the LBIESA 
, omplex; he is aware of the existance and knows some of the members 
f,___the LI EMBRACE team (LIEMBRACE-1, -2, and -4, a1nong the currently

Tri -his 15 years, G~ENDE bas worked in almost every phase of tbe 
Station's ·support activittes, and even though in recent years be 
bas been pretty much restricted to LIEMPTY, his knowledge of 
activities and assets which are still current is considerable. It 
is too early to judge the--outcome of GERJ::NDE's problems, but the 
Station is making every effort to see that security of operations 
is not affected by whatev~r decisio~ is reached.
