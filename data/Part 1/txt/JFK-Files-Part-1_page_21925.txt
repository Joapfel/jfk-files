I, 
Conunittee called t;OSENKO's father on the phon:'!! and told him 
the whole story. NOSEUKO's ·f'athP.r never to'H either UOSENKO's 
-wife or mother of the incident, but did chide t!OSENKO about 
it. The incident was brought before the Ko:r:3omol ar.d <liscussed. 
A written !"eprimand for immoral conduct-una•Jt:iorized use? of 
official docum~nts was placed in his record. This was also 
a final warning meanir.g that any other infra'c:tion would result 
in expulsion-. , He ma:.le the stater.ient that he had been punished 
for this incide~t many time~. He could not imnediately apply 
for party membership; the incident was brm.:c;ht up repeatedly 
in Kor'.lsomol meetings and even in party m-=etings (after he was 
accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being 
promoted from Senior·Lieutenant to C~ptain. (The Dep~ty­
Director who gave him five days was a member of the pro:notion 
commission.)" 
Aithough there have been slight chanses and contradictions 
in NOSENKO's nurnE:rous accounts of this storv (the·house arrest 
was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 dayi) it re~ained 
basically consistent until the Octet.er 1966 ir.terrogations 
when he said for the first time thac he conc=act£d gonorrhea 
from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather thac 1954. In 1954, 
he said, he again was infected, thL; 'time b:zr a prostitute whom 
he picked up in the vicir.ity of thr.: Le:ningrad Rai.lroad Station 
in Moscow. When the KGB required that he reveal the source, 
_NOSrnKo said, he ascribed the latter case t~ the origir.al girl 
from Leningrad. During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO 
also told CIA for the fir~t time that he had had venereal 
disease on t·,,o other occasions while studying at the Instit.ute 
of International Affairs. 
He later began to "feel more a part of the KGB," and as 
a junior KGB case officer, he personally recruited Richard 
BURGI in the first successful recruitment opera'tion .. carried 
out by the newly-created Tourist Departmcr.t of the Second Chief 
Directorate.* "And in 1956," NOS~.KO said ir. 1964, "before 
my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in 
the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned 
the rc:.nk cf Senior Case_ Officer. ! developed a pride in my­
s~_._(a feelingL that I_san do thi~ You know how it is. 
When a person feels that he can, that he has some support, 
then he works much better. ,·le has more initiative and so· 
forth." 
3, Affiliation with Communist Party Organs 
NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Com.~unist 
Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 -when he 
joined the Komsor,1O1 at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku. 
This stepwas a casual one, and he has said that he took it 
without much tr.ought, mainly because all his friends were
