When he was asked on 20 October 1966 whether he had visited 
the Pushkin Street acidress several days after AEIDIAN had. been 
seen ~here, ·as he had ·earlier said, UOSENKO replied: "I don't 
reme:nber. I do not want to say that I.visited the dead drop. _I 
don't remember now whether I visited it or not. It seems to me 
tr.at I visited it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited 
it with KOZLOV, but I cannot say •yes,' and I cannot say 'no.'" 
As previously indicated, SOSENKO said that on the sa:r,e day 
kB!DIAN was observed on Pushkin Street (i.e., on 30 December 
1961) the Chief of the KGB Surveillance Directorate, KOZLOV,

dead drop location occurred on 12 November and 4 December 
1960, when CIA officer Eugene MAHONEY checked the address
