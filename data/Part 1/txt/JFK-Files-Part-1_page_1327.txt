3.J • The above evaluatiop stresses· the operational and security 
weaknesses in this ope~ation .. In contra~t to these weaknesses 
are t-he positive considerations of this mission.· A/2 has the 
intelligence,·competence, and confidence to approach and re­
cruit two assets wi-th the potential for developing anti-regime 
operations a~ a high level within the .Cuban Army. The results 
·which thes~ anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter 
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential. 
Nevert-heless, if the operation continues, it wi 11 bear close 
watching in terms of security and control for these factors 
will jeopardize the: operation as well as KUBARK's position 
if not' properly contained •.

regime in his own country and that he will accept KUBARK aid
