Pages 332 - 333 of the :;:>::.-evious summary cor,tain the basis 
for the previous conch.sion that the claim of XOSEKKO that he was a 
Deputy Chief oi the Scvenfo Dc?artinent from july 1962 to January 
1963 was not credible, It is considered tha·t a detailed rebuttal is 
not necess~ry since this conclusion was apparently based on inade(iuate 
information, During current interviews, KOSEKKO has furnished 
details c·oncerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position· 
which substantiate his claim to having been a Deputy Chief of the 
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964·, 
.An exam.>le in sup:i)ort oi the statement that the previous conclu­
sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written 
notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 196~ .. 
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is 
inadequate, ina_ccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews, 
an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed explan'­
ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes. 
Durin~ current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed iniorma­
tion concerning all aspects of his notes. This information supports his 
claimed position of Deputy Chief 0£ the Seventh Department and includes 
collateral support to his claim of being Deput}'.' Chief oi the First Section, 
First.Department, in 1960 - 1961. C001231
