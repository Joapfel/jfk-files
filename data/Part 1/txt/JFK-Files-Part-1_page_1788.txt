Cable Secretariat 
We have examined t~e Cable Secretariat which la currently 
located in the office of the DCI and reports to the Executive Officer. I 
We believe it should contin'1e to be ln the ofilce of the Director under 
the care!ul supervhlon of the Executive Director. Wo are con--
cerned that aa it now operates requlrementa for cables have not 
been adequately coordinated, and cable• have been dlsaeminated 
too often on the Judgment of Junior officere. We believe thb needs 
careful study. 
Contracts 
' 
We believe that the Agency ls vulnerable on sole-source 
contracts for such activities as TSD and DPD. and that those 
contracts currently in existence should be reviewed and that all 
s 
" 
such future contra.eta should be passed on by thcs DCI' a office 
prior to approval. 
Personnel Assignments 
We believe that the DDCI and DCI should be the fiaal 
approving authority for all assignments to positions of Chief / 
or Deputy Chief of Offices (DD/ 2 Divisions and Staffs) or of 
field stations and bases, both foreign and domestic.
