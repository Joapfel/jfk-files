- 1.. As-·.~por.te·d _in~ reference, AHCLEVE/iS was tenninat_ed 
effective ti:·:July 1967. AHCLEVE/l'S 'was terminated because he 
resign·e.d,,from h_1s· position as a military ~oordinator/member of 
Ju;CE._ (Cuban Representation in•.Exile)·, a Miami ·based Cuban exile 
organization,. in··-'e-a~ly .. June 196 7 and he thus lost access. to ·his 
tar,ge_t, a_s AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of 
REcE··since 1 August 1966. In add_ition~ JMWAVE does not have a 
cu_rrent need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT 
organizatic:>I'.\ has the capability· to p~netrate and report Qn· RECE 
if and when the need should aris"e. After AMCLEVE/15 resigned 
from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ­
ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty" 
ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided that 
.the AMOT organization should not hire him.
