hi°l?;hiy ·m.otivated and st:r;ongly anti-communist, this point-~will 
remain•basically unresolved since it is almost certain that 
A/27 would refuse a second LCFLUTTER examination· if asked.

3.· AMlCE/27 has not seen his contacts in the army for the 
past two years.· Although it is difficult-to assess how well 
he knows various persons in the military about whom he speaks, 
-it is the .case officer's opinion that few of these contact's 
might be considered really close. :AMICE/14 has been out of 
dir~ct touch with his operational contacts since July 1961. 
• 4.- The infiltration into Cayo Cinco Leguas is dependent 
·upon having a ·good guide in the boat. At this time, Phase 
·11 is awaiting the recruitment of AMTRUNK/4 as guide. 
5. Control over AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 is basically lacking. 
Some· control can be exerted through the implied threat of 
·withholding support to the operation. Control however will 
remain-~enuous at best and A/27. will continue to be a dif­
ficult handling problem.
