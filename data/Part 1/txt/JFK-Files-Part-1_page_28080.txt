~ursory, and from the beginn~ng there has been a high premium on· 
both tecnnic·al accuracy and sound substantive judgment. As Mr. 
Randall h_imself not~d in a report on his deputy, we have an 
enviable record as far as "flaps" are concerned; in a situation 
f~aught with danger of inappropriate release of information we 
have had only fi vo ·cases where release has led· to embarrassment 
out of 7,000- "possibles." Mr. Randall, with typical modesty, 
uses the statistic in praise ~f others; I choose to use it to 
praise· him. The Grou'p' s reco_rd to pate is nothing sh.ort of .. 
as~onisbing, and Mr. Randall can-take great·pfide in his team's 
acco"!plishme"i1ts. i 
'· He has built an extremely a~le and dedicated u-am, .~nd he 
i• as quick as anyone I know to ascribe to ind(vidual members of 
that te~m credit for ac~ions, ideas or progre~s~ The~ rrispond 
to h_is fairnes_s with ·loyalty and affection, and their morale 
in the.face of cpn•tant harrassment and frustration is testimony 
td his leadership. • 
New r~ftponslbilitics for support ·to the Offi~e of General 
Counsel were 'added to PiAG's burdens thls year. Hr. Randall 
o~posed the move and argues (and lobbied) intelligently to 
preclude it, to no avail. It is to his credit that, having urged 
a dlffercnt course of actjon, he set about to ensure that the . 
'unpopular new function received ·the same careful attcntioT) which 
has been the hallmark of P[AG's other work. As a consequ·encc, 
our OGC-relatc4 efforts, which arc very demanding and 
time-consuming, have the PIAG stan~ of excrillcnce on them. 
Mr. ·Randall created the system he manages, and continues 
to.seek way~ to improve upon lt. Our move to an iutomated index 
of reviewed nnd released documents was urged and supported hy 
Mr. Randall, and he has been equally supportive of-a new branch 
chief's efforts to restrm:tuce ou.r Initial Review process. lie • 
is also quick to sec and to comment on the way our efforts 
affect I arr.er _,Agency and 'government equities, and vicf: versa. 
During this year his responsibiliti'es were broadened by 
the addition of our Declassification Rcvic1, Branch to his Group, 
a rcflect,i_on_ of our reco!{nidou of t'he inevitable rclation;;hip 
between schc<lulcJ declassification and selective declassification 
and release under FO!A/PA/E.O. 11652.- This Branch will shortlY 
be absorbed by the new Records Review Branch of the D[IA, but PL\G 
·wlll continue to ·ue the focal point for polic}' forrmlution on 
declassification of lJU r·ccor<ls. •
