c·an differ as to the weight which should be given to the value of this 
type of information. 
NOSENKO has furnished information concerning;SCn, • KGB, 
_ recruitme~ts of United St~tes citizens and foreign nationals covering 
. . .• 
the period of 1953 through 1963. This. shou~d not be interpreted as a 
• statement that NOSENKO has furnished inforz:na#<:>n in_ :r.egard to all-, 
sen recruitments,· even of Americans, during this period .. His ir...for-
• • • . . . . 
mation based on personal knowledge is in_ general limited to the First 
. . 
. nepa·rtment and Seventh Department. He has furnished information . . 
concernLng ·cases of several ot!1.er departments in the sen and some 
FCn cases, but this information was in general acquired indirectly 
from social or business conversations with other -KGB· officers. 
NOSENKQ has furnished information in regard to a number of 
cases which were previously known to United States Intelligence. Wb.ile 
•· 
the value '0£ such information cannot be considered high, the additional 
details which NOSENKO has provided in a number of cases can:.iot be 
dismissed as being o:£ no value to_ Western Intelligence,. even if fo.e 
information cannot be regarded as damaging to the KGB. Furthermore, 
inasmuch as there is no reason to question his sourcing o:f inform.ation 
already known, there is no basis for suspicion of NOSENKO for his 
t· having provided such inform,ation.
