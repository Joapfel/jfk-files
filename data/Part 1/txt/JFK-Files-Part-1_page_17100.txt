photographs of Communist officers which are of value 
to both thc.> JMTIGER program and the Station's 
rc.>cruitment/penctration program. The LIENTRAP 
personnel also regularly service twenty-one postol 
accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City 
Station. 
5 .. One development-which may affect the security 
ol the LIEMPTY basehouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC 
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small 
store near the Sovi<.'t Embassy) reported that a Soviet. 
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and \ 
requested him to inform on his nei~hbors. Rl'portc-dly , 
the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LBIITED basehoust') I 
by name.and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed) \ 
of the new buiiding which now housc-s LILYRIC. The 
1 
Soviet pinpointed lhe building by saying the one being'. 
built by n person who fit pc-rfectly the dl'scription of: 
LIMOUSINE. LICO\YL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet 
1•eflected any inte1·est in 'LIMOUSINE. The occupants of 
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1 
indicated to his Station contact that the only person 
he rl'al ly suspected in the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6 
(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing, 
lives comfo1·tably. and owns a c:u·, Ill• claims to have 
heard it rumort.•d that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the 
Americans. (-Sinc-e LIMITED is equippect with a radio 
and tips off the Station's surveillance tl'am when it 
• is used against Soviet targets, fft.,adquarters has 
already nss\!med that the Soviets have identified this 
base-house,) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons 
named by the Soviet who· had no connection whatsoever 
with CIA. 
6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become 
an informant on his neighbors. According to ~.,ICOWL-1, 
he there-fore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to 
collect the intormat ion thl' Soviet wanted. However, 
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it 
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked 
of LICOWL-1 and just wlmt LICOWL-1 may have told the 
Soviets.. The Statio11 is still looking into this develop­
ment.
