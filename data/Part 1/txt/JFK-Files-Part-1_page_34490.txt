1n Switz.erland in 1964, lie was_ subsequently brought to the 
U.S. and after a short period of relative freedom, he was 
conflc~d under strict and relatively austere conditions~­
i'or a pe,·iod of appre>icimately·threc years. Commenciryg in

. NOSl:NKO s 1n1t1al entry 1nto the IJ.S. was coordinated _wlt,. 
the Department of State, and they were periodically ·advised 
of his status during his confinemont up to the time of his 
final settlement. 
The strict conditions of NOSLNKO's confinement were 
intended to convey.to him the seriousness of l1is position 
as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to him that 
hi~ f~cc sct~lcc~nt in the U.S. was pre~ludcd as long n~ 
tins issue was unresolved. It was understood, however,-
that at any time he could have elected to end his ccnfine• 
ment and return to the Soviet Union. OS files do not document 
that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to 
NOSENKO, ho~ever, it is the recollection of senior staff 
officers (ADD/0 and D/OSJ that such was the case, and further 
that it was a condition routinely applied to other defectors 
whose bona fidcs were in doubt. •
