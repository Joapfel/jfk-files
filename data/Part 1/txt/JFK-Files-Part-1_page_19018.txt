-a,pprQ_v~d the sc!ieduling_.·of a ·Berlin party convent_ion (Land~sparteitng) 
f·or 26··Apr11 1969., at whiclf a new and hopefully m~re stable city 
Executive Committee was to l:>e elected. 
4. The 15 Mnrch meeting provided an indication that the Berlin 
NPD may well stick toGcthc~ ~nde~ von Thadden's guidance until 1971, 
in spite .or the fricfion between city and district lcndership. Al-· 
thOli~h the· eight 'spokesmen -for the local leadership, who took the 
floor after K~n~zia's situation report and von Thadden's t~ynot~ 
speech, npprovea·the action·or lhe 86rlin NPD districts in opposing 
the self-dissolution of the .locnl party, and no one contradict~d them, 
nll but 31-of ~he 140 mcmbcrs·present then voted Ior a ·resolution con­
demnini; District Chiefs John'nn Ratzek (Schv~neberg) nnd Philipp 
Goilles (Wilmersdorf}, lt-adcrs oI the ~oyalists, for nnti-party ac­
tivity. This vote amounted to a vote of confidence in the tactics of 
the Bcrli-n·.City_ie_ade_rshi-p, and according.to members present was due 
solely _to vrin Thadden's pre~ence -and influence; In the·view of thes~ 
members, a ·meeti~g 'withoct the· att~ridance or reprE>sentathes of the 
Hanover headqunrte1·s would have led .to a no-confidence vote ·in th·e 
Kendzia leadership. During the m~e.ting, von Thaddcn also reJected 
"Kendzia 1 s "Berlin Program," whi<;h called for n softer l!ne on East 
Germany and on GE>rmnn reunification. 
5· .. At the 15 March se·ssion, lef·t-wing, anti-NPD protestors 
·assault"ed a number of NPD memb(,rs and forced the NPD twice to change 
its meeting site. This leftist action and thP obvious fact that the 
militant left has a penetration of the Berlin !\?D have had a seri· 
ously dampening effect on the NPl,)'s willingness to m<'et in the open. 
The party is now tent':itively plannin~ t.o hold future meetings on a 
ren.ted excursion boat whose locntion would not be announced until the 
time of the meeting. • 
6. The Berlin NPD has rnadc strenuous efforts to rieternaine which 
left-wing organizations made up the· task force which tried to disrupt 
the 15 llarch meeting. The Extraparlinmentary Opposition .(APO) claimed 
the honor, but the NPD investi~ation showed definitely that all but a 
handful of the protestors were an organized ~roup dispatched by· the 
Spandau branch of the liest Berlin Socialist unity. Party (SEW) whose 
actions.are part of a long-range program of harassment by the East 
Berlin SocialJst Unit)' Party (SED). 
7. -Because of the su~sequent possible threats or prohibition 
by the Allies (signalled _by a letter from Governing Mayot· Klaus 
Schuetz to the Allies asking that· the NPD in Berlin bt? banned) and of 
further counter-demonstrations ~y the militant left, o~ 27 March 
-von Thadden wrote !l letter to the Berlin.City leadership asking that 5• • .• ' 4
