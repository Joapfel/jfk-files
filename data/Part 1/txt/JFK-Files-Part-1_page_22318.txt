KURIU:~KO (Army Attach~&), or BELOGLAZOV (Naval Attaches and 
Marines) had any questions or reports to submit, they would 
come to hi■ rather than to KOVSHUK, the ChiP.f of the section, 
After about six months he was relieved ot this duty because 
his other duties d1d not allow sufficient time for this

earlit,r ~eeo as:-Gting DRANO\' against these tarbets. 
SOSE~1{O said on 20 October 1966 that ici.mediately upon, 
or at the latest a few weeks after, arriving in the G.S. 
Embassy Section, he went ~n leave for a month. Either 
immediately before or right after this lea\·e KO\'SHUK told 
him that he would be rcspo~siblc for activities against 
the Naval At tac hes. DHASO\' "as retiring anci gave SOSE!-lKO

first mention either of the leave periodic early 1960 or 
ot having had case offic~r:responsibilities for personnel 
of the Naval Attache's office in ~Iosco•. (At the same time 
he said that he bad lied about going on leave io Joveaber 
1960.)
