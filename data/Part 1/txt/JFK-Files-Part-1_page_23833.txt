JAOUAR ha4 made the followi.11£ available to us, in response to our 
request for information on a continuing basia relating to STEBORY/11 
"In mid-Kay STEBONY/1 was aUll trying to arrange a vial t to 
Algiers this BWD111er - on the strength of help he has received 
fros •some comrades•. 
"Robert VILLI.AJ.tS in Havana has given STEBONY/1 the impreaaion 
that he may viai t Algiers as a member of a C11ban delegation. 
Also, STEBONY/1 understands that ¥111 tam Wc.RTHY, who baa been in 
H11noi, will be going to Algiers. STBBONY/1 ex:peote to 11eet a 
lrUlllber of bis friend& there and hia main reason for wishing to 
make this trip is to disousa his problems, past and present, 
with these friends and other interested parties. He hopes to 
clear up doubts and uncertainties and, in this context, he has 
00111111ented that one of the reasons for much of the hostility shown 
to him has been the reluctance of others to involve themselves 
in the differences vhioh arose between himself and Jacques VERGES 
because the latter vas clearly more innuenti&l and more important 
than S'fi20WY/ 1. 
"STEBO?lY/1 had heard that VERGES vas still insistiog tbat 
S'l'EBONY/1 ves a t.."'TJ3ARK agent and that Nils .AlID2RSCN and Jacques 
CftlPPA vere 'ODYCKE double agents•. GRIPPA, vho is leader of the 
pro-Chinese Co1111mniet group in Belgiua, is planning to bring up­
t<reiate hie book 1Sarxiem-Leninism or Revisionism•, published two 
7e&rs ~go, by adding a new chapter. STEBONY/1 is looking into the 
possitility of ita publication in the tiK or PBPRIMB and, in thia 
context, he considers •~onthly Review• to be the only possible
