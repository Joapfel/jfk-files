As Assistanl lo the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Conuell applied excep­
tie1hal .execu~ivc talent in sharing with me the responsibility for 
the d.irection of the investigative and operational support programs 
in the Office of Security.· It is felt that Mr. O'Connell made an 
outstanding contribution to. the management of 10S at a time of 
.. the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has 
a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his soluti_ons to 
these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the 
breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and con­
cisely in both wr,iting and speech. As Assistant DDS(IOS), he 
demonstrated sc;iurid management concepts and acute cost con­
sciousnesti. His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the 
universal respect he enjoy'.' among all subordinates. 
I regard Mr. O'Connell's performance as ADDS(IOS} as 
"Outstanding."
