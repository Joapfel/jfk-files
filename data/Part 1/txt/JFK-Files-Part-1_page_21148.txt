CASASYN' s dependents took physi_cal examinations at the 
1\m~rican Hospital in Paris on 20 February. Since, because of 
h1s cover there -could be no L'.-i11l\RP connection, Cl\SASIN' s dE-?Cn.:lc:,ts 
made arrangements for tht~ir !>hyi;i.c.i.ls as private cit b:ens, on th€' 
pretense th.:1t they rcqnirca ic-t<1tcmcnts that they were in g.>ad 
health in order to obtain insur:rnce. Obviol1sly, fryrms IJQ "-ere not 
pre;:,ared; the attached ccrtific.i.tcs of good health and freed,:\~ 
from contagious disease arc <'!ll that is nor:nally c;iven to pri\·ate 
individuals in France. We hope they suffice.
