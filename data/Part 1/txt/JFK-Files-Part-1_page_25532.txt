their jobs well. The only chance foreseen is.an increase in 
salary for somo, if not a 11, of thc!:o ai;cnts. 'fh!? co!.t rec.::ot

rennin fairly constant, with perhaps a clight allowance for

longer be paid with his tcrcination. tJV-2823 will be sold or 
otherwise dispos'cd of and should not be included in tho project 
for FY 1971. Equipir.cnt and operational expenses should remain 
constant.
