MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of Legislative Counsel 
ATTENTION Scott Breckenridge 
SUBJECT HSCA Request 
REFERENCE HSCA Letter Dated 8 May 78, OLC 78-1573 
1. (U) Reference requests access to information in 
six areas pertaining to the U-2 Project. As you know 
the U-2 Project files include about 150 boxes and over 650 
reels of microfilm, all located at the Records Center. We 
have reviewed the shelf listing titles to identify pertinent 
files that might be responsive to the areas of request. The 
information requested covers an era and an organization which 
was not a part of this Directorate. As a result much of the 
corporate memory is no longer available and research of the 
files by current personnel is time consuming and requires 
almost a learning process. We have depended a great deal 
on the written History of the U-2 Project for leads to files 
and for information contained in this memorandum. 
2. (U) The primary interest of reference refers to 
the U-2 Project, Detachment C, while stationed in Atsugi, 
Japan. Attached are replies keyed to the six areas in the 
HSCA letter. 
3. (U) We realize that the information supplied by 
this memorandum does not fully respond to all the areas 
requested. Because of the broad and encompassing nature 
of some of the requests in the HSCA letter and the fact 
that our files are not organized to readily respond to 
such broad requests we request that the HSCA staff review 
the material and determine if their requests could be 
limited or narrowed in some way.
