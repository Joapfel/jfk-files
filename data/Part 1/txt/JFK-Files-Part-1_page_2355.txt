D. Is the information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA concerning 
KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-
surate with his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor-. . 
mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities, 
and organization· is more than reasonably commensurate with. his claimed 
career in the KGB from mid-March 1953 to his defection in early February. 
1964. 
. . .. . . 
In reaching the above conclusion, consideratibn has been given 
t"o his claimed departmental assigmnents and claimed positions in each 
department •. Certain allowance has been made for faulty memory with 
consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception 
or whether the failure to recall a particular item of interest can logically 
be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind. There is, of course, no 
accurate standard of measurement which would permit a positive deter­
mination as to whether inability to recall certain details or events is 
actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot rec.all all past events 
or could be attributed to willful deception.
