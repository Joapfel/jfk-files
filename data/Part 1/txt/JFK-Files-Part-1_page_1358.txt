AMTRUNK Operation 
INTERIM WORKING DRAFT 14 February 1977 
1. It is possible that the AMTRUNK Operation might 
have been a political action operation run against the 
U.S.G./CIA. (See the separate memorandum on "Operations to 
Split the Castro Regime._") 
2. In. late 1962 or early 1963, press~re was exerted on 
CIA by Higher Authority (State Department and the White House) 
to consider a proposal for an on-island operation to split 
the CASTRO regime. The proposal was presented to Mr. HURWITCH, 
1 
the State Department Cuban Coordinator, by Tad SZULC (AMCAPE-1) 
of the New York Times. On 6 February 1963, Albert -C. DAVIES, 
(Lt. Col. on military detail to WH/4 - Cuba) met with SZULC 2 • 
at SZULC's residence, to discuss the plan. SZULC referred to 
it as the "Leonardo Plan." While at first hesitant, SZULC 
3 
finally revealed that Dr. Nestor MORENO (AMICE-27) was one of 
its prime originators. SZULC said that he first thought of 
bringing the plan to the attention of President KENNEDY~ as he 
had had a standing invitition, s~nce November 1961, for direct 
contact with President KENNEDY, Attorney General KENNEDY, or 
Mr. McGeorge BUNDY, on matters concerning Cuba. He decided 
against that approach, however, and instead determined to use 
the Cuban·coordinating Group. SZULC later said that George 
4 
VOLSKY (AMTRUNK-1) masterminded the plan, assisted by MORENO. 
It was agreed that CIA representatives would meet with SZULC 
and the two Leonardo planners, MORENO and VOLSKY, in Washington.
