areas were of special in.tereet· to the KljB. liOSENKO knew 
no KGB e~ployees who entered tha secure areas curing 
1960 or 1961 and had no personal contact with any of them. 
He did not remember any information that such KGB ccployees· 
ever repc rted to r,he KGB, except th.:i t Dmi tr iy I... KUKOLEV, 
an electrician .,.-hom he personally handled ii\ -19s~-l95S, 
had observed antenna wiring in the atticr the details or 
aignificance of the wiring were unknown to NOSE~;Ko as of 
1965. 
NOSENKO personally p~aced some reports by KGD agents 
in the Embassy security file while he had custodr of it. 
None o! the infcrmation, he said, was interesting, im- • 
portant, or useful enough for him to remember, and he 
c::iu.ld not name thP. • agent sources of the KG!3. In another 
context and at another tioe, however, ~OSENKO s~id he 
had r~cjll,i.Ved a rcpoz;t from s_one .agent (name unknown) 
that·there was a sign "Security Office" ca the office·· 
• door of John V. ABI DIAN, the r:mtiassy Security Officer.* 
NOSENKO did not study the En~assy secur~ty p:o-
cedures in detail and did not reme1r.ber ,..-hei.:e the classified 
trash was burned. He said that n0t.ning could be done with 
this infnrmation operaticnally, because the trash was al­
ways burned by a u.s. sergeant or a Marine guard ac­
cot:tpanied by an officer.•• 
The Er.lbassy office or floor where any section was 
located or any individual worked during the j'ears 1960 
and 1961 was not remo:cbered by ?~OSENKO. This reply was 
also given when he was asked about the roocs and floors 
for the officas of the arr.besaador, the political office=s, 
ABIDIA.~, and the code clerks.••• NOSENAO said that he 
ejthor knew these locations at the time he was Deputy 
Chief of the section or c~uld have found the~ in the 
in the monthly Embassy phone lists, tho KGB received these 
regularly fr~m agent source$, and the lists gave office
