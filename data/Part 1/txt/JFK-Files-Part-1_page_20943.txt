believe(,! that .this i,!)dfcatcs that CIIOADEl"-{ \\-:IS pretty much "under 
. R\1HX:K _control''. during this period. (Perhaps .t~·aining records ,, 
cari assist in f.inding ihform:i.tio·n on this Chilean period, as 
CHOADEN wont·to New York on one occasion" for a six-week trainillg 
course). 
4. The next. period of contract employment is also hazy. The 
····Oi)erat·ion in.which CHOADEN "·as. asked· ·to p·articipate turned out to 
bo PBSUCCESS. Some sort of c'o::itral:t was drawn up, but CIIOt\DEN 
·'does not ·recall if any deduction for retirement wns made, no1• of 
the terms of the contract. It is requested tfrnt this contract be 
reviewed an·d, should thero havo bee::i no retirement credit, thnt 
it too be rev.iewed for·possible conversion to creditnble service. 
There is no question o.f CHO..\DE~ "l·esponcling to RVROCK control" 
during this perio_d. ·It -v.·ns fUll time work, and most of lt per-
for1;ied nway from farilily---some of it in the .1unt:le. About sixty 
days , CIIOt\DEN recalls, was spent c:::::-:~...:,:;:::..-::::::::,, in Project 
PBHIST0RY. CII0ADEN w:is awarded an RVROCK '{leco1·at ion for bis worlt ».~,

5 0 AR, the res.ult of .his particip_ation in PRSUCCESS, CH0ADEN 
1o-as co::itracted·as a 'covert Assoc·1atc fro:.1 (abou·t; this is· a guess) 
Cktober, 1954 until Apr.il of 1955. CII0ADEN dintinctly recalls 
that this contract called f·or 1·otirc:nent credit if chosen as a 
future option. (It is not inpoosible that this contract was r.iado 
rctro:ictive to cover CHO\DE~•s di,p,,rture fro111 Chile in March, 1954.) 
It would bo appreciated if Rio would be advised of the exact dura­
tion and terms of· this contract: 
6. CHOADEN was~a-Staff E::iployeo ·from 1 April 1955 until 
13 July of 1958, when he resi~n·cd. Retirement payments for this 
period v.·ere returnk_t_q __ Cll0ADE~, and ho underst:i.nds thnt they must 
be repaid sometime before·retireme::it to make the period creditable. 
7. After resigning in 1953 CHO.\DEN went to Cuba and wit;1in a 
veek signed a contract---as an indcoendcnt operator and, to the 
best of CHOADEX's recollectio:1, \\ithout any retil·e111ent benefits. 
Asain, it is requested that tllis contract be reviewe~ with the 
view of possi_ble conve.rsion to creditable status. 
s. On M:ircb 14, 1960 CHO.-\DEX again became a Staff Employee, 
and has remained in that status. 
9. Des111te a 1·athe1· long tenure with RVROCK CHOA~'- now .finds 
tl::.at much of bis service is eithe1· not creditable, or is creditable 
and not paid. CHOADE~ would like to set this ·house in order, and 
to begin having regular de&Jctions from his salary begin building· 
up h"i.s paid-up creditable retireoent equities. Headquarters' 
nssiStance in arriving at •this happy s.tate would t>v appreciated. 
CEOAM:S iS especially interested irl obtaining approval for con­
version of tho early contract cays in Chilo. It seer.is apparent 
that 1f repayment into the retil·c:r.cnt system is to be initiated,
