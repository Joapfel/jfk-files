(c) InfOrt1'4tion from PREISFREUND 
CIA initially interviewed PF.EISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in 
Helsinki. (NOSENKO himself had suggested that PP.!:ISH.Etmo 
would confirm his story of the STOR.SBERG case.) Durir.g this . 
first meeting with him, PREISFREUND correctly identified photo­
graphs of KOVSIIUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG. He ::taintained, how­
ever, thdt his relatiorishi? with KOVSHUK and ~OSE!HW was strictly 
on a b~siness level, that he had never had anytqing to do ~ith 
the KGB, and that he did not know what the initials "KGB• stand 
for. TO'A'ard the end of this meeting, PREISFREU~D allowed th:lt 
. r.-~ ~'. ~ .-. •· 
he may ha~e been unwittingly involved in some~activity against 
STORSBERG and agreed to tell the "entire truth": the fcllo""'ing day. 
On 9 July 1965 PREISFREU~D described how he h3d been caught 
in a blackmarket op3raticn in Moscow and was, on this basis, re­
cruited by KOVSHUK "either at the end of 1959 or early 1960." 
Several weeks later, he said, he was approached by NOSE~KO who 
explair.ed that KOVSHUK was unavailable and thac the KGB wanted 
him, PREISFREUND, to arrange an introduction .between STORSBERG 
and a Soviet female, Irina, ci1e daughter of a Soviet general.* 
PREIS FREUND th<:?11 left Moscow, and when he retun1ed about two 
months later, he took STC?SBERG to ch~ Peking Resta~rant, ~here 
the introduction was effected. PrIBISFREU!m, ST0RSBERG, Irina, 
and ar.other girl the:n went to PREISFREUtlD' s hotel, .:here STORS­
BERG and Irina were inti~4te. 
PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly ':ertain 
his re=ruitment took place in early 1960, pro~ably in March or 
April. At the tim~ KOVSHLl< had refused to explain what the KGB 
wanted him to ao; he s~id only that they weuld talk about it 
later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to 
undertake anything detrimental to Finnish interests; nor did 
KOVSlfllK establish any means of comrnuni::ations with PREISFREUND, 
telling him only that the KGB would know where to find him. 
PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions, 
but no contacts were made. Just as he was beginning to believe 
that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at 
his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow. Asked tc explain his 
earlier statement th;:it NOSEHKO first met with him two ..,eeks 
after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember 
exactly how long it was, but that it was definitely on another 
trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later. 
PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG. He 
first replied that it had been at America House and recalle·d, 
that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim1" 
U was only with some difficulty that he finally managed to 
strike up an acquaintance at the bar. On second thought, PREIS­
FREUND said, he may have first met STORSBERG at the sauna in 
the Finni.sh Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint­
ance. Throughout this 'initial period, NOSEUKO and KOVSHUK made 
repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG to 
the Soviet female had been accomplished, there wculcl be no more 
demands made of PREISFREUND·by the KGB. PREISFREUND added: 
According to NOSENKO,. this was Irina LEBEOOVSKAYA, an 
agent of the U.S. Embassy Section who was. handled by A.V .. 
SUNTSOV.
