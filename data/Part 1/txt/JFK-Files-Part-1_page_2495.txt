During current interviews, NOSZNKO :"as repez.ted the same 
He s~ill i~ ... sists tl~at KOSOLAPOV 
was on the same trair ... wit!--/JEKNERJ ::::~om He:.si:;."lki. Collate1·al in.for-, ., 
mation raises difficulties here, l"lowever: Finnish train manifests 
L""ldicate thatlJENNE~ was the only ~oscow-bour..d passenger on fo.e 
:3ljMarch 1960 train from Finland to Moscow, and that one Viktor 
KOLOSSOV (a name NOSENKO has identified as an alia:1 used by 
KOSOLAPOV) was on the 2 April 1960 train to Moscow. 
The above obvious discrepancy ha.s net beer ... and cannot be ciari-
-- fied with available information. KOSQLAPOV (KOLOSSOV) was ei::1.e:-
r ·- - -', 
on the same train as ~_JENNE~; or he was not. Train ma:..1.ifests indicate 
that KOSOLAPOV wa.s not. Nevertheless, the 11 boy and girl, probably 
university students" who, according to(JENKER"; struck up a conver-
sation with him on the train would appear clearly to be part of the 
operational effort described by NOSENKO, particularly in view of the 
later approach of this same girl to [JENNER; at the airport. There is 
no reason to question that fr.is girl was the female ager...t of GR YAZNOV. 
L7. view of the conflict between the train manifest and statements by 
NOSENKO, however, it is not clear who the "boy student" was: whefaer 
this somehow was KOSOLAPOV, or whet:"ler it may have been so:.:e 
other person entirely. 00011so
