1. Introduction 
NOSENKO·claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the u.s. 
F.mbassy Section of the .American Department, KGB. Second c.hief 
Directorate, from sometime in January 1960 unti.l the first days 
of January 1962.* This section. in his words, was working· 
against "the most important counterintelligence target in the 
Soviet Union,•· the permanent A;nerican representation in Moscow. 
It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy 
and, simultar.eously, as a target for eventual compromise and 
recruitment. 
The functions of the u.s. Embassy Section were described by 
NOSEt;Ko as being, first, to control all contacts by Embassy per-
·sonnel with Soviet citizens: second, to.evaluate information 
collected from all possible sources on 1'.re"!rican Embassy employees, 
and 1:hird,. to use this· inforn:ation as a basis for planning and 
carrying out recruitment appr0aches. The Americans' personal­
ities, jobs, personal relationships, weaknesses, daily routi~es, 
security precautions, contacts with.Soviet citizens, and the 
major and minor sc.:indal.3 in their Moscow lives formed the basis 
• for this ·..rork. To gather such inforll\ation, t:.he section's officers 
directed and debriefed large numbers of agents and informant9, 
including the indigenous employees of the Embaasy, Soviet citizens 
moving in Embassy social circles, and third~country nationals with 
lllnerican contacts: the officers also assigned tasks to and assim­
ilated the report·s from the numerous surveillance teams at their. 
disposal, and they read and tri.ed to exploit materials from tele­
phone taps and microphones placed in the offices and homes of 
the Americans. Each officer had a limited n•.1.-nber of American 
- targets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with ., ach: 
annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit 
the knowledge they had gained of their.target. During 1960 and 
1961, NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within thP. section 
on "identifyir.g intelligence officers at the E:nbassy and active 
development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed 
and painstaking study of code clerks, creating th~ conditions on 
the basis of which they can be recruited." 
As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had 
access to all information concerning its activities: "Nothing 
was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed certainty 
that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans 
associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the 
Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this 
period, and that, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American 
Embassy personnel since "ANDREY."** From continuing friendships 
with his fellow-officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also 
claimed certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the 
time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964 
trip to Geneva. • 
* In de~iefing and int~rrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-
• ular emphasis on his activities during the period January . 
1960 to January 1962, ·since this information was of special 
importance to u~s. Government security~
