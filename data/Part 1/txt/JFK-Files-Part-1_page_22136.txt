in addition, it ~a3 dl~~t this time that the a~~nt c2=e icto con-
tact with KCTf,?-; NOSE::;m learn':::d from BARKOVSKIY th3t KOTEN 
"used to go to sorr:e

ir. th1s st.ory whom KOTE:l knows, he ooca.~e 
agent. wto also used to go to t~is store. 
to rneet. with the agent witt:out the saleslady." 
On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Di·re::torate 
suspected tnat KOTEli l1acl bce:n directed specifically to this store 
in order to meet and ··work on" the agent and that, having learned 
that the agent. had relat1ves "in St.antsiya Loo, al:,out 17 kilo­
meters from Sochi .. , he had evidently received the assig:..-r.ent 
(to visit the relative~) from A~erican Intelligence. Evidently 
they had gotten on the t.rail of this agent and ,,:ere checking on 
him." The KGB also had suspicions concerning the relatives, 
former kulaks who were still w~ll-off financially. It was kno-.m 
to the KGB, for example, that. the agent had written his sister 
in Stantsiya Loo that h~ want.ed to return to the Soviet Union, 
end she had replied: "Is there any sense in your co:nir.g here?" 
KOTEN arrive<l in Moscow and th~n travelled to Sochi. Fror!\ 
there he sent a tel~gram to the agent's sister and her husband 
in· Stontsiya Loo, asking t~em to coMe to Sochi to sec him. When 
they arrived at KOTEl') • s hotel.· however, the hotel ad.--:ii:.'listretor 
told them th.it i-:oTEN was on an excurs1.on ar.d refused to allo·..-
""°' a meeting. KOT:E?l then t.-,ok it upor. himself to travel to Stant­
siya Loo where he eventually contacted and spoke to the rela­
tives. In the course of. this m~eting KOT:E:i took photographs 
of the sister ar:d her husba~d ar.d recorded a message from the 
sister· to the agent on a tape rf~.:order he had brought along. 
From this the KGB deduced that "U.S. Int.~lligence wants to get 
documentary data" and 1 t therefore decided to "try to get l-.old 
of l<OTEN." 
There had already 'been some indication during KOT~•s 
earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual, but the 
XGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed to be a 
loyal Communist Party member. With these recent developments, 
the situation had no·..- changed. Although NCS~o 's superiors 
were absent from KGB Headquarters at the time, immediate action 
·, • • vas required. NOSENK~ consequently "took the whole thing on·
