intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV•s 
activities and con ta.eta at the Institute. Huwovor, Subject said 
that a_s far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to -himself 
. . . 
at the Instit_ute .. and did not have any partlcuhr friends there 
wh-om Subjec~ knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes 
, open £or the type or thing I was looking for, howover, a~ -would 
let ~e- .know it'_ he came onto anything interesting. Subject als~ 
_ ottered to "play up 'to" GAZlffl and/or LOG;NOV under .my guidance 
it I wished, but I decline·d the offer 'With appropriate expressions 
or a pprecbtiori. 
19. The. ·questior. that renains unans,1ored after all this is, -
or course, why LOOINOV and GAZIYEV_ were talking about Subject 
. . 
ove:- the phone. on 21,. April 1967. According to Subject, the 
di~er which LOGINOV attended took place in ~tarch 1967, while 
LOGINOV did no~ attend OAZIYEV•s second dinner, \\hich took 
place about mid-1-tay. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the 
truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which L0GINOV . . . 
told GAZIYEV on 24· April he wished .to discuss with GAZIYEV_ 
concerned ho:w to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV­
Subjec·t enc9unter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on 
_ 24 Aprii, it woqld appear that it was fir.ally decided that . . 
GAZIYEV and his wit'e should simply have Subject and his wife 
over to a peaceful diMer in order to at least partially erase -
the memory or the fir-et dinner.
