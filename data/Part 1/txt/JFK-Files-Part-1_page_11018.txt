1. Since ~id-February 1963 Xexican immigration authorit 
placed stamps in the passports of travellers to and 
which read "Arrived from Cu~a" and "Left for Cufa". 
stamps are placed on the page with the picture. 
2. All requests for Mexican tourist visas in Cuba approved 
in Mexico before they are issued in Habana.2 
Field Comments 
1. Cuban visas are often issued on a separate piece 
and not stamped in the passport, so that the pass 
would not show that the bearer had travelled to 
2. This regulation was first noticed in February 196 
Documentation for travel from Mexico to Cuba does not 
from that needed for travel to other Latin American c 
The traveller must have a passport or other travel do 
with a valid visa. Mexican citizens within the speci 
age group must also c_arry a cart i 11 a mi 1 it ar. 
Mexican security services do not screen applications 
to Cuba. Although the Mexican Government has taken n 
to prevent travel to Cuba, it has discouraged governme 
employees from accepting invitations to Cuban-sponsore 
activities. It also appears to want to avoid recognit 
Cuban Government activities by not sending government­
delegations. These steps, plus the bothersome baggage 
photographs, and questioning by Mexican immigration au 
have probably curtailed travel to Cuba.
