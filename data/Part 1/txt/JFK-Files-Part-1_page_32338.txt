All thio had to be accc-:::plished with great regard to security because of 
the ·sensitive position occupied by the agent. Subject's performance has been 
effective and, given the operation's importance, cnn really be called outstanding. 
The agent is again a prime"source c-n the radical sector of the government, which is 
cruc~al to developments locally. 
Furth~r, this officer continues to manage an outside principal agent who in 
turn handles leftists, Communist Party and press placement assets, so directing these 
efforts that they contribute effectively to overall Station objectives. Hore 
recently, Subject has ~aken over the unilateral deployment of a new audio operation 
targetteJ against a senior local Co=unist Party official and is carrying it through 
successCully. Thia officer-also handles much of the support requirements for his 
various operatic-ns, including'manase~ent of safehouse keepers, overseeing a small 
surveillance team, and acquisition of rental cars and property in alias. There is 
little doubt that s~me of Subject's success can be attributed to his Latin backgroua/ 
and fluent Spanish. But both of these advantages might be wasted by a less capable 
all~round officer. In his case·, they provide him with complementary skills that 
. enhance his superior performance.· In the view of the reporting officer, Subject ' 
carries more than his own share here 1~ Lima in a manner normally calling for an 
officer of ccasiderably more senior grade and experience. •
