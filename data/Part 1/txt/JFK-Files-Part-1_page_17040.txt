SUBJECT: Renewal of Project KDFACTOR 
in 1972 for $19,000 
in 1973 for $20,000 
1. This project covers photo and visual surveiliance 
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Oue observation 
post c~vers the froµt gate of the building.and another 
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried 
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back. An 
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of 
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings 
with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed 
inside the Station. 
2. The production from this operation has consis­

Soviet Embassy in 1962. 
3. This seemingly straightforward operation has not 
always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in 
operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than 
a dozen years. At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife 
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now­
terminated principal agent was divorced seve1·al years 
. ago froci··a· wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some 
desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for 
years was supposed .to be developing the films was simply 
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by 
his unclear.ed secretary. Family relationships keep 
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All 
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We
