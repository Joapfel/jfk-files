A. QlLBCJJr!/1 (Q) gives the conv-' ... !1cing i.l!lpression that he is at ha:ie 
in his new work. Ee r~s~onds ~ell to ~u~-~stions &."ld inst.ruction3, adds 
~uge"'stions of his own l'or i=p:-oving the ;::lan-- an indication t.hat he 
,d.shes to ;,lease. In the begi::.ine he shoved a tenaency to rai.$e i:dnor 
obJect!.Oll3 involving personal ~ter:i.al p:-oblems (e. -~., inconvi;;nience to 
family life o .. • a lone tdy) but less of t:-d.;; was rer:iarked a3 he ca:.l'l to 
realize that require!:lents '1-,'llre to be reasonable and he was to be treated 
as a lE;man bein~ with his O"'r.'!l ;iroblems. 
He has stated that he ~oul.d not e~ntinue his present involvement 
with target personalities &.'ld in3tituticr._s if it were not that -.re vi.;h 
him to, i.e., his cr,zn inclir..ation would te to wi tb:i.raw ,·rom the political 
fringe. ?.odigast feels that ttis is consistent 'Id.th his background, 
...-hich -was not a !)arty career; i.'l his youth he wa3 willfully apolitical 
e.nd hostile to the 11 ::-.ove:nent"; l:it.ar hi!! ""~s involved i.-. o~po;:;ing part.y­
people in his ?,ew York work; :...'l Paris he didn 1t get alone wi k r.13 party 
friends (the affair of the forged letter) and oi course broke with the 
magazir..e crowd there. 
He see;ns to be genuinely camnitted to working against eria.:ni.es 
of CDY .... ~, ready to accept eve:: de~per COC!::it:r.ent; he ha:i expressed 
no reservations as to what he 'ld.11. do. He doesn I t object to report:L'lg 
on old :·riends, fello·.1 ::B?R.Tif.:...:~, e., al. He rai:;ed no objection to 
FWTTZ..1., or using s/w techni.q::es (,•1hich he took with hi;;i on a. trip to what 
-was the::1 a very hostile area, ...-!:ere he had kncr.,n ene:nies, and '1-:1:-ere

B. Rodigast 1s kno""Ld;e of Q•s a:-.itude in t-he months prior to· 
recrui~ent (Ju."le 1965) is li::::.ted. itodigast has the lllpression :;; had 
sic.ply reached the end of his ro~-- he bad nowhere to eo, he ha.d 
earlier decided that he would ille to wor:C £or or at least c.:,o"D";rate with 
ODYO~ (althoueh earlier atte::rpts to make contact met with no ~uccess)' • 
. The hU!ilc-'le treatoent received at the hands o.i' his recruiter, the 
subsequent sympathetic handlin:.; by his case officer, undoubtedly 
convinced b:i.r.i that he had not r.a.de a mistake. 
The mater...al factor is not to be underestiDated. 
The de!lOralizing position of livi_n~ on hi.3 vii'e and worse, on her fa;:dly, 
must have lowered his resistance to any- possible alternative. Rodigast 
simply coesn•t kno-,1 how Q might have respcoied. to a reasonable offer 
fran encles of ODYO?C:: at that ,:,-:,int. The prospect o;: immediate engagement 
at. a decent wage cay have been cecisive. 
Since that tiI:le, Rodiga.st feels Q •s motivation has been reinforced 
and pcrl'»;.;; considerably alter&J.: he has been asked to do obviou~ 
necessa?7 t.Mks ,and so he can r~1 he is needed by someone; he has been 
given Na:;onable instructions on how to acc:o;:-lish them; he sees that 
others are concerned for his pe::3~nal safety- and material wellbeL."!g. 
Bod.iga.st bas taken pains to avo:.:i giving t.he i."!lpression that there was 
&nJ' confusion or error or diffe:-e:ice of vitri,:'."Oint in running the :;:-roject 
(even at a time when there were ~'lnty- of all. th...--ee); such problcs were
