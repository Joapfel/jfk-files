' •• You may recnl 1 th:-it, in mid-i,lay this year, the Communist Cuban --
Chargo d'Aff~ircs in Athens, Jose Luis Galb~, was the object of world -
llttention -.ftcr he :,hot :-i Greek bus driver over a trivial traffic argu­
ment nenr· t.he town of Thermopylae. Newsp:1pcrs throughout the world cai: 
rind the story nnd it would not be exaggerated to label the incident as 
lln intcrn11tionnl ncnndnl -one which m11y be snid to have damaged Hellen­
ic dignity to tho :wme extent to ,,hich the Castro regime ignore3 ·it by 
nccrcditing enng~tcr~ such as Galbe as its diplollllltic repreaentativeo -
bef9re the Greek people."

. "On that occ.einion, wo wrote the Greek government crilling their at­
tention to ti1e neod to save the hcnor of Greece by severing all tic:3 -­
diplom:itic r,nd • commercial-- with the Rod governm'?nt of Cuba. At that -
time', we W1lrncd th,'.lt the. gangster Galbe \-/Qj ty11ical of the new promotion 
of Red Cuban "diplomats" --mostly undesir;1ble Communists trained toJe.£ 
form tn::iks of c!,pionngo and ngitation-- /l!ld sub:.itantiated our asser on 
with n quote from Udon Alvarez-de la Cnmpa, a defecting Cuban diplomat­
who had chnrgod Galbe by name during a pra:is conference in Madrid." 
"Todny, two new defections from the Cuban Foreign Service prompt us 
to re-open the Galbe case. \,e refer to those of Mssrs. Gilberto H. Ale 
many Vilnr, until recently, Trade Counoel~r to the Cuban Emba3sy in To= 
kyol and Luis Ric~rdo Alonso-Fernandez, until recently, Cuban Ambassada­
to uroat Bri~ain.' 
"Doth former diplom..,ts had always been rcg1irded a5 competer.t, ser! 
ous men even by us, the relentless opposer~ of the Castro-~ommunist ty­
ranny. Deforf.l he took office :1s Cuban ,\mbassador .to the United hingdom 
in 196), Luis R. Alonso Fer·nnndez had also performed ambassadorial du -
ties in Fcru and Norway. A scholarly, well-mannered man, he is well re 
membered by nll who knew him in his d1rlom:itic office even if they may 
h~ve dis~pproved of the totalitarian r~gime that ·he r;presented. tven­
tually, he bocamc disenchanted with Cor.m:uni5m and publicly resigned his 
post in London only A few days ago. ( In connection with 11,r. Alonso's re 
signation, the Greek newspaper "Vradyni" in its September 6 issue won 
ders precisely why Red Cuban Ambassador Galbe has not been ousted yet)°;' 
"Gilberto R. Alemany, an e(!ually Able and well-bred ·trade si:ecia -
list! ~eld his Counselor's position for three years· in Tokyo. His re -
cognition of the true nature of the Rej Cuban government led him to de­
fect secretly nnd become our own secret agent in Japan. Late last mon­
th, after fulfilling.his dAngerous mission, he mde hi5 feelings public in Miami." 
"As you can see, those decent pe~rle, who are still active in Cas­
tro's diplomatic corps c~nnot stand :it for a long time. 'I'hese new de­
fections show that the few that rerr.a~ n are abAndoning the sinking ship 
to t·he "new wave" of Castroite diplor,ats --gangsters, spies and agita.;, 
tors in Galbe's fashion." 
"But there 15 more: shortly afte·· his defection, in An interview -
-with a leading Miami newspaper, f.1r. ,.len:any made statements that con-­
firm our assertions to this respect. Tne following nre quotes from -
