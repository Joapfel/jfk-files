So I think that it 18 pertectl,y possible -to debato on this point. I 
do not thiruc that the policy should be to eet out a public thsai1J, and even 
lee" a public polemic. I do not think that it is part.lcularl,y important 
to the etl'U&gle tM.t the the.or., of the tour clABH8_ NI uphold publicly. I 
do not think thll~ nnyooo rill be d1sAppo1nted to BEIE' that 1n this country 
there 1B a paaBDntry or a proletariat so radical 4nd so onlightenE:d that

I lQj\ ~so fully c~nvinc:ed that th!I national bo~oisto hoa no revolu­

And that it doea not depend on the theories propoaed or tha thinking of Gue1·ra

that ia a fact, and facta are abovu all elao. And I think thst the IIKC!lilnt
