SUB.JICT: Meeting with AMLASH-1 in Paris, 
31 January to 3 February 1965 
15 February 1965 
1. Am.ASH-1 returned fro• Rolll9 to Paris oa 31 Jan 1985 
and was ut for a very brief rneetiag the same night by ONTRICH 
in order to arrange a meeting for the following day. The 
following subjects were discussed at the two meetings on 1 and 
2 Februal')' 1965: 
a. The primary reason tor again meeting Alll..ASB-1 
before bio planned return to Cuba was to brief him on the 
security implications involved in the infiltration and 
poulble capture of Modesto Orlando Orozco Basulto AKA 
Bebo Orozco, who lnfilt1·ated into Cuba on 21 Dec 1964. 
Orozco, according to bis de, went to Cuba to rescue Jose 
Vaaquez,Merey ·and three otbors·who were biding in the. 
home of a woman named Gloria Cabrera, who lived at Ko. 72 
27th Street, between N & O, Apartment 3, Vedado, Havana. 
Oroaco'a capture, if he bas been captured, presents an 
indirect threat to the security of AMLASB-1 and a nore 
direct threat to the security of AMTRUh'K-10 since Orozco 
in Jan 1964 exflltrated throudlthe rat line established 
by AKICE-14 (Miguelito). Upon bis return to Cuba, 
AIILASJl-1 will check the above with AMTRUNK-10; and, if 
Orozco is under the control of the security service, will 
decide and colillll\lnicate with W.lllli whether AKLASH-1 ac~ 
AMTRUMK-10 believe it necessary to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-10. 
AllLASB-1 was briefed to &e.od a letter to UNSNAFU-9 to' 
indicate whether Orozco has been arrested or whether be ls 
still ln hiding. If. the letter to UNSNAFU-9 mentions a 
good aDd pleasant return trip, this will mean that Orozco 
la not under the control of tbe security &enlce. If the 
letter talks abou~ long, tirint trip, tbla will indicate 
tbat Orozco bas been arrested. AKLASH-1 wae also requested 
to send a report on the above and any coaplication&AJrbicb 
ban developed or say develop froa Oroaco•a in.filtration. 
b. AJILASB-1 suggested that bis nom de guerre "Charles," 
which we have been uaing for tbe-paat three yeara, be 
changed to "Gerardo."
