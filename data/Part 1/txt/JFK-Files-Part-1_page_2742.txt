security.

to the First [American Embassy] Section by the 
Operational Technical Directorate, KGB, based on

responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he had 
access to and was obliged to keep current on all information 
relating to the section's activities. On this basis he 
has assured his questioners that the KGB was 'completely 
•· unsuccessful in its attempts to recruit Americans assigned 
to the Embassy in these two years. NOSENKO has also said 
at various times that his access to section files and his 
association with section officers made it certain that 
there were no such KGB successes even in the periods
