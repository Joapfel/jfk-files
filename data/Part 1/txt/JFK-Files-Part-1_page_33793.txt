SUBJECTt ll~t.ional O>rr.mi.ttee for a Free Europe 
l. I am naturally disturbed by the report which has reached 
me as to your attitude on the ::ational Cb111mittee for a Free Europe, 
as expressed to the Inspector General at a meetine la:;t week 'Which 
I wa3 unable to attend because of absence from the city. 
2. This att.itudo, as described to me, was that you knew very 
little ,ibout NCFE but that you h::d the general impression t.:iat it 
was rather loosely handled from an adr.tl.nistrati:ve and policy control 
standpoint. I do· not wish to go into the h.1..stcry of NCF'E control b:, 
ClA and be accused of castine aspersions on its i:landlir.e in the past. 
I do think, however, that your allegat.ions may i;-, correct so far as 
the past is concerned·. 
J. As of the present, however, I want you to know that 
Mr. Durkee and I, with very able assistanca from m1Jmbers or 
!fr. Durkee-• s staff, are doing our level best to sP.t up agreed upon 
procedures for administrative, financial and policy control and 
reµortine. With U1a best objectivity I can r.1uster, I t.'link that 
your responsibility over the Nat.ional O,lll!littoe for a Free Europe 
is now being ably discha~ged, 
4• I would like at your convenience to eo over U1e new 
arra.'1gements mat have been raado ,md ~ brine you co1c.pletoly up 
to date on the activities of fae 0>111ni. t tee, as well as to i;et your 
instructions as to a syste.n of maklng such periodic reports to you 
in the future. This briefing r.:.ght well take t.',e for:n of a prelim­
inary bud{:et review and I s~cost that the di.vim.on heads of !IC?:: 
zd.ght be broUF,ht dow to IULke proerese reports to you in the briefing

conversant with tile present arrangements and activities 'Jf the
