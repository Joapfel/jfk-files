11. (Item u; I have finally figured out Purfey 1 s lflB8t Pointer. 
Du.ring o~ of our initial conversatio:-..s I facetiously remarked, in 
reaponae w types he was looking f~, that what he .anted was a rod, 
..tiite.and blua ~o. a graduate of 111ast Point, who is now in the 
export-!J:lport business dealing with Africa. 
12. (Item 14) I toli:'! Furfey on SatuZ'day that the local OS 
people are and have been in contact vitil the LAPO and the Sheriff 1 s 
Offioe on militant matters, that the OS people are known as Agency, 
that 00 isl reporting wh&t.eY&r they leun. and for us to involve our­
selves vould be confusing and duplicative. If Furfey wants to know 
llhat OS is getting, tell hiJI! to contact Ralph True in Headquarters/OS. 
Furfer~ might "811t to consider having t-..i.s req,.1irements levied on OS. 
13. (Item 1.5) Beske reports nothing new, and not likely to be 
anytbi.nlJ soon on the Connover-<::larke affair. Connover has changed 
jobs and is too busy to do IINCh. 
14. (Item 16) 
bat be doubts it. 
Beske reports Gonsales aay have somet.'li.ng on v.B. 
Be will check. 
1s. (Item 17) I told Furfey that I do not want to get 1n­
wlved. in.any activity that would put us in the position of being 
· accused of ·investigating militants. wa are on thin ice as it is. 
'lbarefore, DeVIUIOD will not be asked to follow up on •eompton• 
· contects and we will depend on OS polioa contacts. ••
