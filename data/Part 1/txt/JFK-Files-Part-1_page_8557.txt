• S~bject has recently had some deali~gs with IVANOV (P-1612) who 
ts ,furious for the following reason: Formerly so,•iots leaving Mexico 
•••• \'iotild ta,ke KUI or Sab;¾na to_ Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot 
l.he following day. KLM and Sabt>na w_ould pay overnight hotel costs. 
Now, however, the So"liets are picking up Aeroflot in New York. 
~cause of scheduling,. however, they still must spend at least one 
n_ight in New York. The airlines wHl not pay this and IVANOV wanted 
~ubject to cover it. Subject refused-- for the very sound reason that 
jt did not raake sense for him to pay $20 for sellinc a $127 ticket· 
-· Jr9m._wbich his profit was only $9. IVANOV became furious and St:bject 
• y,ielded' by_ agreeing to pay for ·IVA!lOV's accommodations and he said he 
would do it for thosebecoralng ns friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but 
be would not do it as a general rule. While Subject was away; 
howe\'er, his wife wen.t overboard aud got IVANOV four rooms --(for two 
~ople) •.. Now Si!!Jject is fU;rious. • 
On 31 July Subjecf was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came 
in carrying a ::?py o·f Pravda or Izvestiya. Subject quote<! the old 
sa~, '. ''Th.ere Js no truth in.Pravda and rio news in Izvestiya," and 
PRIKHPDKO got mad claiming Subject wa3 acting very unfriendly by 
making ant!-Soviet propaganda, PRIKHODKO was very serious. _ This is 
proba.bly as good and as accur11 te a th1f:nl>nail sketch on P.RIKHODKO that

Septe9ber / -bad visited Subject to find c.,ut what Subject knew about 
a congress of _.Jewis:i intellectuals· which ·is to b(' held in iilid-~eptember
