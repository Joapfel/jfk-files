Question: Tell me about the ,?CCasions "'hen you ...,"!r& with GRIBANOV 
an:i ';ARABRIU. 
NOSEUKO: Three timee;--drinking in cafes. Twice afcen.ards thera. 
were girls. The most recent time wan in Septer.-.ber or 
October 1963. I don't remeribe.r th~ Hrr;t time.. in 
1963 I received a call from Tl,RAilltI!! ,,t home. ·· .Then 
GRIBA.~OV got on the phone and told ~c to take his car 
and cc:ne join them at the Prag a Re:staur:ir.t. I didn' .t • 
take his car because I didn't ~ant tc c~ll the duty­
officer. I took a cab and went to th~ ~raga. They 
were sitting there and drinking in a ?ri vate room. I 
joined them. They were drinking chnrnpaqno, but I took 
cogn_ac. Tl,RABRU! sugc;e!.:ted girls about. 1230 ar.d GRIBAN·ov 
made ~ego to che office to get my nuL~book. I called 
one girl I knew--her and ·her sister. ~n:~n· I got b.ack 
to the restc:.urant it was closed with onl 1• GRIBANOV and 
T}.?~BRIN still there. Wl• wE:nt to the •:1irls' (apartment). 
They w~rcn't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before. 
Questio~: Is this why GRIBANOV called you co the rcstaurar,t (i.e., 
to provide girls)? 
nosENKO: I think so. It was the second time I had participated 
in this. This last time C:RIBANOV told the girl his 
name. The girl works in the Archives o! the First Chief 
Directorate. At that time of night I ~a~n•t able to 
rea.::h anyone else. Iler name is Gal in,1 ~tikhaylovna. 
Her mother works in the Central Committee. I don't 
remember her last nam~. GRIBh?;ov was drinking and she 
told him that she had quarreled with Z,WTSEV, the Chief 
of the First Chief Directorate Archives. GRIBANOV 
told her that he would give.her a job and told me to 
arrange for a job in the American Department of the 
Second Chief Directorate for her. Galind'S flat is in 
the building inhabited by Central Co:nmittee·workers on 
Kutuzovskiy Prospekt. GRIBANOV's ariver drove him 
home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830. 
. 3 March 1965: Speaking of the damage his disclosures must 
have caused the KGB, NOSENKO said: •1 believe th~y will punish 
people in the Second Chief Directorate (SCD] ... Even GRIBANOV .•. 
He was personally responsible, as head of the SCP, for pushing 
me ahead.• 
NOSENJCO: Even firing. 
Question: Do you think any others would be. puni~hed, or even 
fired? 
Maybe KOVALENKO, BOBKOV,.and·people in the Eleventh 
Depart!l\ent. Many otherl[J-, .. too.
