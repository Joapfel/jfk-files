. J.! As al_read\· indicated,' it seems to·rne tl~at .there are no serious 
problems· invoh.-ed '.~ any··o( tl-ie fore1toing and thM the -materi~l can be·,·. 
·rr.\dil)· cut to Ht the-p,lttern. It is the recomn1t-~d.uion o{-Mr. Barnes in 
which I concur, th;lt Mr. Lange,:in be _assigned t~ the PP Sta{{ during his 
tO',lr o{ duty here. He could in this capacity ""-'rk ,·ery closely.with WH 
:b1vlsion, but it .s~-e~s to ·Tracy. a'nd inyself that 'he can contribute importantl)· 
to the work of the PP Sta{{ and in· the process b.r~den himself. As regards 
the m.ttter o{ the lcctures, I·would recommend· t:\a:t arrangements be -made 
to 'pe_rmit and e,.·e_n encourage him to continue th~se sin~e it' seems to me 
th,lt they would fit ·in very w·ell with his general PP assignment -- assuming. of 
course, that his H~adquarters. and field cover are properly designed and main­
tained. Tiie Headquarters con~r--problem is not II s11bstanti.1i one and as {ar: 
ae the field ia concerned i{ Mr. Langevin were to go Wtder nor.-o{{icial cover 
o{ t!,e ri~ht kind this also should present no proble:n. There is a ready-
made cover in the field and iil·a cr_itically important count~y by virtue o{ 
hi!J ownership -- for some :.ix ya,·us -- o{ a new;;p-aper in Santiago. It 
would not be incompatible with his resumption of hi:t position a11 owner and 
~dit_or o{ the Santiaso n_ewspapaer, to work in an annual se~ies of lectures 
either fn Latin Amerka or in the United States. There is·_only or.c further 
poitlt involved in connection with the lectures: Be-cause of Mr. Langevin'& 
intimate association ,vith many o{ the details of PBSUCCESS and also in 
. light of the standins: ·rules 0£ the Agency, it would be desirable for him to 
submit at laast in general outlines, and preferat>l)· textually to the extent 
!c,uibl._., the substance o{ his p:-o~osed lectures. He is anxious to do this 
in· connection with the for.thcoming lectures -· for his own piece of mind 
since he would like to be double.checked on.th~ 1:-:ings which he shoulrt say-
and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan developm1t.-:t. 
l!c could and in the material to Mr, Holcomb C\r myself -- or to you -- and 
aflt!r it has been checked over by one o{ us, we could arrange to submit it 
to t:1e Office of Security fer such further checking as may be desirable. 
4. Mr. Lange,·in proposes to take a lea\"e of absence of a month or 
six wee-ks, starting within the n.-xt few days. 1 l>eheve lt would be 
dt!sirable for Mr. Baker, to sLi.rt the necessal)· personnel and other admin­
istrative actions, includir.g any additional se,urit}· clearances which may
