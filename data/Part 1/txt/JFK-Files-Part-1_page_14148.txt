Headquarters Action Requested 
7. To summarize, it is .nl'WA\IE1 s view that HUNKELER's only actual 
potential \1llue to WOFAC'f is as a support agent to Wll Division as a 
whole, in.supplying unofficial cover and possibly in Rpotting, develop­
l.1i(, r..i1c..l·1(;c::..·ultiilb u~,llJ~i"i0N am,,.:t3. His value to operations of .nl'WAVE 
Station itself will be non-existent or minimal, since there is ~ttle 
IIUSKELER can do for that Station which cannot be accomplished more 
easily by a staff employee. Therefore, it is requested that Head­
quarters review this case and comment as soon as possible. The 
alternatives are: 
a. Renewal of contract as it is at present salary of $3600 
per ann\DD. 
b. Terminate. HUNKELER has advised that he is not prepared 
to accept a salary under his.present level. It is suggested that the 
following representative memoranda also be read in this connection:

1967 _by his present Case Officer, Jeremy F. GEDLAND. After an object­
ive and frank discussion, HUNKELER requested that he be permitted an
