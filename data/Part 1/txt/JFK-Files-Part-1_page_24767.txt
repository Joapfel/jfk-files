Action Bequired: FYI 
1. On 15 July after leaving a local publisher's office 
DULINDEM-11 drove Nikolay S. Leonov to l~s hotol. DULAUREL-1 wbo 
accompanied them to the publisher's office was left at her boma 
and DULINDEN-11 and Leonov were alone during the course of the drive. 
Leonov proceeded to ask DULINDEH-11 varioun questions about'his 
private life including his economic situation and also queried bia 
about his future goals in life. DULIND~-11 responded to. all 
questions and said he enjoyod his work with DULAU.REL-1 ond was 
interested in journalism and felt that be had learned quite ·a bit 
in the short time he b..as been iovolved.Jn assisting DULAUREL~l 
with Panorama Intornncional. Ho said that be did not work witb 
DULAUllEL-1 for money nlone but because he saw this as an oppor­
tuoity to improve him&elf which would eventually lead to an 1=;,rove­
meot in his oco·nomic standard. DUl.IMD.EN-11 ssi.d that it was. a 
relaxed conversation, Leonov was very friendly and appeared to be 
interested in DULINDE?i-11 's goals and aspirations. , 
2. On 16 July DULINDEN'-11 saw DULAWU:L-1 am the latter: a$kPd 
him how bis convorsation wont witb Leonov. DULINDXN-11 gave: • 
DULAURXL-1 a summary of what had been discussed and commented that 
Leonov appeared to have a genuine interest .in his future. DUUUREL-1 
then told DULINDEM-11 that previously sbe bad .a rather lengthy 
conversation with Leonov about DULIHDEN-11 and told Leonov tbe 
problems he bad with the party, th,:, accusations made against -hia, 
her conversations with DULINDEM-11 during this period and the 
investigation she had conducted whtlo DULINDEll-11 was under party 
control. - Leonov told DVLAUREL-1 the fact that DULI.NDEN-11 was 
under party control is of no signif.icance and once again re-iterated 
his general disgust with the party leadership.
