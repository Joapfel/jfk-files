On t.·he several operations agcinst m1l1t:ary code clerks 
which N0.5:l.KO has described and in wh1::h he has claimec! a 
personal role, his greatest detail a~d emp~as1s has been given 
to the case of Ja.-nes Harry 3TORSBER,:;, In 196.2 NOSUiKO said • 
that, ir. line with GRH;k.-.:Ov' s instru.::tions that he pay parti­
cular attention t.o code clerit operat.ior.s, he de•:oted rr.ost of 
his tirr,e for almost a year to t.he S'X>i1.SiiERG oper::ition, a.nc! 
played a personal role in the unsuccessful KG5 approach: he 
described in the f1r~t~erson his conversatior. wit:h STCRSaERG. 
During fr.e 19o°4 to 1966 p°;rio:'l, l~CSE:iKO denJ.td not or.17 that 
he had pe-rsonally participaLed in this ~ay but also t.ha~ he 
had ever claimed to havE:- ~cne: 'he continued to say, however, 
that he s~pervis,:;o the ope:at1on from beginni~g to en1. k­

the basis of his fin~ncial need, ;:;ut he tejected tl-,e Y.GB bid 
and thE: cneratior,. -was over. NOS~!,KO was certain that Si'ORS­
BERG had ~ot reported the approach and said that the KGB would 
use this fact as an addit1o~il elencnt of pce~sure sho~ld 
STORSBE.~~ again te pobted outside the United States. NOSENXO 
also kr.e. that GCLITSYN had reported t.o CIA cor.cerning KGB 
modus operandi in this case as well as P~EISFREUND's part in 
it.

A second iteo from GOLITSYN may also relate to the STORS­
BERG operation': GCLITSYN told·: of learning in t.he. SpI ir.g of 
1960 tt,at the KGB had de· .. eloped a milic.aiy code clerk in Mos-· 
cow to·the point that recruitment was ~irtually assured. Ac­
cording to U.S. Army records, only two oilitary code clerks 
were stationed there at that time, STORSBERG and his superior 
William--S. nURLEY, the military co:nmunications officer who 
additio~ally performed crypt.Qgr.aphic duties. NOSENKO has 
said that there ...-as no KGB ·operation against HURLEY. and 
·HURL~ has reported no approach •
