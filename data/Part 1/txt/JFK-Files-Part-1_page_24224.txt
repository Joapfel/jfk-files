1. We are manifesting reports and correspondence concerning QREOONY/1 's nev 
contact, carole Pina, an AJ:ierican, age 31, born in ~ew York City (possibly Bronx_ 
County), whose father's last name was Appel or Appell. lier husband's name is 
Carlos rina (Mexican), but she is separated froa him and he is seeking a divorce. 
Sile holds US passport, No. 0633873, issued S August 1%3 in !?ev York; it COlileS up 
for renewal in August (at which til:le she expects to be in am:ie). She is afraid 
that her having traveled to Cuba in 1964 with a Progressive Labor delegation will 
hurt her chances of getting a renewal of her passport. . 
2. Subject had been having a series of political and m:iorous affairs during 
her stay in Dar, and was in serious trouble Yhen Q c:.et her. After rejecting Dennis 
rhocbeab's advances, she was in serious danger of being declared a prohibited 
iDDigrant; Q befriended her, and he and Coloan Ferrer of the Cuban Embassy (vho 
had been having an affair with her) saw that she got out of Dar safely. Q was ... . " 
to lileet her in Cairo (but in fact had no intention of doing so) and later caught 
up vith her in Rome. She indicated a desire to work with Q (without quite knowing 
for whom she would be workin~-he hinted rather broadly tu her that·he ~~c in 
cahoots with "our friends in the East," but it will be noted that in one of her 
letters there is this disaruing phrase: she warns hiJ:l about hov to deal with 
certain persons and adds: "lie cool with them-do not sbcnr your true colors (what-
ever they are)"). . .. 
3. Q eeized on the opportunity 0£ using subject as an unwitting ir.formant 
and eventually agent on the same basis. She submitted to an intervie~ on tape 
-in a Rome hotel room which lasts about 2-1/4 hours, in whicil Q debrief& her on 
her knowledge of every Tanzanian, liberation ::iove::ient1 nr :illoc -:::ersonality with 
whom she bad contac~ and in view of her attractiveness and willil!Znesa she~£· ..
