MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT 
SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson 
1 April l<J70 to 31 March 1971 
l\lr. Williamson departed San Jose, Costa Rica, on 21 
Februarr 1971, after having served as Chief of Station for two and 
one half years~· The la.st year of his tour was highlighted by two 
oxtremcl}' delicate, highly productive operations targeted against 
tho Communist Party of Costa Rica, and a political action opera­
tion of a most sensitive nature stemming Crom them. This latter 
operation, focused as it was around the president of the country, 
called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U, S. Govern­
ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence 
at hilnd. (It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station 
Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example o( both tho 
collection a.td use of intelligence on the real "national interest" 
level.) 
Throughout these operations, l\fr. Williamson handled him­
aelf very well, especially dllring the latter part of his tenure when 
he was under considerable pressure as an ahnost ine,ritable conse­
quence of the impact o{ these operations, Ultimately, Mr, 
Williamson'" recall Crom Costa Rica was req11e11tod by the Costa 
Rican Government. It should be strossrd that this was a mark oC 
hi:1 operational success rather th~n the result o'C any opt'rational 
"flap" or miscue whatever. (The U.S. Ambassador waa the
