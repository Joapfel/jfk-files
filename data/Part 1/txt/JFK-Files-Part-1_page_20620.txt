Dear Dave: 
10 June 1975 
.. The ordinary retirement letter is in no way 
appropriate for you. In tho first pl~ce, your . 
retirement· _is no· stepping out of' the <1ctive world 
into-.a worlu of pleasure. Instead, you are launch­
ing off on even 11 tougher challenge because of your 
sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not 
bo. the termination o·f your interest in intelligance 
and in this Agency. Instr.ad, you are going to be 
doing "'hat you can to help .it survive the current 
set of attacks upon it. nut r.16st of all, your 
retirement is the departure of one of our most 
excepd.ona1 officers, to.whom I had the groat 
pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Modal 
and whose vork I hiive admired these m,1ny years. The 
only thing ordinary about your retirement is the 
sincere and special personal and official good wishes 
we in the Agency send-to you and your family for 
success and satisfaction in tho years ahead. rhis 
we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you 
with special spirit.
