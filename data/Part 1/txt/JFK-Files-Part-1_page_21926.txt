joining. ~1ien NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953, 
he transferred routinely to ~he Komsomol organization there 
and became Secretary of the Kornsomol Organization of the 
Second Chief Directorate. This was a small .orga~1zation 
consisting, NO.SENKO thought, o{_ about 17 KGD employees; he 
remained its secretary until June or July 1954, when he got 
into the trouble over illegal use of operational '..iocuments. 
According to tmS~'NKO. "Immediately after this incident the 
Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, ar,d I was immediately 
removed from the position of Secret;.ary." A week later, a 
"strict reprimand" was entered in NOSE..".KO's KoT.somol records. 
In October 1954, on the eve of his 27th birthday, NOSENKO 
was forced out of the Komsomol for over-age.* At that time, 
the "strict reprimand" he had received several months eailier 
was remitted on NOSENKO's petition, and he was permitted to 
leave the organization with a clean record. He ~as not per­
mitted to join the Communist Party imsr.ediately, however. 
NOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows: 
11:-:ow I had to prove myself. Not being a candidate for Party 
membership, I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness, 
to prove myself. I also asked the Party Organization of the 
Seco;,d Chief Directorate for some 'oul:lic service' (obshchest­
venniy) assignments. I colJ,.ected newspapers. II For a year, 
HOSENKO "made qood" by running errands and performing other 
such tasks, until it was decided that he was suitable for 
Party membership. He applied in J2.nuary 1956 and was accepted 
as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year: 
full membership was granted in 1957. For over a year, from 
October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had the 
distinction of being the 0:11}· employee of the KGB who was 
neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant. 
4. Statements to Others by NOS~KO 
Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had 
talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons 
involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this 
paper. NOSENKO informed the recruitment target Horst BRAUNS 
that he had two daughters.** He advised Ivan Ivanovich PREIS­
FREUND, a Finnish citizen used in the recruitment approach to 
a u.s. Army sergeant in Moscow, that he was married, his 
father was dead but his mother was living, he had served in 
the Navy, and he had two children. PREISFREUND met the 
"little girls" ar.d later reported to CIA that, although 
•• ffl?SENKO was a "woman-chaser," he loved .. his daughters very 
much.*** With one KGB agent in particular, Arsene FRIPPEL, 
NOSENKO was especially forthcoming: he told FRIPPEL of his 
* .According to the Statutes (Ustav)of the Komsomol in effect 
in 1954, the maximum age for a Komsomol member at that··time 
was 25. On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded 
in October 1953, upon reaching his 26th-~irthday. When 
this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965, . 
. • NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomo1· • 
in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the 
maximum age was 26.at that time, and that no special 
exceptions were made in his case.
