. didn't." NOSENKO also said that TSYMBAL had ask~ him several 
times to transfer to the First Chief Directorate an1 had 
suggested that he might be as~igned to the United States. In 
fact, NOSEN',<O added, 'he had got i.nto SOl'!le diffic;.tlty with O. M. 
GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief° Directorate, cy, virtue 'of 
TSYMBAL's efforts in 1962 to have NOS~J<O transferred and his 
leaving the impressi::>n with Gf<IB~lOV that NOSENY.1) (who was still 
in Geneva) had agreed to this action. 
Question~ in April 1964about his association with TSYMBAL, 
NOSENKC stat~d that he met TSYMB~L for the first time several 
days before their departure for Geneva. BP-sides saying again 
that he saw TSYMBAL aL~ost daily at tr.e Legal Residency and· 
that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter ti:-e Legal Resi­
dency, NOSE~~KO reportf::d that in 1962 he went out with TSYMBAL 
several times a week to eat lunch or dinner; sometL~es they were 
joined by I. S. MAYO.ROV,* sometimes by A. ·K. KISLOV (see next 
section), l!nd so111etir.-.es the t·,10 ate alone. .During the 1966 
interrogations, NOSC-iKO said th3t, while he had seen TSYMBAL 
on a daily basis in 1962, he saw him o~ly twice 1n 1964: once 
when TS'flv'.BAL travel 1 ed to Geneva from Bern for or.e or two days 
and later when NOSE:lKO saw TS'I'.'-\BAL ··off for. Rome frcm Lau,;inne. 
Association with Other Soviets 
NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most 
often were/',. K. l<ISLOVandYu. I. GIJ!C** KISLO"v, withNOSEllKO 
was one of the four :r.emb~rs of the Soviet delegation staying 
at the Hotel Ariane in Genova, and was said to be head of the 
American Section of TA.5S and·~ genuine correspondent.*** During 
the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOS~~KO reported that KISLOV was 
not a KGB officer and made no reference of his having any 
affiliation wir,h the KGB. ~os~~KO dio say, however, that he 
had arranged for KLSLOV' s name to be given the KGB double 
agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of 
information on Soviet disarma."T,ent policy: BELITSY.IY was to 
pass this information to his C!A contacts. NOSEt,KO made 
numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV, 
specifically with re~ard to a night in early Jur.e - when 
NOSmKO was robbed of or sciuandered his operational funds, 
which brought him to CIA - and on the night of 10 June 1962 
when NOSENKC squandered 2000 Swiss francs (the money CIA had 
given him) on wine and women.***** In giving NOS~KO the 
money to defray these personal expenses. the CIA handlers 
expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security 
arising from KISLOV's knowledoe of this inexolicable source of 
income .. · NOSEUKO repped that~ there was ·no need to be concerned·, 
since ·KISLOV was• "too drunk .to ·know what i.s going on," .and. in· 
.any event he constituted no threat.
