SUBJECT Recommendation for s~;:>proval of 
Mr. Grays ton L. Ly-=.,;ii as ., Participant 
in the CIA Retireme-:~~ and Dii;ability System 
REFERENCE HR 20-50 
1. It is i,trongly recommended that l..G:· .. Grayston L. Lynch 
be approved as a participant in the CIA Reti-Nni.rnt au<l Disability 
System. 
2. It is the opinion of the Special O;:,~::ations Division that 
the duties p'er!ornied by Mr. Lynch from .the 1::::n:1e he ente1·cd on .duty 
in February 1961 until early 1968 meet the s:;:;:.:i:: arid intent of the 
criteria for 11 qualiiying scrvice 11 as dciineci ii::: H~ 20-S0b. The lone 
exception to th·ei;c ci-itcria is that :V[r. Lynd, was not "abroad" 
during the time involved except on a sporacb.:: i:,;1,;is. This exception, 
however, was duc completely to the geograp}"ric;il location of the area 
of operations. This location made it uniquely [J.ropitious to have 
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a c1orr,-.ic;;tic base. There is 
no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's ser,~,:e, was in the conduct 
and sctp;i'Jrt 0! covert opcr;:i.tions which r·c:::;;.:.::.:·s:,.:· co:iti:,uing p,aclico 
of security and fradccraft procedures and 1.1,'hk;1 included, from 
time to time, ha<!:ards to his life and ht~alth. .ct is also believed 
that Mr; Lynch would be at a disadvantage in c:.btaining other employ• 
ment becaus.e of the sensitivit~, of. his past sec::-d,..:e as well as tho 
dearth o( requirements for his peculiar back,~·=Gund, skills and 
knowledge. 
3_. On the basis of the above and Mr. Synch 1 s unique per­
sonal record, it is bdieved that his service ·f::..cing the described 
period is certainly equivalent to if not in c.xc:N,3 ~i the requirements 
for "creditable service abroad" and that ii it ,::..1r.i not been for a 
geographical accident, this ser0..c.i would h,....-,::, been performed as
