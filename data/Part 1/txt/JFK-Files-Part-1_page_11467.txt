Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined 
500 pesos. The purpose o1 the payment was not identified. 
Later she made a call fro~ the Cuban Ecbassy which indicated 
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay 
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not 
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make 
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba 
Cultural type) bas a key to L/3's apartment and night see 
the note but would be unable !ia,~entify the sender since 
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless sc as a signature. ! 
3. DRISCOLL now plans upon bis return to Mexico t,o 
recontact L/4 to 5tet the lat-pc:::f- ...... ,.,"- -- !.''.!·:: .::.;;.:,;.;..:;' : ... 
UU~L~m~~a. !l tbe Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/J's 
release ic behalf of the ~exicans and if it appears he ~ill 
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the pos~ibility 
of our do!ng something t~ get L/3 out so the operation can 
become active again. . 
4. Io the above regard L/3 ,-as discussed 11·ith Mr.! PIPER 
of the Guatemala desk. ~r. PIPER believed the Station has 
a high enough contact with the Guats (E5M.~JOR/20-Presidents 
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and hi8 ~~xic~n cc~patriot oul 
of prison and back to llexico with a mini mun security risk. 
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the-cable upon his ·return to • 
Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt be should 
possibly travel to Guate~ala and have a prelimi~ary ceet ritb 
L/3 before Guat Station ~akes anv all out ~ffort to officially 
request Li3's release. If,after.seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is'.satis­
fied tba~ L/S is still an ally and is willing to cooperate 
after his release tben DRISCOLL belie~es we should attempt to 
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Bopefully7ESll.JOR/ 
20 will arrange the release so ~bat all involved believ~ it 
bas been done at the request and urgicg of the Mexican Govern~ 
ment. DRISCOLL, however, 'li'ould like L/3 and L/4 to belfeve • 
be (DRISCOLL) bad something to do with the release in o~der . 
to raise bis status ~1th both for the sake of future op~ratioo-
al tasks be will levy on them. 1
