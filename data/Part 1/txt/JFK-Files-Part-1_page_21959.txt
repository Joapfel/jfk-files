having relations. With MALIA insisting on the lights bei~g 
turned oft, however, . it was impossible to obtain compro- :,:ti • 
mislng photcgraphs (tho KGB did nc,t yet have infra-red 
photographic equipn.ont, NOSENKO said) and therefore no re-
cr~itment Rpproach was made to MALIA. Dur in~ this and a 
later trip to Moscow in 1961, MAJ,IA was ''v1J1•y cautious,'' 
and the K-GB ne .. ·er again succ~eded in exploiting MALIA' s 
horrinse,x,.,11,li ty. for a rec·1:ui tmcnt approach. 
Investigation Results: MALIA, a U.S. ~avy intolligence 
offi_cer during World W;,.r. l I, has visited the Soviet Union 
in 1955 and twice in 1962. While buying books frir the 
Library of Congress and.several universities in 1955, MALIA 
trave:lled over 10,000 miles throu 6 hout the t;SSR, which w·as 
suff1c1ently ~nusual at the time to attract press publieity. 
in 1955 and 1962 he nad contacts with dissident Soviet 
citizens and clandestinely brourht to the l'iest lltcraturo 
for fUblishing abror.d, In December 1963 MALIA was the 
subject of an attack in the Soviet press which ch~rgcd that 
during 1962 he h~d ''spent his ti~e in ~oscow looking for 
disse~sion in the ra~ks of young intell~ctuals Qt druLken 
debaucnes." M.~LIA llad been in periodic contact with CIA 
in recent years; in the spring of 1963 he claimed to have 
·had··r.o involvc:::ents with blnckmark~tec•rs, hor.-.ogexuals, or 
females 1..Iwide the So,•ict Union at any time. He naclc a 
sir..ilar statement: to~iF~ in October 1963. ~:ALIA has 
not been inten•icwcd in ccinncction with NOSENXO's inforl!la­
tion about him. 
b. Recruitment of BURGl (19~6) 
NOSENKO's Information: At the first mcettni in 1962 
and despite ~is stated fear for his own security and his 
determination to dis~uss only the two l~ads hu wished to sell 
CIA, NOSENKO de&cribod his rccruitffient of Yale Professor 
Richard llURGI on tho basis of a ho~osrxual ptovccation oper­
ation ~hich bcgnn in Moscow and ~ul~i~ated with an approach 
in Kiev in June 1956. NOSENKO reported that he received a 
.letter of commendation (blagodarno~t•) and a ~onus of one 
month's pay for this recrultroent, L~t in 1966 he retracted 
this claim. The BURGI case was the first operation in which 
NOSE~"KO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB, 
and NOSENKO said he counted it as a turntng point in his 
persotial and professional life: It was with this success­
ful operation, ~IJSENKO stated, tt..at he "began to grow" from 
a spoiled· playboy into a resporfsible and effective counter.: 
intelligence officer. The IIUHGI operation.was the first 
recruitment carried out by the Tourist Department-after it 
was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO. In 1964 NOSENKO 
reported for the first time that his.superior, A.S. KOZLOV, 
ll il 
,.1 
Deputy Chief of the Tourist Depart~ent, hfd also taken part ; 
in this operation, but that h~,, NOSENKO, was :the 0 'respons-ible. " 
case officer. In August' 1965/ when a'sked' who had recruited ,! 
BURG I, NOSEN".CO., repUed: "KOZLOV and SOSENKO." - Aske.d who· --· •• '.::.f'. 
recruited him first, NOSENKO said: "KOZLOV, naturally 2 He • f·' · -~
