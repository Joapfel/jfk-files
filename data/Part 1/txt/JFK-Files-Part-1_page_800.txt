.Uliit1d States torritorial w~ters. REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1 
that 1 KU8AR,< had played no role in mounting,\ provocation operation 
against th,~ GOC. At the same time, REU'l'EMAN pointed out that 
-it wq.s highly unlikely that GUIROLA was a GOC agent. As a result 
of tl1~s conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check 
out certain aspects of the GUIROL\ story. At the. same time, 
AMCARBON-1 was prevailed upon not to write a story which might 
lead the public to speculate on w~1ether GUIROLA was an agent or a 
plant in a propaganda play design~d to embarrass the GOC.

!7. PHOPAGANDA OUTLET. AMCA~tBON-1 has been use :.l succ~ssfully 1 
during the period covered by this report, as a propa:5anda outlet 
through whtch items of interest ti) KUBARK could be surfaced ·in 
the free wc,rld press. Examples of how AMCARDON-1 ha8 been harne8:::>ed 
in this f i(, ld are outlined below: 
a. AMCRAB-1. The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally 
surf~ced iL the Miami area on 13 (lctober 1963 via tho Diario de 
las A111ericas 1 which played up an API release from Montevideo. 
The API Mor.tevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1 's info1.·mation 
relat;ive tc GOC activities in Uruguay. The story in the Diario 
de las Americas had an extremely limited impact on S1,anish readers 
in the Mian.i area. As a result, it was decided to c;lo a series 
of fe~ture stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1 
was typical of the veterans of thE, Granma expedition. who felt 
they had been betrayed by CASTRO r·.nd had been relega 1:ed to positions 
of obscur,ity once the revolution l,ad put CASTRO in pciwer. AMCARBON­
was briefed in detail on the AMCRJ..B-1 story, and he v,as given an 
opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 ur.der controlled conditions in a 
JMWAVE safehouse. After completirg his debrlefing, AMCAR.BON-1 
wrote a series of feature article~ on AMCRAB--1. The first article 
in the series received front page headline play. The series of 
articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they-provided an 
excellent peg for JMWAVE to mount •·a replay operation via other 
propaganda assets. AMCARBON-l's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked tip 
by UPI, API ind others, and it was played throughout Latin America. 
The details of this surfacing·can be found in WAVE 5826 1 dated 
14 October 1963; WAVE 6092 1 dated 19 October 1963; and 1 WAVE 6174 1 
dated 21 October 1963. 
b. Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Story. On 26 February 1964 
JMWAVE learlled that when Mr. Charles""GRTFFIN"rs-sons went to Cuba 
to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY HEB, they found that 
select item; were missing from the boat when it was turned over 
to them. It was believed that this information would make a good 
human inter,:::st story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC 
propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items 
from the Cu.Jan fishing boats which had violated United States 
territorial waters. In view of this opiniont a steering tip was 
given to M,t,~ARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 represen ta ti ve in 
Key West interview Mr. GRIFFIN. This interview was carried out, 
and an arti-:!le outlining the points which wel'e of interest to 
JMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the 
Identity 3. 
c. LAYC Story. The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santiago, 
Chile was not recetv1ng appropriate coverage in the South Florida 
nuwsp~pers; as a result, REUTEMAN contacted AMCARBON-1 <;>n 5 ?.larch 
l 9G4 and su 1;gcs ted that the LAYC m.:Je ting was a story wlach the . 
Identity 3 :;hould pursue. AMCARBO~'-l-1 was gr.:i.teful for this steer1n 
tip and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC 
to ~ne of the members of his staff. A story on the LAYC was . , 
subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the-Identity 
(COMMENT: Copies of the articles cited in si.:bparagraphs a through 
c above are attached for Headquart0rs information.)
