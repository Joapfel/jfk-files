~~~~·-lll!rllit,~~~~----~~.,._~....,._.,.~---~--- ..... --~ .............. ~..----· Dur.ing • this first ·ll!eetlng NOSEUKO ir,ade no nr,netary request ,-
of CIA and asked only for reasonable assurance of a secure future ' .t,; < f: 
in the United States. In this cor.nection, he said, he would 
•. prefer to act as a CIA ccnoultant, particularly on co1Jnteri11tel-
- ligence matters because he was a specialist in this field: he 
would be able to give CIA leads and assistanc~ in spotting and 
recruititig other soviets. 
The next five mee~ings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively 
to debriefings on the activities of the K~B Second Chief Direc­
torate. Altho•·gh his impdnding defection was t11entioned, his 
reasons for taking this step were not discussed. In the mean­
time, NOSENKO' s first Cili handler :: lew to Washington for dis­
cussions regarding the dafection and, on his return, told 
NOSL~IKO that the CIJ\ leadership had asked why, .:;pecifically, 
NOSENKO had decided to come to the United States at that time. 
The answer was that NOSF.~JKO, "after co:ning iiack and seeinc; that 
there was no more chance to come to the West, or little more 
chance," felt that this was his one opportunity to come and make 
his life with the Americans. Therefore, he was going to seize 
the opportunitf while he had it. AskeJ about this, NQSENKO con­
fi med that thi :, was his reason; and a.dd-:::d: "I r.,ay never have 
another chance, and in addition, I've had s~fficient time since 
our last meeting h~re in Geneva !1962) to ~eigh everything and to 
cons icier everyth_ing." Later in this same ir.eetir.g, !WSENKO again 
mentioned his lack of interes'::. in ,no11ey a:1::i his feelings about 
deserting his family: "I understand [thac it will be difficult 
to adjust to a new life in America] and k~ow that for some time 
I will be sick within. And I know that a certain period of 
time must e~.apse before this can heal. I even spoke to you 
bluntly about my- [financial) security. I am absolutely un­
mercenary and have never had any appreciation for r:-,oney or 
wealt~ ... My mc3t difficult and sorest spot of all is my family. 
This is the n:Jst basic and most difficult spot of all. And I 
know perfectly well that I must go through an illness over 
this. For this the only and the best doctor is ti~e. I don't 
expect to have a new famiiy there. Of course, I don't know--
but at least I'm speaki:-,g from the way I feel now. I have a 
strong liking for children--nct only for MY own, but for all 
children and, losinq my own, I am fully conscious how I must 
suffer through this. In time I will get used to it. I know 
one can get used to almost anything." 
At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to rerr.ain in place for 
approximately another week, and the tentative date of 8 Febru­
ary was selected for the defection. 
NOSENKO's motives for the defection were .not.mentioned 
for five more meetings.· Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned 
the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once. Ar­
riving shortly thereafter, he announced that he had been or~ 
dered to return to l-ioscow the following day and, therefore, had 
to leave Switzerland Lefore morning. He stated his reasons 
formally in an asylum request, written at the time:

"This deci•sion was made by me, -no't now, at the 
moment I write this r1quest, but several years ago. 
Having worked for man~ years in the KGB and knowing 
more than the average loviet citizen about the policy of 
the Soviet government, about the direction which this 
government has chosen to take, and about the law and 
order in the USSR, I have come to the decision that
