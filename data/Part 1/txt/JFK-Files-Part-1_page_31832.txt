SUBJECT Recommendation for Promotion of Mr. 
Joseph S. Piccolo . 
t. It Is re~ommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted 
from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been In grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960 
and .was assigned to what Is now the ~peclal Affairs Stall (formerly ________ . 
Tas_k For.ce W) on 27 August 1962. 
2. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo 
was conslden-d to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency 
policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his b<'lng con­
sidered for CB-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 c:>n 19 July 
1960! On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommendc<l for promotion 
to GB-8 at" a Ume ·-when ·Jte was expected to leave· the Agen<;y In order 
to comply wllh hl.5 obllgatlon for mllltary service. The recommendation 
was not approvc-d on tho grounds Uiat promotion spaces were limited. 
Mr. Piccolo served in the .t\Jr Force between 4 October 1961 and 
_27 August :1962 when he returned to the Agency and began working In 
th'e CI Branch of the Special Affairs Stall. 
3. Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI 
operatlona 'and 1s one of the most promising young~r men In tho CI 
Branch. His performance since returning Crom mllltary service has 
been su~rlor 1n all respects, 
4. I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotlo~ r·
