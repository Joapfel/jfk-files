Mr. Hunt is an officer with real abllity, creative_and·hA'Aa\(~al. During 
the period under review, he baa done a great deal to tighten up the operatit>n of 
hia ahop. The amorphous aspects·or some projects he inherited.have been. 
eliminated or cut down to sizci. He has a pleasant and engaging personality 
and a broadly based background. 
ll there are ~y areas ol.weakmfss in his performance it ia only because 
his potential is_ so considerable. For example, it is possible that the staff and 
planning asp·ects ol his job could receive mor·e attention ·although, admittedly, 
~ere ia a large grey area between the responsibilities of ·the CA Staff and the 
responsibilities of 00DS in this respect.
