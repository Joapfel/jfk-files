J\,!r. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about eighteen months, 
during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and 
Ocvclopment. During most of the past yea1· Mr. Christ has doubled as group leader 
of the Radiq-Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of 
a separate Audio-Physics group. both of which continue to comprise about 40% of 
the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. l\lr. Christ has performed 
these duties in a mange rial capacity in an extremely· effective manner·. so that both 
groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining 
basis. 
Mr. Christ is extremely consciontious. receptive, and alert to the needs of 
the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his 
direction and supervision. His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout 
the ycqr. and 1::1 best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed 
Sunds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts. Also, he is not one 
to "rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them 
t~ tas~ th_is year for what he considered ~ffo,rts below what he felt their capabilities 
should be. •
