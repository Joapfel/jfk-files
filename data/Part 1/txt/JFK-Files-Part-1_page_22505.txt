PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IDN NUMBERS 
·.;:.••. 
1. • A relatively small proportion of the total number o ersonall­
tleB indexed by the CS are of acUve operational interes at any given 
point in time. These are normally_ subject2 of exten • e reporting and 
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, d members of 
groupe and organizations of continuing target int est. Each of these 
personalities is assigned either a 201 number r an IDN number. 
2. The 201 number serves a dual pur se. n brings the files on 
these personclitles into the CS records stem. A single number, 
e.g., 201-123456, is assigned to each rson, and a dossier controlled 
by th.i.s number is estabHsh.od which ontains, or bas cross referenced 
-· to it, all of the reporting on the ln vidual's personal history, current 
. status and prospects. Once the 1 number is assigned, it is used in 
:· fut\lre reporting on the indivi both as a file number and in place of 
uther Identifying data. Up-t ~te machine listings are published 
periodically to help neld s lions and headqurters desks keep book 
on those 201 personaliti falling in their particular geographic or 
• functional area of inter st. 
3. It has becom apparent that the 201 machine listings should in­
clude the identiti of persons of operational interest because of their 
coMectlon with target group or organization even though there may 
not be sufficie information or specific interest to warrant opening 
,-.-- a file. For mple: A conshierable number of stations are concerned 
. with the a vitles of Cuban exiles. Coverage of their movements, 
... factions objectives can be a8::sisted by furnishing all participating 
statlo up-to-dat~ listings containing info:-:nation under the control
