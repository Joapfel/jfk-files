.. 4. LIREAUl-1 's liandlirig of LIRELIC-1 encompasses two 
_targets. By far the more impo1·tant one is LIOGLE. The goal 
here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of . 
LIOGLE usi11g_·several good contacts he has in this organiza:-tion 
as· a_ Stepping st.one. Some steps have been taken in this 
direction~' LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for 
-assistance to current k~y LI OGLE personal! ties. ··He has also 
• submitt.ed his c·urriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job 
in ~IOGLE .. T~is has so far failed to ;,roduc·e any concrete 
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of ~ourse, that he is_ 
of no value to LmlARP uhless -he obtains a. job giving hirn access 
to hard information on LiOGLE plans ?nd activities. The 
promfse of a regular s:ilary ,· as a matter of fact, is comple'i:ely 
dependent on LIRELIC-l's ability to penetrate LIOGLE. In an 
effort to maintain· interi,n. contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1 
liquidate some persona·1 degts, the Statio11, via L~REALM-1, 
made·him a loan ·of 3,000 pesos. Further details on the LIOGLE 
·-aspects of the LIRELIC-1 operation will be covered in the 
fo~thcom_ing LIOGLJ::/'LIRELIC progress report. In nddi tion t_o
