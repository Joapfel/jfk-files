29 with a request whether he might be of use to .KUlJARK either in Afrioa 
or elsewhere in the wo_rld• and th.-.t he would like to be taken· back into 
the fold. He is obviously ooncsfnad about hie position in the GOC at this 
ti.me· and feels with the diplor:,atic relations being eotauliahed between 
Belgium and the GOC that his position will become incr~asingly wader. To 
reemphasize paat assessments of nL10~UE, he is far too disorganized an 
individual to be an effective FI A€9nt. but would probabl;,· be U3eful where 
action is required bt•t det!iil&d accurate reportirig is not. 'L'he station 
agrees vi t!J a.n early statement mace concerning WIROGU3 that he has a 
peculiar. turn of 1:1ind lihich len<is itself remarkably to· nefarious and • 
e:Xtra-legal activities but would add tb.at the~,e activities should be ot 
an acti<'n type.
