ANALYTICAL COMiv1ENTS CONCERNING THE BONA FIDES OF 
YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO 
As indicated in the introduction to this summary, information in 
regard to Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-. . 
trary but realistic list of areas considered pertinent to the question of 
. - • . . .· • -
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB • 
knowledge, and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with represent­
atives of this Agency were known to the KGB. 
It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects 
would also be considered but that his admitted previous lies and exag-
' 
gerations would not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a ( • 
"bona fide defector. 11 
The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which 
are being given specific consideration. Attached is a separate section 
• containing remarks in regard to the designated areas of A - H. 
A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom q.e claims 
to be? 
B. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?
