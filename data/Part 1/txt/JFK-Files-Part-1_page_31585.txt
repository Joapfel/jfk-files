tho followinii points were discussed. 
(1) A Strategy Board to guide RFE. Spencer Ceels the need 
for 110,me his.h-,r level political guidance than RFE is getting from 
their staH p..-1Jple and talked about getting together a board of peo;ile 
like Geori:-('. ·K.,ilnan, etc';' I told Spencer that l thought it unlikely 
that G.eorg..- would g(,i-"e v~ry much time to this but might be willini; 
to give· th..-m an occasional idea or suggestion. 
(.!) $pen.cer asked me about the possibility o} their finding 
some job eo·r Sam Reber. I told hirn to wait on this until I had time 
to discuss it with FW.

allocat_ion oi $-400, 000 to he_lp in the refugee situation~ I told him 1
