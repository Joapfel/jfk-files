MEMORANDUM FOR TUE RECORD 
P.~vicw Staff: 75/1008 
23 June 1975 
SUIJJECT: Rockefeller Commission Contact 
Mason Cargill told me today that the reference 
in the Commission report to an employee who was fired 
because he abused a defector came from a deposition by 
Dick Helms~ Helms could not remember an eY.act name, 
but from the description which he gave on his deposition, 
it is clear that the employee who was fired was John 
Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960. 
Torpats, himself a Lithuanian refugee, was working 
in the Defector Reception Center in Frankfort, Germany. 
In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian · • 
defector, Torpats beat him. After Torpats was fired, 
he sued the Director (then McCone). He lost the case.
