8. POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE. Attempts have been made to· 
obtain dissemlno.bie positive intelligence from AMCARDON-1 durina 
-tbe period covered by this report. This attempt has beon r,onernlly 
unsuccessful, in t'1nt AMCARDON-1 does not bnve a great number of 
contn.cts in Latin America who would give him nccess to worthwhile 
intelligence_apprecinbly in advance of the iQformntion appcnring 
in the ov.ort press. As a result, AMCARDON-1 is usually not awnre of t'1 • 
inside developments in any Latin American country; consequently, 
be is not a_wort~while source. of positive intelligence. As a 
matter of fact,·_ AMCARBON-1 is less valuabl~ as a source o:f positive 
intelligence·. -than· most journalists. This is attributable sololy 
to his lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin Amorican political 
. -scene. It is•believed that Al1CARBON-l will ultimately overcomo 
this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him frr 
the collection o:f·. positive intelligence •

9. CO?r~.:-,. ·In the peri.od covered by this report, AllCARDON-1 
bas been-found;to be a straight-forward individual who is honest, 
cooperativ.e.and'.v,ho.understands the need for security. Our 
relationship.· also indicates that AMCAnDON-1 _is an accurn.te reporter 
of that information which be passes to KUBARK. In view of this, 
JMWAVE plans·to:co~tinue to harness AMCARBON-1 in the same manner 
that he bas b~en usod in the past. It is believed that our rela­
tionship with AMCJ1,RBON-l enhances our ability to conduct our 
operational missio~ i~ a secure manner. In addition, this relation­
ship tends to min_imize the possibility that Jl,tWAVE might have diffi­
culties with.the media outlets in the South Florida area~ As a 
result of. our _·continuing relationship with AMCAROON-1, a special· 
activities repor.t will·· be forwarded at appropriate intervals.
