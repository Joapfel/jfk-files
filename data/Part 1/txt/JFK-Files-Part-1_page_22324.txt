•· Transfer to the Tourist Departmerit 
Soae ti■e in the fall of 1961, SOSENKO said, he heard 
of GRIBASOV's decision to pro:note him to the posit ion ot i 
Deputy Chief of the entire A21cric_an -Uepartmen t. \03ESKO, ___ _ 
however,. knew that his chief sod friend KOVSP.tn-: v>anted th_e ___ -
job and that FEDOS[YEV (Chief of the Department) also favored 
KOVSHUK tor this posit ion. Realizing that bis 011n appoint-
ment would tLerefore place him in a difficult position a~d 
wishing t~ avoid this, SOSENKO spoke to the Chief of the 
Tourist Department, CHEL.~OKOV, about returnirg there. At 
CHEL.~OKOV's sug~est ion, .NOSESKO -;went to GRIBASOV with the 
request to be returned to the Tourist Departoent as Chief 
ot the American Tourist Section, wilh the understanding thai 
he voula be r.ade Deputy Chi~f or the Tourist Department 
upon th~ r~tirement of the incumbent. B~LDIN, in July 1962. 
To this GRIBASOV agreed. NOSE:-.'KO said that GRID.\SOV did 
not discuss ~1th himlus reasons !or wanting to appoint him 
Deputy Chief or the A3erican Department or for appointing 
him Chief of the American Tourist Section, nor did he discuss 
with SOSENY.O his personal requirel!lents for these positions. 
On one occasion, i.n early 1965, ~OSENKO said that it was 
because GRI B,\1"0V "thoui;ht I was a tough guy, a good case 
officer. ln 1959 I saw him often dnd was involved in a lot. 
of questio~b .-hich ,ere reported to him." According to 
his most recent version, NOSENKO ~as officially transferred 
from tte A~ericao OOpartment at the end of Decereber 19~1 
and reported for duty in the Tourtst Department on about 
3 January 1962. 
KOVSHt'K, who was also a candidate for the job as Deputy 
Chief of tbe American Department, had earlier held this po­
sition, according to ?-iOSENKO and COLll'S~. lie had been per­
sonally involved in many of the core siKnificant American 
Department operations di.;ring the previous decade. These in­
cluded the recruitments of :RHODES and SMITH (the latter one 
ot NOS~lCO's ir.ost iaportant leads. according to ~OSE!~KO); 
the handling of 'SliAPU:O;: the at tel'lpts to recruit STORSBERG,. 
~TO~E, -and ll~.SSHEUI; the devclopmE:'nt of the CIA officer 
_ ~"D,acd the interrogation of LA~GELLE in connection wit!t 
POPOV arrest. 
By contrast, GRIBASOV's original candidate fo~the job, 
NOSEhlCO, was present .-hen KOZLO\" recruited Bt:RGI,aod himself 
recruited l!ARRIS.)and five homosexual tourists who visited 
the Soviet Union"in 1959, furtherm=>re, NOSESKO's perfor­
aance as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section. as he 
admitted under interrogation, was "not good." 
NOSE:SKO has gi 0 eo many contradictory dates for his 
transfer to the Tourist D~partment. Iu 1962 NOSE..'\KO said 
at various times that this took place in January i~62 and 
in February 1962: in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling 
some time between 15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 
1965 be arrived at the date of 2 or 3 January 1962, after 
it was pointed out that he appeared in the approach to lf.E. 
JOHNSON on 5 January; (On this basis, he said that the 
official order was issued about 25 December 1961 and that 
he turned over his files to his succe6sor GRYAZNO~ several 
days later.) ~OSE~'KO contradicted this latter esti~ate. 
however, by saying that he was in the U.S. Embas~y Section 
for the eotire period of the three-month surveillance of
