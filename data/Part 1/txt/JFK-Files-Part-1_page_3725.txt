is a Cuban and a close friend of aine. !ie is ARTU!E's 
clcaest friend in Nicaragua. A~TI~E often stays at his 
home. On a couple of qccasions A~~I~E has been by to 
see me with another mutual Cutian friend, Pri!!litlvo 
ABLA.~£DO,who used to live at Cl aluff on the Cast Coast. 
9 El Gallego" AaLANCDO nCi.., lives in ~anagua • and makes his·· 
1iving renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling 
eq~ment. On one occasion AR.TIME came by with a Cuban I 
believe was named, VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual 
Cuban friend (she teaches ~panish at the American Embassy) 
tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in. Miami but that 
• ARTIHE has no connection with this enterpri~e. A couple 
of times .ARTIME· has come by with Frank· co:IDPH, A. short, 
quiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry sto~es in 
Ilia.mi. CONDOM ~snow pretty well-off financially and is 
a good friend and business associate of "Bobe" Rr.BOZO, 
vho in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. • I 
bel!eve CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the

The last two times ARTIME. has not had anyttiing. ,to drink. 
We talk no operations or other- s 11-~h business. My•,personal 
vi.eve on dealing _wit~ CASTRO, especially on.howwe should 
have dealt with him in the paat 1 are rathex- hawkish and I 
think ARTIME finds these viewa pleasant to hie ear although 
he is well aware that they are not "policy." 
i-,:fr'•' ;-,, • &. ARTIME told me some lllOnths ago--befox-e the elP.ctions--
of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO. The.meeting was arranged 
through CONDOM. ARTIME has not claimed to me to have met wi·t!'. 
Kr. NIXON either befo:re or altex- he assumed the p:residency. _ 
He has made i~ kno~n'p _as is ~lx-~ady ~ell known, t~at. REBCZO
