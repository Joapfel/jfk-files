Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requirl'S 
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful materi.11, rather than the 
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take 
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done 
periodically. A 2()1 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should 
be pl!rged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: 
(1) Duplicate material, i.e., exact copy(s) of a document. 
(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for 
the opening. 
{ 3) All abstract sJips. 
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884). 
(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information ii 
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the c;issemiraation number 
then must be :ransfened to the first page of the raw report. 
(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch 
co,-er sheets unless there are remarlcs such as coordinations or comments. 
(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substanti,·e infomution 
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is 
by the Records Officer. 
(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 2(11 dossier 
lorn-arded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention 
fn the !'01 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized 
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction 
over the contents of the material mwt possess Top Secret dassificatiCM 
authority. If the document c:innot be downgrac~ the file should be retained 
at the desk or the copy of the TS documt-nt should be removed, ret:lincd 
fn a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a 
cross-reference sheet ( Form 867) placed in the 201 file ghing the location 
of the TS document.
