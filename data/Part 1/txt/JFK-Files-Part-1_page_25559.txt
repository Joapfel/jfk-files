(3) Over 20 years service, three months 
salary plus one month's pay for each full year 
of service. 
(4) All payme11ts above are to be calculated 
at the rate of pay appl~~able at the time of 
retirement and/or resignation. • 
3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their 
Memorandum concerni.ng this amendmeµt we would like to note 
the following: 
A) GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the 
Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers 
hims.elf to be· a "career" employee of the Agency, and 
whose initial local employment for cover.purposes was 
largely notional under 11 system of ''ghost payrol ling". 
GERENDE received no income or benefits-from this "cover" 
position v,hich terminated due to the demise of the 
company 011 31 • December 1967. GERENDE' s other "cover" 
is self_ generated in that he gives English lessons in 
his spare time to middle managemer1t Mexican nationals 
employed by American owned companies in Mexico City. 
His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but 
suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source 
of bis income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered.by 
the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call 
at all times for operational activity~· Any other local 
benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of bis 
being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern 
of this Agency given the above circumstances of bis employ-
ment with us. • 
. 1· _ This Branch is of.the belief that the resignation 
and/or retirement schedule outlined ·in paragraph 2, B above 
provides car.eer benefits for GEREJ.'DE in the event that be 
must resign and/or·retire in the event of unforseen personal 
_ circumstances. It additionally rewards hi~ for his loyalty 
of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive 
to remain in Agency service for the additional f1nancial 
bendi ts that i.·ill accrue to him providing both future 
security and incentive. • •
