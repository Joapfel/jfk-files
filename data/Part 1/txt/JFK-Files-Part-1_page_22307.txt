CIA hag documentary evidence, ln th~ for~ of official 
Fi&~ish train i:,anUests, that JE~"SER travelled from llelslnkl 
to Moscow by train on 31 March 1960. Thls docu~ent shows 
that JE~1'1ER travelled alone and no Soviets w~rc aboard when 
th~ train lP.tt Holsinki. CIA also has Rn official travel 
lllan ifr,st showing that KOSOLAPOV, using the name KOLOSOV, 
travelled from llolsinl'1 to lfoscow by rail on 2 .\pril 1960, 
two days later, and that no Americans travelled on this train 
with him. t;OSENKO identified KOLOSOV's photogr2ph as that 
of his subordinate KOSOLAPO\'. (\'OSE}:KO earl I.er said that 
he did not know whether KOSOL.\POV u:;0d an alias for·•this 
trip, what that alias rni&ht h&VP, bct'n, or whether KOSOLAPOV 
had an alias passport; he agreed that he would have had to 
authori~e s1..~h a passport.) When he was told of CIA evidence 
that KOSOl,APOV did not travel on the same train as JE:-;NER 
ar.d th~r<.,fore could not have met and talked with him as 
:!0Sl:.h1{0 had rq:ortt:!d, SOSEt.lCO refused to belicvt? it; he in­
sist0.d that he.• had read the reports of both KOSC,!..\POV and 
GHYAZl\OV, and that the events v.·ere exactly ns hE- described 
them. 
(iii) The GARLA!n> Case l. 
GOLITSYN told CIA after his defection that while he was 
statio111.:d in Helsinki, probabl:; in Novi:>r.tber:.-not !.!arch.--1960, 
KOSO!,APOV tra\'el ll:d to Finland under alias and col"..:ncrcial 
cover in order to make the acquaintance of an American code 
clerk on the l!elsinki-~loscow train. KOSOLAPOV's arrival bad 
bee:i announced by a cable from KGB Headquarters to the 
Helsinki Lei;al Resideccy. According to GOLITS\~;, tho Legal 
Residency le:arned which train this ,\merican was to board and 
succecdi;d ir1 placing t:OSOLAPOV i:i the sane cOl!!partmcnt with 
hil'1. GOLITSYN :saw KOSOI.APOV board the train with this AIGeri­
can. I.atcr, when another American Department officer visited 
Hel,;ir.ki, GOLITSYN a!:'ked him how KOSOLAPOV's operation with 
the code clerk had gone; from the officer's refusal to answer, 
GOLITSYN assumed that it had been a success. 
CIA travel records show that KOSOI.APOV made a second 
trip to Helsinki in November 1960, again under the KOLOSOV 
alias. Finnish railroad manifests show that KOSOLAPOV left 
Helsinki by train on 16 Noveober 1960 and that oce ·f his 
travelling companions on this train was G;JU.AND, who was 
en route to Moscow to assume his duties as chief of the 
State Department code room at the American Embassy (Page 
198). There were no other Americans on this train. 
Told that KOSOLAPOV had a:ade. a trip to lfolsinki in 
November 1960 and had travelled to Moscow on the same train 
as an American code clerk, one of his o·,rm targets, NOSE?-."KO 
said that this could not be. He agreed that, as in the case 
of KOSOLAPOV's trip to l!leet JE!t'NER, t.e would necessarily 
have been fnvolvc<l in the planning of such a second trip 
and would have had to approve arrangements and ·correspondence 
in connection with it. Even if such a trip took place when 
NOSENKO 11o·as out of lloscow, he said, the details of it would
