JOHNSON became acquainted \,ith VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at th~ 
Metropol Hotei. They. told JC~30N t~at·they_ had.recently ar-
•rived in Mose~ and invited JO~lSON·to visit their hotel room. 
JO!elSON agrE.ed because ''they understood each other right away. 
They knev th~y were the sa.-ne (i.e., ho.:nosexuals) and so he came, 
and when they were engaged in their _business, O\:r people walked 
in on them ender the disguise of the hotel administrator and 
one militiaman." Pl".otographs of the incident had been taken, 
but these had not been developed at. the time of this, the first 
co::frontation of JO~~SO~i. >. report describing tre circumstances 
(an akt) was prepared, and JOHN.SON -.ras then transferred to another 
r<XY.n. By this time, UOSE!lKO had arrived at the hotel from his 
office, ar.d he went into the room where JOHNSON was waiting in 
dt:cordanc.:e.with KGB orders. NOSENKO di$CUSsed the situation 
with JO.i-CIS')N, then asked him to type and sign a statement that 
he -.ould ''not say anything derogatory ab::>Ut t:1e So·.rict Union." 
JO~s9:~ did as he was told. 
The following day, after t~e incriminating photographs had 
bet!n developed, l.OSENKO approached JOHNSON in the cafe cf tt.e 
Metropol Hotel arid askea him wheth~r he intended to keep his 
promise. When JOHNSOU said that r,e planned to do so, NOSENKO 
preser.ted him with an envelope con•taining copies of the photo­
graphs and said that they would be leaked to the foreign press 
if JOH:.~SON were to break his pro~ise. 1h~ KG9 .l~ter learned 
that JOr~isoN had visited (or pho~ed, according to a later ver­
si~n) the U.S. Embassy and assumed that he had reported the 
approach. NOSENKO did not recall what name, if any, he had 
used during this operation. 
Qu~stioned further on 24 April' 1964, NOSENKO said that, 
upon his j:lrrival at the hotel :i.rrr.1ediately after the compromise, 
the milit1aman described the incident to him in JOHNSON'A pre­
sence. Addressing JOHUSON, NOSENKO had said: "How come? How 
could you do such a thing? What are ~e going to do now? After 
all, this is punishable by court and ... people are given from 
five to eitht years for such relations. It used to. be three 
to five, not it's from five to eight." Frightened by this, 
JOlflSON had written and signed his promise not to denigrate 
the Soviet _Union in the future. 
NOSENKO was asked whether the JCGB would mount such an 
operation against any foreigner who wrote uncomplimentary 
letters and articles about the USSR. He replied: "They don't 
jump on everyone, and not everyone writes this-way~ And not 
everything that is written this way gets into their hands. 
In this case there was a coincidence.·· There was something ve 
could hit him on. For instance, if the fact that he is ·a 
homosexual didn't come to our attention, they would probably 
just say: 'All right, to hell with him. _we have to get. rid 
of him. Let's see that his trip is cut off.'"·
