CJ_tief, Serv~s Staff 
.SUBJB:T: Ole-Time Recimira· -. Request~ Randall Promotion 
. As ~u · Jcnow, OB is not reticent abo~t expressing his views, and in the infonml 
career deyelopment 'hOrld, Fred had had it in FRO. I've known OB fairly well and re­
SJ)e!:t his candor: and prQfess_ionalism; we jt1st worked very well together on the GS· 
16/17 Panel, with M interes~i.J}gly identical philosophy. Fred'.s perform'.Ulce did not 
$,8ti-sfy OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It Joes no.t surprise me, since 
Fred had been in FR from_l970.-197_5, that his Fitness -Reports for the past years ~uld 
put him in a neutral middle, or even low ndddle, r~king among B/(fi officers·. But 
that's yesterday. 
Today, as- I tried to say s.trongly in my 8 August meroo, my view o.f his work is 
that it is O!Jtst~ding--and I don't'.so rate ll)aRy_officcr-s .. J would hope his prc.,;~t 
• work-col:1ld s~and· mi Lts own merit, and project fomard, expecting FOL\ to be a· ,,11y of 
life in the D00 witp all the J!1311a&ement c~llcnge, and headache, that poses. llis 
present and future peer c:ompetitfon -should be 1-1ith the NC crowd, -not the B/~ group-­
if tha~ hurdle is detenniliing. 
'-· . 
At the risk.of being irritating, I feel bound to state his cas~ in what I con­
sider the appropriate cornpet-itive environment", to avo_id• an out-of-cycle suggestion 
doinJ? mischief to the system. Any hooe? mn::mt,J/11
