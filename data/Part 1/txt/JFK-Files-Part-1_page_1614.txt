independent sourceo. The most critical aspect would appear to 
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly brin~ IB obertsJ name

whether or notIB obert~ reported hie activities with Itkin in G~nevc1 0

1955, and then a requeat in 1963 by the Domestic Operationa 
Division for his use on Project 06WU.BRINY. In Ms.rch 1964 DO 
Division advised Security that @eleol!) was not going to be used 
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather ,o8 
ominous allegations against members of the firm of @el&on, Levin 
and Gordo0 indicating that one member of the firm wa& a card­
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time 
Mr. Rocca ia investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr. (,!)elson)
