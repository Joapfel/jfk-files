very friendly. For the firs~ time. NCSENKO r~ported·that 
KISLOV had beer, a KGB operational contact while in the United 
States, that he had be~n .introduced to KISLOV by a KGB o~ficer 
in Moscow prior to his.departure for Geneva in 1962 in order 
to be able to E:xploit him curing the Geneva Conference. and 
that after returning from G~nE:va KISLOV had be~n recruited as .. 
a KGB agent on the basis of· a favorable report NOSEN_KO had 
prepared. 
Often durfog the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his "big, 
big friend." Gt1K, ..,fr,0:JI he described as the Deputy Legal Resident 
in Geneva and the only "strong officer" in the Y.GB Legal Resi­
dency. He implied that his friendship with G1J·,<, a former memb'9r 
of t~e KGB Second Chief Directorat~, ~as of longstandi~g. NOS­
ENKO related that he and Gt,;K were together near!)• every day in 
Geneva. They often went out together to chat and have a few 
drinks, and as a cor.sequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor­
mation about some of GUK's operations there. In 1964 NOSENKO 
told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the 
activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because he no ionger· 
had a good iriend there like GUK, who had been reassigned to 
I<GB Headquarters. ..n-,en question~d later in 1964 about 'his 
relationship w.ith GUK, NOSE!lKO said he hau come to kno·,., GUK 
w~ll only during his 1962 TDY in Geneva. 
6. Availability for Meetings with CIA 
In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed 
displeasure over ~.AAK•s insistence on deferring their luncheon 
(at which NOSENI<O sought contact with Arn~ric:an Intelligence) 
until three days later. When ths first meeting with CIA did 
take place on 9 June 1962, ?,OSENKO stayed. for three hours, 
and it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled 
for 11 June. This second meeting in 1962 lgsted seven hours. 
NOSENKO remained in Geneva until 15 June, and in the interim 
he met CIA officers three more times for o•,er seven hours 
altogether. He offered to ~eet again on the d~y of his ce­
parture, but this proposal was rejected as needlessly endan­
gering his security. 
From the first 1964 meeting on 23 January to his defection 
en.; February, NO.SENKO was met a total of 13 times, the sessions 
lasting for five or six hours. He was able to co~e to the CIA 
safehouse every day but one, and this opportunity was skipped 
at the request of the CIA handlers. By mutual consent, most 
of the meetings started in the afternoon, but on two occasions 
NOSEHKO arrived as early ~s 0930 hours; several meetings went 
on until past midnight.· NOSENKO appeared to be totally at 
the disposal of CIA, to be the master of his time, and to have 
no other demands for his attention except for the visits to 
the !<GB Legal Residency, "looking in" on an occasional session 
of the Disarmament Conference, and attendance at a reception •
