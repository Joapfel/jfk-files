The knowledge of NOSENKO concerning cases, KGB operations, 
and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department 
and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The 
scope of his knowledge_of his. own ciepartment_when considered in·t~to_ 
is br.oader after 1957_ than before, which is compatible with_his claim of 
. increased responsibilities. His knowl~dge ·of the wor~ of other departments 
. of the SCD ·from the late 1950 1s on is also more extensive, which is also a 
further indication that NOSENKO actually held the claimed positions 
during this period of time.
