.thinkin~ about exposing the role of Miami attorney Alex E.~ARLSON, 
residing 145 Curtiss Parkway, Miami Springs Florida in the 
Bay of ~igs operation. AMCARBON-1 stated that, if CARLSON were· 
.of any ~urrent interest to REUTEMAN1 then the Identity 3 would 
soft pe1dle the CARLSON angle. REUT.EMAN advised AMCARBON-1 that 
he had no interest in CARLSON but knaw of him and was of the 
opinion
1
that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney. The receipt 
of this operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON 
on the dentity 3's over-all interest in the role that CARLSON had 
played n the Bay of Pigs invasion. This briefing, in turn, 
enabled CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting 
with AM·ARBON-1. While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this 
Bay of ~igs story, he never did put anything into print as the story 
was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish 
his res,arch. 
L """I':. In WAVE~4, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-1 advised 
JMWAVE ,hat Mr. Trevor~RMBRISTER
1 
an associate editorfor the 
Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting 
to rese~rch a story regarding the possibility that strategic 
missiles were hidden in Cuban caves. This information enabled 
JMWAVE ~o keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles 
which mtght be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba. ! . 
Id., In WAVE 4701 1 dated 20 September 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
gave JMWAVE his -resume of the discussions which he had with 
AMBIDDY~l at th~ Miami Playboy Club on 19 September 1963. This 
information was useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1 
was telling the press.

I e. In WAV~ 5661 1 dated 10 October 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with 
AMBIDDY~l's public relations man. This operational intelligence 
was useful in terms of keeping KUBAR.1< advised as to what A11BIDDY-! 's 
represe~tatives-were telling the outside world about their 
operati9nal activities. 
: f. In WAVE 6910 1 dated 31 October 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were 
being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK 
vessels
1
which were located in South Florida waters. This 
information .alerted JhlWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny was 
going to be directed toward the Identity 5. Armed with this warn­
ing, JMWAVE was able to take action which minimized the publicity 
repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5. 
g. In WAVE76711 dated 16 November 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
reported to J\lWAVE the fact that he had receiv<:d a letter from 
Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one 
Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno 1 Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE1 
Headquarters and the Lima Station~ This examination revealed 
that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no 
real operatio~al potential in this lead. This incident did undersccre 
the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significan1 
operational leads to JMWAVE's attention. 
h. In WAVE 1614 1 dated 6 February 1964 1 AMCARBON-1 
advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous tulephone calls 
indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had aefected 
from a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previous Y 
been seen •in ~Hami ·during November or December 1963. At the same 
time AMCARB0~-1 pointed out that he was suspieious and thought 
that
1
these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was Lot a bona. 
fide defector but was either a GOC agent or a KUBAR~ t,lant, who 
was being use~ as a means of creating an incidunt which would 
embarrass the GOC, as a result of U.eir fishinJ boats penetrating
