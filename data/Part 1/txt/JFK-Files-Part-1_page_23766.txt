1. Purnant to the suggestion containe4 in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965, 
n aake4 JAGUAR to lay on auoh ooverage as the7 oould manage. Attar some 
weeks has paeae4, and JAGUAR had not moved in this 4irection, we rel)'!atecl 
our request, po~nting out t!:iat ST!:BCHY/1 would soon be leaving. Short­
ban4e4 and ha111pered. b7 oertain restriotions, JAGUAR move4 in to 4o what

tol4 them to lay off' (much to our ohagrin) f'or the time beiq. Thia the7

Ve 4on1 t know axaotly how long they aotually ha4 him in their aigllts, 
'but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he vaa 
watohed on 5, 6 an4 7 June. A JAGUAR offioer advised us informally 
that s/1 "seemed. to be out'of' tOWD" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had 
mentioned that he might take s/1 to the oount17 for a day, but ve don't 
knov whether in faot he did so.) 
2. Here is JAGUAR'• note,
