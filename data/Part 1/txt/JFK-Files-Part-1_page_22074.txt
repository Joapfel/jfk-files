- NOSD:KO received no written reports on the results 
of the stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss. 
this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during 
the first month of surveillance, periodi~ally after that. 
These discussions took pl.ce either by telephone, or when 
KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or w~en NOSENKO 
visited l-~OZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters. Fro:n KOZLOV 
or perhaps someone else, NOSE'NKO learned that the post h~d 
'been discontinued after 90 days. On the basis of these 
conversations with KOZLOV, NOSE!-.KO knew'that nothing of 
interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur-
veillance.

from KOZLOV that tte post had bee.n replaced by periodic 
inspections. 
- N03ENKO did not report this incident of surveillance 
on the Pushkin Street dead drop site to his CIA contacts 
in Geneva jn Jun.e 1962 because the post had already been 
discontinued by this time wit~out anything unusual or sus­
picious h~ving been noted. Therefore he thought that this 
incident wo~ld not be particu:arly interesting to the CIA. 
CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street 
dead drop site only once, on 30 December 1961, a year later than 
NOSENKO says, in response to qn apparent signal from PENlCOVS~IY. 
The sequence of events was as follows: On 27 December 1961, 
following receipt of what seemed to be the prearranged signal 
fr9ffl PENKOVSKIY' that the drop had been loaded, Air Force Captain 
Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the u.s. Embassy to 
alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night, ABIDIAN 
left in his own car for Spass<;> House, the Ambassador '.s residence 
where a dance was in progress. to tell the CIA Chief of Station, 
Paul GARBLER, about the signal. ABIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso 
House with the other guests at about 0200 on 28 December in 
ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part 
of his "drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was 'to leave a mark. • 
Later in the morning of 28 December, ABIDIAN, again in.his own 
car drove from the Embassy to Dh-.'IDSON's apartment, ·W'hare he 
first checked the telephone pple visually from the window and 
then walked by it for a closer e~a~ination. Although it was 
not certain that the telephone c4lls received on 27 December. 
had, 'in fact, been a signal from PE.'-KOVSKIY and although no ·. 
supplementary mark was fourid on the telephone pole, a decision 
vas reached to check the drop. Therefore, at 1115 on 30 Decem­
ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Embassy Economics
