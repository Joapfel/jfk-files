-10 April 1964: "I made a mistake [when] I said I 
accepted the cases from KIIRENOV .... I accepted the cases 
from Pavel Fedorovicl1 PAUKRATOV. This was in the beginning 
of 1954." 
-15 April 1964: NOSElHCO said that he thought he turned 
over the correspondent files to F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned 
to the USSR from Australia in May 1954). UOSENKO asked 
when the PETROVs defected in Australia; he explained that 
he was not sure about KISLITSYIT and could have given them 
to another officer. "If IaSLITSYN came [back from Australia] 
.in 1953, then it was to KISLITSYU. Otherwise, it was some­
·one else." 
·-18June 1964: "KISLITSYN came into the.Embassy Sectioh 
in 1954 and:rgave him the files oh American correspondents. 
DUDYLDIN also joined the section this year and took th~ 
files on·the Army Attache and.his assistants from PAIJKRATOV.

· which he most often _gave for his entry into the KGB, is. _ .. 
correct, this would place the turnover in the fall of 1953. 
_· On other--. occasions --he .has· said specifically that he turned

(agentura) at his disposal in operations against Army
