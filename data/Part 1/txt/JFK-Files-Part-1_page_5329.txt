MEMORANDUM FOR TIIE RECORD 
SUBJECT: . Letter from Louis A. Brun to FSO Felder • 
1. I talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops Support 
Staff) at· 0840 hours this morning about the. letter mailed 
to FSO Felder at the American-Embassy iri Port au·Pri"nce, . 
Musulin said that he had spoken with Brun ab~ut. the .. letter 
and Brun had assured him that Felder said to mail letters 
to him through Foreign Service ma U channels·~· . Brun .is in 
contact with Felder during h1s·v1s1ts to Haiti and.this . 
system was la id on between them dm• ing ~n:e of hi~ tr i~s. -
2. Brun also said that·be:·was a little ·upset about· 
the problems which 'bad arisen- in sending· his:.letter.·•, _Brun 
said that be bad received a letter from Felder (mailed in 
Hew York City) saying that be _had naver .race•i~Eld the-.letter: 
from Brun. Brun was r.oncerned that the le.tter, may'.·have • 
fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti. •ifus.uU:'n\said that 
be would try to recover the letter and send it .:back to 
Brun. 
3. I tol'ct Musblin that Ambassador Ross was· very raucb 
disturbed about this matter and that any. further involve­
ment by the Agency with correspondence between ar.un and-. 
Felder should be avoided. Brun is a business agent of • 
Clemard Joaeph-ChaTlea and thus any ·corresponder,ce between • • 
Brun and an official Qf the American Embas~y is ·of parti-·.· 
cular concern to tbe·Ambassador·because of the obvious 
political implications. Musulin said he understood this 
and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any .correspondence 
111 tbe future would be bis own responsibility-. :
