ing, ho dctr•1'rt.ed four or five days later in civili.an clct.~es 
for his fi,~l duty station, Scvietskaya Gavad in the Soviet 
Far East. NOSENKO claims to ~ave chosen this post, con­
sidered g~norally to be the least desirable of all naval 
assign~111.11, on his own initiative, to prove to his father 
that ne WQM a man. (The above was hi~ account in 1966, in 
all earlier ~ccounts he s~id he went to the Soviet Far East 
in the fall of 1950, and in fact said that he had two months' 
leave in l 'i~2, one !or each of two 1•ears there. However,

fonnation f cc::-i J\r:lcr ica:, public,1tions reporting navi:tl de­
velop~ent~. Asked in April 1964 for any personal account 
of his own w-:>rk, t:os:::?:J<O was able to think of onl1• • four or 
five trips• on small ships to the coast of Sakhalin,• and 
three to H~~kaido, to drop or pick up agents. ll1s own role, 
he said, W4B as a tr~i~ee: he was taken along only "to iearn 
how it wao done;• he himself never trair.ed or dis?atched any 
agents, nor did he know the identities er missions c! any 
others. Ho ~lso could not descrite the ships he had travelled 
on. Que&til')ned on the location of Sovetskaya Gavan' in 1965, 
NOSENKO in•isted that this city is lccateu in Primorskiy 
Kray, alth~ugh it is actually located in Khabarovskiy Kray.••

a sanitoriui:i near ~cscow under treatltent for tuberculosis. 
He said he was cou;~ing up •half a glass of biood at a til::ie.• 
(X-rays an~ acdical exa=inations from February 1964 have 
detected nr., indications that ~OSE~KO ever suffe=ed from 
tuberculosis.) 
- At this tiree, the sum.mer of 1952, NOSENKO said he was 
offered in ¥.osco·,1 ar. opportunity to attend the GRU strategic 
intelligence school, the Hilitary-Diplo.~atic A~ademy, but 
turned it down because he had already studied most of the 
course rnatt~r in the Institute of International Affairs;~~­
sides, NOSCiKO said in Octobe= 1966, he failed the physical 
examination when sugar was discovered in his faeces . 
• - NOSE!n<:O was then transferred--without returning to 
the Far Eaat--to the !ntelligence Staff of the Baltic Fleet 
.at Baltiysk. He ir.ver.ted a story in 1964 about going there 
In October 1~~6 NOSE~KO was asked whether he had ever been 
to Sakhalin; his ans~er was no.
