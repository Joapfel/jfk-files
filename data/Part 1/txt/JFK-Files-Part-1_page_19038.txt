elections last fall. is directli.· attrfbutable both 
to its own well-publicized int~rhal dissens.ion a~ 
to voter preference for the Christian Democrats and 
Socialists deriving from the image of vigor.and•

,,,hich ·is unlikely--it is do~btful: that the Nf'D will 
be an}' more successful than ether fringe grOUFS have 
been in seeking to rally latent riyht-radical se~ti­

Election Setbacks 
The NPD has claimed wide 
attention both in Germany and 
abroad and led many observers 
to co~clude that it wati a force 
to be r~cko·ned wi-th. • i-Hthin two 
and a h3lf years of its founding 
in November 1964, the party 
elected representatives to the 
legislatures in five of West 
Germany's ten states (11 counting 
West Berlint. In electibns this 
April the iarty ~as expected to 
obtain close to 10 percent of 
the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate 
and 12 to 15 percent in Schleswig­
Holstein but actually won only 
four seats i~ each p.:irliament 
with 6.9 and 5.8 percent of the 
vote respectively. In the 4 June 
election in the party's "home 
base b.:istion" of Lower S-.:1xony, 
the NPD's performance ~as si~i­
larly unimpressive--7 r,~rcent 
of the_ vote and 10 Landt.Jg seats .. 
E.'nphasis by pa:·ty leaders 
on their success in g..1ining rep'­
resentation in all the states 
where the party has co."'.!.;:eted 
during the past year has not 
masked their disappoint.."'.".ent that 
the ~PD's momentum of c:-owth has 
leveled off. The part;•s failure 
to make a good showi:- . .; in 
Schleswig-Holstein a:~d Lower 
Saxony--areas considered particu­
L~rlv susceotible to ra.tionalist 
appe;ls--is·especially d~maging, 
ar.d raises fundamental doubt 
about the party's futu:-e pros­
.pects.
