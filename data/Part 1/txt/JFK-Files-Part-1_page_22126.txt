NOSE:NKO has given different dates for the time ~hen he left 
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Departmer.t to become 
Chief of the American-British-canadian Section·of the Tourist 
Department. During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on 
·different occasions that this occur;-red in January 1962 and in 
February 1962: in 1964 h.e timed the transfer as fallir.g between 
15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSEN!<O gave the 
date as 2 or 3 .:·a1nuary 1962. He has also reported that he was 
in th~ U.S. Embassy Section for three mom:hs ilft.er John ABIDIAN 
serviced the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus 
placing NOSENKO in the U.S. Embassy Section until late March 
1962) and that he had tran3ferred to the Tourist Department by 
the til':le OOL!TSYH defected (which NOSENKO placed in mid-January 
1962 but which actually occurred in mid-December ~961).* W.E. 
JOP.N50N, the target of a Tourist D.apartment operaticn** con­
firmed that NOSENKO approached him in Moscow o~ 5 January 1962. 
!n fobruary 1965 NOSF..NKO said he recalled that the correct· 
date of his approach to JOHNSON was on 5 January 1962. The CIA 
intex:viewer then remir,ded NOSENKO that he had earlier described 
on several. occasions his visit to the dead drop site on Pushkin 
Stre~t and his receipt of reports from the surveillance post 
for three months afterwards: during all of this period, NOSENKO 
had said, he was in the u.s. Embassy Section of the First Depart­
ment. NOSENKO was told that CIA records show that ABID!A.~ made 
only one visit to this dead drop site, on 30 December 1961, six 
days before the approach to JO~SON. He answered only that he 
might have been confused, but despite any contradictions the 
"~" (his err,phasis) were the important thing, not any corre­
lation of dates.
