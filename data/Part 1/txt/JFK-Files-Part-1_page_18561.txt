1 •. ·1 would solicit Career M·anage~cnt Group .and the Promotta"n Panel 
to consider the overall career of Calvin. W. Hicks when deciding on the cur­
rent cycle• of promotions from GS-iJ·to 'GS-14. • •• ' :- ~. \ 
2 •• After Mr. Hicks ·EOD in I 950~ he advanced rapidly in three years 
fo GS-11. He :was pro~oted to GS-12 ·in 
1
1956, six yeari. later to.GS-13 in 
.19'62, and.since then has bee:n.almos·t 12 years in gfade. __ He.has had over­
seas to~rs with FE and·Nt Divisions; has sef"led as a training instructor, on 
a PM task, force, and with Miami Ops 'ahd area branches fo WH. In th~se • •• 
;assign~'e~ts he. consiste~tly received Strong ,ratings. Despite a largely para- .• 
• military background, .in· I 967 he adjusted to. the ·1ntcliigenc·e productioh'cycle .• 
. and developed the skills __ c,i i:ui operat_kn,is! officer. d~in<J op~ratlons·-ortented. 
reports -work fo. the Intelligence' Watch. As of this date he has the longest 
continuity in'the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful 
individual whe'. exercises excellen't ,professional Judgment. He was recom-
. mended for. prom6tion-from GS-13 to Gs-.1,nn April 1968 and in April 1969. 
·In T970 he was· recorrimendetf fdr a QSI-biF:I Chief,. Peer deSilva. He was.­
•• ·again rec<>mmended for prooidtion ·in.March 197·1, in Noverriber 1972, and in 
November 1973. 
3 •. Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are· rela­
tiye and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of 
.his caree_r would seem to argue the.equity; of granting·the often recommended 
promotiori to Mr •. Cal'.'in Hicks as ho nears ·the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is 
49 years old and has a, family of five children. He has a medical hold which 
will not allow him to' serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem­
plates retirement at age SO (in late I 974) ., He is and will be until then a 
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch. 
4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last 
decade be granted at the tin:ie of this year's promotion cycle.
