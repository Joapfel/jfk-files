The effectiveness or non-effectiveness of NOSENKO during his 
assignment to the First Section, First Department, from mid-March 
1953 to late May 1955 can have little pertinency in _the question of the 
bona £ides of NOSENKO if it is accepted that he actually was an officer 
in the First Section during this period_ of time. It is felt that information 
furnished by NOSENKO in current interviews and in previous interviews 
is of sufficient scope and detail that his clail:ned service as. an officer 
in the First Section during this period of tune is completely acceptable.
