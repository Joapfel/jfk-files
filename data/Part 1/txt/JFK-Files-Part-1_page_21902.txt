While in the hos­
pital, NOSENKO ap­
plied for release 
from military ser­
vice. This was as­
sisted by father's 
friends. After 
release from the 
hospital he did not 
want to return to 
school. lle called 
his father and then 
spent a week with 
friends of the 
family in Leningrad 
before gettiag a 
rcom in a dormitory 
at the Leningrad 
Shipbuilding Tekh­
nikurn. Despite 
failure to return to 
the Naval Prep 
School, NOSENKO was 
cr~dited with satis­
factory completion 
of the school yoar 
(Tenth Class). In 
June he passed the 
exams for the Second 
Course at the Ship­
building Tekhnikum. 
He then went to the 
District Military 
Commissariat and was 
demobilized. He

1965 
In the hospital 
NOSENKO decided he 
could not return to 
school as he was 
asha:,:cd of the type 
of girls he had been 
with the night of 
the accident and 
could not stand the 
thought of being 
made an example of 
by the school KOMSO­
MOL organization. 
He left the hospital 
in civilian clothes 
and stayed with a 
friend of his father. 
He obtained a state­
ment· that he had 
attended the Naval 
Prep School, which 
was just a report of 
his courses and an 
average of his marks 
up to that time. As 
the son of a minister 
it was then easy for 
him to enter the 
Shipbuilding Tekh­
nikum whete-, with 
special tutoring, he 
was able to complete 
the Tenth Class in 
the summer. (May) 
Apri.l 1966 
"After this (hand 
shooting) incident I. 
..did not :.:want to go 
back to the school 
and began to study 
at the Shipbuilding 
Tekhnikum in Lenin­
grad, in the Second 
Course, in order to 
complete the Tenth 
Class. In May or 
June 1945, with the 
help of the Director 
of the Tekhnikum, I 
received documenta­
tion certifying that 
I had completed the 
Second Course which 
made it possible f~r 
me to enter the In­
stitute (of Inter­
national Relations) 
and I returned to my 
parents in Moscow.•
