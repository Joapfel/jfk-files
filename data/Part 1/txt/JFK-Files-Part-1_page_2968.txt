Comment: In December 1959, a month after ~ECHTE!l' s 
return from the USSR, the FBI learned that he 
had revealed his homosexual compromise and 
recruitment by the KGB to a m~mber of his tour 
group. NO SENKO cited the !PECHTE~ case not D6 
from memory, but from his\.r.ritten notes brought 
to Geneva in 1964. Although presumably a. 
Seventh Department case, NOSENKO did not relate 
it to his s~rvice there in 1959, nor did he 
indicate the source of his information.
