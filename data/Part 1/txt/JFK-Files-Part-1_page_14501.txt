,. 2. QUS~UIN:..37 is tar more confident than we are, about 
• ,the ~sibility of getting access to the building during the· 
·construction phase ·to possibly install various audio devices. 
·ve believ,L-tbis opcratlon to be a formidable one and we might 
be challenged -by .the ·presence io lb.drid of PBRUMEN security 
fori~es overseeing the construction, tho presence of PBRlntEN 
electricians ~d other professions, complicating the access 
to the building. ~o believe AllAtJT0-1 has the Bomanil1ll. 
experieoc·e well in mind and -most likely will do everything 
within bis power to overcome the post;ibility o! an audio 
pen_etration of his building. 
3. We wow:d be grateful for any information addressees 
might have on tbe.gen~ral modus operandi of PDRUYKN security 
forces in areas wbere PBBmi.EN. official· installations have been 
constructed. Have· tbe7 used ·pBRUlIBN technicians, electricians, 
constructiou··engirieers-, etc'l Also we woulu like to know whether 
the· PBRUWi:.'G have _installed their own telephone system or have 
they generally relied on the system of the host country. We 
would·appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or 
other addressees would like to make on the best 
course of action tor the Station to consider. QUS~UIN-37
