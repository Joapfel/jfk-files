-"the cult of ~T/\LI11 ·.i~- ·much that I heard in the KGB 
about the reiqn of STALIN, all this left it.s mark and 
forced me to think deeply about the real truth anc to 
look at evr:r,thing mor-~ critic3.lly. Already I no 
longer had f~ith in all these ideas which for years 
had been preened into my head. 
"3. The new leaders (KiiRU.SIICHEV and Company) 
used the same methods but already diluted with the 
water of dem0cracy, with playing up to che people 
and attempts to convince them that a new era would 
arise, a new and better life, and that now the Party 
was ~lways going to concern itself with the welfare 
of t~1e peopl<::. In fact, it was a struggle for power 
and the use of all.means in this struggle;"even 
microphone~ (they listened to the conversacion~ of 
BERIYA and his friends: later they listened to the 
conversations of MOLOTOV, MALENKOV, KAGJIJWVICH, and 
others). · KIIHUSIICl!EV' s endless blabbing about suc­
cesses, when in fact they didn'c exist, the figures 
at.out how tiiC;; USSR had.passed the USA ir. the produc­
tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were 
available onl:1 infrequently. The endless promise,s 
of a better life when in fact nothing of the sort is 
taking place. All this similarly forced rne to re­
evaluate not only the events which were taking place 
in the country, but already the entire ideology of 
the Party, its external and internal course. 
• •4. The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000 
to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this 
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with many 
casualties. This also maJe a deep impression on me. 
When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev, 
from my relatives--my father's t.rothers--I understood 
well the real relation of the workers both to the 
leadership and to the Party as a whole. At the same 
time I saw how the workers really lived, how they eat, 
what they have and what they =an buy with their wages. 
•s. I heard a great deal from my father about 
the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the. 
devel·opment and the course of· cons'truction in industry, 
about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno­
logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci­
sions in regard to many industries, and this was not 
only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor­
tant leaders in various fields of industry (MALYSHEV, 
VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But-no one dared to 
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father 
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci- • 
sion would ba incorrect, he received such a rebuff. 
from KHRUSHCHEV. that he Wall p;re>foundly sh~en and in 
the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill­
ness in-1956 and his death in August 1956.
