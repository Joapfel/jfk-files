Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four.years' 
duration and that Lecause he failed a state exa·rnination he 
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of flve years' 
duration and he graduated In 1950, on schedule; and that it 
was of five.years' duration but he failed an examination 
which delayed his graduation for three months . . 
Comment: See p.367for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB 
upon graduation from the Institute in 1947. 
The duration of the Institute course and the 
date of NOSENKO's completion are material to 
the plausibility of l1is claimed Naval RU service, 
which he said followed almost immediately upon 
his departure from the Institute.
