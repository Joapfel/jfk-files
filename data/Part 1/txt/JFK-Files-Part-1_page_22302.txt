According to NOSENKO, he maintained t~e file on physical 
security at the U.S. E~bassy, aod it contained detailed 
floor plans and photographs of the installation. SOSESKQ ~as 
unable to give the location or the floor of the office of 
any single individual or component or the Embassy, including 
those of the Ambassador, or hie own tar~ots (ABIDIAN. the 
■ 111\ary code rooia, and the SUtfl Oepartef'nt c-,,miaunic-atlona

reported as the "seventh, oighth, Iii.nth, and tontl\ floorA,'' 
or "seventh and up," or the "top four floors." SOSE~KO did 
not remember how many floors there are in the Embass~. nor 
was he even sure hnw many floor~ were included in the r~stric­
ted ar~a. (The restrict£'.d area in fact consists of the top 
three floors, the eighth, ninth, and tenth.) 
t. Knowledgeability about American Intelligence Perso~nel 
1.'0SESKO said that not only the deputy chief but every 
officer in the section could id<::1tify the known and suepecte<l 
A:aerican lntelligenco personnel in the E:nbassy. Nevert;1eless, 
he himself did not know about three CIA officers (MAIIOSEY, 
:~RELL., and GARBLER) whoa the KGB had dcfinit.e l y identifi~ 
as such before their assignments to Moscow in 1960-1961. For 
example, .MORELL·, whose overt CIA affiliation was officially 
announced b)' the Embassy to the Soviet ~in ister of Foreign 
Affairs, was under direct and active cultivation by KOVSJr_'lC 
and the KGB First Chief Directorate officer K.N. S~IR~OV in 
1960-1961; NOSE~KO knew nothing about this (although asked 
leading questions ~nd given hir.ts) and did not identify 
"MORELL as a CIA officer. Four of the seven offic~rs ~hom 
be said the KGB suspected to be CIA had never had any such 
affiliation. He could not give a~y information at all on 
the person he said the KGB considered to be the CIA chief 
in Yoscow, KLOSSON, either on his Moscow activity and contacts 
or on the extent and results of KGB coverage,. or on his per­
sonal situation and background. He could not explain why 
KLOSSO~ was considered to be the CIA chief, but 3aid that 
"every officer thought be was." 
g. Knovledgeability of KGB Code Clerk Operations 
As bis main task, the prime reason he was moved into 
the U.S. Embassy Section, NOS[~KO alleged, was to supervise 
t.he operational work against American code clerks. In this 
capacity he closely guided the work of case officers GRYAZNOV 
and KOSOLAPOV. • NOSESKO shared an office with his two sub­
ordinates, and the three were within sight and hearing of 
•According to GOLITSYN, mo knew both men well. GRYAZSOV was 
"a very experienced'' case officer with some success; he had 
spent about the last five years of his 16 years in the KGB 
in the American Department and was a specialist in code 
clerk operations. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had about 
ten years' KGB experience and, like GRYAZSOV, was specializing 
against code clerks in 1960. •
