ning away f:om sc~Q~l back to ~r.sc~~ in January 1944. !n 
earlier acccunte h~ said he ~as aL the prcparat~ry school there 
from Cctober 1942 U."ltil Jnr,•Jary 19.:4. C<lrlicr he had al~o 
giver. e:x:::,ansive a.•·d char.gir.g accounts of ~is escape fro!'l set.col 
to join t~e Soviet front against the Germans at Tuapse~ nj. he 
admitted th~t this wao a lie. By cuttir.g the ti1!l~ he '-38 in 
Baku fro::i 15 i,\or,ths to about t~ree, i;osENKO also .J.dmitted im­
~lic!tly that his accounts of the ba~ic-trdinir.q he received 
ir, the prc:paratcry school, of the BlLm\er he sper.t working at 
the school rather than returning to Moscow on vacatic~, a~d of 
his •certainty• that he celLbrated his lSth birthday in B3ku 
were also false. 
NOSCJKO has Leen relatively consistent in r~counting the 
events of 194<. In 1964, 1965 and again in 1966 he told of 
studying as a11 •external" student in ~osco-.., to complete his 
ninth year of schooling and of rejoining his classmates from 
Baku ~hen the naval preparatory school ret~rn~d to Lenir.grad 
in the autU'V\ of 1544. On several occasions durin1 1964 and 
1965, NOSEt,!<O cesc::-ibed how he anrl hi:1 classmates spent Octcber 
and Novcm~cr 19~4 working in the woods ncar'Ler.ingrad before 
beginning their ter.th grade studieo late in the year; t,e o:nitted 
this account from his ttpril 1966 autobiography. 
:,OSENKO' s account of the next years is similarly mar~ed 
with a r,u::lber of i:..co;,sistencies and falsehoods. ( In t.'-ac 
latter category he has clai~ed and later acl~itted as ~ntr~e ~hat 
he atter.ded the Fru:1ze 1-:aval Academ1 fr-om 1g4 3 to 1J44, that 
he was on bCtive milit~ry duty until being demobilized in 1945, 
and that he "'as &hct ir. the hand by a jealous young naval o!fi­
cer in 1945.) According to the account given unuer interroga­
tion in l,pril ::. 964, t.:OSE:;Ko W.3s c;hot in the hand at a puty in 
the end of April 1945, was hospitalized, resigned from the 
preparatory school, and received a certificate of satisfactory 
co:npletion of the tenth grade, although he had been in school 
only si::ce t.ove!n!)er 1944. In 1965 and 1966 NOSENKO said, re­
spectively, that he was shot by a naval of(icer in February 
or ~arch 1945 3nd chat he shot himself in hearly" 1945; since 
the 1964 interrogations he has claimed only that he received 
a &t&te~ent of the courses ~e had attended at the preparatory 
school and that he cowpleted the tenth grade at the Shipb~ild­
ing Tekhniku:n in Leningrad. 
the Soviet. t-avy defector AiHA:-iONOV said he attended a naval 
preparatory school with t-!OSFtll<O during the period l H4 to 1946. 
ARTAAONOV, after ~OSENKO's defection was publicizeu, said he 
had kno"'-n a son of the 1-!inister NOSE~lKO in the navc!l school in 
Leningr.-.d fro::i ::,944 to 1946. He was then shown a picture of
