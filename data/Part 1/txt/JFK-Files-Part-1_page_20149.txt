S"JBJEC'l'a Jacques RICHAROOON - Recommendation tor Prom~ion 
1. Jacques_Richarda~ has _been under.JI(/ 11Uperrl.sion aa Deputy and 
"'Cue Officer: !9r. ·approxinutely tifteen month.a.- Baaed on the knowledge of 
·Richardson as an inrliv11wd v,ained r;lurine this period and upon hl8 actual 
pert<imance, I recoriwend that b& be entered for consideration on the SR 
Division 08-lli to 06-lS promotion list at this time - Junr. l?!,7. The slot 
and job ,rhich be nov occupies, Chief, Soviet Branr.h, is, ot course., adequate , 
·. tc accomod&te such a pl'OlllOtion. • • 
2. Richardson's operational performance bas belJll outstandinK and 
not:bl,y versatile i!'.irin{; this ~rl'Yi. H'.! h!!.!I e~ag"".! pri1Mr:l.!y tn liJJisnn 
• and has been personall:y aftect-ive 1n tems of results achi.,)ved almost daily.,, 
• in term., of reports, op&ratio~l dat.a, and joint. ent'lrpriseJ while, overall,, 
be has established enduring profeiisional relation9hips from which the 
organillation as a whole should ben9fit for some time to coiae. In addition, , 
owing in large part to u.n.iq-Je personal talents, lillgttiatic and otherwise, 
Rich&rdaon has han<D.ed a nui!!ber of unilatP.ral cil.sea most effectively. In 
the o!!ice, too, _as vell AS _in face-to-face ~rational 3ituations, Richardson 
has ~en l'.'~standirie~ He has a flair for ·an,I a facility with the written word 
as evidenced._ b:y the a.'1!0lUlt of genet"al and particular correirpondence vhieh he' 
has initiated, and he knovs the organizational "drill" intil!ately and frail 'tl&y 
back. • Thus, I feel that he is qualified tor. ~~he-NCOlllllWlnded promotion bJ' 
abilit7 and experience in both the intemel and external aspects of the 
profession. 
• . ' 
J. Relative to the 1110re ·personal characteristics imolved in the term, 
managerial ablli ti, ,judgments are r.eceesarily more Sl.lbjecthe but here, too, 
I consider Richardson to be qualified in m.a.turity, 1n ju1J?;'ll,;nt, and in 
experience. He would most certainly be a rrupervi.eor vho coul1 perf'onn all 
the chores or hancile all the situations vhich I-~ would bff calling upon 
sub::z:tlin..'ltes to take c:u-e ot, :I.a itself, the beginnirie o_t ariy good supervis~ry 
.· !"'?lationship.; In actual fact, he has had conBHerable experience in this 
regard alrea·dy and the prineipal shortGOmir,g I have noticed is a tenrlency to 
"carey" others by an exte?1Biori of his own inrhlstry. Richardson is not without 
his difficulties in the area of personal relationships. He is a purist.at· 
t-1.1!!-ell ·md l!IEH'li fc111t.ly impAt.1.-nt in. ci:irtain. tmman sttWltions where a shrua of, 
the shoulders would b~ the best reply. TIM:tse characterlstica de not alway~ 
111al<e for the best personal relationships but are f'reqsiently obiriated by 
intellect and above all are· correctable and are being corrected.
