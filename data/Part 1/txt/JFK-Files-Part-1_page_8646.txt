for any inforllllltion t,e could obtain from tho U .s. Embassy• bas avoided ~ ~ Ji ,-,; l1' \ l 
contact with AEDUII.ARD. at the French Club. LlllEALM·l • s wife, an almost t,;.v-j r1' W"'J.

b. Mrs. LIREALM receqtly told LlREALH·l that for a number of . ./ .ft-J" '. 
/
consecutive S!it-~rdays •. AEDlEHARD had brought a young lady, whom MRs LIREALM ~ • 
thinks to be Getaisn, to fhe Club as his guest. Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt 
to deterinine th_e identity of ~tie fe!l'llle • but n,ported the information to _ 
her husband. She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD1 a 
pattern ~f attivities at the Club. He ~as not seemed to single out any 
indlv~dual 11s a tennis psttner, nor ta be frequently s.aen socializing with 
anyone i~ particular while at the Club.

' 2. LIREALM-1 was advlsed t~st the Station had learned that. AEDIEHARD\(:)/\ ¢'(('- ,~.. • 
_will not return to_-~H illlllledlatejy as ongin,ally thought, but hP- will \.~~g;,c,1r" 
probably reir.1iu in, J1texico for another five months. LlREALM·l was told that 
this infor11111tion wa'S-' dot yet publi.: krio1<1ledge, but the Station would like 
UREALM-;l .to confirm this if possible. This led to a general discussion of 
LIREALM~l•s association \lith AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM•l 
was instructed that it was not the Statio~•s wish that he avoid contact wft'h 
AEDIEHARD, but ratlier that he not single o'ut AEDIEHARD for special attention 
or closely court his friendship. It is llbe :writer's opinion that a £uff1cient 
time has elapsed since the last incident for LIREALM·l to again renew some 
aaaociation with AEDi£HABD, and a psr~icOlsrly opportune cunce to do eo is 
avail-Ible: LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD both belong (as has prevlous:.y been reported) 
to a gcoup of tennis enthuslasu at the Club who take turns entectalni1'g each 
other in their ho111es. To dnte, all the members of this group have given-parties 
except LIBL\L.'f•l. Mrs. LIREALM, !ollovf.rig thQ'incident and thinking that AEDIEHARD 
va.s -s<>on to depart, has stated that she ,lid n~t viint to have A::DIERARD in her 
hotue since he t"ttpri11~ents a govern.uent _so opposed to the principles of her govern· 
llient, etc. sued on .,:::11r:R-\!lD's extension in He:xico and the fact that the LIREALM'• 
Q\.'e their fcionds a party, LIREAt.~ was lnetructed to plan a party for the group 
and to include AtDl!HARD and his wife 1n the group inv'ited. At the party, 
LlIU'.ALM·l should not focus an undue lll!!Ount of ,lttention on AtolF:HAPJ>, but ihould 
take advantage of the oppot"tunlty to ront'V th~ir gonoral friendahi~ and let the 
matter, lll0re or less, take its o~n heed fr.~m there. As a flrot otep in this 
g~r,cira~ direc.tion, LIREALM•l pl:11111 to KO to- the Club over the week6nd oe 6•7 
Soptombor ~t ti:::.,s _whoa ,-',EtIEHAB.D uoually playa tennis to at la111t 11ay bollo.
