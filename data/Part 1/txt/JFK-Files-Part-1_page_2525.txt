FEDOSEYEV who wanted KOVSHUKas a Deputy. 
Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOSENKO the 
position of Chief of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the· 
reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would 
become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The 
above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi­
cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to­
GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB. 
This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career 
•• of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section, 
an~ July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-

July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarks 
in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period of 
March - June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases
