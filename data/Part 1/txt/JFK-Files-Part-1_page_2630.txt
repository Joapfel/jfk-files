Top Secret 
(EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES) 
Notes for the Reader (Continued) 
NOSENKO's claims are judged in the light of his own 
assertions and in comparison with collateral information, 
It is not the function of the examination to speculate 
about possibly credible alternative explanations for the 
paradoxes reflected in NOSENKO's statements, except when 
such explanations are advanced by NOSENKO himself. 
If there is no immediate explanatory note pointing out 
the relevance or significance of some item in the text, the 
reader may expect that the item's relevance or significance 
usually will be developed in the immediately-following text. 
Otherwise seemingly minor points are included because of 
their aggregative significance: they will be a matter of 
comment .in the Summary and Coriclusions section following 
each major portion of the examination" 
Direct questions and NOSENKO's replies about his 
contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, retractions, 
omissions and the like, are reflected in the text. Where, 
during his interrogations, it was not possible to pose 
direct questions without furnishing NOSENKO information or 
insi~ht into th~ iriteriogators' purposes, the topic was 
covered exhaustively.if indirectly, and NOSENKO was 
provided every opportunity to comment on the matter in 
question. When the text indicates that ~OSENKO apparently 
was not asked about a particular matter, or that "he didn't 
·say", or "didn't comment" or "didn't indicate awareness 11 
and so. forth, the reader properly may assume that the 
matter was covered extensively. 
In instances in which NOSENKO ~ontradi~ts or retracts 
earlier assertions, no more weight is necessarily ·given 
to his final assertion as opposed ~o earlier corttrary claims. 
To assist the reader in following what are sometimes 
lengthy and complex accounts of events, NOSENKO's narrative 
is broken from time to time by a clearly identified 
editorial comment which seeks to draw the reader's attention 
to the relevance or significance of NOSENKO's assertions, 
.or to what conclusion is drawn.
