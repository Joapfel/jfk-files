in the summer of 1959, the recruitment of[Ge~ard M~RTENS] in July -
August 1959, and the recruitment o(Arr;.ene FRIPPEL7in 1959. The 
foregoing is not a complete list of all cases in which NOSENKO claims 
personal involvement, but is represe_ntative of cases in which his alleged 
participation has been confirmed by interviews with the individual who •

\Sir ·Allen LANE, Arthur BIRSE, William Staltley WILBY) and 
) 
(David TAYLOR)werelBritis~citizens and the other above-named indi­
viduals were\ United States; citizens. This would seem to substantiate 
the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was an 
officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-• 
wealth tourists in the USSR. 
In addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about 
r 
an operation against,Martin MALIA~ an American tourist who was in ' . . 
the Soviet Union from approximately September 1955 to December 1955. 
; MALIAjhas not been interviewed and will not be interviewed, so at this 
time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims involvement 
or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the 
ir.dividual involved.
