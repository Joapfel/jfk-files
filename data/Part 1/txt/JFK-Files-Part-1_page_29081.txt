- • In reviewing my previous fitness report and 
those of my predeces_sors, on this fine officer., I find myself hard put 
not to re~ca t what bas been sai"d _· so often b"~foro. She bas been the back­
bono of· th,is section· and. of those where she has worked previously. Her 
work has always shown exce!lent judgement and in~cnui ty.. A self-starter 
with t~emendous drive and discipline, the amount of work sho has produced 
bas b~e~ prodigious._ An excellent team worker, sho has nev(;r shirked vbe:i 
.as so often happens - she is asked to take on additional work or work on 
a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplOlllatic 
and tactful and is able to present suggestions nnd criticisms in a plea­
sant manner. She is one of the most dedi~ated person~ I have met in the 
Organization, and exce.ptionally dependable. While, as a,woman -and a 
Specialist, she bas had little opportunity to handle agents she bas done 
very well with those we have given her to handle. She has showed gre~t 
~bility in the traini-ng of two transcribers and in the deJ>riefing of t1to 
f~male agents and their husbands. This is in large part due toner in-
- -depth -knowledge of- the tnrgcts -tliis ·section - is working~ on. Tne past few -
months hnve .. ,be~n difficult__, _requiring the complete reorganization of this 
Section and the termination of the majority of. our assets. • Under this 
st_ress, she has performed in h~r usual outstanding· ~anner. Perhaps, 
even a little b~tter. Her hl\Ddling of a great deal of file work has b_een 
excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has 
maintained it in its present very good stat~. (continued)
