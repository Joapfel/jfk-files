"'fop Secret 
(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION January 1960-January 1962) 
exploiting the knowledge they had gained of their targets. 
During 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, within the section 
special emphasis was placed on "identifying intelligence 
officers in the Embassy and actively developing them, 
acquiring ciphers, and painstakingly studying code clerks, 
creating the basis·on which they can be recruited". 
As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO said, he had 
access to all information concerning its activities: 
"Nothing was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed 
certainty that.in 1960 and 1961 the KGB recruited no 
Americans associated -with the Embassy, there were no KGB 
agents among Americans as.signed to the Embassy in this 
period and, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American 
Embassy personnel since "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, recruited 
ca. 1953, seep. 33). From continuing friendships with 
his f·ellow-officers of 196G-and 1961, who remained in the 
section when NOSENKO transferred, NOSENKO has also claimed 
certainty that there- were.no KGB recruitments from the 
time he left the section in January 1962 until his January 
1964 departure in Geneva. 
Transfer~ the American Embassy Section 
i 
In ·December 1959~ while serving as Deputy Chief of the 
American Section of the Seventh Department, NOSENKO learned 
from the Department Chief DUBAS of plans to transfer him 
back to the American Department's American E~assy Section, 
as Deputy Chief. NOSENKO said _he was opposed to the move 
and wanted to· remain in the Seventh.Department: 
"I was u~ed to it there and wanted to continue. 
I wanted to stay in the Seventh Department. This 
[the transfer] was i'ld pr:omotion. Here I was the 
Deputy Chief of section· and would be the .same 
there. The American Department is, of course, the· 
most important. But here I was working against 
American tourists. This is also important. 
Furthermore, I showed [had proven] myself there in 
'55, '56, '57, '58, and '59 and was considered to 
be not a bad case officer. And there, in the 
American Department, I must prove myself with new 
i,eople."
