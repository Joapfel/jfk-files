10 August 1965,, . lind_er ques'tioniug by DERYABIN, NOSE~"XO 
r'ZlpP.ated the chronology of his promotions gh·cn CUl 26 Janµary 
1965. He again explained that hP:was pu~·up for captain in 
1956, but this tim~ said that.tho\promoti6n had been blocked 
on the gl'ounds that he should. 'toe. made to. wait becaus_e of 
shortcomings in his work. Asked why he had told CIA that ho 
had beAn a major during the 1962 meetings and again in tho 
bio~raphy prepared· in I-'rank·furt, KOSE~KO· repli~d that hr 
thought the truo story would not ho believed. • 
17 April 1966: In a voluntary statement, NOSENKO ..,·rote 
the following: "In Ma1·.:h l.951, with the rank of Junior lieu­
tanant, I ~tarted service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh

ant colonel ond the trnvc>l crclt•~· which you know of, with the 
rank of lieutenant coloc~l, was filled out erroneously.** 
.19 April 1966: In a n~w version of his autobiography, 
NOSENJm included the following statc>me11t: "in July 1956 I 
became a c~ndidate mcmbcl' of the CPSU, soon after v.·hich I re­
ceived a promotion at work: I becama a senior case officer 
and was given the rank or senior lieutenant. In August 1957 
I was acc~pted into the CPSU, and during the second half of 
1958 was appointed Dt•puty Chief of th,·: Second Section, Seventh 
Department. On 29 HecC'n:ht:-r 1959 I was pror.iotcd to the rank of 
captain. ----.-------
26 October 1966: "I li~!d when I said I was a lieutenant )l 
colonel in 1964. I was only a captain." Asked why·he had 
.,, said in 1962 that he was then a major, i,OSE~-KO replied: ,' 
.-"There was no conversation about rank in 1962. About my po­
sition, I ~aid I was in th~ Tourist Department. That's all." 
To. su11JJ11arizc what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while 
-serving in tho KGB: He bcc:unc a senior lieutenant in 1952, 
April 1953, 1954, or 1956; a captain in 1956 or Septembcr/Octo­
b~r/Deccmber 1959; a major in Dece~ber 1058 or 1959; and a 
lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963. (The latter 
clailll was verified by thC' official KGB document listing him as 
a lieutenant colonel as of Dc\~emt>er 1963.) · On tho other hand, 
NOSUHCO has indic:ated that his highest rank in ·the KGB was • • 
captain, and tha€ be never advanced to a majority or a lieu-. 
ten~nt colonelcy. • 
•At about this time, in t>arly 1965, 
ROSENKO was only a· captain and bad advanced to n1s ~enio~- ,
