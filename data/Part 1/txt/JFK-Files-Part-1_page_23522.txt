versation struck uncomfortably close to the P.UJ.:A!IOID-1 and HWJvl0ID-2. 
operation, we attempted to discourage subject by pointing out that 
such a proposal was illegal and would have drastically dangerous· ••

We asked if Foreign Minister LA..~ had approved this censorship .... 
proposition and also inquired how the Foreign Office could possibly 
interest itself in a matter which would see!:! to come under the • 
jurisdiction of Seguridad Publica. POVEDA.'iO replied that it. ·had not 
been discussed in plain words with LARA, but that he would ciscuss it 
with him in order ~o determine whether the matter shoula be dropped 
or explored further. He was cautioned not to tell LARA of his 
conversations with the Er:lbas·sy officers. 
6. Several days l~ter subject advised that he had discussed 
the matter fully with Foreign 1-:inister LARA and that the latter had 
,been extremely interested in the proposal. However, LA.IU pointed 
out that the Foreign Office had no jurisdiction in this regard and 
told POVEDANO to discuss the proposition with Lt. Col. Gonzalo SEGARES, 
Oficial Mayor of Seguridad Pub.lica.

about the idea and authorized subject to ec.rry .out further study and
