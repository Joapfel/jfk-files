CHAPTER I 
FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS 
Evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides is comprised of his own 
statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials, 
and the counterintelligence information he has provided. 
NOSENKO's Statements About Himself 
In his meetings in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad and in 
. th-e course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has; made 
numerous statements about himself. More than any other, 
however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial 
hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtfu1 and 
well-expressed exposition of how he wished CIA to r~gard 
him. It is quoted here in its entireiy. 
·i' 
My life, my childhood and youth passed in very 
comfortable circumstances since the position of 
my father gave us th~ opportunity to live without 
lacking for anything. And the only difficult • 
periods of my life before the death of my father 
were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev, 
Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my 
working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-
1952. The opportunity. to be always well-dressed~ 
to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my 
own car, t~ be able to use the car given me by my 
family and also my father's car, the opportunity 
to travel to the South and to vacation in the best 
sariitariums, dachas, and so forth; all this 
unquestionably left its mark on me and became 
someth~ng of a habit. After the death of my father, 
my successful progress in my work gave.me a higher 
salary, and although I did not have all that which 
I h~d while my father was alive, still I did not 
experience any serious difficulties. But already 
I wanted to live. still better.
