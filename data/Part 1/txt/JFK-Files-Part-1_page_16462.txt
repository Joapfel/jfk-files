RE.FERENCE: UFAX-14 
l. On 27 January, Alien Affairs Staff advised that under 
Section 313 of Immigration and Naturalization Act, AMHUG-1 
cannot become an A.lllerican c.t.tizen until after 10 years from 
April 1964. While normal Cuban exile must wait five years, 
Communie.t party mel)lbt:rs must wait 10 years. AMHUG-l's 
position as "intelligence officer" is considered a "oeaningful 
extension"- of CP membership. 
2. In view of ft!!MUG-l's distinguished service to RVROCK, 
WH Division will submit a meraorandum through appropriate channels 
requesting authorization to submit a bill to Congress to reduce 
AMMUG-l's waiting period from ten to five years. At this writing, 
we do not know bow long this processing will take but will keep 
you advised, 
3. Paragraph 2 above is our intention and we naturally 
cannot guarantee approval at this time. If a spPcial bill is 
passed by Congres~, AH'IDG-1 will go through routine appllcatloa 
for Naturalization with RYROCK QJ:ldance.
