2. N0SENK0's Transfer to the U.S. Embassy Section 
In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the 
A~erican-Britisn-Canadian Section-of-·the Tourist Department, 
N0SENK0 learned from K. !1. DUBAS, the departr:~ent Chief, of plans 
to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief. 
N0SENK0 said he was opposed to the move and wanted ~o remain in 
the Tourist Department: "I was used to it there and wanted to 
cgntinue. I ~anted to stay in the Tourist Department. This 
Lthe transfe,;:/ was no p::-omotion. Here I was the Deputy Chief 
of section and would be the same there. But, of course, its more 
important tLere. The American Department is, of course, the most 
important. But here I was working against J\meri£an tourisis. 
This is also important. Furthermore, I showed fhad proven/ my­
self there in '55, '56, '57, '58, and '59 and was considered to 
be not a bad £ase Qfficer. A':}d here, in the Americ_an Department, 
I must show fprovy myself with new people." N0SENK0 therefore 
asked DUBAS in December 1959 to ''please fight for me to stay.

DUBAS later told N0SENK0 that he had twice spoken to Second 
Chief Directorate Chief o. M. GRIBA.~0V on his behalf, but to 
no avail. In January 1960 the official orders transferring 
N0SEHK0 were issued. 
On the day N0SEHK0 reported to v. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the 
American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report 
to GRlBA:.~0V • s office. To GRIBA..~0V N0SE!-!K0 again expressed mis­
givings about the change of assignment. GRIBAN0V replied that 
DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that he, GRIBAN0V, "had 
his own plans and that was all." GRIBAN0V told N0SENK0 that

There was no change in the functions of N0SENKo·• s section, 
however; as before, it continued to be responsible for 
operations against tourists from the United States, 
England,and Canada. 
FRIPPEL has reported that H0SENK0:continued to meet him 
until he left the Soviet Union. in• .January 1961 and again 
when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in 
1962 and once again in 19631 see Part V.D.S.
