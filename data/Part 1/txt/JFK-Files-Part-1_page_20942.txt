Action Required: See Paragraph 9 et all 
. 1. During his RVROCK career Michael C. CHOADEN' has served 
as Contract Agent, Covert _Associ_ate, Staff Agent nnd Contract -
Empl'oyeo. On orie occasion CIIOADEN res i~~nod from RVROCK, became 
a ·Contract Agent·; then~:roturned as_ a Staff Employee. The purpose 
of this dispatch is to request a 1·cview of exactly what ClIO.-\DEN's 
status has boon over tho years, what nrust bo .:lono to 1·cpny 1·etire-
'ment funds ·for any periods of creditable serv-ico not now covered. 
and to study the possibility that some periods of tenure might be 
converted from u~creditablo to creditable status. 
•• 2. CHOADEN serv.ed in ·the Air Force from Februn-ry 1943 
through Octob9r 1945, with total ~crvice of two years, eight 
months· and °19 days~--
3. The da_tes of CIIOADEN's first RVROCK service ..:n Santiago, 
Chilo, are very hazy to CIIOADEN. He does recall that he wns first 
recruited by the COS, but cannot recall if this wns on a forlll!ll, 
salaried basis. At some .tirn_e during 1950 or 1951, probably .the 
latter, CHOAD:El'J signed an RVROCK contract, for at least two yea1~, 
possibly longer. The-salary is remembered as US$500 per month, 
and on one occasion thi,s salary \•:as pa_id in advance to allow 
CUOADEN to purchase printing equip::iont. Please ~heck the contract 
covO:?ring this period and advise Rio (a) the c!uration of the con­
tra•!t ::ind (b) if any prov is ion for deductions (or future payment 
of) was made. If, as CHOADEN suspects, the1·e were no deductions, 
even for Social Security, CHOADEN would appreciate lle>adquarters 
comment on the possibilit'y that this period might be retroacth·ely 
converted to creditable service status (after payments into 
retirement system. of course). In this connection it is sui;i;ested
