Dear. Anthony, 
C Re ardin your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our 
•'records indicate t. Valeri~ Vladimirovich Kostikov 
traveled to Mexico, France, pain, the U.S. and Cuba 
during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned 
permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and 
served there until August 1965. He was variqusly 
described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache. 
During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S. 
Government employee assigned to·our embassy in Mexico 
City. 
In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald/ 
approached ·the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt 
to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. 
Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa 
request. We have no information which indicates any 
relationship between these individuals other than for the 
purpose of Oswald's making his visa regu~st. 
Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of 
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned 
to the consular section and was a second secretary. It 
appeared that he was tasked with following :the activities 
of the Central American communist partie$,_.,ahd left-wing 
groups, and he met often with members of"' these groups, 
reportedly providing them with funds and technical 
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual 
TOY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family 
remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip 
to Havana. 
Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in 
September 1971. Our information indicated that he was 
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at 
the time of his departure, there was some speculation that 
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that 
he was known to Lyalin.
