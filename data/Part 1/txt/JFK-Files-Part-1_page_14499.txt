J .. ·All.:\l.IT0-1 confides in {c-'1· pcoph•. From our reading 
of QLTU!ID :incl QiJDOZE·;. th'1'e arc at l,..•ast three pl'°rsons 
\\"hO could loi;iqU~- a1id c-ffcc:t:h·ely fill ttw role ns an 
intcnn,:,diary. They arc Identities ,\, B, and C. We can 
,:atci.;od.cally eliminate Identity A for o!.Jvious reasons, i.e., 
lack of di_rcct access to him. Because of his rclatio'nship 
to identity_ D,, .,~c_ can also tent:-it h·ely cl.iminatc Identity B. 
He: p)·csents·':i:l"is_k "'·hich·wc arc not_ certain should be taken; 
hov/c\'.er,·wc \\·ould'"Ifke'-"'t'-~·aad n comment on him in a later 
paragraph. -Idcntity C would se~m to be the most logical 
cho"ice. He' __ is intclli¢o,'nt, a professional man, well-to-do, 
youn~ and .one- "'·ith 'l\'hom ..\~IAUf0-1 frequently talks and whom 
• he often sec§~-- We know. little. about his political prociivitics 
•aithougbbe iiYe~~hc impr~~sion of being a moderate analyst 
of wo"i·ld everits and· doesn't seem to tiavc a strong affection. 
or aversion for the ·PBRl~iEN Government. We have n good 
background on him- prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet; 
however, a·s -you· can wc1_1:imai;inc, thl! report concentrates on 
. the_ economic·•side of ;the inclfvidual. We have made a number 
of .:atteinpfs-- here in. the _Embassy to determine whether he. has 
iny Americari ~ontactsi but ~1th negative results: His visa 
file d6es not show wheie he visited in the United States or 
the purpos~, except that it was a ·business trip. He has an 
indefinite_ visa and we arc fairly certain that, if necessary, 
we could use the question of his vi~a as an e~trreto him. 
We ate currei1tly reviewing with all Station assets their 
knowledge of Identity c. In acldition, we are also considering 
assets such ·as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, '\\'ho could, under some 
legitimate business pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective 
is to develop -n warm entfee to Identity C without compromising 
nny of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of 
Identity C by either a Stat ion Officer or an asset workir,.; 
under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of 
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Y-\rt I under separate 
cover . .-\ POA on Identity C was requested separately. There 
are no deroga~ory Station traces; 
4. Ideu~ity B would be an excellent choice if not for 
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be ·explored 
'l\'ith Ql'SEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint 
operation. QUSEQ_UIN-48 could probabl}· get the necessary 
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's 
aide~; to contact Identity e. We will not pursue this until 
we receive your c·ommcnts. • 
5. It is not too early to consider the emoluments w~ 
might want to offer to A~!..\LT0-1 at the.time a pitch is made • 
..\s always they· should be divided into two areas - for defection 
and for recruitment and work in place.
