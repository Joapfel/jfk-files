On 17 October 1975 one Manuel De AR.'-IAS contacted our 
overt Domestic Contact Division (DCD) office in Miami 
offering-his iervices as a double agent. Following are 
excerpts from two DCD Reports dated 20 October 1975 and 
19 January 1976 based on debriefings of De Alt!AS: While 
in Cuba De A~M:\S claimed to have been the neighbor of 
Raul BET:\l':COURT, the brother of the former Venezuelan 
President Ro:::ulo BETANC01.•RT, and his two daughters. 
Antonieta and 1-:ariela, who was De ARMAS' girl friend~ 
De Am~s• mother decided in 1962 that Subject should 
leave Cuba, 1,:hich he did. In 1975, De ARMAS found out 
that his two young cousins had been placed in an orp-han­
age in Cuba. He made contact .with Mariela BETAl-;rCOU-RT, 
telling her that he was fed up with the U.S. S}'stem of 
gov~rnment in ord~r to tain her ~ttention on the mattet 
of taking his cou·sins out of Cuba. t-lariela asked him 
if he would be willing to work for the Cuban GoV:ei:-nm-ent· 
and he replied he would if it would help the you~gstbrs. 
Mariela then told De A~IAS to go to Caracas and ineet • 
with her sister Antonieta. De ARMAS went to Caracas on 
02 Oc;::tober .197S and met with An-tonicta, but·n_o proposal's 
were made on the possib.il.ity of· his working for· the·· • • 
Cuban Go\·ernment. Ori 17 Oc,tobcr .197S De ARJ.IAS again 
called Mariela and was told that he should return to 
Venezuela to.hold, -rnorc··talks with Antonieta and· "ott;er 
people." After: talkirrn wi'th P.lariela on 17 October 197S, 
De Alli-US called our DCD/r.fiami Off.ice because as a U.S. 
citizen he claincd ~ha~ he did not ~ant to gei i~vol~ed 
with the Cuban Governcent unless ~e had this Age~cy's 
appro\·al. ·oe AP~'l.,\S graciously offered his sen·ices as
