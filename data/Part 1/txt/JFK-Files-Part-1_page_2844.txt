(AMERICAN EMBASSY.SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
Comment: NOSENKO doesn;t know why he was selected to 
consult with the MVR in Bulgaria. As far 
as is known to CIA, such consultation was a 
function of the KGB advisors in Sofia whom 
NOSENKO himself described, The American 
Legation (after a ten-year absence) reopened 
in February 1960. By 1961 the MVR had demon­
strated that it had lost none of its earlier 
demonstrated efficiency in controlling the 
activities of resident foreigners and in 
establishing the basis for mounting operations 
against American diplomats. There was no 
apparent necessity for NOSENKO's Sofia assign­
ment, and therefore his account is judged to 
be untrue.

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the 
end of April 1961, NOSENKO was reviewing MVR lists of 
foreigners scheduled to visit Bulgaria, when he came across 
the name of \Horace G. LUNTl.aL NOSENKO recalled that a Slavic 
linguist of l.eiat name had'iJeen reported to him in Moscow by 
VOLKOV or YEFREMOV· as a possible homosexual~ When MVR . 1 
officers confirmed that _this~UN'flwas a Slavic specialist,0£ 
NOSENKO decided . to check llis· rec9~lection against KGB 
records, for which purpose he telephoned Moscow·. An almost 
immediate reply confirmed that this . was the same ~UNTJ who o, • 
had visited Moscow previously, and that he was a nomosexual. 
(The KGB had never exploited its knowledge offLU~'s homo-Ol 
sexual activities and the MVR had not known tflate,UNT]was D~
