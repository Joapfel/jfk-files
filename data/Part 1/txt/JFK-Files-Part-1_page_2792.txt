Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations: 
Summary and Conclusion 
According to;NOSENKO, on transfer to the Embassy Section, 
operations against the American code cl~rks.were. the Section's 
priority task and thus his most ·important single responsibility 
as Deputy Chief. He asserts to be complete his awareness of 
what was known to the KGB. on this topic at the time, because 
of his seri.ior.position, his personal review of relevant files 
and correspondence, his personal direction of KOSOLAPOV and 
GRYAZNOV, and his personal participation in their operations. 
Ni thout exception, ·in every one of the c~ses •NOSENKO describes 
there are facts substantial!~ at variance with his account, 
in direct proportion to the amount of collateral information 
available. • 
Conclusion 
From the foregoing it is concluded that he was neither 
Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section nor supervisor of all 
operations against American code clerks. Consequently, 
he would not necessarily have known ~f recruitments among 
other Embassy personnel.
