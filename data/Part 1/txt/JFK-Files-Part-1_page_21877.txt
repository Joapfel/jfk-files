26 J~nuarf 1964: In a threc-and•a•haif hour meeting, 
NOSES'Ko emphasuec!t°hat although he <&greed that it was .· 
necessary and useful for him to .remain in place ·until th·e 
GRIBANOV visit to Geneva, he wanted to defect ~s soon as 
possible thereafter. 
za January 1964: NdSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might 
not. bccom1ng • toTcneva after all, for KGB Chai_rman 
SEMICIIASll-.YY was apparently reluctant to permit hira to 
travel beyond Vienna, NOSE~KO said that he would probably 
have definite information on GRIBANOV's trip b; the end 
of the week. 
30 Januar* 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series, 
NOSENJ:U' said t at tnerc no1, appeared to be little likelihood 
that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris,* Therefore~ he 
wanted to defect right away, As reasons he cited the 
eootional strain of any further delay and the fact.that he 
and his case ofiiccrs were wasting their time working 
against the local KGB Legal Residen:y, which had no wo~th~ 
while or promising targets, Ile also felt that nothing of 
value could be obtained from the Sovi~t del~~ation because 
"TSARAPKI~ himself doesn't k:iow what he will say until he 
is told by Moscow the day before," The CIA handlers, however, 
cielayed the defection for one week by obtaining ~OSENKO's 
agreement to assist in an audio operation: CIA propcscd to 
install listening devices in the offices of the KGB Legal 
Residency, and NOStNKO said he woul<l check certain physical 
aspects of the delegation buildin&s, As the best time for 
the defection, he suggestc<l Saturday mcrning, _S ··Febraary, 
because he probably would not be missed until the following 
Monday. This date was tentatively scheduled, and NOSENKO 
again repeated his desire simply to "disappear without a 
trace." He also asked about exfiltration plans. 
31 January 1964: NOSEXKO reported the results of his 
reconnaissance oTTlie KGB Legal Residency in connection with 
the proposed audio operation, which would involve microphone 
transmitters operating on a carrier current, He told CIA he 
had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building 
used its cwn batteries and generator, and therefore the 
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain­
in place until the arrival of the CllEREPANOV Papers'-, which 
he was told were enroute from Washington, He explained that 
he had felt ~ress~re at the previous meeting because of an 
imminent move by the delegation from its hotel to the Soviet 
villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would 
be noticed more quickly. This move, he had now learned, had 
been postponed pending the arrival of a housekeeping officer 
from Moscow. 
• FrOllhJ to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where 
he was seen on the street with a Soviet identifie~~y 
NOSENJCO as a KGB counterintelligenceofficer •. There-is 
no evidence-• that he visited Switzerland. .
