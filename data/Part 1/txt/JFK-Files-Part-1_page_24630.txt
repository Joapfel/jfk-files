1. On the mornin~ of 16 April 1968 our surveillance of 
Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV, Soviet Press Attache and Second 
Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, who is a 
known KGB officer, determined that he had a clandestine meeting 
with a Latin American male. LEONOV passed a small bundle to 
this individual. We followed the Latin AMerican to the Hotel 
Principal, Bolivar 29. Checks at the· hotef revealed that he 
was registered at tl,u hotel as Feliciano PACHON Chacon ta, a 
Colombian citizen, and i:hat a woman, Librada MORENO Leal, also 
a Colombian citizen, was registered in the same roo~ witb him. 
Airline checks revealed that PACHON arrived in Mexico City on 
6 April 19G8 and that MORENO arrived on 12 April 1968. Both 
came from Bogota. Checks with our representatives in Bogota 
showed that they were both important members of the (PCC) 
Communist Party of Colombia. Further checks revealed that 
PACHON and MORENO had air reservations for 20 April 1958 to 
return to Bogota on separate airlines. Our surveillance con­
firmed their departm·e from Mexico City on 20 April 1968 on 
separate flights. 
2. ·We informed our representatives in Bogota who informed 
the Colombian Security Service. Both were picked up u~on 
arrival in Bogota. PACHON was carrying $70,000 (U.S.) and 
MORENO was carrying $30,000 (U.S.). 
3. Both couriers broke and provided considerable infor­
~ation, the most important of which is: 
a. Identification of the entire clandestine leader­
ship of the PCC and FARC. 
b. FARC: personnel and plans.
