it was necessary to. go, to hear her.·. ·Not because· 
• you do not beliieve GRY.\ZNOV. ·No. ·eut, you see, 
to hear from the source ( emphasized)·, directly., 
what is go!Lng CID, and ho-.v it is going. on, ·to get 
a feeling. Because the .source· will tell the case• 
officer, then the case officer ~111 tell you. • 
Maybe sometimes be will not give you every detail, 
every intonation. But in some cases, it is neces­
sary to feel this. nut, of course, it depends on 
the agent, on the target, whether you will GO or 
not go. It's very difficult, again, to say. 
Could you say that you met 50 per cent of the 
section's agents? 
No, I can't say. 
Fifty per cent or 75 per cent~ 
I can't answer you. 
What about your functions as a supervisor in re­
gard to saJ:ehouses, to "K.K. 's" and "Ya.K. 's",* 
Oh. I myself had a fil~ on my flat, a ynvochnaya 
kvartirR, which I brought from the Seventh 
[Tourist Department I. It was my o·.vn. GRYAZNOV 
had his own yavochna.ya kvartira. KOSOLAPOV had 
also his own yavochnnya kvartira. And nbt one of 
us had a couspfratfve lp1irtment. 
And you took the "Ya.K." from ... 
(Interrupting.) Which I had from the Seventh. 
And, by the way, when I was leaving the First 
{American) Department, I took this file again 
to the Seventh. 
And not one of you harl a conspirative flat. 
No, because the section had only--how many?-­
[P.I.I MASSYA bad one conspirative. [V.P.) 
FEDYANIN had o~e conspirative, and then there was 
one conspirative flat, where, in fact, an agent 
was living. In the First Section there were 
three 01· four conspirative flats. 
But among you, GRYAZNOV, and KOSOLAPOV there was 
n_one? 
Only "Ya.K.'s 0 • 
•A "K.K." {konspirativnaya kvartira-~onspira..torial ~part­
ment) is defined by NoSESKO. as· a safehouse, 'or apartment owned 
and maintained'by the KGB. A "Ya.K." (yavochnaya kvartira--
meeting apartment) is an apartment occupied by a tenant who 
is perhaps subsidized·by the KGB and absents himself when 
there is a·need to use the apartment for meetings or other 
activities. The "K.K." is used for more ·sensitive operatio.nal 
purposes, be said. •
