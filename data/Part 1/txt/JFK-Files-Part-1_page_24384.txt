to some of the crltlclams that have been leveled at his production, the fact 
remalJl• that 1 b.:.ve -not seen any marked J,inprovement during the past two 
years ln the qaallty of the material be-provides as. As tlme goes on &Del 
the realistic crlterla of what le dlseemlnable and what ls not are applled 
more and more to his prodactlon, _and this production 1n turn remalns at lta 
preseDt level of euperilclallty, we will see less and leH of lt qualify for 
dlssemlnatloo. Slnce he la an FI agent, thh has conelderable slgnlficance, 
although lt of course doe• not present the full picture of hls capabWtles. Hla 
operatlonal lntelllgeoce has been recelved wlth mticed evaluations: asaally 
hle lnltlal coverage ol a subject ls very well recelve,i a.ad often whets the 
appetlte of the reclplent for more: somehow, however, that "more" never 
seems to materlallze -- they get more ol exactly the same callber, but 
llttle more 1n terms of depth of reportlng. Perhaps the !ault Ilea 1n ORPHONEII. 
In whlch case we should reallze early that what we have here ls not a traa 
Fl agent, bat a sort of "operational lntelllgence batterfly." Perhaps, on the 
other band, the !ault Iles ln RODIGAST'• handling of the man, not ln terms of 
the personal relatlonahlp which RODIGAST has been able to balld gp wlth him, 
bu\· maybo even becauee of that relatlonsblp. I remember when I first talked 
wlth RODIGAST I quickly realized that be felt he knew more than ~dqaartera 
a• to what was lmportant for O /1 to covel' and what was not: I am sorry I 
mlseed RODIGAST on hls TDY here and when I was ln London, and that hls 
home leave has been postponed. for I had hoped·to determine for myself 
whether RODlGAST stti,i ielt that way. wbtever the reason, I arn by no mean• 
1lvlng up on O /1, bat wW continue to try to narrow down hls targets eo that 
he wUl have a _falr shake at showing what he can do when he ls not allowed to 
cover the waterfront. 
4, What the above paragraph ls leading up to. le that I do DOt 1D all 
honesty feel that he bas done anything to really deserve a promotlon, except 
balld longevity slnce the la•t one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that 
aewepaper Job offered to hlm (his preference, ln any event). However. I do 
~•allze that a man must have an lncentlve, and would like to propose that we 
suggest to LCPlJIIT that a more reallstlc Increase might be ln the neighborhood 
•• of $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned ln paragraph 2 above 
might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to O /1 as a new benefit.
