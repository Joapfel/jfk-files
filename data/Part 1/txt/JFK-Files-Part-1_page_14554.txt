Nothing ·is known about un~fficial contacts 
vith other diplomats in Madrid except that he 
is.,_close to and'· exchanges information with the 
Algel::ian -Ambassador~ 
• • At .time3 -he tries to give the impre·ssion, • 
.. and tills mi,ght _be: true,· that' h_e enjoys the_ full • i 
.personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raul. 
ROA. 
_ .·-He· frequently tells other Cuban diplomata 
• :.stopp:f.ng··in Madrid that he makes 90%. of ·the 
· dedslcnis. without consuiting Havana becau·se 
tha~ -~~ ''.why_ I am h~re for." 
;'Above all, he directs con~tant and bitter 
. criticism against the bureaucracy in Havana 
because of •its incompetence, which, in his opinion, 
will ·cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge 
after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an e~d ("No 
one in Havana wants or cares to make a decision"). 
The Peter.Principle L-" In a M,erarchy every . 
employee tends co rise to his level of incompetence" 7, 
which he has read ani! is going to send to Fidel CASTRO 
for reading on the. a·dvice of Melba HERNANDEZ, should 
be taken as an example· ·of what is happening in

trying to interfere with the DDbassy in Madrid, 
resulting in lack. of co-ordination a·nd even co~ 
•• operation. ( ·To Horacfo F1JENTES Martfoez: " More 
than lack of organization there is chaos in Cµba

Re directs almost the same criticism against 
his staff in Madrid because they._ lack qualifications. 
for the posts that. they hold. " They think that I 
am ·a fool.'' he once told an associate, ''but I 
don't miss anything_ t:1u they do."
