No specific reason. GRIBANOV called me at midnight~ 
I could hear that he was already drinking. he asked 
me how long it would take me to get dressed and come 
down to the Praga Restaurant, first.private room .. 
Afterwards we wanted to go somewhere else to finish 
the evening ... GRIBANOV was sloppy drunk, lay down 
to rest, he needed a couple of hours of sleep. I 
drove him and TARABRIN home, got him there·_at 6:00 
a.m., gave _him some pills to help him; 
When did you first personally meet GRIBANOV? 
I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I did not

group operational discussions (a,bout 15 people present) 
about work against Military Attaches: in 1954·: that was 
the. first time I. ever spoke to. hia.
