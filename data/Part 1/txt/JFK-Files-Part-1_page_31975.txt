from agents ihan mo~t Case Officers. His two new recruitments 
represent the Station's most promising propccts against the 
FSLN in the long history of FSLN operations in Nicaragua. It 
is· suggested that this Of{ i'ccr' s con tr ibut ion of only two 
recruitments (at the very end of his tour of duty) could well 
be more meaningful and productive than the efforts of o 
super-salcsmad whose acquisitions later prove to be marginal 
or useless. (

DUTY NO. 2 
l 
Subject conducts Station liaison at ·the working level with 
two contacts. Ills main job is the maintenance of the relation­
ship, an effort handicapped by political considerations which 
oblige him to tak~ but never .give, to cancel scheduled training, 
and to maintain a low profile. Nevertheless; he docs manage 
to extract information of interest.Ori th~ tcrrorijt and political 
targets, and the relationship docs provide him with acces~ t~ 
certain military officers who are being assessed and developed. 
Additionally, this Officer shares the task with the COS 6f 
conducting. liaison at the policy level, an ~vcn more djfficult, 
and less productive effort. Subject's warm and winning personal­
ity and extensive experience arc key factors in his ability to 
maintain the relationship at all, which results in clear net 
gain to the Organi:ation.
