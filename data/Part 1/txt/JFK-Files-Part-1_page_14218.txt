. :·' wouldn•·t be surp'rised. if this was suggested _by his wHe,who -
-- is ·ver·y -•.jealous of· her huS~aild •. .) .Th~- meeti"ilg was arranged 
for 1130 hol1rs on 17 January. ·_AMAUI'0-1 commented that he is 
up quite-. early in the morning, ·:presumably 'to begin work in 
his office.. - • 
2. The above report is the first we have received on 
Subje.ct's use of his honie as' an office. The invitation to, ... 
the Ruma_nian, of course, casts -=:uspicion on the nature of the 
conversation. ~ 
:.3. Since his move to new quarters, AMAUI'O-l's home is 
about. 50 yards from two WOFIRM staffers - Martin B. CRYArn and 
Co-nrad B. FALAGHRO. (See attached sketch). Edwin B. RATTEREE 
lives, approximately 200 yards from the A~!..\UI'O hume. This 
proximity to A~L-\UT0-1 's home by three staffers brings up the 
~ilestion of the ~serif an RF .device to monitor conversations-
in Al'.IAUI'O's office at home, assuming at this time, that he. 
has a phone in the office, most likely an extension of the 
home.phone; • For pl~nning purposes, we would appreciate from. 
MKNOVA a list of :requirements for a target study in the use.• 
of an Rt device~. If 6ther ~~ans are available for external 
penetiation 6f his home we would welccime your suggestions 
and comments. Please advise us also if the P.F device is still 
a controlled it;em, whi~h cannot be discussed with or released 
toliaison. Your earliest reply would be appreciated;
