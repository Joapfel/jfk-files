'DDO STAFF MEETING BRIEF #32 22 February 1978 
1. DDCI 
The DDCI attended this week's staff meeting. He spoke 
of his appreciation of being able to work directly with 
the Operations Directorate, an organization which he ha~ 
known from the field. He said that when he was first 
offered the nomination of the post of Deputy Director, 
he thought of the Agency primarily in terms of his 
perceptions of this Directorate. He knew that its officers 
worked long hours, developed excellent contacts and produced 
top-flight reports working always with a strong sense of 
dedication. He is planning to have a series of briefings 
which will further acquaint him with the activities of the 
Directorate. Meanwhile he reaffirmed that he had an open 
door to persons who had problems or issues that they wished 
to bring direitly to his attention. 
On his first day on duty, Mr. Carlucci was thrown in 
direct confrontati~~-with the Depa~tment over the State/ 
CIA Treaty. While the Department has expressed very strong 
emotion concerning this Treaty, the Deputy Director stands 
by the position that he expressed during his confirmati6n 
hearings. When asked by one Senator about the State/CIA 
relations, he said that he felt this relationship had~been 
codified to the extent that this was possible and that it 
was now a matter for Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station to 
work ~ut their ow~ individual arrangements. He hopes that 
we will be able to find some way of diffusing this issue so 
that we may proceed to other more substantive issues such a~ 
internal reporting responsibilities, communications, and 
cover. 
Specific cover problems were briefly discussed. The 
DDO promised to deliver to the DDCI a new inventory of 
those issues and situations where the Divisions are
