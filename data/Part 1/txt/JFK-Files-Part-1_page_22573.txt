Havana, Cuba 
29 October 1957 
• SUBJmTz Reassivuient - Arthur o. Vaivada • 
TO : Headquarters Desk 
THBOUGH: Chief of Station, Havana, Cuba 
1. While at Headquarters in the early part of Y.ay 1957, it wae verball;y 
agreed that I return to Cuba for a.tout one year, security pen:dtting. 
2. While rro:y o::,erational 1o0rk in Cuba from August 1954 until February 
1957 vas concentrated on co.Cl!IIUJ'list tarcets in tte 'CniversitT of Habana, it 
should te pointed out that r;ry- c:uties during that period also involved many 
contacts l.'ith sutversive op::'Ositionist elelrents. Hien goverr.n:ental persecution 
inc1·e:ased during February 1957, two of my key agents were lost, one of them 
by goverr:.ental assassination, so that l was obliged to leave Cuba temporarily 
pe??dmg clarification of th3 security factors involved. D-.n-ing rrry three 
months'at~ence in PEPRIY.E the local Eituation deteriorated; and after my 
return ray position was less favorable than it had been as a newcomer si.a:e I 
had lest assets tut had retained the cumulati,;e security hazards of three years 
of cultivation uld recruitment efforts. 'lbe University was, and still is, 
closed. Our co!Cll:Ullist penetration efforts are continuously harrassed by 
official pe::.-secutic.n o! the target group. • 
J. Si.nee by June 1958 I shall have s;:,e.nt .four Jears in Cuba, I believe 
it appropriate to subcd.t this letter at this time requesting that Headquarters 
begin to study the pcssibilities for reassignment about June 1958, or prior 
to that date ii' .r.ecessary. As to future assignments, I have nc reservations 
or special rec;uests. I am willing and ;repared to t?-avel to an,- area 
consistent with m-, qualifications. Cenerally speaking, and for obvious 
security reasons, I am interested in getting out of the Central .p,;erica­
Caribl:ean area if ?OSSible. It ma,- be recalled that I was denied an Argentine 
Tisa in 1953, for purely technical reasons. This situation ·may be chai:lged, 
and I 1i0uld not be o;:,posed to a tolJl' in J.rgentina, Cllile, or any of the South 
American republics. In this catter, the nature of tte new !Jl:'Oject or 
assip:ucent would take precf:c!ence vi.th me over personal preferences as to 
particul.ar area ot ass~t.
