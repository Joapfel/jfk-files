The opposition radio station& !;car the hrunt of an array o{ Je,:al 
and. illegal device a dcoigncd to intimidate them. These device a 
include the threat o{ violr.ncc, favoritism in the distribution of 
essential Government advertieing revenue, temporary cloaurcs, 
and Government-fomented Uriltcs, 
Chile's national television -- th<? only country-wide ch,1nnel -- h.111 
become an important propa~:u;d.1 instrument for the Government. 
But it is being chnller.icd. by a Catholic Univeraity chann'?l wh~ch io 
attempting to expand its service beyond the S,-intiago area. 
A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition, 
lasting more than a.year, hai; taken place at the Papclcra, Chile's 
only important' private nr,waprint producer, with toe corr.;,;;.ny

efforts to take over the firm. The paper c~mpany claims that 
Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy. 
Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media 
have continued to function, tal-:ing advantage of the fluid political 
situation currently prevailin~ in Chile, and have b<:comc increasingly 
effective in ~xploiting the Govt:rnment's .economic failures and the 
g_rowing dissensio-n within the ruling :l.·lnrxist coalition, 
Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains i.ts media 
is being slowly und~rmincd as the Government expands it_s control 
over the Chilean economy. ~1.any opposition media .:,re re;,ortedly 
already in diCCicult financial straits. The Chilean Communist Party, 
seeking to strengthen its voice i_n the March 19f3 Congressional 
elections, has already purchast:ri five bele.lguered radio stations 
(one a former opposition station) in southl·rn Chile.
