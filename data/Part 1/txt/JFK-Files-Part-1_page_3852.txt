1. On the night of 13 ~nuary 1967 the writer using 
the operational alias Jaaes· E.T'Wilson met with Artime in a 
room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose 
of tbe meeting was to formally terainato Artime's association 
with the Agency. This involved the obtaining of termination 
Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover 
the final periodical payment through 31 Doceaber 1966 and 
obtaining outstanding receipts. 
2. 'l'.be meeting was cordial and all paper work involved 
in the proceedings was accomplished without incident. There 
was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what be bad 
done (or tried to do) for the Agoncy in the past and an un­
doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that be was r•ady 
and willing for any task be mig'1t be ca_lled upon to do in 
tbe future. 
3. Artime made only one request--& rather passionate 
one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members 
ot two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR) 
■•bers who were executed Pa the result of operational missions 
to Cuba and the wife of an~~ber who is serving a 30-year 
■entence. (It will be recalled that Artime baa been furnishing 
receipts for the $3,ooo·be has been receiving in-recent months 
claiming that the money goea to the families of IIRR members • 
wbo have lost tboir lives or been imprisoned while on MRR 
missions.) We are examining these three cases and if worthy 
will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and 
martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.
