· (SEVE!lTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960) 
T•7hen NOSI:NKO moved from the Seventh Department to 
the Second Chief Directorate's American DepartMent in 
January 1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him. They 
were never used against targets in the AI!lerican Embassy 
but, NOSENKO said, the Seventh Department "used to call 
me on homosexual prospects". VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued 
as active KGB agents until some time in 1960 or 1961. 
After they were employed once more [against Gi. E. JOHNSO~ in CJ6 
January 1962]- it was decided that they were~oo well -
known". NOSENKO claimed that the agents were retired and 
that he himself sent their files to KGB Archives in 1962 
or 1963. 
NOSENKO's Soviet Agents: Summary 
NOSENKO claims to have been these agents' case officer 
for two to five years, during which he met each regularly, 
assigned them operational tasks, and received their reports. 
With the exception of YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, however, NOSENKO 
can cite few instances of their operational use, and he has 
but superficial knowledge of their personal backgrounds. 
It is unlikely that this is merely the result of failing 
recollection. He knows no more about the three whom he 
claimed he took with him to the Embassy Section, where he 
continued to be their case officer for two more years, than 
·he does about the others. In the two instances where his 
agents were involved in KGB operational activity, NOSENKO 1 is unaware of SHULGINA' s work with LEVINE and lQRIBE;R£, ana:/2 
was not involved when KUNGAROVA was targetted against and 
!married CIA agent Philip NIELSE~. NOSENKO's familiarity 
~ith the nine agents he named appears to be that which 
would be acquired second-hand, not through personal contact 
as he claimed. 
, , 
With respect to YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, the evidence does 
not sustain NOSENKO's claim that he was their case officer 
in every operation from their recruitment in 1957 until 
their retirement in 1962-1963. He is unfamiliar with either 
agent's background. He cannot say where either of them 
lived or, indeed, how he got in touch with them when he 
required their services. With the exception of then 11.E. 06 
JOHNSO~compromise in 1962 (see p.268), all of VOLKOV's and
