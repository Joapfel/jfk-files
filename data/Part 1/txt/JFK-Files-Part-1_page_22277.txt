further inconsistencies. Because o! this and, in the absence of 
any pressure of dny kind (including any apparent psychological 
pressure) to lie about his date of entry, the r.ost logical explana­
tion fer thi& cha:.ge is that 1:oSEllKO forgot in early 1964 either 
whe:i t.e joined the KGB ar.d/or what he i,3d told CIA in 1952. 
OERYABIS ~as c<>=!'e~ted on the significar.cc which the date of entry 
holds for a Y.GB officer. lie expressed the opinio~ that it wou!d 
be unusual for a KGB officer to forget this date. 
NCSENKO was sueationed at length by DERYABIN (Pag~s 616-619) 
concerr.ing the t!~ing of his entry on duty with the KGB. As a 
result o! this i~cerrogation it was determir.ed that N0SENKO was 
una...,.are that at tr.e time he saiJ he joined ~he KG9, the presE:nt 
First Chie! Directorate was uesignated the Secor.d Chief Direc­
torate and vice versa. Therefore, NOSE~~O would have joined a 
compone .. t entitl~d the First Chief Directorate in Xarch 1953, 
not the Second Chief Directorate as ~c says. NOSENKO did not 
know or had forgotten v~rious other facts, including the date 
that the MVD was r~designated the KGB, and misstated the loca­
tior.s and exister.ce of various buiidin~s and offices in the 
vicin1~y of the KGB Headq~arters buildir.g in early 1953. 
Ir. June 1962 ~:OSENKO said several times, in different meet­
ings, t.h~t the ~GB agent uANDRF.Y• (Pag~s 413-414) had been re­
cruited ar.d had left Moscow before he, ~OSENKO, entered the KGB. 
lie estil!:ated the date as 1949-1~50. ?-!0SENKO knew that "A.::OP.E'r 
was associated in Moscow with ruiODCS and when told that ru1o~ES 
was ti-.e:::-e from 1951 to 1953, adr.iit.ted that. the date .he gave might 
be wro~;. ~OSE~KO continued to say, however, that uA.~DREY" was 
recruited before he (t,OSEl!KO) becar .. c a K.:;B officer, and later 
reverted again to his estimate that •.11,:,..;!)i:ll:;1• was recruited in 
1949-1950. Wher. he returned to Geneva in 1964, NOSENKO changed 
this story and said that during his 1953-1955 tour in the U.S. 
Embassy Section he saw cipher specialist SELEZNOV, who had come 
there ~o consult on the then-active •A.~DREY• case. NOSENKO was 
unable to explain how he could have been sure in 1962 that the 
•ANDRn"" case was before nis time; when he said in 1964 that 
this was not so. Dayle SMITH confessed that he was :::-ecruited by 
the KGB in late 1953, and records show that he left Moscow in 
early !954. 
c. Circu:&&tances of Entry 
NOSENKO has consistently related his entrance into the KGB 
to discussions he had with General KOBULOV in early 1953 in Mcs­
cow, aft.er returnir.g from the Baltic. Ho..,.ever, he has changed the 
date of th~se discussions with Y.OBULOV virtually every time he 
has told this story. In June 1962, NOSESKO said he talked with 
ROBULOV at the NOSENKO dacha while on leave in March 1953; during 
the April 1~64 interrogations he changed the date to February 
1953; in April· 1965 t:OSENKO said he spoke to KOBULOV at the 
KOBULOV dacha in January 1953 while on leave and that he lived 
at home and was at the "disposal of GRU personnel" during Febru­
ary and March. Finally, in April 1966, HOSEt-KO said he first 
spoke to KOBULOV at KOBvLOV's dacha on ~ew Years Day 1953, that 
he was subsequently •resting• at a sanitarium connected with his 
tuberculosis of the year bef0re, and that he spoke again to 
_ l<OBULOV er. the day of STALIN' s funeral, while home for a few days 
from the sanitoriW'll. 1~ was at this seco~d encounter with KOBL"'LOV 
that the latter promised to concern himself wit.h NOSENRO's entry 
into the KGB.
