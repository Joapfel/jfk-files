less were well g.n, their w~ to identifyir.g the source of the 
Mmiroity docu.-nents idt::ntified by GOLlTSY:~, ha\ ir.g narrowed 
their list of suspects to 20 ( including VAS5hl..L) by 11 June 1962. 
When they received the fraq-r.~nt o{ NOSE;-.KO information which 
focused on the British Ett,bassy i!'I Modcow, the numter was reduced 
to VAS~ALL and or,e other. Although the r:os:::n~o information 
apparently coniiri~ed the already solid suspicions of VASSALL, 
there is n-ascn .t.o ,bel i'!!vc that the identification would have 
been---iR:complished withcutthis infor-:nation. The lead was there­
fore not ne'f! or exclusive information, and NOSENKO himself ad­
mitted in 1964 that he kr.e·"' that GOLITSYS had kno-.m of the case 
from the latter's work in the lnformation (Reports) Department. 
Of the identified third-nat!onals whcr.:t NOSENKO said were 
beir.g tergettcd or investic;ated by the Y..GB, nor.'? held positions 
of Rignificance, with the ~ole exce~tio~ of the then member of 
tt:e .British Parliament,~ whose personal life 
and career the Soviets s~quenty atfe:'Tlptcd--w1th consider6blc

(iii) Reir.ark~ 
On the basis of the ai.,o1:e exa;nin2t.ior., NOSDa:o•s in(ormation 
on KGB operations against tt.ird-nationals cannot be co~Rider~d .a 
positive factor in t!1e as.;e.s.:;:"'.,_.nt of his bcr.a f ic~. 1.s s -posi;i­
ib.le negative factor in cor.sidcratio~ of his ~~ fi_des, the in­
significance of NOS~KO's rcpr~rting on third-national leads mc~t 
be meaGurcd against the criterj_a of his cla,.:r.ed access ar.d con­
trary evidence. In the case of foreign touris~s his leads show-­
ar.d 1-,e hi:nseH h3S cor..'Tler.tcd--that su~re,;ru_it'.llents wcr~ no 
P!lrticula; value: assumi~g that NOS~~Kv was De?uty cfiier of th? 
Tourist Departr.ient, he should be able to make such a stat~mcnt 
without challenge. To cate no indeper•.!ent evider.ce of foreign 
tourist recruitmer.ts has err,ergoo which cor.tra1icts him. Opera-
tions against other nestern emhassies in Moscow are a sllgt.tly 
different matter. NOSENKO's information, or lack thereof, can­
not be evaluated on the basi3 of completeness because he has made 
no claim to !ull access to such information or to positions which 
WOl..ld have given him better a=cess .. Except for t:1ose he said he 
was informed of in connection Yith possible u:e against U.S. 
Embassy targets, he has usually sourced such third-national 
leads as he did have to particularly close relations with the 
responsible case officer. • !t would not be valid to argue that 
a source cf one lead should have told him of others, or that-he 
should have bad mere close fricr.ds in the KGB. Thus on all 
applicable criteria, t~e NOSENKO leads to operations against 
third-r.aticnals ~ust be excluded as a factor weighing for or 
against his~~-
