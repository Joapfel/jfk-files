B. lioi.·en•r, Undersigned ,.-ould like ·to suggest the following 
i~tcrrrPtatic~ f~~ ~h-:cvc~·valce CJ? be in it. I suggest t~at money, 
per sc, is :r:ct the primary end th:i.t Suhject is stri\"ing for now, just 
as _it never seeced to be his pri~ary 5oncern throughout his life. [ 
believe-thatSubject tenuinely enjoys clanddstine operations; at least, 
his conce~tic~ o! clandestine operations. Subject probably would ... 
prefer to ~ork-for the ~IS or possi~lv the K. German Service because 
. he. has a genul.ne'"fondness for the people and many aspects of t'he 
.~ulture of-both·countries. Jhc iiea of legalized, or at least 
•• in·ternat"ionally t_olcrate<l;_ "Spy in~" offer"s the oppo.r"unit,· to 
legitimi:ze, arid fl:.ereby·rationali:e, Subject's ia;'·""'"•-i/iicllfl that he is 
-protecting his.equity in an important", unique,· "professional" 
category~--
C. . "Subject,: during the period of Uncle rs i gned; exposilre, always • 
. considered that-.if.hc-had money-fine, if not, then ,nough ~ould come 
~ his way fromcso~~plbce to sustain him from one ventur~ b the next. 
·subj~ct felt that the ~cquisition of money would be a by-product bf . 
• his oppbrtunist.stheme~ and technical inventions in pursuance of his 
. main goal;-personal r:ecogni tion· for persc,nal achievements and triumphs'. 
D. I bel1eve -Subject does not expect ·to ·be accepted in his 
offer of ernploynent with the Frer:~h- Service, but rather to let our 
minds jump to the next· logical stcr-the full meaning of th.:- result 
- of such an attec;'.>t on his part.. 5u~ject knows very ,,el 1 thatlienas 
violated his oarole and would be encjrceratcd on his return. I believe 
his pride and· the r,robab iii ty of ctc>nsure and ridicule of family and 
friends irt Frarice ~ould disuade him in the final analysis. 
E. Subiect is a most excellent chess player. I have never 
won from him, n~r have I ever seen him lose a game. I consider that 
Subject has thought this line of action out thoroughly. It. is 
apparent that he is ~illing to gamble his quit claim settlement on 
sqmething_th.H I helieve he has specifically in mind--possibly the 
offer of ne~ docu~ents and identitv in so~e third countrv. He has 
aiways had a great desire to "surp!·ise" e\·eryone back hom<'(i.e. Paris): 
with new docu.-:-:ents, a new idcntit~·. plastic surgery, etc. I do not 
believe th.at ·,.-hat he wants is necessarily more dollars, but rather 
for the AIS to once again help hl!'::i (:is co-partner) to achieve his aim 
.0£ acclaim, success and recognition, possibly this time to family and 
friends in France . 
. • ' 
F. ! do n0t believe th~t. Subject iould ever be physically 
intimidated. :--!e lest half his front teeth to German i"nterrogators and 
the other half to French prj~on guards. Additionally, he do~s possess 
·a de.fiant spirit that sometimes cor::es through as sheer obstinacy to 
friends. 
G .. If it is considcrd worth1,hile, I believe an attempt should 
be made to lccate a C/0 locally who his handled him in th~ past. A 
C/0 for whom Subject has respect a~ a higher echelon and ~hom he 
considers understar.<ls him. T suggest th:it this C/0 inten·iew Subject 
in an uncontrolled environment to rleterm~ne what it is that Subject
