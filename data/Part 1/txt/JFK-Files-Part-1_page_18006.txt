1. D1.u·ing my recent visit to ~orlco I had A cood c,~ru:ce ~ go 
over n:any ot the ins-and-outs o! Ws project. vi th the Case Officer 
and with other officers in t.'1e Station. At ~tat.ion staff.meeting I 
siated that reporting on CI mat~rial dorived from tho project was 
inadoquate a.-,d COS appeared to ~"'O along vi th this view. The conc,meus 
I sc,t. from the CA~~ Officers was ~~at the SP.-Ca8e Officer is not 
su.Ific:iently alert to the nee<! !,.•:- reportlnc or. tho CI· aspects of 
tho matter and is limiting hu,isel! to str1.ctly scrviciniJ SH. ·Division 
rnatturs. ·various Case Officers cited instances to me of conversations 
pointin~ to new clandestine. re.la!.icr.ships or contsininf; previously 
1...-nown clandestine relationships ::i the Soviet field which have noi;. 
been reportod. ' Owing to a lac.:.: c,.f timP., I wao unablo to oxa1nine the 
records 11',vself, but I am incline-:i" t-o accept thoso stl\temm ts as true. 
2. Tho Caso.Of!ice-r gave~~ a r,eneral.run-down of tho situation 
of tho agents on this project a?":: it-appears that everything is running 
'· very w·cu. He told ::e that in ~s nt"J project outline, wh.lch will 
he up. in a wee}: or two, he is i:::.ludinc s-,mQ raises to some of the 
ae,ents. He iold 11'.e that on ·his la$t round of pa:, raises hu had some 
difftculty·hero at headquarters. If any diff1c11lt.y scens forthco:ning 
V 
U1is time, I s~ould Hirn to hav-, tho .rnat-ter brou,;ht tomy attention 
·because, as YoU know, I feel v~~- stronr,ly on this matter and fought 
t.~o :;n:i:o battlo:i -.nth hea.:lquart.,:-s fvr at leant five years. • •·. 
• J. In speaklne vi.th the Ca~c Officers or. the Cuban side, as well 
as on the CI, it wa3 apparent t.'lat UF:'AT remains probably the bi€'~St 
si.nde s0urce ,,f informatio~ avs..ila~lo to t.,e 1-'.c:r.ico Cl t\• Station 
anJ - that e'lery effort should 1't> r:.ace to· continue its sn:o~t.h functioning. 
,-
If t.'11~ means .a couole of huncre-.:l ::-esos .inc;:-r<ase to each a~ent semi-annually 
or annually, it does :iot setwi t.., -~ too much of a strairt and I <lo net 
see why 1o-e should !':ave any tro.:~.le. When I coir.pare the salaries ot 
the base operator:, ar.d proce!sc-::-s c~ t~is project, especially c:onsicering 
the illegal position the.v ru-e b, vit.'1 those of relativel.,· unproductive 
agents elsewhez·o in· !~exic_o and i.~ :::a.."ly ot.'1er St:itions, I cannot help 
bt.t feel that we· ate bu;,i.n~ a ~'It deal for our r.iont1y in t.~is project.
