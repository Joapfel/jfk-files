1. Headquarters has an extensive file on Rolando MASPERltEJl 
Rojas (201-04266~). There is no indication that Headquarters 
has been in toua with Su!>ject at anyti~e; h01'ever, Subject's son 
has-been a source of information to WODISH on several occasions. 
2. Subject•s D .indicates that 'te was hq,risoned in 
1970 for his part in an abortive atte~pt to invade Haiti in 1966. 
There is no in~ication in the file when Subject was released from 
prison. Subject's contacts are within the Cuban exlle c01Rmunity 
and elsewhere in Latin >.urica along with his own private holdings 
whereby he would not have needed assistance in resettling in 
Honduras.
