t.OSZNKO's first reference to JCUNSON ir. 1964 was at a meet­
ing on 2 February, ~hen he produced a note ·bearing that r.aJT,e a~d 
the date 5 January 1_262., • '_'Here· I have a r.ame Jotted down, 
Everett ~iallace Lsi£,F JO~SON," NOS~KO said. "The date was 
. 5 January 1962, but what too.k place Y. ha\'e absolutely no recol­
lectior.. I don't think it was a rccruitr.1ent, but it.was some 
sort· ·of -:ontact, or he ,was being:· stcdied or worked on, o:- some­
thing i'ike that. But I remember nothing." 
NOSE:NKO next rr.entioned his approach to JOHNSON on 17 April 
1964. Although not i~mediately recalling JCHNSON's nrur:e, he 
eventually rement.P.red that "it was scmethir.g like JOHNSON, 
JOID.STON, or sorr,ething that starts with a 'J'" ar,d that he was 
a Baptist from the California coast. NOS~1Y.O placed the opera­
tion sOCletime in the sum.~er of 1962, after his return to Moscow 
fro.-n Geneva, bE,cause he also reme,::-,bered wearing "just a ·coat, 
no overcoat at the time." JOHNSON, who had come to tr,e Soviet 
Union as a tourist, was known to be ·a socialist, and on this 
basis the KGB Seco~a Chief Directorate considered him as a 
recruitment target. When the Second Chief Direc~orate checked 
whether the KGB First Chief ~irectcrate Wv'Jld have any use for 
JOHNSON as an ager,t, however, it learned there was no interest 
~ in JOHNSOS: He had no access to important information, and he 
lived too far from the KGB LE:gal Residencies in the United 
States for convenient contact. 
Several days later KGB surveillance observed JO~SON 
mailing some letters in Moscow. When read by the KGB they were 
found to be_"so bi!:_ter toward the Soviet Union, angry, critical,. 
that they Lthe KGY decided something had· to be done" to stop. 
him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on 
his return to the United States. At about the same tur.e there 
was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual. and it was decided 
to entrap him on this basis. The sole reason ,.,as to halt 
JOHNSOS's criticism of the USSR - no recrui~~ent was attempted, 
because neither the First nor the Second Chief Directorates 
had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had deter'-
. mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal 
any.ray. NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the 
approach to JOHNSON, except.that "BOBKOV said I should go."
