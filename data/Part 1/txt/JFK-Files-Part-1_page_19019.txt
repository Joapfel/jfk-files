9 •.. On Kendzia's resignation·, Guenther Mense\, a member of the 
Executive Committee, was selected as. Acting P~ .. ty Chief and Speaker 
or·· the Par:ty·--Council until ,a new···Execut-ive Committee is elected in 
October. 'Menscl, an at'torney, ·was hesitant about accepting thc.'job 
because ~f tis-possible ~tf~ct 6n.his practi~e, and did not commit 
himself until the 10 April executive meeting .•. Menst'l's age (62) 011d 
stabili·ty were'•th·e main reasons for his selection. The only other 
replacement considered was Guenter Kleinert, also on the Executive 
Committee·, whom Kendzia did not trust. Mensel 's duties a~e to con-
• sist of calling and chairing pr_o-forma monthly Executive Committee 
n:eE:ti'ngs and-of presiding at the pnrty congress next ~ctober. 
10. Kendzia considers his re~ignatton a temporary tactical re­
treat cau.sed- by disagreements with the NPD national and Derlin dis­
trict leaders, by von Thadden's public rejection of his "Berlin 
Program," losa of busin_cs8 because of un.i"nvor=-!blc publicity,· a_nd a 
hit_.and-run car riccident involving a bicy'clist on 27 March. Kendzia 
promised ?Jensel to remain acLive behi~d the scenes and set up' 1) 
_ va·cant office .in •his place of bus-iness as party henclqliarters, with 
desks for himse 1f and Executive ·t01nmit tee members Frank ~chwerdt, 
Joachim. Rebuscha.t and Hans Werner Andrens, the de ~ heads of the 
Berlin NPD. 
11. Kendzia anct a maJority of the NPD l~aders hope that the fall 
elections will brin"' some 25 to 35 NPD members inLo the Dundestag. 
ThiR, they feel, will make the party more ncccptable to potential 
right-wing voters in Berlin and ,thus enable the NPD to make a showing 
in .:he 1971 Ber) in communa 1 e lcct ions. (Source Comment: The Berl in 
NPD-'s maJor problem in Berlin is to keep its membership intact and 
its m_achinery- flinccioni11g until 1971. -Whether Kendzia will hold to 
his promise to direct ·the Berlin NPD from behind the scenes indefi­
aitely, • and whether he will emerge as leader 'in 1971, are open ques­
tio.ns, .because Kendzia has shown an interest in the current program 
and····policies ·of the Free Democrntic Party (FOP) and pnrticularly in .. 
its "Ge'neral-Contract" concept, which fits in wit·h his "Berlin • 
Program." A close friend of Kcndzin's, (fnu) Nerchert,., resigned from 
the NPD. to protest._its participntion in t~e presidential election in 
&,run on 5 ~nrch nnd has alrendy mnde overtures to the FOP.)
