1.- Personnel 
The problem on l~ck ot. personnel b.u been and is one ot the main difficulties 
which the Section has'encountered in its labor. Countless are tbe motives tor 
this, amonc whicb we can list. 
A .. - lDNs ot capable persoMel I Due to. the importance· or the labor developed in 
Latin America, the personnel nth capacity tor the wrk is not veq abundant. 
B.-·PersoMl problems or the aspirants to Delegates a This is one ot the most. 
conflictive 1110t.iv<ls we are ac"ually facing. . 
Uore than exile by the Cuban people, what is actually taking place is a 
massive exodus ot ou.r people;. Consequently,being in the need ot working t.o 
help their families, C\&I\)" Di31.egates haw had to give up. ~heir labors: and coope .. 
ration with us. In 111..'U\)' cases, aspirants to Delep.tes have been forced .to abculdon 
tne Plan .remaining only a rew days tor their depart)U"e. •

c.- Problel!lS on obtainine; vi~as a The d.U'ficulties .in ob~ng the visas lc,r several 
. countries {like Colombia, Maxi~, El Salvador, Santo Domingo ) bas also • on 
many occasions, hindered the departure ot the Dele@tes !or IAtin America. Tb9~ 
is a specil1c example in Mexico,. for Ylhich it bas be.m abs.:>lutely 1Jlpossible 
to obtain the visas; in spite .ot all the etrorts ~de. :.tiny ddlegat:!s in these 
said conditions or inactivity have consequently abandoned the plan. 
D.- Prob.},ems ot Delegates in the resoe£tive coubtrJ,es, The problm the Delegates 
have had to race in the different countries have be-en so :nany that it results 
imposible to outline them all. We wlll tey to point our those which W8 consi­
der are the most import.1\1 
a.- ~conopdc dif'ticultie~ I The Dalega.tes lacked operaUo.-ial !'unds to develop 
their plans !or approxiaat.;!l.;r one year. Their field ot operation na 
logically l"ljtducecl to the .least. Actually the delegates do have thase funds, 
though, evidently, many ot ~ p:.ans could not be carried through tbea. 
b.- Probl.eas with American ot11.c1als in the ditterent countrles1 Th:>ugh 1n the 
1Mjo;;.•it1 o~. the cowitries our relations are the best,pevertheless, we ha'IJe 
bad to face proble:is in s~. For example, in Honduras 1Ye have ·bad to 
change the Delegate due to pressure of B:ltista S'JPporters. In our Delesation 
at Sao Paolo, Braz!.l, our ~satEs have even bad :to clean fields, just aa 
simple workers, ( the7 ware not sent to Latin A.eerie& tor such purposes) 
and further more they have eve.-i been prohibited to use the nue ot the ms.
