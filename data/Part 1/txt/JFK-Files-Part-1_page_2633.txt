Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943. 
In a second version [more probaule since entry to the Moscow 
Special Naval School required prior completion of the 
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said. that when the war broke out he 
and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he 
completed
1 
the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned 
t9 Moscow afterwarcls, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the 
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he 
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943 
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory 
School (then in Baku). 
. . After just six months in Baku, without completing the • 
Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to 
Moscow.· 
Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran 
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and 
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku 
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the 
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of 
Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions. 
NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the 
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval 
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he 
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO 
•• received a gunshot wound in .the hand, and after being 
hos_pi tali zed for a month, he left the Naval school.
