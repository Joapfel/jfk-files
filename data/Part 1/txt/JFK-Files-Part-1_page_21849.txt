NOSENKO' s exact state:nents and meaning on -variou, speci•fic sub­
jects. The protocols were in no way presented to t,OSENKO as 
docwnentary portion.s of a •confession," but_ ::,at.her as distilled 
and final stater:ients o! \ohat he did e.:td did not kr.o..· concerning 
particular topics. NOSE~KO was asked to read each page of each 
protocol carefully and to sign his name at the botto:n to indi­
cate that he understood and agrend \olith its cor,tcr.ts; he was 
allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to ask any 
qc.eetions and make any .changes that he wished. (A!::end:nants wer·e 
entered by the interrogators ar.d were· i~itialed ~y NCSENKO.) 
NOSENKO was asked, a!ter reading.each page and after completing 
the entire protocol, whether he understood whut was writt~n there 
and whether there w&re any more changes he wished to make. He 
was then asked·to sign and date the statement, "I have read and 
understood this report and certify it as correct," at the end of 
the final page. With one exception, which will be noted later, 
he did so calmly and without objection~, although o~ one or two 
of them he rem~rked that his st~tements were pres8nted in ~uch 
a manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do 
so, he was not able to suggest any cha~ges of fact or presenta-
tion which would make them more ac.curate.· Cor.unenting en the 
use of interrogation reports, NOSE~KO said on 4 ~arch 1965: 
"My life story is absolutely correct. Anytnin1 I tave signed 
is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand ~hat I am doing 
when I am signing any paper. Thi~ i~ an official document, and 
I ful:y understand what I'm doing when I sign it as being abso­
lutely correct." 
In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail 
on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he enteted the 
KGB, -in an attempt to gain additional ir,si.ghts ir.to his charac-
ter and personality. ~

Further questioning was conducted froM 26 July until 1\ August 
1965 with the participation of Peter DER'iABIN, a former KGB offi­
cer. These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian, 
were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience 
in the KGB to obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's per-
sonal and professional background. 
There·were n~ further debriefings or interrogations u.~til 
1.8 October 1966. On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the 
case of Lee Harvey OSWALD. 
During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned !':or 
seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his 
identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera­
tions. Questioning was in both Russian and English.
