the [Bri tisl_D Security Service, has provided the following in 
a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the 
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation: 
"Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans, 
Louisiana 
A secret and reliable source has reported that the 
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch 
with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the ini­
tiative in this contact appears to have come from 
the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to 
persuade Garrison to write an article about the 
late President Kennedy's assassination which pre­
sumably the Foundation could use in some way."
