Such a reply of the Government of the United States of Ame:rica 
to the communication of the Soviet Government cannot fail to cause 
serious concern, the more so since the new case of violation of Soviet 
airspace took place after warnings on the part of the Government of 
the USSR to the effect that American authorities should take the 
necessary steps to prevent such violations. 
. In connection with the foregoing the Soviet Government expects 
that the Government of the United States of America will undertake 
further investigation of this act of violation of the airspace of the 
USSR by an American military aircraft and will punish severely those 
guilty of this violation. 
The Soviet· Government also expects that the Government of 
the United States of Am.erica will take the necessary steps to prevent 
violations of Soviet airspace by American ai~craft in the future and 
states that in the event of new violations full responsibility for their 
consequences will rest with the Government of the United States.
