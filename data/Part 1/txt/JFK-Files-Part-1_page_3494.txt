SOURCL A Cuban exile observer who was present du.ring the s~ech. 
1. 
Headquarters Cnm'lft8nt. The following is a reswtae of the political 
philosophy of ~anuel Artime Buesa, leader of ~e Kovimiento de 
Recuperacion R~volucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary 
Reco,·ory) as prepared by SourcE. It is based on statements 
made by Artimt) in bis speech on 18 March 196-1 to the Associaci6n 
para Recuperaci6n Econdmica de Cuba (AREC, Association for 
Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled 
Comunismo por ~u~? (Communism ~or what?), which was written 
nine months b~tore Castro came to power, and on Artim.e's .book 
Traici6n (Betrayal). 
Artime does l'.Ot believe in political extnaes ~ neither the 
left nor the right. He believes that extreaes always end by 
touching one another.. If any extreme gains power in Cuba, 
and in the case of the extreme right by imposi.ng a dictatorship, 
be will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does 
not believe in the classification .of men by race, by political 
ranks in former governments,. or by money. Be confesses ·to.being 
an opportunist in the sense that he is taking aaximum advantage 
ot each opporiunity, but not in the sense of ch.8.nging his 
beliefs in acnord with opportun~ties. 
- . - . 
The main then nf Comunismo por gue? was that aore than a change 
in government a chr.nge in the conscience of aen is needed. It 
outlined the duti~s of the padr6n (landowner) toward ~he workers 
so that the latter may live in dignity and honor. The padron 
should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems. 
Tbe worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron. If 
tbi■ ¥e~d pro luo is not adhered to, a (ChrlsUan) government
