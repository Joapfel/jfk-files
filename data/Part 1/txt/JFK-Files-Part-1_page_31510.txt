1. Admiral.Miller will call upon tho DDCI Doon to request 
more funr.1.9 for. the CrU!ladc for Freedom. At the prc~ont rilto of 
exp,.in~ture, funti:J will run _out on Jl Docomber. 
2. $488,991 vas buc:teoted for the Crusado this yeor. Wo 
havo told Admiral Miller that since t.hc Cru:1ado wa:J unnl>le to 
live within this.budget, wo were certain that the A~cncy would

4. There is a good deal of gos:iip about th_o use of Crusade 
t.unds and I_ think you should be acquainted wi_th it. Bec.'.luse the
