was "in constant contact ,.,-i:h the govern­

,·asion altempt and th~t he "did nothing 
wrong." ln 1970, however. WerRell told 
a·n ._At:anl!! magazine writer, '.'·When ,·ou

"T!Je company" is g1ine~ally u~_ed as.a 
euphemism for the Central Intelligence 
Agency - an arm of gO\·eniment Wer&-11 • 
says now· he has ne,·er had anything to do 
with, excl'pt • to sell it some guns. The 
compar.y he was talking about, he says, 
w:is CBS. O,·er the year,;. ho,.,·e,·er, Wer­
Bell has spoken often. l'f his association 
,.,·ith the Company. Producer McM•11len 
quoted WerBell to the con~ssmen as say­
ing he had "previous e:iperience·· with "the 
company:"' "'And "'hen I asked him what 
company he meant, he said the CIA,'~ Mc­
Mullen said. 
"Everybc-,dy al .... ·ays irets that impression 
about any goddam th:ng -"'~ do,·• WerBell 
says. It is a conclusion that"· ,s neither 
d1fticult nor illogical. It may not, howe.'er, 
be accurate. 
But \lihat, then, was Mitch WcrBt-11.

• was -. in th~ Dominir:sn :iepublic that

ble-timed it to the ,Qzama Ri,·er? The 
tanks were attemptin!? to capture as much

simulated rank. of ,najor:~itenil'" supplied 
by the U.S. Air Fon:e as lie demonstmted 
his · firm's re,-olutionary silenced sub­
machine gun to a South Vietnamese gener­
al? 
To questions such as these, WerBell'a 
standard reply is. "( guess I'm just lurky." 
Murl" titan just lucl:. howc,·er, WerBell's 
propensity fur being in•the crucial place 
at the crucial time seems to stem from a 
combination of machismo, the profit mo­
tive. 11 knA<"lr: fnr d~~lopin,; .!'\Jnh, .;..\,;,ly rnJ•

The Old Boy 1'etwork - "And don't you 
ever kid yourself that there isn't such a 
thing," says Wer&ll - is the cloak-and­
dagger types' answer to the union hiring 
hal!. It is a loc-.;ely structured help want• 
ed-situation wanted grapevine. "I became 
friends with a bunch of guys who are now 
four- and fo·e-star generals," recalls Wer­
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind 
,Japanese 'iines in World War ll. 
M~morabilia of the OSS days and sub­
sequent ad,;-entum hang in WerBell's 
home and in his psyche. The wallJ of both 
his upst'airs den and· downstairs "war 
room·· are derorat!'d "'·ith dozens of hunt­
ing (upsta(rsl and military "(downstairs) 
weapons. Si:i unsheathed sword!i are 
mounted en the d<>or of !he li'.juor cabinet. 
Two glas.~ display cases in the den, each 
locked, contain handguns ranging. from 
sta:idard .4.'> autorn11tics to sirgle-shot 
assa.,-.•ina'tion pistol~. Daggers, bayonets 
and throwing kni--es .• till the in-between 
spares as bric-a-brac. Photographs of 
short, slant-ewd l(t'nerals ha·ng on walls 
and stand on tables. Between t"'-o 11.ild.boar 
heads abo,·e the den.·entrance is a framed 
,ertificate from the \'ictnaml'Se Airborne. 
The big1:est war sou.-enir, though, isn'.t 
on WerHell"s wall. It is in his head - the 
way a man of 5,; acts aiter· more than 20 
years of bei»g in and on the fringt>s of vio­
ient conflict.s. Some· of it, obviously, i!,
