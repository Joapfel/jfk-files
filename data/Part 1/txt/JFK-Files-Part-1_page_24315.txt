heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this· woul4 fall), 
and those thre_, have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well: 
Breckenridge, Hornstein and Friend. QRPHONE has talents and abili­
ties and weaknesses which can best be explai{led/ sold in person, not • 
through dispatch. I think, that the way to do it, if at all, is by Spence 
during a visit to these Stations. 
f. "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often 
this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand Horvath 
asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the 
operation that ·would have given him this information.) I do not know 
what you now expect to find. In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels 
the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would 
consider a Staff-internal review pretty much a waste of time. 
3. Having gone around this problem several times in the past 
several years-with CI Staff and the pertinent area divisionP.. (as the 
files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider 
QRPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it 
costs to maintain him. We may be able to justify it since we attempt 
(as no one area division would) -- and to some extent succeed -- to target 
him on a multi-divisional basis. In light of these considerations, and 
since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability 
of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe 
that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of 
the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course, 
entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least three area divisions.
