The t:d . ._."'J in December 1963, according to NOSENKO, was to 
p~rticipate i.n '!:he search for Aleksandr CHEREPANOV. Acco1·ding to 
NOS~NKO, t~s particU:ar document was not acco·,.mtable in th.at it was ._ 
only necessary ~o turn it in when :requesting reimbursement £or travel 
. e::>s.-penses. NOSEN.i<:O stated that ::ie had not clai...,ied the rather small 
amount of money to whlcb. he was entitled and ha.s also admitted that he 
• really brought the docu."nent along because it gave him the indica.t~cl rank 
of Lieutenan'!: Colonel. 
NOSENKO has completely retracted his clai...-n. to having had the 
rank of Lieutenant Colonel,. stating that even a.s a Deputy Chief of D3pa.:rt.:. 
ment he was only a Captain although be vr::a.s entitled to and expected to 
:receive the rank 0£ Major in early 1964. NOSE::N'KO has stated that 
giving hi:rp. the rank of Lieutenant Colonel h1 tb.e above documer ... t was 
the error of KASHPEROV, the officer on duty in the SCD. on Sunday, a:..1d. 
that practically all Deputy Chiefs of Department in the SCD had at least 
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 
The above explanation by NCSENKO may well 'be considered by 
rea9-ers with at least a degree of skepticism. However, ii NOSENKO 
was di~pa.tched by the KGB, it would seem that he cou.ld have been pro-• 
vided w~th something a little mo::.:e substau-;ial to docu:.:nent his cla.i::.n o£
