QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King 
Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin 
Luther King Foundation, where he met with 
Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization. 
Tbdre was recently a split in the Center and the 
Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out 
of office. The office is still vacant and, 
according to Porter, will remain so for the 
1-ediate future. The reason for the continued 
vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King.and 
other members of the Board of Directors to 
maintain direct control. Porter is a former 
writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said 
that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly bow. 
QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a 
brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said 
that the Center is going to establish a foreign 
affairs staff which will be beaded by Jack O'Dell, 
an old CP member. 
3. After QRPHONE's discourse on bis trip, Andy 
discussed in broad terms what be could expect in the 
next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese. 
QRPHONE was told that once be was proficient in M-L 
be would be expected to go out and test his knowledge 
with various individuals and organizations in order to 
gain access and become known to the Chinese. Andy 
emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have 
to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if be 
was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE 
Accepted this.
