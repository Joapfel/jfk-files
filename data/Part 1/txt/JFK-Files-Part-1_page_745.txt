c. Via I~enti ty-4 ~1NLtfJK)prLssed guidance material 
to M~xico'e toµ female poet, Margarita MICHELENA, . 
·concerning YEVTUSHENKO. MICHELENA published a series 
of profession.al criticisms of YEVTUSHENKO as a poor·• 1 
poet and opportunist in the Mexican press. In April,·~ 
inunediat.ely following YEVTUSHENK'l's departure, a con­
densation of the MICHELENA critt·:iues of YEVTUSHENKO were 
published in the leftist political illustrated magazine 
"IMPACT()" py LILISP-E .• 
d. Ident1.tles 3 and 6 of t'n-e LIANCHOR group also 
publ i'shed art i.cles against YEVT'TJSHENKO in the rightist 
daily "EL SOL", but the Station felt the articles were 
too vitriolic ar,J unobjective to be a credit to LIANCHOR. 
In fact, because of these articles the Station plans to 
remove both Identities 3 ana 7 from LIANCHOR; for it is 
obvious that both persons have long since lost all traces 
of th,ir former leftism and are extreme rightists.

8. Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of 
Guatemala Dally "EL IMPARCIAL": 
a. Duringn,INLU~~~Easter visit to Guatemala City 
he was told by \he owner of ''EL IMPARCIAL" that the -:>/ 
newspaper was only interested in publishing (LINLUCK's) 
articles. The newspaper owner stated tbat(!,INLUCK\was 
a well-known personality in Guatemala and also wroftt'\ 
interestingly. The owner also said that he had pub-
1 iehed .one series by Identi ty-4 because Iden.ti ty-4 was 
a Guatemalan who at one time bad been ~mportant. However, 
the owner pointed out that the other LIANCROR writers 
were unknowns and did not write well. He singled out 
Identity-3 as being a "menace to journalism" because much 
of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander.

the newspapers "EL DIA" of Honduras, "LA PRENSA GRAF I CA"
