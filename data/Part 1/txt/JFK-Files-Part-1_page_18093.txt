have Leen mounted. The operation i tsclf. w:is an attempt to

. Another very effecti\;e performance by LIONION..;l was his 
obtaining_, ~Y -~harp observ'ation and quick, intelligent and 
secure·._action, ·an apart:wnt in a building directly across 
tbe street from the target. The Station ha~ been seeking 
an apartment in this building for many years. 
E •. Problems: The only problem curr-?ntly besetting the Project 
is the excessive work load on the Prin~ip:il Agent. To alleviate 
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of 
the film produced by the Project. 
Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has 
received his permanent imr.:i~rant status and now has a good deal 
of immun_i ty from harassment from Mexican imrnigrat ion authorities. 
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly 
cut of the Office of. the President of Mexico and thus has a 
strong protectiv·c security factor built into it. 
F. Liaison: The Project has no liaison connection. LIONION-l's 
co,·er backstop with the Office of th~ President of Mexlco is non­
operational.· 
G. Interagency Coordin3tion: Not applicable. 
H. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-l's 
observaITons and operational logbooks dui·ing thcrorning year
