Top Secret 
(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER) 
NOSENKO said in October 1966 interrogations that he had 
lied when he had claimed in 1964 to be a lieutenant colonel, 
that actually he had been but a captain. Asked why he had 
claimed in 1962 that he had been a major, NOSFNKO denied 
that he had ever even mentioned his rank to CIA in 1962 . 
Conclusion 
NOSENKO has stated that he became a senior lieutenant in 
the KGB in 1952, April 1953, 1954, or 1956. He was promoted 
to the rank ofcaptain in 1956 or September/October/December 
1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a lieutenant . 
colonel in October/November 1963. He brought to Geneva in 
· 1964. an official KGB document· dated··. Nover1ber 1963 identifying 
him as a KGB lieutenant colonel. In retracting his claim 
that he was ever a major or lieutenant colonel, NOSENKO 
asserts that nevertheless as a captain, he held the position 
of First Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department. 
NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to 
his KGB rank parallel and are apparently related to his 
contradicted and retracted.claims regarding Naval RU 
··service,· date of entry to the KGB, KGD assignments and 
positions held:, and in short, to the totality of his claims 
regarding.KGB service, few of which are credible.
