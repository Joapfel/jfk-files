1. SubJect to Brussels station vicva., Bead.quarters believes that 
S'fr3lllt'e proposal 1n Re:fcrence is a-good one £Dd very consistent vith 
our interea1.a that he develop bis acceas and acccptabllity vithin tbe 
circles or wich Ref' Iden A is a s~icant f161,U'C. We realize that 
the picture J.a a cocip.Ucated one, md that Iden A of' Re:f my or my not 
19t prove to have the ata¥1ng po,,er of tbe 8\lccessi'ul political 1'161,U"e. _ 
At the ema t.ime., it does seem that he 1a the 11108t ou1.at&nd1ng leader 
at the ent1•rev1a1on.1a1.a todey, and ea such merits our attent10D. 
2. Vith reprct to Re.ference para !a-•a concern about possible damage 
to our natioaal. interest ey publlcat.ion of tbe book in !ngllsh, we tend 
to 8148 Vi th 8l:EWaY in feeling that the support vilich such a publica­
ticlll aight render to our enemies could not really" be detected by the 
naked eye. S:lmUarl,y, -while 1161""1.ng vith the senti.aent that. wul.d 
crit!call,y scrutinize all proposals by nev aaaets, we note that Sl'E'BOBr 
ts, indeed, supposed to be aeek1ng to rcGBin status amoog hi.a rormer 
asaociates, and that Ref proposal does not, to our viev., contain any 
hint which would suggest that in tolloving out this line or action a1. 
our cllrect.ioD, he 1a 1:10tivated by BAY ul.terior or concealed aim difi"erent 
f'1'all that \lhich led us to impose the COtl!ILLsaiOn 1n the first place. 
l• Ve are a.tte1111t1Dg to get a roush translation done on a J,)r1or1 ty­
baaia. S'.rEBO?iY, or course, should understand that such a tnmala1.1on 
v1ll be unf'in1shed, ldlCl should be caref'ully revieved for the proper 
"feel.," to rule out usage or interpretntioD Vbich S'lEOOBY, vith hie 
background, IIOUld never have inferred frO!:l tho French text. Banethe­
less, aa the cJoc\Jaent has came to band onl,y on 2 July, and given the
