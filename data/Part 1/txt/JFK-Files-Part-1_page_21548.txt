What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to 
the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite is an 
understanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the knowledge 0£ 
the methods.of the comm·unist regime, the knowledge.o!.the .real foreign 
and interior policies of the Soviet gove·rnment and the faith in the right~ 
nese o! the £rec world. 
It was not a decision· which was accepted·· or could be ·accepted 
in a month or a year. Thie decision was slowly growing in me. l 
think that the beginning was in, the studentship. 
Living with my parents. and being in the circles of the parent'&· 
and my acquaintances I knew more then there was written in newspapers 
and periodic& and that was propagandized by radio and TV, Working in 
the_ Far East and later being in trips in dil!erent regions and cities of 
Russia !_found out much better the life and conditions oi the life oi .the 
•• people of the Soviet Russia. . . .
