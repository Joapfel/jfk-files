S'ECRET/SENSITl·VE (-~ 
Ex-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not. 
I am quite certain their work paths never crossed. 
LIADLIB is still in Mexico. He has had a difficult 
time sinc;e his "resignation" getting a job, 
keeping a job, and making ends meet. _It probably 
would be to BKTRUST's disadvantage now for 
the two to meet. For this reason, and to assess , 
ex-LIADLl"B-s present state of mind, .Headquarters ;_ 
sent saneone to ta 1 k with LI ADLI B--1 . in the spring 
of 1972. At that time he still seemed bitter 
against· BKTRUST. 
Other than wishing to make s·pecial mention of 
EX-UADLIB-1, I know of no Agency personnel 
other than those in WH/l and the'Me~ico Ci.ty S.t.atio 
whom. he knew. 
5. OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL 
.- .·

_under whom Agee worked fr011 July ·1967 until the 
end of the Olympics.
