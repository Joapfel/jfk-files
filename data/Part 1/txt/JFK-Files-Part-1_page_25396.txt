9. Erne rgency • Cond It Ions, L 
If an official anti-USA atmosphere of sufficient 
Intensity prevailed In Mexico, LIHUFF/1 very probably would 
not be able to r..alntaln hlmse-lf here, par-tlcuJarly If his employment continued in his present capacity.· • This, 
however, Is not seen as anyth-ing except a very remote·contfn• 
gency due to the Government of Mexico's dependence on the U.S. 
.tour-1st trade. In a general war, It Is probable that LIHUFF/1 1 
would be able to continue In place without too much difficulty i 
and would be wllling to continue operating on current objectlvel 1 
or to undertake entirely new operations agaJnst new targets. '( 
Contact and communications should represent few problems In . •
