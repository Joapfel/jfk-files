Top Secret 
(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER) 
CornP.lent: NOSENKO is the only Soviet official known to 
CIA who claims to have occupied a position of 
trust and who claims he was not a Party member 
at the time. 
In the period following, 
11
to show his eagerness" and'·"to 
improve himself", NOSENKO asked for Party assignments. For 
more than a year he ran errands and collected newspapers and 
performed other such tasks. He stated that he applied for 
Party membership in January 1956, was accepted as a candidate 
member in 1956, and that he was accepted as a full Party 
member in 1957. 
Conclusion 
NOSENKO's claims about his Party activity do not ·sustain 
his claims to KGB service, and they suffer from identical 
disciepancies ~ith respect to chroriology, plausibility, 
and contradiction by independent sources. It is concluded 
that NOSENKO was never a Komsomol secretary and, if a member 
at a11; was no longer a member after reaching his twenty­
sixth birthday in October 1953. The period in which he had 
no Pa~ty status was twenty-eight months, not the fifteen he. 
claimed, and it covers the period of his first tour in the 
Embassy Section as well as a portion of his initial Seventh 
Department assignment. An officer unqualified for Party 
membership is ineligible· for:KGB service. Consequently, the 
evidence provided Ly examination of NOSENim' s Party status 
indicates that he was not serving in the I(GB through at 
least a portion of the 1953-1956 ·period.
