NOSENKO's Information 
NOSENKO personally and alone recruited the Moscow 
represent<;1-tive of 'f]ritish European Airway_@, wh<;>se name21 
NOSENKO did not recall, at the Hotel Metropol in Moscow 
during the summer of 1959, possibly in August. The approach 
was based ori homosexual compromise involving NOSENKO's 
agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV. 
NOSENKO explained that the Seventh Department in 1959 
had a section qealing with commercial representatives, which 
was responsible fo~ the~E~man. That section had asked 
NOSENKO's section for help.·21 
"They.said they didn't have any agents or any­
thing anq didn't know what to do. So somebody said, 
'Well look, why don't you ask the chief of the 
section?·· He's a special°ist.on homosexuals and can 
arrange everything for you••' So I wound up handling 
the case, and TARABRIN (of the First Chief Direct­
orate) said I should report to him." 
[In this passage NOSENKO was referring to himself, although 
he has always claimed he was Deputy chief of the section.]
