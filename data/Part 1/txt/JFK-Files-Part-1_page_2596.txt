Top Secret 
(Summary of Case) 
During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, constiltations 
were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken to restrict 
his movement~ and activities. This Agen~y was concerned 
that his behavior would attract undesirable attention and 
publi~ity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his 
bona £ides, which were becoming known to a widening group 
in the U,S. Governmenc, might be inadvertently revealed to 
NOSENKO himself. The FBI on 1 Apr{l indicated it would 
11 n o t i n t e r p ·o s e ob j e c t i on II to the C I A p 1 an t o 1 i mi t NOS EN KO ' s 
freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the 
Department of State, and the White House were advised. 
On 4 April NOSENKO was driven to a new safehouse in a 
Washington suburb, and told that this safehouse chenceforwaid 
would be his regular place of residence" Since that time 
NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been 
under full-time guard, and has not been permit~ed access to 
news media. 
Intensive ~nterrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic 
examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain 
information which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier, 
and to clarify c~ntradictioni in what he had already reported. 
The polygraph ex,mination results were inconclusive. This 
phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964. 
Despite the s~arching nature of the questions and the 
implicitly and ex~licitly expressed doubts of hi~ ~eracity, 
NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to 
answer all questions put to him, Because more information 
pertinent to the question of his bona £ides was needed, a 
new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964. 
Different interrogators were introduced and q~estioning was 
resumed in a neutral, non-host1le manner. The period of 
neutral questioning continued until mid-November 1964. 
After further consultations with the FBI, a round of 
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between 
then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of 
about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation 
teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous 
assertions. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements 
had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions
