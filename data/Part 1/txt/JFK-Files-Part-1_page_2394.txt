A theory which has previously been given consideration and 
warranted full consideration was that if NOSENKO was dispatched, 
his mission was to confuse leads furnished to American Intelligence 
and/or to denigrate the value of information furnished by GOLITSYN. 
In connection with this theory, it· should be· noted that NOSENKO during 
current interviews has not made any remarks which could in any way 
• be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does 
not claim to have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently, 
when so.me topic peculiar to the FCD has been broach_~d with NOSENKO, 
his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn 1t work in the FCD, " 
or "You should ask GOLITSYN about that."

In connection with any consideration of whether the contact _of 
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by 
the KGB as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN, the timing of certain 
events should be noted. GOLITSYN defected on: 15 December 1961. 
NOSENKO departed from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzerland, 
where he remained until 15 June 1962. 
It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not 
impossible for KGB officials to complete an assessment of the actual or 
potential damage which could result from the defection of GOLITS YN,
