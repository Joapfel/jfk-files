As fleadqu~rters is aware, JMWAVC is refuting on a con­
tinuing basis and via all appropriate assets commentaries 
similar to that discusoed in the reference. As for this 
particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance 
for AMSCROLL use, pdmarily its radio, the point of which 
was that GOMCZ had becon;ie eligible for the "Foot •n· Mouth 
Club" due his admission on 21 October that Camarioca was a 
plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a 
.result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think 
I made excessive concessions•••" explaining that the people 
are really leaving due to economic reasons. We agree and 
say .that the economic reasono are to obtain three meals a 
day, to be able to walk into a market and buy eggs and milk. 
The guidance ends with this:· "You may take_your foot out of 
your mouth now, GOMEZ".
