WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS I~'VOLVED 
l.· We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch, 
WKSCARLET-·3 and several other. CUban exiles "-ere recently arrested 
and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on 
6 Octo~er. After having read these accounts NOC Byron~ .. GUTRAM' 
reported, for the record, that.he once knew Eosch and WKSCARLET-3 
in the early 1960' s. ·GuTRADT ·met l\"'KSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both 
wer~ enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. GUTRADT at that 
time had already terminated his relationship ~ith BKHERALD. 
While at o~s GUTRADr was not particularly close ·to WKSCA,RLET-3 
• but KKSCARLET-3 was generally knm.ledgeable o! GUTRADT's back­
ground and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen 
KKSCARLET-3 since 196~ after completion of the OCS course and 
dout:ts seriously that WKSCl,RLET-3 "'Ould rer.:er.-.l::-er him. 
2. GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Y.ia~i when GUTRADT was 
training Bosch in a BKHEr~'\LD-sponsored progra~. Bosch only knew 
GUTAADT in alias. G~TRJ\DT h~s not seen Bosch since completion 
of this training. 
3. Given the .length of time that has el&rsed plus the lack 
of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Besch, G~"TRADT and the 
Station do not believe that their knowledge cf his past BKHERALD 
activities presents any security prcblems todar. GUTRADT, of 
course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and 
was surprised to hear of the bor.~ing of the Cut~na airliner.
