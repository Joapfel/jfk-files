We need to get a finn coJlll!li bnent vi th nepeet to the Cru1111.de1 s next balloon_ . _r. • 1 
operation. • /4~ i,.y--}_7'; 
Our best target trom the point or view ?! geography and RFF. rad~~verag6 ~- \\l 
is Czechoslovakia. We can go into Pound and fhmr,Ary 501116What lenc efficiently. l 
If Hungary vhould be thetarget, we vill precumahly still havo the problel!I or 'p., 
clearanc6 trom the Bri tioh to launch f'Nl!l their Zone, and failing th.1t flhoul<yt"' > ., 
have to back up to our Zona. Lv-""

country is perhaps ot· oomo slisht additional desirability from the p8)'cho-·~• \..,r. 
logical point ot viev. It is, however, n?t essential. From tho p.,int ot JJ--··\'-
viev or our campaign schedule, .an initial launching date or about Augi1at • ...,'r' 
20th would be ideal. Thia would allov t.r.e 51.ory on the oporat.ion and it.a )r _.,. 
effect to become known at. tJ1e opening o! our September campaign. • T~~f 
We have in storage in Munich So,ooo packu,es (or tvo each) or razor blades, "i h .,,. 
100,000 zippers, 72,000 packets or needlH {five to the packet), and lS0,000 S•·ty 
cakes or ooap ( 1/2, J/4 and one ounce dz.es). All or the above except ::,.K·. 
needles vcre donations to tJ1e Crusade, and the noedles were at coot. w-,- t.-•' 
have had to tell Gillette and Talon tvic,r; (at ChristmRs ancl Rt l!:a!!ter) that~< 
the operation for which they supplied tlleir products had been delayed. We G_ ~,..

~...l•i'j~--I do not knov vhat keepe putting this ,,rr the track. It is ZIG' intormat.ion 
that the boye in the big house were initially enthusiast.ic about the idea, v"v; 
and the rei'-0rd will show that .Ambassador Eriggs thought it most valuable 'r -¾;;,;

I would npprecia te your ge tt.ing us as sooa as pi>ssi bla a positive arxl ( barring ~- r · 
an act or God) irrevocable approval tor a balloon operation into a speclfied~v 
target country at a certain _date, vit.h ilLreement in principal on the natun/" 
of the operation ;._ i.e.; or an order o! .magnitude of 6o,ooo to 75,000 
vehicles, bearing the above mentioned aat.erials together vi th mes&af88. r" . . , <­
To repeat, by tar the beet tarset is Czeccoslovakia; our pre!erred dates.··:.,._ .. ;> 
around August. 20th. " 
Let us not make this ar,proval in princl;:le (vi.th tine date and target) 
contingent on a budget, except in a geceral vay. With an aJ.llroV&l. in h.and, 
w can proceed vi th plans and supply a fairly accurate budget, wh.1 ch vill 
depend somewhat on such thinss as whet.her ve can use the P-20 balloons on 
band for the short fiight to Prague or 10et.cer we will have to resort. to 
P-50 1 • tor the longer !light. into f'oland or from the U.S. Zone ot Auat.ri.a
