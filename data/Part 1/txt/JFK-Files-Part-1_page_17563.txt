0'· It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support- p:-ovided 
to other Station operations, the CE informa:::ion obtained, and the positive 
lnt.elligence gathered by Project LIFEA T well justify the expenditure of 
KUBARK assets in terms of funds, per:ronnel, time a.1d .;;ecurity risk.

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are-of 
a contlnuing na;ure and not desfgne.d to be fulflHPd within a given period, 
no sta:istics ca.1 be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each 
objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the 
coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately 
15,000 pages of raw tex.: were p~ovided in =he July 1939 to May 1960 period. 
LIFEA T has been ln daily operation during the review period with the 
number of lines covei:ed varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be
