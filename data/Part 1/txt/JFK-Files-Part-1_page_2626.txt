(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS) 
Comment: (Continued) 
the KGB with a mock code machine rotor. He 
further acknowledged that he had been recon­
tacted by the KGB in the United States in 
1957, where he met KGB officers regularly 
until September 1962. He identified by photo­
graph all of the KGB officers described by 
NOSENKO as having taken part in the oper~tion. 
NOSENKO "cannot be certain" that he did not 
know about "ANDREY" while he served in the 
Embassy Section in 1953-1955, and when pressed 
to describe specifically the source of his 
information, he invariably indicated that he 
learned of the American agent later, informally 
from KGB colleagues.
