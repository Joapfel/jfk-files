not sure about RISLITSYN and cculd have given ther.1 to another 
officer. •it KISLITSYN came (back from Australia) in 1953, then 
it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwis~, it was someone else.a 
}·'• 
18 June 1964: •KISLITSYN came into th~ First Section in 
_1954 and I gave him the files on l\merican correspondents. BUDYL­
DIN also joined the section this year and took the files o.n the 
Army Attache and his assistants from .PANKR.\TOV. BUDYLDIN left 
later that year and turned those files over to me.~. Yuriy 
LEONTIYEV joined the section in 19·55, and I gave him the files 
on the Army Attache and his assistants." 
NOSENKO has also been indefinite as to the date he. assu~ed 
responsibilities for the attaches. hs noted above, he said on 
10 April 1964 that he received the files in the beginning of 
1954. lie had earlier said that he worked -0n tl)e correspondents· 
"only about six months." If the date of March 1953,-which he 
most oft8n gave for his entry ;nto the KGB, is correct this would 
place the turnover in the fall of 1953. On other occasions he 
has said specifically that he turned over the correspondent cases 
and beg~n work against the attaches in J3nuary 1954, on still 
others· that this occurred in May 1954. In February 1965, NOSENKO 
said that he could not remember when he changed assignments.
