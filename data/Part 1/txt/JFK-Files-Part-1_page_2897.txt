Top Secret 
(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT_ - January 1962-January 1964) 
At his first meeting with CIA in January 1964 NOSENKO 
related how a disaffected former KGB colleague, A.N. 
CHEREPANOV, had stolen documents from the American Embassy 
Section and in November 1963 sent them through an inter­
mediary to the American Embassy. CHEREPANOV's treason was 
discovered, NOSENKO said, when the Embassy returned the 
documents to Soviet authorities. CHEREPANOV fled Moscow, 
and NOSENKO claimed to have taken part in the KGB search 
for him. NOSENKO brought with him to Geneva the official 
KGB document which authorized his travel in the search for 
CHEREPANOV. 
The significance of the crrnREPANOV incident is twofold. 
The KGB _documents which CHEREPANOV allegedly sent to the 
Embassy appear to have originated in the American Depart­
ment's Embassy Section,- and the documents relate to KGB 
modus operandi, personnel, targets, and technical devices 
employed in operations during 1958~1960, during part of 
which time NOSENKO claimed he.was Deputy Chief of the· 
Embassy Sec_tion. The KGB document, the "teI!lporary duty 
authorization", is an i tern of physical evidence NOSENICO 
has offered to substantiate his claim to personal parti­
cipation in the.CIIEREPANOV case and to having held the rank 
of KGB lieutenant colonel. [The document does not itself 
refer to CHEREPANOV in any manner.] 
NOSENICO' s Information 
The KGB officer, A.N. CHEREPANOV was born about 1920 or· 
1921. During Norld War II he was a KGB officer working 
with partisan groups behind the lines. Later he was in 
Yugoslavia for four or-five years, and was probably Deputy· 
Chief of the KGB Legal Residency ih Belgrade. 
Comment: CIA records contain references to an Aleksari.dr. 
Nikolayevich CHEREPANOV, a Soviet diplomat and. 
suspected intelligence officer in Belgrade in 
1953. CHEREPANOV left Belgrade in 1956. A 
Yugoslav intelligence officer who defected in 
1957 confirmed that CHEREPANOV had been an 
intelligence officer.
