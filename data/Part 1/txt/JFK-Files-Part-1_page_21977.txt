CHELNOKOV." Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings 
with FRIPPEL at CHELNOKOV's request and the two continued 
to meet with FRIPPEL, des?ite his lack of production, be­
cause they "ke;;,t hoping he woulC: give some::.hing." In a 
different context, but speaking o·f CHELNOKOV, NOSE~lKO ex­
plained: NYou see, never·mi:1d if you are a chief or a 
deputy chief of a department, you must have. one., two, or 
three agents. GRIBANOV insists, so that you don't forget 
how to work. The Chiefs of the [Second C!"liefJ Director­
ate do not de~~nd that they have :2 or 13 agents, but they 
must-have two or three. They will have important agents 
or those in leading positions." 
- NOSCNl<O continued to act as FRIFPEL's case officer 
after FRIPPEL had left ~he Soviet Union and NOSENKO had • 
been transferred and promoted to the position pf Deputy 
Chief of the To~rist Department. He met twice with FRIP­
PEL d~ring this latter period ~hen FRIPPEL ~isited.the 
Soviet Union aJ a guide with groups of foreign visitors. 
ao·tn of these mee:tings were handled by tWSEN.i<O alone, with-
out CHELNOKOV. • 
- The first meeting took place in the swnmer of 1962, 
after NOS~NKO had returned to Moscow from Gen~va. FRIPPEL 
had arrived in the Soviet Union as a guide for some Ameri­
can journalists. (NOSENl<O was unable to give the compo- • 
sition of the journalist group or to recall where they 
stayed in Moscow and where alse they·travelled in the Sov­
iet Ur.ion.) ?,OSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what 
questions the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during 
a scheduled interview1 subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged 
that standard practice required visiting journalists to 
submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing 
to Soviet authorities prior to interviews. After the 
inter•,iew, he recontacted FRIPPEL to learn the reaction 
of the journalists to their talk ••,ith the Soviet leader. 
NOSENKO could not recall their sp~cific reaction to the 
KHRUSHCHEV interview but did remember that they were 
•satisfied~" Another reason for contacting FRIPPEL, 
HOSENKO added in a later discussion, ~-:.is to learn whether 
any of the journalists might h:tve joined the group at the 
last moment in the United States, which might suggest 
intelligence connections on their part.• 
- NOSENKO r:1et FRIPPEL cllone for the second and last 
time during March 1963. Since FRIPPEL was a guide ·tor 
tourists aboard the ship "Olympia," which stopped for a 
day in Yalta and Odessa, ?-lOSENKO flew to Odessa from Mos­
cow and accosted FRIPPEL in the lobby of the hotel where 
the tourists were having dinner. Finally able to get away
