EDUC.-\TION A~,D CUI.Tll!U:. 
28. Asid~. fro~ the tw0-ycar statistics course t:1ken in 
1960, RUIZ appe:n·s to lack :1 soiid, fori:!:tl cdUl':!tion, althotigh 
he rn:,kes up for it by being an avid rendc~ (five newsp:1pcrS a. 
day plus books)·. Ile undcrst:tnds and speaks 1-:11:;J is!i nnd French 
(fluency· unknown) a1id h:'ls un<lcrt:lken to teach gramr..:i.r (presumably 
SpaniEh) to the Embassy staff. ' 
29. RUIZ appe:1rs to be scnsit~ve to art, and he frcqueritly 
complains nbou·t the ~eneral lack of cul turc in Cub:i. (This 
might indicate th:itl1UIZ considers himself "abo,:e" • the Revolution). 
He shows some of the i;encral inconsistencies of the self:..educatcd~ 
For ex:imple, ·bis vocabulary level is rather low,· and he curses 
frt,quently when talking to other male members of- the staff. On 
the other hand, he ~ecrus rnther ~cl) versed in international r 
affnirs and has a good undcrst:rnding of international· trade. It 
is probable that he has read some of the works of Josi! Ma·rtl and, 
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of 
his own reports to Havana. • 
HEAL TH PROBLE!-IS 
30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as n liver 
illness (not further specified) for \'Illich he takes a medicine 
cnlled bilidis. (This may refer simply to the r.edic:11 words for 
"liver chsease". Cor.ipet<?nt. e:...l)erts here guess that -the medicine 
ls used for anything from chronic constipntion to gassiness 
and c0nstant eructation bcc:iuse of inadequate digestion of fatty 
foods. It is possible that RUIZ sufferi:; from the hard-to-pin-down 
mal de foie; which can be found in a hir,;"11-strung, hard-driving 
person. ---iflJIZ' evident use of !ibrium (see abo\"e) might also 
suggest this condition). 
31. Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to 
rest, following the rccommcnd:1tion of his physician Dr. CAVAS (also 
received as CABAS and CALDAS), and whose telephone nu:nber appears 
to be 276-77-46. There is nlso a meutjon o~ a Dr. PERIU, but his 
relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to 
cold weather, and was planning to go for_ his health to the same 
Gimnasio as his son, Alcjnndro. 
32. A July l9G8 mcin orandum for the record st::.tcd that RUIZ 
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting fiom a fnll h~ h:id abo~t 
12 years_.ago. Since then he hns had chronic backnches which were 
pirticularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S., 
Haiti, :ind Santo Domin;;o. llis p:iins h:wc recurred since he 
arri~ed in. Spai~. On 3 June 196S he had n severe attack and was
