(c) Receptivity and Audibility of ~icrophones 
SOSENXO ~ade the following evaluations of the quality 
of intercept received from the chancery microphone tostalla­
tioris: 
11 June 1962: "They are d;-·ing, the microphones, and 
we cannot do anything about it, because we can't get into 
the E.r.ibassy l to make ne~ installation&!. In that respect 
your Embassy and th<:? vritiah Embassy .1re the only ones we 
can't get into." 
14 June 1962: "The most interesting nnterials, of 
course, are 1rom the ... [Sotc: one or two words or. the tape 
are unintelligible here; from e&rlier and subsequent re~arks, 
particul&rly one on 24 January 1961 (see belo~), it is clear 
that J;oSE'./KO is speaki 15 of the mic1·ophone in the Minister 
Co~nscllor's_office.j And I t0ll you honPstly that it is 
becominf incr0asin~ly difficult to work with this. The 
shayba lmicrophoneJ, AS we call the~, is fading a~d only two 
or t~ree people are able to m3ke out what is ueing said. 
That is, the tape sau~ds as if somewhere far, far away, 
so~ewhere in the cellar, someone is spea~ing in a whisper. 
It is very difficult to hear, very difficult when it is 
fading. But·,- what can you do? They tell us categorically 
and directly--KUZ~IS, the Chief of the section of the Second 
Special Dcpartnent responsible fur this, tells us that 
soon we will not have anythir,g there. There arc a great 
nu~ber of microphor.~s there, b~t they don't work. I know 
that there are about 20 microphones there that don't work. 
They have all gone deaf.•· 
24 January J.964: ·•sow, we ali,o listened to the code 
rooc and the teletype otfice, but we could never get any­
thing out of the teletype office because of icterference 
(
probably speaking of machine noise!. Fro~ this point 
p~inting at the list, but not stating which microphone he 
~as speaking about! th~ reception became progressively 
we~ker until it finally stopped: evidently it wore out. 
Yes, there was another point in the bar on the 8th floor. 
This one never worked even though it was installed. Thus, 
out of the eleven poi.n-:s, nine were working ... [NOSD;KO then 
referred to information he learned in 1962 and 1963, after 
leaving the U.S. Embassy Section.! GRYAZNOV said that the 
equiFment is deteriorating and they are only getting snatches 
of conversation and that in a year or two they will be com-
r
letely inorerative. GRIEA!JO\' is insisting on getting to 
recruiting code clerks at all costs.'' 
~ 1 .'. :n Jgrnu a ry • 1964: "Here in HORBALY' s and. BROP.l" Is room 
(
officeof-fiieAgr1cultural Attaches], there is no acoustical 
sic) and nothing comes from here. I'll come back to this, 
but they complained that they're not getting anything. [These 
microphones were installed] when this building was .being 
built. It wasn't later after you had moved into the building, 
but when the building was under construction ... [NOSENKO was 
asked whether more or fewer than nine microphones arc· now·-0ur­
rently active.) It couldn't be more, anyhow." 
14 May 1964: Very interesting information was heard 
troa Minister Counsellor FREERS' office, NOSENKO Raid, "but 
tor the last years, even in 1960 and 1961, it was very
