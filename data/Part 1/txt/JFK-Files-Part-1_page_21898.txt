• After receiving a 
scolding from school 
authorities for 
having submitted the 
petition, NOSENKO and 
several other boys 
began to plot to run 
away to the front. 
When the time came in 
early 1944 only one 
other boy, RADCHENKO, 
would accompany him. 
The two slipped out 
of school, made their 
way to the railway 
station, and found a 
freight train heading 
toward Tuapse. On 
arriving in Tuapse 
they were arrested 
almost immediately
