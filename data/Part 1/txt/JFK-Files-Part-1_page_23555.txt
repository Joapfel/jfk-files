KD!CW.NDUM FO.'t: Special Deputy, WH 4 !:Jecember 1~53 
Slfo,foCTs }-ir. Ross C:1CZI£R 
By pre-arrange~nt thrcr.:eh !·il". Smyser I had a.n interview ,6 t.'1 Mr. Ross 
Crozier in 'lI!'J room at the Hotel .ltaleigh on the niJ,t of 2 i)ccember 1953 
for the purpose of getting an iinpressjon as_to ltlether it 10s possible 
that he co•.lld be used to adva.".ltage in our progra.-i.. 
Mr. Crozier has been a contract agent in Costa Rica for approxL~tely 4 
years. He is married to a Costa ~ican and has 2 children, a~es 2 and 4. 
He .-as in a stuient capacity in Costa•~ica. Froi:\.my ;.no;;led;:;e c,f . 
• raporUng done by the station in Costa Rica and the indication of sources 
of in!'crm2tior, in reports fro:n that statio:1, I am incl:i.ned to think that 
he v~ry ably ~andled hi.aself. In additicn, I was V9ry nuch im~ressed 
with him durin;; the co· . .rse of the lnt i:rvie;., ar.d feal that he is an ex­
cell,mt type, having all the necessarj· q;ial.ificatj ons for giving s,.1b­
stantial assistance to our progra~. He has 7 ~cc.ths re~ajning under the 
GI assista.".lce !:>ill for educational i:ur:;;oses and it can be s::.tisfRctorily 
arra.,ged by hizl to complete !-:is educ2.tirn at Sa.'1 C,.rlos t:njversity, 
Guate:r.ala. Under the Guateir.alan law- :iis wife, bein 6 a Costa ilican, 
becomes a Gua ta-:-.alan ci tfae:i ·c;pon her esta'!:llish.'l~nt of residence in • 
Guatemala and t.~is is a distinct adva:-;t2ge. 
He has a valid U.S. passport on which his two children are carried but 
it ·,rill be desir.qble that he enter GuateI:13.la as a tourist, ej ther with a 
toJrist visa L~ :us passport or on a tourist card. The children could 
also be issued tourist cards. The use of a to:.irist card eli?tinates 
the necessity o!: his reportin:,; to the police. He can stay 6 mo?1ths and 
then obtain a renewal of th~ tourist card ;,.ithc~t leaving the country. 
1-Iithin a relatively shcrt time he unquestic!'lnabl7 co.;J.d be of distinct 
advantage to us on reporting on activities and attitudes of students and 
other elements. 
He could act as a cut-out. I feel that he is qualified to actually 
develop a penetration into the Communist Party, a feat with which he 
had some success in Costa Rica. He co·.:.ld handle an :important PP opera­
tion with Enrique SALAZAR Liquens(also knoii:'! as Oscar H. CJ>JiTA in 
s~ion files), which operaticn is presently be:.ng handled through. 
Donald O. Hed1ger. Irrespective o~ whether Hediger continues with 
• Guate:iala or is give:1 assi~nt .outsi::ie the country, I believe that it 
is important. to ha"le Crozier v.i t:1 us in Guatemala. We can finJ plenty 
for him to do.
