intelligence research· purpoaea. lt is poasible that the quick ac­
knowledvnent b-/ the Soviet Foreign Offj ce of the lanJ.ing of the C-118 
in Soviet terrltorJ precluded tr"' Y.7D trom fully exploiting the crew 
111embers. Colonel Brannon and_ Captain Kane were• separated from the 
group and given preferred treatlll!!nt, apparently with ths intention ot 
de-veloplng them tor in!onr.a.Uon purposes. We are convinced that both 
men Juindled themselves extre~l7 well ar~ did not disclose any Wor­
mtion concerning the ·Agenc7 or its activities. 
To date we have no indication that the Soviets !mev at the til!!9 
they interrogated the ~rev inen, th.at the flight ot the C-118 w11a con­
nr.cted with CIA 1n ar1;1;way, nor that t!l~y·knev. three of the um aboard 
were CIA peroonr.el. We do believe that in time the Soviets, through 
Brannon's ad.Jress book; which liBts the open Agency telephone llWllber

queationed him ac.ot1t the n 10th !;upport Group and the 740Sth Support
