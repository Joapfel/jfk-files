from l\OSEXKO on her recruitment in 1962. During current interviews 
the notes which NOSE;>;KO brou;;ht out in 1964 have been discussed in 
detail with NOSEl':KO. He has given a detailed explanation of the material 
which he brought out and his explanation· of all aspects is very convincing.

was unusual, but rather that his ex;,lanation of why he was involved is 
logical and normal. 1':o consideration was previously given to the En6lish

were used in two of the four cited cases.
