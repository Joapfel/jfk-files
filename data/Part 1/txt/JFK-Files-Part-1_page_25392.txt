position, it shouJd be possible to obtain. information on 
the Min is try of Education and other aspects of the Mexican 
,;--_ education system which, according to the·last word received 
', from Headquarters, is somewha: of a priority requirement. 
d. RMD, This· project is.responsive to Priority A3.Q 
and f of the Related Mission Directive· for Station Mexico 
Clty-(approved October 1963). This priority reads in part: 
"obtain Information on the stability of the Government ... 
through high-level penetrations and through surveillances and 
controlled assets of other powerful political groups such as 
the Frente Civico ... and through continued development and 
influencing of high-level government contacts. 11 As an 
ancillary measure, the project could contribute to MHSPAWN 
objectives of the RMO under certain circumstances where use 
of right-wing platforms ano urganizations is merited. 
Background. 
a. Developments Leading •.~o to Project, 
(1} Mexico, politically, is a country in which, 
Increasingly, a centrist political concensus is developing 
based on the impact· of education and economic development. 
On either side though of thts growing central political 
specti-um are extreme •left and extreme right wings which are 
quite active and quite vocal and which have an influence in 
·the form of individuals, organizations, and movements greatly 
out of proportion to ·their numbers. Political disturbances 
and efforts to ·induce iack of- staL,i 1 ity er;irinate in the rnai11 
from these two extreme wings. As the centrist force grows 
slowly, it is possible and probab.le. that these two wings will 
_intensify their efforts and become more and more radical. 
The Station has intelligence coverage·of the extreme left­
wing, but has neglected the equally. important extreme •right­
wing when, in the final analysis, any threat to Mexican 
political stability by fomenting unrest and incidents does, 
and w i 11 continue to, em i nate from the right-wing as we 11 as 
• the left-wing. Assuming that, as indicated in the present 
RHO, the long range national policy objectives of the U.S. 
toward Mexico are to encourage a stable democratic government 
and political environment, then coverage of the right-wing 
is required if for no other reason than meeting normal Station 
responsibilities for political report'ing. HBFINCH contacts 
in~this area have been, and probably will continue to be, 
virtually nil. In fact·,.at present in this area HBFINCH 
contacts are non-existent.
