• 61. A.a a first otep towal'd opoading up communications, it·!~ 
planned to fin~ another aaaomaodotion addNon in the JHW~VE GNa tor 
AMFAUNA-l'a u&G which can be aupectod to function without tha dalayo 
that have boon axperience4 recently. BCloau~o of tho importanoe and 
urgency of scm~ of AMFAUNA-l'a intellisonce ~eporta, conaida~ation 
io almo being given to am~igning a radio op@rator to him, pl'Obably 
AMGt.tN-9 who is avai tins i)nly hi; signal P' 1tr. 1:o becc,me activo '4nd 
who will probably not be 1,aeded in the AMWP,r::N net as originally 
planned. 
62. AMFAUNA-l will :t>e. inotructed to b1t"eak off contact with 
AMCOG~2, and to ceaae int~reating himself in the affairs of ~he 
EacQbray. As for AMFAUNA-.. , it is feared that AMFAUNA-1 ie alro~dy 
oo dcaaply involved lfi th him that, if he wac not a bona fide 1ofoctor, 
tho damage has already been done. NevorthL.less, AMFAUNA-1 w::.ll b1t 
uarnod. of the potentialities of this si tua .... Lon so that he ca,i be 
pNpured to go into hiding if it should de"dop badly. Specific 
military require?'llanta will be sent to AMFAl''IJA-1 for AMFAUNA-L1 to 
help in ostabliohing :lis value as a source, Also for the improvement 
of the security of the operation~ AMFAUNA-1 w:i.11 be told to stop taking 
porsonal and unneceeoary risks such as his penetration of a restricted 
boach, 
63. For th~ continued improvement of production, politic~l ~nd 
economic requirements will t~ sent to him. AMFAUNA-1 is very 
rcspo~aive to requirements, and has already developed sources and 
inf~to in the political and economic areas in response to 
instructions from JMWAVE, It is believed that an increa9ed output 
of higher-priority intelligence can be expected from this operation.
