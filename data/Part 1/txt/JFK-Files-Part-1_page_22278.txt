In 1962 NOSESY.O described the simple proce1ure by which he 
ent~red the KG!3, volunt~-~ring that there ...,as r.o need to fill out 
a questionnaire (a~~eta) as the KGB already had his files from 
the GRU. In April 1964 when asked if he had ~ot been required 
to fill out any questionnaires or oth-~r docu.T.ents, NOSENKO c'!es­
cribed the anketa and other for~s he coffi~lete1 (sayin~ he took 
them home to do so) and his various interview3 with KGB per-
sonnel officers. He was interrogated in detail on these claims 
by DERY~.B!N in 1~65, to whom he gave descriptlons, albeit in­
accurate, of the varicus forms ar.d of his visits to KGa Personnel. 
In 1966 NCSENKO wrote in his autobiography that there ~ere no 
talks with KGB Personnel before or after his acce?tance· a~d in­
plied that there were no forms to fill out. 
d. Remarks 
Accordir.g to all of NOSENKO's stories, his GRU service was 
the springboard for his accept,,nce into the KGB. He met KOBULOV 
while ho~e in Moscow from Prinorsk/Sovctsk, he entered the KGB 
as a lieutenant since this was his naval rank, his.admission 
according to the early version was facilitated by the availability 
of his GRU personnel file; yet CIA has concluded that NOSENKO 
was never a GRU officer and it a?pears highly improbable that he 
waa ever in Primorsk under any circt.mstances. 
On the basis of ge~er~lly available information concerning 
Soviet realities at the time of NOSENKO's clai~ed entry into the 
Y.GB, sup?orted by the c:.<pcrt test i;nuny of DF.R'fADIN (\..·ho was in 
the KGB, then MVD, in Moscow at che time and h~d been himself a 
KGB personr.el officer until less thdn a year earlier), a person 
with the background NOSENKO has given could r.ot be accepted into 
the KGB in the mar.ner he claims. llis health alone would seem 
to have precluded this, but in addition, NOSE:~KO descrit.ed a 
series of incide~ts in his life equally likely to cause rejection. 
NOSENKO's mistakes, changes of story, and apparent fabrications 
add to the un~ikelihood of his account. 
It is concluded that, as in the case of HOSENKO's GRU ser­
vice, either NOSENKO and thos·e who have supported aspects of 
his story have seriously distorted his past life, or he did not 
enter the KGB.
