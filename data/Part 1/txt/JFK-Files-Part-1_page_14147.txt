4. Tho following summarizes tht> progress thnt ~-as made in these 
ar.eas during tho two year period of HUNK.ELER1 s conti·act status ~·ith us. 
a, Cover was provided for n Berlin based ai;ont, ,UITlffiILL/1. 
Although tho a.:ont was terminated by Berlin Station, mnnal,':emeh~ of ids 
co\·er ~-ns competently and professionally handled by HUXK.ELER. 1ru:-;K.ELER 
has continued to offer his services to \\"OfACT in this respect and, 
although ho .could provide a cover offic!3\ anywh~re in the L.'ltin American 
sphere, has ~vecifically suggested Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Costa 
Rica and Venezuela. He is -now in the process of opcnin~, on his own 
initiative I branch of ficos in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic and 
I
'/ . -again vol un teercd them for possible use as cover. According to HUNKFLER 
I s·tation Caracas has shown some interest in taking advnntage of the offer 
There has been no·other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during 
-tehe·-past two'·se~rs.~,~-- s·uch l!Se' .. .tn the futur,e is an open question depend-
ing iri part oh whether· WOFACT has a ,requirement for cover fncili ties 
such as this, and.in part on 'the nature of our relationship with HtmKELE .• 
. • ' 
b. HUNKELER has met frequently with ~embers of the Central 
and Latin American consular community in· the Miami area. These assoc­
iations were enhanced by JIUNKELER 's activity and participation in 
several international organizations concerned with b~siness and social 
relations among Latin and North American countries. Some operational 
information was gatbered about these persons, but npne of them ever 
shaped up as a valid' intelligence target worthy of further development 
and recruitment. It is no.t expected that this target area will be of 
any more interest in the future than i
1
t is now. 
I 
c. HUNKELER ha·s a large number of business associates through 
out Latin America and in his travels has contacted a number of governmen 
officials up to the presidential level. Most of these cont!,\cts have 
been of a business nature. One of them, a Panamanian legislator, is of 
some interest to the Panama Station. Interest in the others has been 
minimal'. Future prospects remain open, but must be considered as long 
range. 
d. There has been no use made of HUN'KELER as a third party 
recruiter ~nd ngent handler during his.two year tenure. He has de­
c,lared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks 1 
but the Station hns found it more advantageous and efficient to use 
inside personnel for this. It is highly unlikely that station policy 
will change in this rega1·d. 
4. HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this period. 
On these occasions he was-given an intelligence brief nnd his operation-
al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT. The results, in terms of dissemin!'!' , 
ated reports, havo generally been negat~vo. 
5. Recently, HUNKEI,ER provided an introduction to some incliv~duals 
who hu·e a potential for use in the ..n!l;~IO~ program, There was some 
discussion of continued activity for Hlr~KELER in this program, but it 
was tho consensus that there was not sufficient p1·omise in his contri­
bution to merit retaining him for this pw·pose alone. It can b,:, ex­
pected, hcwover 1 that he might, in the future, assist in entree to 
other persons of JMUNIO.S interest. 
6. Station .rnW.H'E is of the opinion that employment of Robert s. 
HL~K.ELER ha·.!:! not had tho rosul ttJ that were hoped for when the con tract­
ual relationship was first established. Reco~nition of this was implici 
in the rc11e~ot1a:t1on of his salary scale from 84800 to $3600 per annum 
in March 19fi6 nt the end of his first year's contract. It is also the 
opinion of thi8 Station that there 1s littlo likelihood of improvement 
in the ne:ir t'uture al thou~:h it is recognized that n long rar.~l' J?Ot~n.tial 
exists. Th,HH.' Htatemcrnts nrc mado withoat preJudice to Rol>l'rt s.
