·:REFERENCE: HM..\lh'-15952; 27 November 1967 
.1. Headquarters' confusion re:;ardir.g the v:lrious LIEYPTY· 
properties is und~rstR~d~ble, althoubh each change in location 
was duly re~orted as it occurred, and at various times project 
renewal requests, progress reports, nnd other correspondence has 
pinpointed the lbcations of the bnse houses involved. Tbe con­
fusion undoubtedly stens fro:n the unfortunate fact that LBUTED 
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations .in 1V66 
without changing cryptonym,,. Up to thio point, LB!IT.ED had been 
in a building owned by l'iOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE frontin:; f,:,_~ li'OFim!). 
LILYRIC had been renting aa·npartment in a building in which 
WOFIRM had no financial _interest. .tn 1965, howeve1·, LniOi.iSIN.E 
• bought th~ property cofita-i·n1::g the b'uildln:; in which LH!ITED had 
be:::::: locata,::, l'~.l.ed i.iie i.•uilding, -and built a new buildin,; in 
which an apart'llent was rented to the Station (the rent, however, 
was to be returned to the Station for t!1ree ye:irs as partial 
pny1aent ·on. the _lcar1 wilich the Station had given I.l:JOUSINt; ro that 
he could buy the buildinG). For variou~ operational reasons it 
was decided to put the LILYRIC person:1el into the nev.- builcHng, 
instead of the LIMIT.ED crew. LB!ITED was therefore !'~o..-ed i:i.to the 
building which LILYRIC h?..d occupied. At, this point, of co~rse, 
new c1·yptonyms shoul~ probably have been' assigned in order to 
avoid the. confusion which has C!v.idently c!evelcped. (This ·.vas not, 
however, simply i sw~tch of per&onnel - each base house retained 
its organizational integrity, which is urldoubtedly why crypts were 
uol; changed). As far ns LIC;U,I.,\ is concerned, the cohfusicn
