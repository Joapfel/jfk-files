"Whnt About L'ltin Ar.iericnn Col'lrnmist P11rtie;,?".- Castro dismissed the f.-tct that 
,.. Chinn did not greet the roor~'niz:i.tion anri ctnngo of tho Culi!ln Com.-:iunist i'arty, but 
spl to and concern were obvious in the tone of hb voice. C:ts ':-o knows that t-e has

"Continental Redst.ance t.o Argression".- Even though the Lima lllt'!eting of military 
chiefs from 17 American countries did not tnk9 up the question of the Inter-American 
Army, the ~EFembled chiefs unquestion4bly took a step towards its estAblishment, which ' 
will be ultimately decided on by the 0.A.~. Aggression to the Dor.tlnican Re:1.1blic, 
and persil'tence in Cuba-drafted subversive plans against t.he rest of the Hemisphere,
