manuscript would be in his interest as well as ours. He had. referred 
more than once during the meeting to the need to avoid the appearance 
of "a bear hug"; in other words, collusion or cooperation between him 
and the Agency, leaving an inference that the book was designed to be 
a whitewash of CIA. In view of this, it was easy to convince Hunt 
that an Agency press release would be in his interest. I would note 
here, however, that both Mr. Rocca and I felt that Hunt and his 
lawyers were genuinely cooperative and that a press release which 
is too harsh or denigrates the book or Hunt's motives might be unfair 
and considered by him to be in bad faith. Hunt appears to retain 
admiration and respect for the Agency and seems convinced that 
nothing in his book will harm our operations or personnel.
