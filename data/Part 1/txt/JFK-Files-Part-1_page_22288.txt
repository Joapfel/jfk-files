c. Promotion to De?uty Chief of Section 
NOSENKO said that in June 1958, when the unit that tad 
formerlr handled tourists from all cou:itriP.s was reorganized into 
two sections, he was promot~d from the rank of senior case offi­
cer to that of Deputy Chief of the newly created .\.~~rican Tourist 
Section. NOSENKO said that this section was the m,st inportant 
in the Tourist Department, and that he did not know why he, 
in particular, had been chosen its Deputy Chief but was certain 
that GRIBANOV had no voice in the decision. 
d. l<nowledge cf Section,' !I' Staff and 1-.gent Perzor.ncl 
NOSE~KO has named with clarity a:1d cc,nsistency the other 
officers of the A!nerican Tourist Section during this period. The 
Soviet agents of his section whcm NOSENKO has identifie1 were 
1110stly his own; he said that the agents were constantly shifted 
from case officer to case officer and hence it was •difficult to 
say just who handled which agents.• NOSEKKO said he had approxi­
mately eight Soviet agents in 1958 ar.d about 12 o~ 14 in 19~3, -
most of them eroployed by Inturist (Pages 109-112). With the ex­
ception of the two hor.-iosexuals, YEt'?.E/:•:>V and V0LKOV discussed 
separlltely below, NOSE:,Ko cannot supply personal cat a on his own 
agents or remember specific jobs they <lid for the KGB. 
e. Knc~ledge of Section's Activities 
As of June 1958, according to SCSE?:Ko, the work of the 
section of which he was deputy ~hi~f was •just getting going.• 
Its ~ission was, first of all, to detect Western I~te!ligence 
officers and agents a;oong the increasing flow of tourists visit­
ing the Soviet Union; only seco~darily was t!le section directed 
toward the recruitr.lent of KGB agents from among these tourists. 
In his new position NOSENKO was responsible for supervising 
other officers in the section in efforts along t!lese lir.es. Be­
cause of this and because at G~!3lu~OV's request he personally 
reviewed KGB information on the use of tourist cover by Western 
. intelligence services and KGB counteraction thrcugh 1958 (Pages 
·145-146), NOSENKO made a number of state!nents concerning these 
subjects during the 1955-1959 ~eriod. 
CIA started its so-called •1egal travelle-• program in 
1955 and by 1958 was deeply committed to such operations. Now 
there is firm collateral infortl'aticn on what the KGB knew of 
this operational program. I~ view·of NOSENKO's duties in the 
American Tourist Section and the section's prime mission, he should 
have knowledge of agent compromises during 1958 and 1959. More­
over, thanks to collateral holdings, what NOSENKO did and did not 
know can be compared with information from other sources. These 
facts are reviewed below. 
(i) BLAKE 
A valuable source of information for the KGB in its planning 
for the operational activity of its Tourist Department in the 
late 1950's and early 1960's was the Englishman, George BL,\l<E 
(Pages 146-147). BLAKE has confessed that in the s•..mrner of 1959
