armament Conference notified the Soviet Ambass.ador i:1 Bern 
shortly before noon on 6 February 1964 that NOS.E:',i<O had dis­

speculated that he might have been fipoisoned" or.-inJured in 
a car accident.*. Two more daya passed without Soviet authorities. 
making any additional public or private statements on t~e subject.

to 
9 February: Evening news bro;.dcasts in Geneva carried 
reports attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENl<O 
had disappeared. 1· 
lOFebruary: Unidentified Soviet sources were quoted in 
the press as having said it wa_s presumed that he had defected. 
Au. s. Department of State press release wa~ issued iden­
'tifying NOS~l<O as a l<GD officer ana·acknowledging his request 
for political 3sylurn in the United Stat~s. •
