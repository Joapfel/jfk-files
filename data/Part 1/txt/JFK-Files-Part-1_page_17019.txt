and two basehomw survei llanco sites. Termination of 
th~s project, effective 30 Juno 1972, was the result of 
a security revio_w which revealed that the VWBLANKET 
principal knev, the basic d~lalls oI lhe KDI-'ACTOR opera­
tions. 
_-,_, - 2. Agent termination was accomplished without any 
immediate difficultles; however, continued security will 
· ---- depend on the terminated agents' silence. In tho event 
there is a compromise, tho risk of damage to tho Sta~ 
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be 
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR's 
operations. 
3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj­
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for 
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc- •

costs. This project ·action requests this additional 
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses. 
4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this amend­
ment/termination request.
