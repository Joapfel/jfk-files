1962, but the party ha~ signifi~ 
~ant .strength in.three i~port~nt 
so~t~-c~ntral atatc~ (Parana, 
Sad ·Paulo, and Guanabara)-. Like 
all other Br.:izllia_n.'J,.-irtics, i-t 
was abOli~h~d during i political 
redrganiz.:ition uhde~the Casteilo 
Branco .:idministration. Most of 
its meinbers then affiliated with 
. the progovernn\ent ARENA. pa"rty . 
and campaigned unde~.fi:."s banner 
in the November 1966 c_ongressional 
elections. It is unlikely that 
ther.e will be ,my significant ex­
pansion in the· nwnbe.r .of politi­
cal parties--the· new nr·azilian • 
cons ti tut ion sets do.wn: stringent. 
·.standards· that virtually eliminate 
the possibility o~ a repetit1on 
of the fot111er proliferation· of 
parties. The ·former PDC has made 
no attempt to reconstitute itself, 
but its former members 'wil-1 prob­
ably join with-like-minded con­
gressmen to pursue policies con­
sistent with Christian Democratic 
ideology. 
The Guatemalan PDC was only 
recently recognized as a legally 
constituted party. This groupi 
~hich is being financed by Cath­
olic.sources in Germany and Bel­
gium, has some strength in the 
youth and student movenien't and 
·some growth potential among the 
campesinos who make up more than 
half the population. Current 
.direct.iOJ'.l of the party leaves much • 
to bedesired1 its leader, Rene de 
Leon, appears .honest, but he has 
little organizational flair or 
i,opular appeal. With moie vigo­
rous leadership and the develop­
m,nt of.a middle-echelon cadre, 
the party might dev~lop signifi­
cantly--particularly if the in­
cumbent Revolutionary Party (PR) 
administration fails to resolve· 
basic problems confronting it. 
The remainfn'J• nine Chris-
tian Demo~ratic partios--ln Ar­
gentina~ Bolivia,· Colombia, Costa 
Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicarogua, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay--show scant . 
prpm1se of. developing into· forces. • 
-of national importance ·over. the 
next five years .. Leadership of 
even m~dest stature exists only 
in Argen'tina (Salvador Alende,. 
Horacio.Sueldo) and Bolivia 
(Remo di Natale). 
Party Youth Wings 
. As with all poli'tical groups 
.in Latin America, the vast major­
ity of CD party milita·nts- come 
from student organiz~~ions in the 
local univczsities. In most 
countries of the he~isphere, CD 
voting strength on the campus is 
much greater tha·n the political 
strength of· the p~rent ~arty. 
A few examples illustrate this 
point: In Panama, the party 
polled 3.1 percent of. the national 
vote in 1964 (and probably would 
poll not more than 5 percent to­
day), but its university youth 
got 12.8 percent in the January 
1966 campus election and 24.4 
percent in January 1967. The 
Dominican PFSC received 5.4 per­
cent of the vot~ in 1962•(and 1ts 
present strength could well be ' 
lower becaus·e of intern.ii divi­
sions and leadership conflicts), 
but its youth wing on the campus 
garnered 40.2 percent of the 
vote in May 1966. In Venezuela, 
COPEI polled 22 percent of the 
• vote in 1963; its student wing on 
the campus of Central University, 
howeve·r, polled 40.2 percent of 
the vote in 1966.
