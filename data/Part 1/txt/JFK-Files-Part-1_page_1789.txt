We believe the DCI' a office should also review all aealg11-
ment1 in the middles rr.anagernent echelon with p:irticular reference 
to insuring the proper language qualiflcatiooa, operational training 
and auitablUty. 
Public Relations 
We recommend that the ·present ey1tem o! public relationa 
by the Age_ncy be changed. While we see the nece■ aity for the 
DCI to have an assistant in his office handling relations with the 
- ---------------, 
public media, we believe that every effort should be made to 
minimize the a.mount of publicity that CIA rec:ewes. 
. We etrongly :-ocommvnd th.at the present practice of 
giving background briefings to newspapermen cease and that 
CIA give information to the press only where CIA has something 
" 
which for operational reasons should be released on an unattr-i­
butable basis. We urge that no public speeches be given by 
Agency officials. 
Reduction in Force 
We recommend that the DCI and DDCI insure that the 
pre sent reduction in force in the Agency include senior officers, 
particularly supergrades who are no longer aa effective as they 
should be in their a.s sign::nente.
