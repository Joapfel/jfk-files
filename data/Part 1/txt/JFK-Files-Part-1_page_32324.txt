FITNESS REPORT 
Daniel Flores 
cont. 
SECTION D 
in terms of paper flow and personnel administration. lh.- demonstr.ates 
an ability to advaru:c further along these lines. Also during the 
period under review he participated in an approach·against the 
local head. of Cuba_na Airlines in a Latin America country. Although 
the recruitment effort was not successful, it was conducted inn 
professional manner nnd Mr. Flores used an access agent rclnti¥e 
in a very effective manner. • 
He has .been perhaps the most aggrelJsive officer in the Cuba 
Operations Group in pursuing· leads for intcrvicws--of relatives, 
friends, and acqualntanccs of Cuban officials pos~ed abroad. 
Outing the pcri~d undci re~lew he conducted at least six such· . 
intervi'ews ·and developed good assessment data on various targets. 
As a native Spanish speaker, Mr. Flores has the ability to 
pass as a forei~n national and has successfully carried out roles 
as a Mexican citizen, v~1ng OTS-provided false documents. This 
ability to pass as non-American has been of great assistance in 
handling the key case he relinquished only on leaving LA/COG, 
Mr. Flores has now overcome an earlier reluctance to bo 
aggressive which former supervisors might have noted. I nm 
confident he will caintain and build further on what I have found 
to be a highly improved sense of enthusiasm. I am sure he will 
be a strong contributor to his new component. 
No. 3 
lie is an of Heer. who llll·rits further res pons ib i 1 i ty and one who 
should continue to ri:-.c in rank :is he assU111cs these nJJitional 
responsibilities. It has been a pleasure to work with him and 
I should like ~o do so with him in the future .
