d. LIE~IPTY-3: LIE!JPTY-3 is met at irregular intervnls at 
various out-of-the-'&'a.y restaurants for tho purpose of briefing 
and debriefin~ on operntional assir,nments and discussion of his 
written reports. J.!cetings are arr['.nged by·phono 1.sia3 open 
code. His·· most· .recent assigm.1ent .. has .. been ,.the _development.,. 
assessment, and recrui tmont of 201-810901. LI~:IPTY-3. b?.s -few 
peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but bis 
extensive operational nctivity in past years against the l.FdARSil 
target bas required that he be.used cparingly, selectively, 
and always under alias. Development of 201-810981 has been 
bis only assignment during the reporting per.i. od, ancl LI~,;p•;,'Y-3 
made good early p1·0;:;rcss. Purporting to be the representative 
of a fi11u club for architects, LIEHPTY-3 was able to get 201-
810981 to·agree to become a consultant. Thereafter, LIB:.lPl'Y-3 
continued to ask· queations about 20l-81C98l's vork, tc the point 
•here 201-810981 realized that more than a fil~ club for 
architects was involved •. At this point it was decided to.-let 
Llfil!PTY-3 break cover~ recruit 201-SlbSSl to supply infott.ation 
on the work of his office (but not--a.t this polnt--tbc peoplo 
.... , io bis office), and continue to handl~- him. un~il the. recruitment 
was firm and pre.vious questions about the· stability and 
reliability of 2Ql-Sl0931 kd been resolved. 'i'his was. done, 
aod· 201-S10981 accepted rccrui tmeot, knowing th:it \\'01.J'iDY 
intelligence was in,·olved; LIEi.IPTY-3 I.old st>v.:-ral meetings with 
201-810931 after recruitment, and countersurve illance. did not 
reveal any signs of imIL\RSH survcilla.nco. For about· a month, 
however, LIE~-!PTY-3 b0.ts not. been able to contact 201-810931 ,. 
and it is poDsible that.th~ latter.has developed cold feet. 
If LIErJPTY-3 can reestablish contact, he will continue to
