file on 11.BIDIAN. On the first p~ge is written th~t 'I, NOSENKO, 
Yuriy Ivar.ovich, opercd this file'.• Or. l(; February ho said: "Time· 
will ahow I aJ!l what I say." On 3 ~arch he referred nine times with­
in one hour to a check via such a source. He repeatedly stated 
that "time will show" that he is not a provocateur. At one point 
he engaged in the following dialo1ue with his interrogators: 
NOSENKO: I'm telling you that, if you chtck, you'll find 
that I'm right. 
INTERROGATOR: We're not disputing that you worked for the KGB. 
We're disputing that you held the positicns you 
say you held in the Y.GB. 
That's what I'm saying. !f you cculd check you 
would find thct I was oaly in these two deparc1tents 
and only in these positions ... 
(later in the session) 
NOSENKO: I can't tell you anything "ll'.'ore. I can't prove 
anything. Maybe the future will shew. 
INTERR~ATOR: What can the future show? 
NOSENKO: I don't know. But from what I understand the check­
ing has not gone very far. Maybe you ca~ check 
further ... I mean, if you have any possibility now, 
I mean by chance, have anyone in the KGB or out of 
the KGB, with any of my .3cquaintances, friends. 
INTERROGATOR: You mean o~r acquaintances, don't you? 
NOSE.'IKO: Yes, but maybe your acquaintances can check with 
someone, because anyone in the KGB !'hould know· 
that, yes, there was a ~OSENKO. 
INTERROGATOR: Should we ask someone like \'AKHRUSHEV or SUSLOV? 
NOSENKO: No, of course not, because I gave you their r.ames. 
Check someone else,. r.ot known to me, so you can be 
sure. 
d. Additional Observations 
(i) Inquisitiveness About CIA 
NOSENKO's questions about CIA and its activities seemed to his 
interrogators to be beyond the interest or curiosity expected of 
soviet Intelligence defectors. Frequently he asked, even while 
discussing his own KGB responsibilities: "You tell me about a case, 
and I will remember details.• Other examples of NOSE~KO's inquisi­
ti-veness- -incl-ude--t-he- fol-lowing·:------ -- --------- ------- ----- - - -
- ~"hen sho'-'Il the CIA publication "Checklist of Soviet 
Officials Abroad• during the 1964 meetings in Geneva, NOSENKO 
made inquiries--about what organization prepared ::·t- and to what 
part of the U.S. Government that organization is subordinate.
