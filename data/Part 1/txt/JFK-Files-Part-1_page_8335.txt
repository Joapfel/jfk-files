/\•:oid~· "hurtinn" hi~ .fricnn5. Gloria then told me 
that Val r,c•,cr acccrtod an i:lvilation to h,we coffco with 
her or Pcoe or to dine ot.it. He exolaincd to hor ·that it 
could. hurt h~r to bl seen with -~im. she qavo an example 
of ~.han sho was ·invited-·to the ballet with Val and a-­
group of fciends. • • 
A.fter the ballet, Pcoe and Gloria invited Val to 
Join them for ·dinner. val declined. Pepe an~ Gluria · 
went to the ·Hoyo .19 •. Shoftly after .thqy arrivel'.2,,. Val 
and: a . .far~c· numoer. of .embassy officc-rs aloo artiv~d·•

• Val work]Lr!lOrning.s only. Gloria mentioned that 
Val .is in tho embassy only in the. morning. T~is was . 
in response _tc::, rrr:t statement that. I had tried to call 
tho embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap­
pened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would ·call 
-in•.the afternoon. She added that he of course works 
in the afternoon, wt .outside the embassy. 'I said ''try­
ing to bl:y gringos"•. She said "trying to convince .•. . Mexicans". • • ·.--- ··-- •-·-···· -··-- ---
• COMME~;T$ 
.it seetii¢ to me highly unlikely that Val is 
really:° coricerried ilbout the weifare of· Jus friemils 
seen with ·him. It seems quite clear that he con­
siders Gioria and.Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential 
assets_. He d~s n9t_want to be seen wi_th us ~ca~se 
·we ·would lose· -our value to· him. He· told Gloria that 
they should confine- their· contact~ to the French 
Club. • r>u,s. St38Jl!S ~o confirm the SllS:picioil that·. he 
.~lit!_ves that tJ;&s•i-s a sectll:'.e plad:i. to mee3·t peoplt!e

It is ~sihle that.·he chcck~d- with his colleag.ti"es _· 
arid tlley were of the opinion that:.my chqice 9f ·the 
J;,lave de Ore:, for ;i.µrich Wets too pµplic, • e~posed. us 
to· too tiany Amedcanill. • • 
I feel .t:hat Gloria has serv_e4 a very useful 
purpo_s~ in this l'll<!ltte·r. If she ls ~ork1,.ng .for val, 
which I doubt, she is in a oosition: tc:> seo that .nr) 
business is indeed legiti!"<lto, ·time-consuming, and 
with considerabie fim1ncial ootent-ial. • ·Further, 
she ·is in a position to relay to Val my unwillingness 
to coo~Fate vlth him and his governerntn and Rt-/ threat 
to· take the rpatter to the embassy if his hat·rassment 
.continues. •
