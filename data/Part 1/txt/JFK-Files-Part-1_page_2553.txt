SUMY...ARIES OF CASES NOT EX..4..W...L.~ED IN TEXT 
Pages 399 - 435 0£ the p:revious summary contain su..-nmaries 
on the cases o£(491Ame:ricans who, according to information .:f:rom 
. NOSENKO, were of KGB interest, we:re approached by the KGB, or 
were actually recruited by the KGB. It was stated that the.se cases 
did not clearly relate to the specific KGB positions beld at particular 
times by NOSENKO and thus could not be 't.sefully employed in examining 
his claimed KGB service. The sourcing of these cases has been explored 
in detail during the current interviews wit:-i NOSENKO, and it is now 
possible to establish a certain relationship betwee:n. these cases and 
certain claimed positions of NOSENKO in the KGB. 
It is the conclusion 0£ this summary that any group o£'.4,91cases, 
as well as all other cases concerning which NCSENKO has furnished 
;f' 
information, must be fully considered, not necessa:dly fo:i: t:i.:le importance 
or .u...."l.importance of tb.e in:fo.:mation, but to determine how NOSENKO 
claimed to have iearned of the case and whether his statements con-
cerning each identified case are supported by collateral information.
