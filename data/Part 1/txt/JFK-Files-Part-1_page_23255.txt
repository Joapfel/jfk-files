l. In recant convers_ations with both JRJ-> and RDS, Subject has 
broached. tne prospect of a possible assignment withL, the u. s. follov­
int: coropletion of his rlabana assignr.ent. He says he would not wc11t his 
staterents re reassignment vnich were recently forwarded to Headquarters 
to be interpreted to cean tnat he is not interested in a iJ. s. tour. He 
sals that he nas b.:!t,n giving rucn tnougnt _to his future career, as well 
as to the need.a of nis f.3i!Jily • ne poirits out th!it h~ personally has DOV . 
spent approx.i.mauii.y. 16 years, exceptin 6 vacations a."ld snort training 
perioos, living .,~a working o.i tside tne U. S., -tha·t his two cnilaren 
have never livea tnere, a.rid tnat ooth be anci his wiie are concerned 
that too· 1111ch time will elapse before tney can provide their children 
Vi.ta a period in t.ne U. 6. during their for1uative years. 
2. It ia the opinion of both .lillS and J hf' that Subject is at a 
point in his career developwant wnere a to'ur at Heaiquarters wruid 
be extrenely beneficial.. The ;:itation lacks knowledge concerning the 
specilic rleaaquartars jobs to wnich a person of 5ubject 's status mig.bt 
be assigned; but it is our understanding tnat OTR soretimes emplcys 
these persons as instructors. i-;e believe ttiat a tour with O'ffi would 
not only re~dy in great measure deficiencies in Su::ije::t's background 
caused by lack of nea:iquarter., experience, bUt would at the sane time 
affon:t o·.1.n e.xcellent instructor material.. 
J. In viev or Subject's own interest in sucn an assi~nt, and 
our estimate of toe potential value to ni.m and to the Organization 
that would accr-.ie from it, we reco!llllenci that Hea:i.quarters arrange such 
an assi.gnll2nt if at all possiole. 
h. In view or the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near 
future, a praupt decision is requested.
