In August 1965 ~OSENKO r<;-ported that at the time of 
Bu1tGI 's arrival in the LTSSR, his file contained a copy of 
his visa application (ankcta}, ''inayhe" an excerpt from a 
cable sent by the s~vieT fobassy ill t~w United States saying i ·; 
that a visa had been granted, a routine note from Inturist 
giving BURGI's anticipated date of arrival and his itinerary 
inside the Soviet Union, and the results of traces of the 
general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate 
. .\rchives. ~;osENKO himself ran the traces, which proved to 
be negative; there was no information on record concerning 
BL'RGI, and since no other nam,~s ,,,ere mentioned in the 
oaterial available on BVRGI, no other traces were made. The 
KGB interest in !JFRGI uerived exclusiv':)ly from the fact that 
he was a professor of Slavic studies and therefP_re had. con-
tl).ct with students w!,o mi1-;ht so:i:e <lay work for the U.S. 
State Dcpa1·t!n(:nt, l,mL·rican Intelligence, and other target 
org-anizations. NOSE'.'-;l{O did not re:call who first suggested 
::..n 3ltcmpt to recrui.t him. 
·,'iht'n BURG I arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in 
contact wi tii a numbPt' of KGB n.gents, and their reports were 
placed in tile u110f'ficial file 1iiaintnincd hy HOSENKO. * :,O­
SENKO could not recall in 1965 how many such agents there may 
have been, their names, or what they might ha,•e reported 
concerning BUllGI. (131'P.GI hJd s.n lnturist int0::-prcter but 
i;osE~KO did not k:iow whether he w~olrG"B agc11 t.) From some 
source, name forgotten by KOSI:XKO, the KGB obtained indica­
tions that BURG! was a liomosexunl, and it was decided to 
try to obtain the grou11cts for recruitment by homosexual com­
pro:!!ise. NOSENKO therefore approacheJ Yu.A, LOPUKHOV, an 
off.icer of the Bri tif'.'1 Department who handled the homosexual 
agent V.iktor BELA~OVSKIY, and asked permission to use his 
ogent in setting up the compromise. After permission had 
been received to mount an operation on this basts, LOPUKHOV 
~'ld NOSE~KO met with BELA~OVSKIY and instructed him to r:nke 
BURGI's acquaintance in a hotel dining room. The compromise 
proceeded according to plan: DELANOVSKIY met BWlGI, the 
feet of mutual homosexuality was recognized, and BURGI was 
invited to BEL.~NOVSKIY's hotel room where hom.ose>."Ual acts 
took place and photographs were made. NOSE~KO was in the 
adjoining room and directed the compromise. He did not meet 
BUP.GI at this point, however. 
As the result of ~OSE~KO's special request, the com­
pro~ising photographs were ready by the following day. A 
report of the compro~isc and a request for permission to 
attempt recruitment were then submitted to NOSENKO's superiors. 
The request came back with the approving signatures of O.~. 
GRIBANOV and A.S. FEKLISOV, the Chief of the American Depart­
ment of the First Chief Directorate, which had expressed 
interest in using BURG! in the United States. BURGI's itin­
erary called for him to fly from Moscow to Kiev a short 
while after this episode ~nd, having called the Kiev KGB with 
instructions, NOSP,'KO and KOZLOV flew there the day before to 
prepare the operation. BUR.GI arrived the next morning and. 
was met at the airport by (fnu) KHODAKOVSKIY, an officer of 
the Second Directorate in Kiev who operated under Inturist 
•NOSENKO explained that no official files were kept on tourists 
until 1960--only "collections of materials."
