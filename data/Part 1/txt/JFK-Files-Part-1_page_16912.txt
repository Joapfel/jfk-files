2. During the- rcpot;t1ng period, tnc cnse officer has been 
meeting G~R~ND~ an avcrncu of three times p~r.weck~ l~ctings 
are usually prc-arranf:cri, at various s.1tes nn~ times. ~leetin(!S 
a\·ci·a~o ?.O t.o 30 minutes. C'iERENIJI,; turns o,•er to tho case 
officer neK4t1ves, prints, logs, and other reports which he has 
pi-.:kcd up from· tho bnse houses Since the prc,•ious meoting, 
alon 1; With IJrl-ef contnc-t reports on his met'tiur::s with l>ase 
house repr~sontntives. Reports on other op~rational activities 
are also turned in nnd dtscuRscd, and GEIU:NDE is given instruc­
tions, notes Ior·the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge­
ments which may L>e desired by ·the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes 
and tran~cripts are exchanged at each· meeting. (The departure 
of Llr\CUT'f-:-1 at tho end of April 1968 left the Station without a 
BEDOX transcriber. As a temporary solution, pending the return 
of LL\etrrE-1 or the rccruit1nent of another mmox transcriber, 
GERLNDE's wi.fo, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50 
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish lan~uage portions of the 
tapes. She docs tho work in her home, and Gm.ENOJ.; transports the 
tapes.) 
3. GERENDE has the diroct agent-handling responsibility for 
the fol lowing LIE~!PTY nr.cnts: LU:MPTY-4 (photo-processor; met 
twi.ce pur woek); Ln:m>TY-G (I.IMin;o; met onct1 per wee!< until. 
terminntion); JJIE~IPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIE~[PTY-13 
uorm1lly met twice per wook -- in his absenco LIEMPTY-:n l!lnkes 
meetings); nncJ Lrnrrn>TY-9 (LICALLA; met twico per week). Ho is 
re8ponsible for rl.irectini,. their work, pnyin~ them, and handling 
nll of the administrative problems which muy develop, To'Judge 
from the rcsul ts, GEHENDJ•: has excellent rapport with these ugents 
anct is nblP. to r~ot a consistently hl~h pcrl'ormance ratt' from 
them -- particularly LIC,\Ll.-\ and LII,YRIC personnel. 
4. As noted in reference, GEHE:NDB was omployed by the 
Mc::dcnn MllltAVJ•;I. committc<~, which we found ~, useful side benefit. 
His MIIRAVJ•;L activity clurinf~ tne reporting period has been minimal, 
but we expect it to stnrt pick inc- up aGain. G:•:RENDE has con­
ducted a few discreet inquiries and invcsti~ntions for us within 
the MHRAVF:r. complex, nnd we have instructed him to try to get 
an assig-nmont which will keep hi11J as close to the FJSTEAL 
delegation as possi~lc. 
5, Reference also pointed out thnt GERK.~DE had pcrl'ormcd 
liicely in the cu] tlv:1t!on nnd development of nu operational 
lead, and that the !;tation planned to !~ivc Gt:!ll...·r-,mr: more- ot· the 
same. :Furthermore, GER1·:NDE's stan<.linf~ assignm.:-nts (LIEm>TY

over 13 years anrl h_n:-. no other outside empl,,)~lt.'nt o:r nny 
consequence. T~y the s:tme token, he was, thrOl!~".h no .fault of 
his own, doing less work for \'iOl•'IIU,I than at any time in his 
c-:ircer. GCRENDE's operational exposure throu:~h the years

security reasons. 1'hc solution to G1,;1u1:1E:'s pr01.Jle1r. (lacl: of

been ~l!~ainst the FJSTE,\J. target, particular C:\rt' wou~d have to 
be tak<"n in co1runitti,ng him further in thls di.reet.1011. It was 
dccidt:'d, therefore, th~t his principal r~tooling would be in 
a non-FJST~AL field.
