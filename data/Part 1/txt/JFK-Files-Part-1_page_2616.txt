(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS) 
The last time the vault was entered was in the fall of 
1963. At about that time the agent, a military man, 
received a promotion and was relieved of his night watch 
duties. (The agent was scheduled for rotati6n to the 
United States but, with his promotion, he had obtained an 
extens1on until May 1964.) Although the agent was still 
active in January 1964 and was still assigned co the same 
military post, he had lost access to the classified 
documents. The information obtained from the age~t's vault 
was highly sensitive and so valuable to the KGB that the 
Paris Legal Rezident as well as several case officers there 
had been·rewarded for their part in the operation. 
Before leaving Mosc~w for Geneva in January 1964, 
NOSENKO had been told that the technician FOFANOV had been 
sent to Paris in the KGB hope that the agent would be able 
to re~enter the vault again before his transfer to the 
United States in May .. When. NOSENKO visited the Soviet 
Embassy -in• Paris on 19 January 1964 while· en route' to 
Geneva, FOFANOV was on duty at the entrance and NOSENKO 
cha·t ted with him. FOFANOV said h_e "was not doing good" 
and he "would probably be sitting there until May":, but 
he. had hopes "that ~ome.thing mj,ght happen"~ 
The Ame~ican ag~nt was getting paid by the KGB and he 
was recruited with the promise of a substantial sum of 
money. NOSENKO didn't ~now if he. was recruited in Paris 
or ·if it was even a formal recruitment, nor what plans the 
KGB had for him after he left Paris. 
NOSENKO learned of the_ case "in little pieces" .at 
separate tfmes fr6in. various ~embers ·of the Second Chief 
tiirectorate Specia~ Section who ~ariicipated in it, 
principally LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV in Moscow, and FOFANOV 
l*ter in Piris.: [Under intensii~ ~uestioning, NOSENKO ~as 
.also alleged he learned -0f the case from IONOV, the Chief. 
of. the Special Section.] NOSENKO e~plained that he knew 
LEBEDEV and KARETNIKOV from their visit to his office to 
discuss technical installations at new tourist hotels, when 
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of th~ Seventh Department.
