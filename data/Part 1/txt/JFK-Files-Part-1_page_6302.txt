a. It ts notad that Jorge WBDINA Bringuler· is listed 
on Pa1to 13 of Attnchment C to UFG:\--1977 ns an MRR member, wltb a 
listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JMI\A\"E ti-acing Identifies one C.'lrlos 
PR.-\DO as "a brother of Raul, th,:- ht'ad or G-2 1n Las Villas Province," . 
as. reported In IIAVA-6437, 5 October 1960; there ls no further i~forma 
tion on this Carlos PRADO. Ho'l\'CV('r,. the orl~inal source of the info 
atlon given In Attachment C or UFGA--1977 was a letter brought out 
of PBRU:UEN by AMSTRUT-1 nbou.t cad)" July_ 1962~ Said letter contained 
a $25 money order, Issued at Station No. 9, N.c~ Orleans, on 
16 llarch 1962 1 for Jorge MEDINA Brinhruier and purchased by Maria 
Teresa MEDINA. Tho envelope, adclressed to Sr~. ·consuelo. C. de 
Rl\'AS In Mexico City, bore the· no,:ition, "For Carlos PRADO," and 
contained a note, "This money order for $25 1s for ·earlos PRADO 
from his aother,·" In addition to the monc-y order. There is one
