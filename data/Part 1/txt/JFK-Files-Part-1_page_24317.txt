of focal interest to the PRC. This could lead to 
invitations to Peking (as it did in Ness's case) and 
possibly an FI operation of consequence vis-a-vis the 
China target. 
3. The efficacy of the aforementioned scheme seemed Of,-. 1_.,, 
to pose some doubts to llr. Horvath. On the one hand, he f-' ~• 
did not feel that either Rome or Paris Stations bad ~ r' ii,., 
sufficient case officer strength on hand to direct and ,,,,. J/:t i 
support a tricky operation of this type which might have J;~• 
only marginal utility, in their view. As for Paris, 
the French police, being as efficient as they are, would 
probably come upon QRPHONE's "black net" in .time, and _, l 
could conceivably pose security problems for him. As ~ 
an alternative, llr. Horvath proposed that CA Staff write~~..,.. 6 /Jt 
a general dispatch to all EUR Stations describing the -,.; l~ ~f~! 
asset and indicating that the Staff would like to see ,._ ~• -~r-:• 
greater use made of QRPHONE's capabilities on the- ,_ ja 6ti'J J,.~ 
Continent. The dispatch should ask the Stations to commedt,.t-r 
on the service that QRPHONE might provide them and suggest_ ..l,il' 
the means for accomplishing it. l\lr. Horvath also asked - ,...,. ..... 
that, prior to forwarding the dispatch, a security review 
be conducted of this case. He did comment that, if the 
security review indic·ated no severe compromises of 
QRPHONE's cover or personal security, it would be a 
pity not to make gTeater use of this agent's notable 
contacts in the European leftist community. 
4. Accordingly, I agreed with Mr. Horvath's two 
recommendations; namely, to conduct a security review of 
the case and, subsequently, to forward a blanket dispatch 
to the Field, if appropriate. I mentioned that we would, 
still like to raise the possibility of a black operation 
in Paris and Rome in that dispatch and to this, Mr. Horvath 
posed no objections. 
j Addendum: Following the above conversation, Miss Jane Long 
_ _._: ·I bas initiated a CI type of review of the Subject's 
I security status.
