15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains lnformaUon obtained 
by JMWA VE regarding Subject ~ indicated him to be emptionally un­
lltable, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of a r.ut. We 
are inclined to agree wllh this information ln ao far ae Subject 'a eco­
nomical theory ts concerned. During bis stay of almost one year u 
an uylee 1n: the· 1u- gentine Embaaay 1n l:labana, Subject spent the copious 
apare time arailable to hlm writing an economic treatise. On our meet­
Ing wltb Subject on May 4th, Subject provided ua with a handwrttton 
abort summary of this docament. According to this aumnlary, Subject 
bu been attempting to correlate economic cycles wtth pea.ks of sunepot 
acttvity. He bacu up hie ''economic argument" with reference to the 
Old Testament and the Aztec Calendar. 11 Subject haa been expounding 
Udl tt.•>ory 1n public we are not surprised that he la considered some-. 
what of a n~1t. It should be noted, however, that many otberwtae sane 
and UH!ul people believe 1n boa·oacopee and other slmllar superaUUona. 
WO do not feel that this quirk. 1n bla personality must neceaaarlly be con-
8ldered derogatory in term• of bi• possible operational exploitaUon by 
ltUBAIUC. Altbough we ban epent Jess Uan ton hour• with Subject, our 
lmpnH1on la that be la a rational indlvldual 1n term■ o( hla attitude 
toward.a and relatlonahlpa with other lndl'Ylduala and per■onall~ea arouncl 
ldm. Aa a matter of fact, we obtalned the lmpreaBlon that Sub!ect po•­
