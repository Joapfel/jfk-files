r. At pr,esent we have the case or a member or the 
Chilean Coinrilunist Party and OSPAAAL whose passage has 
beeil~e~ aside by these o~ganizations to travel rrom 
~dr.id_-t:o -CUba. PQur days ago FRANCO sent a cable and 
.s~ill ·:there is no answer. We ma<le the decicion to grant

with a cable which was shamerul to see and read. The 
wording or that cable gives the impression that PDlEDA is 
be~ held captive and asks them to please come to his 
help and 3end for him. He makeo us look ridiculous. Just 
think that cable has been read by others before they showed 
it to me. The political position or PD-lEJJA and other CUban 
writers should be investigated, as riow they are putting 
up on stage "La Nochede los Asesinos" and they also want 
another ·cubanwrner-tocoine. I should like to get your 
advice in this area _as.I am totally ignorant or matters 
re~ated·to culture, for we hive no cultural attache here.

was no inconvenience on his part if they requested it and 
took the necessary steps. •• You know Mr. ASENjO. I saw. 
tum a month ago and he had asked me 1f' we had decided not 
to go ahead with it, as there lad not been an answer in 
that regard arter having obtained authorization from the 
General Admln:fs tration of Security which was the most 
difficult step.
