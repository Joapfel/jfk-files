period of-.training ahd handling prior· .to anticipated d-ispatch--early 
Julygfthrough l~te N9vcmber ... 1960. These thoughts are based on 
per_sonal daily -extended co·ntact ·as trainer/agent handler with Subject 
as a member· of prospective cross-border team for implementation of 
REDSOX Operation. AESENT[NEL. One member was re 0 assessed operationally 
unsuitable~ whi~h left a team of 2 agents, b6th of which Undcrsignzd 
continued to handle .. It is:hopcd that this assessment may be of 
some bcricfit to th~ AF Desk Officer, who r~qucsted it the day of this 
writing. It i.s intended that Subject's dcmonst1'ated suitability for 
AESENTINEL, an infiltration-exfiltration operation into difficult·_ 
te~rain in the Soviet Union, will serve as a mechanism rather thah 
an end in illustrating S~bicct's general abilities and limitations 
for the task at hand. An ~ttcmpt bas been made to prc5ent this 
-~atcrial iri-subjcct categories considered operationally meaningful.

•• 2. It is my considered opinion th;it the SubjectYof this writing 
has the highest personal and professional regard for Undersigned. I 
do also consider that, although· thoughtful handling and self assure,j­
ncss were pi;_1:_r,~g_uisite ·agent control factors during this case, Subject 
d·id not cause',~n-uncomfortable amount of special handling problems. 
The s~nior Project Officer was Mr. Perry Crookham, C/DOD/DOB during 
the training and holding prior-to-dispatch ~hasc of the operation.
