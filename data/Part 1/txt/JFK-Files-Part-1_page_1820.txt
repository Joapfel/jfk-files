We reviewed with some interest the embryonic operational 
center which the Department of State i ■ developing. We found that 
this is an interesting development and would obviously have bearing 
• on the intelligence community. 
State at White House Briefings 
We recommend that in accordance with the present practice of 
a representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency attending the 
briefings of the ,vhite House staff by CIA, that a representative of 
the ·Department of State also be invited to attend these meetings.

Receipt of Top Classification lvte.asas.ea 
We recommend that the DCI take up directly with the President 
the problem of receiving all pertinent messages dealing with foreign 
• . 
afia!rs which might have any bearing on intelligence esthnates or 
reports, or on covert operations. We have particularly in mind 
such communications as between the President and I<hrushchev, etc. 
We believe that it is important for the DCI to see such messages in 
order to give proper guidance to the intelligence and operational 
activities of the Agency.
