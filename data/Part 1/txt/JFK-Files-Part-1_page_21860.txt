further prompting,gave a detailed st&tement-of his own personal 
past and his professional career. ·In tius· statement he described 
his education, his service in the GRU, his entry into the KGB 
and gen~rally the functions and operating techniques of the 
various components of the KGB Second Chief Dircctora_te in which 
he had served, along with the inclusive dates of his serv.ice 
in each. This account was very similar to that given MARK 
earlier in the day. Still without prompting, he discussed 
several specific KGB operations against Americans inside the 
Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University 
professor on the basis of homosexual con,promise and the other 
an unsuccessful attel'.lpt to recruit an American ·code cle~.- • 
NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.* 
The question of his further assista.nce was then ,aised 
again: The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the 
Yale professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree­
ment involved only two pieces of info~mation and ignoring the 
fact that he had already given considerably more: 
NOSEUKO: 
Case 
Officer: 
I have told you enough for this day, and I ~ill 
tell you only these t~o cases which I wanted to 
tell you, and it is enough for this day. 
How do you imagine that this is enough? You 
know that we work much the sa:ne way. 
NOSENKO: Yes. 
Case You know what interests us, of course. 
Officer: ... _,·,.•. ,·- . 
NOSENKO: I know it. Today I ·gave only two things, 
Let's meet one another [again]. 
Case Good. But let me say this: What you tell me 
Officer: ·1:s~,your business. I am not going to try to 
bring any pressure at all ... There is no argu­
ment about it. I am not going to say: 'Please 
see us in Hos cow. ' I don' t want to see you 
NOSENKO: 
CASe 
Officer: 
in Moscow because it's too difficult. It is 
completely impossible. That's it. No more on 
that subject. 
I said to David [MARK] before meeting you that 
I don't want to meet anyone anymore, not anyone. 
All right. -Agreed.
