C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section 
throughout the _1953 - 1955 period as he claimed. (Previous conclusion) 
The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The 
conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First 
Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-March 
1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the Seventh Department, 
SCD. 
This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO 
during current interviews. The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an 
officer in the First Section but was not a very eff~ctive officer and that 
-
both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he 
was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is reluctant to 
admit that he was other than sl!ghtly !~~_1-~~daisical in his work during 
this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be­
havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the 
Komsomol unit in 1954 _and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"
