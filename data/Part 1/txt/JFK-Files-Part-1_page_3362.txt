1. Tbe following oar report concerning the noi-so-private 
affairs of AMBIDDY/1 and his fiaricee may be of interest to 
BBCKHOFF. According to AMYUll/19, AIIBIDDY/1 inten~s to formalize 
his relationship with Iden B sometime within-the next few months. 
The marriage w:C l probably take place in Latin America and. Iden 
B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would 
have a·harmful effect on the AMYUM ,:,rganization .. Attention is 
called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer,·in part, some of 
the qu•stions raised in ref dispatch·concerning ODYOD involvement. 
in,AMWORLD. The Station has forwarded reports of this nature 
which concern claims by members of the Cuban exile ccaaunity of 
ICUBABK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/1. • Of the ·specifics· cited· by the • 
Cuban, intelligent or otharwise, to support their allegations • 
those statements attribu;;ed to the ADORLD principals th:.:imeelves 
appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to "knowledge" 
aa oppcaed to conviction based on AIIWORLD'a affluence. To date 
no tangible evidence of KUBAIUt involvement with~ has come 
to our attention •
