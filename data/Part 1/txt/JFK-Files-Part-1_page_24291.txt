affiliation with .JKl,ANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment, 
a~~ ~P ~x~r~ ~i~Cu&i~u LO ~/i's cover situation. We have.no 
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,

contacts. 
ABILI'IY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and ca~ 
work well for extended periods without supervision.

burden. He is not overly concerned about his administrative 
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely

he can be very upset.
