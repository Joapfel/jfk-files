41 •. Aside from the cons tn n t er it ic h;m of ll:w:111:, '~ i nC0!11PC-
te nce, lnck of vision, and lnck of realism, _he is quick to ·point _ 
out the ··dcficienelcs of life iu Cuba ·as reflected in Ii.ls clii·ective 
to his- Embassy' staff not to cclcurate Christmas to~cthcr, because 
·:there. ni'<:! liUnGrY people' nt home. RUIZ has nlso said 'that ,medicine 
in gehcral .is-quite_ backward in Cuba. 
·; 42. Although he is probilb1y an :tth61-Lst (or likes to_ .think 
. of himself as one:), he_ ls k1i"6wn to believe that "rcl-ii;ion should 
not be conslclcrcd a hnndicap for pcisons trying to return ·to Cuba." 
'lie docs not hide his-views of the American people, either, for 
• he describes Am~ricans as "frank" and "simple". "They· treated 
me ·very.well," he tolu Raul LEON Torres in. DC'ccmber 1969. On the 
other hand, he .refers to Latin Americnn diplomats as bo·otl ickers· 
because they use the. E1iglh;h lnnuuage at parties, and he has 
remarked th:1t "capital ism is no t;ood." 
43. He seems to have a certain admiration for G12neral 
·Francisco FRANCO, of ,1'hom RUIZ hns said: "FRAXCO is the only 
rcnson thnt Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also c:illcd FRANCO 
"one·of the few most brilllnnt politicinns of nll time." 'I'hcse 
seem like strange words for n man as security-conscious as he. 
41. He appears to be well-informed on international matters. 
Some of his views are contradictory at timei, but they characterize 
tim hs whnt migh~ be called an undecided realist: 
a. "Cuba is a political power, not a military or 
economic power." 
b. "The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the 
Mediterranean." 
c~ _ "Cuba c?.n destroy ·Guantanamo whenever it chooses 
to do so, althouch the base has lost its strategic value 
to ·the United States.-" 
d. "US-China rappronchment should be feared, but 
also a Japiln-:Chiua alliance." 
c. "US power is beginning to crumble, but the 
Soviets arc revisionists." 
f. • "The Egyptians hnrm us ·when they buy sugar from 
Cuba and then resell to other countries."
