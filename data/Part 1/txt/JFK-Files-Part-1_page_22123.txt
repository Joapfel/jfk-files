didn • t read an'y. report of the results/ and I didn't ask· to see 
one. I- took a :-.e-.itral po'sition .. They said e:veryt:1ing. was O.K. 
~he next day L~"N'!' was to meet KOVACHEV and ti",e section chief.· 
I went on a .little trip, the May holidays, part of 30 April, 1~ 
2 ,· and 3 May. t.r.e:i I re.tu1;ned they said everything was O. K. and 
that he f_t::_.T'J

ha~ left. I asked them what t."ley had decided for 
the futur~, a contact in the United States or not. They said 
they deci~ed against it because he was to coi:.e to Bulgaria in 
1962 or 1963 fer a Slavic conference.u 
Th~& account, which NOSENKO gave on£ October 1964, differs 
somewha:: from what he had said earlier, -on 11. June 1962, during 
his second meeting .,.ith CIA. NOSI:NKO claimed tnen that he per­
sonall1 participated in the recruitment of Li.11T against GRIBANOV's 
wishes: "They sent me in '61 to Bulgaria. 'I':-,e Minister of Interr.al 
Affairs there asked for a specialist to help them. I we.nt to 
help. 1,r. (American] professor arrived, a very prominent special­
ist on the Slavic countries ... They [the Bulgarians) had never 
tried [t.o recr·iitJ an A.,nerican. '!.et's try,' Isa.id, The Sov:-
iet advisor in Bulgaria celephoned GRID~:ov and reporced that 
NOSENKO had dec:.ded that i.c is possible to ge:: this 1'.merican. 
GRIBh:;c•; .l'c.S i:1 a confer<;:1.ce at t.he t,ime. GR1:BANOV said: "Where 
the hell's HOStl;Ko? Let me talk to him... i,·r.at the hell are 
you doing? I sent ycu only as an advisor.' ~hen he hung up. 
What cculd I do? The B~lsarians had already ~acle all prepara-
tions ... I was e:nbarrasscd, but what could I do? I left the 
office of· the ad·,isor c.:-id they •,:ere waiting for me... I de-
cided to go ahead. I was sure that it would work. I felt that 
it could bE: done, that this American could be firmly recruited •.•• 
I spit on everJtning and went ahc~d with the Bulgarians. I 
told ti.em to grab hirn. If it will be diffic~lt for you, tell 
me and I myself can recruit him. Well, they began and I came 
there. He (NOSEUKO is speaking of himself] .,.as under the guise 
of a Bul~arian and spoke in English, althoug~ my English was 
poor ... 1 said: 'You are a puder~st.' He also proved him-
self to be a h0111osexual there [in Bulgaria] ... 'Well, what will 
society think of you, those whose know you?' Well, what did 
this perscn decide? He agreed.H 
The-first time NOSENKO said that he had not participated 
dire,ctly in this operation was on 2 February 1964, while still 
in Geneva. He volunteered the following: •in Bulgaria in 
April and May 1961, although I did nb,t personally participate 
in this, I went there, and-I helped them there with the whole 
process of recruitment of this professor. I hel?ed the Bul­
garians with what to do and how. He was the professor of 
philolc;:r,1, Lt"?;T. • 
NOSENKO has also varied ·on the timing of the operation 
; ·against· LUNT. In the account quoted above, he said that. the 
approach was made the day before he left on his.May Day holi­
day. On 24 April 1964 he said: •r remember that it was at 
j -:;;· the very beginning of May that this name came up. And we got 
. ·-,J .,., ... ,.- the. infor.aaticn from Moscow the same day, telling us it was
