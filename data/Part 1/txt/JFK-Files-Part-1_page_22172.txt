it may have be·-=n sever.al 1110:1t·,1s after: I began n:y KG9 service 'i~t 
GRleJJ;ov first came· to my attention. t. don't knew when I first· 
saw GRIBA?:OV but it may h:1ve been approximate:l~• 1953 at. a :neetir.g 
before M.:sy Day or the 7 November hqliJay. !would not'necessarily 
remerr~r this as I frequently rr.et much r.iore importar.t -:>eoo:;le, who 
were friends of ny rather, and seeing G!UfJl.!:ov wcu.i.d:-~ • t have been 
particularly i:r,portant to me •.. Sometimes de.ring 195•: a_nd 1.955, it 
was necessary to obtain the signature of a Defuty Chief of the 
Second Chief Directorate· on a cable that. I had.written and, if 
SHUBNYAKo·; was absent at the time, I would take it to GiU3A.'-.OV 
for approval. Though I was only a junior case officer at the 
tir.le, I would tak1;.· the cable, after it ha.! bce:-i a;;rrovcd by the 
Chief of Section and the Chief of Depart:r:::nt, clircc.:tly to GRI.3;,!;ov, 
who wculd simply sign it with no cliscussicn. ! do root :-er.,ernber ho.,. 
many times I to(Jk cables to GRIBA.NOV nor co I reme,.uJer the :::ontents 
of any specific one of them. The fi:st rr.eeti~g with GRIB.?.:,OV that 
I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956. I think it was 
in June. r had returned from Kiev with }~OZLOV and, after writing 
a spravka on E~RGI, PERFILYF.V, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRiilA?:OV. 
'KO~LOV didn't introduce me to GIUBANOV at th.;1t til'.!e, out G?...ID.l\N~V 
knew that I was NOSEHKO b3cause the p1an for the·su~GI op~ration 
said that I would participate a!1d because ?ERFILYC:V :1ad :nade an , 
appointment for the three of us to Epeak to GRIE>:J-:·.JV at this tir::e. 
The 1:-,eet.ing lasted aLout 30 or 40 minutes. GRIB; . .NO'J read the re­
port on BURGI's recruitment and asked sorr.e questions. KOZLOV 
answere:d some of these and I answE.reJ others. .at.tier than c.sking 
what Ukrainians t.ook part in the operation, I C.:!n re-:all none of 
GRIBAl,OV' s questions nor do I remember any of the conversation 
which tock place at this meeting. When we were through, KOZLOV 
and I left while P.ERFILYEV remained with GRIBl\.'WV._ Perhaps the 
first time I was alone with GRIDA!!•JV was in 1958. when I attended 
a recepti~n giver. by t~e Indian Err~assy at the sovetskaya Hotel 
in Moscow. L'sually [A. V. J SUNTSOV ac-:ompanied GRIB.-\:~OV on such 
• occasions. but,·he was sicic at the timl?. I clon't kno· .. why SU!ZTsov· 
usually went with GRIBANOV, why I was selected to go, or wtat I 
was supposed to do at the reception. I think. GRIBA?-:ov called the 
Seventh Department and asked whom he could use, but I don't know 
why he pick~d Me. GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was 
to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBCNOV. I was to 
introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use 
the last name ~;IKOLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used 
the name V'"ra Ivan0i·.-.:.1. l,fter work, I went home to change r:ry 
clothes and we went in GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel 
Sovetskaya. GRIBANOV sat in front wi':.h the dri•1er and I sat in 
back with Vara ANDREYEVA. I cannot say how ~4ny times I have seen 
GRIBANOV altogether. From 1959 on I saw him more frequently. 
Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of sections and 
their deputies and I would take part in these. I ha<i begu.'l tc • 
call·GRIBANOV by his first name and patronymic in 1958, when I 
was Deputy Chief of the First Section of the Seventh Depart:nent,_ 
. but at thes_e meetings I called. him 'Comrade -General.' • In 1959 •• 
I also went to GRIBA!IOV' s office alone in connection with· t.-ie. 
FRIPPE~ case and, sornetim~-between Uay and October•i95g~ ·took 
him a· report that I had prepare~ concerning the use of tourist
