Moscow because of reported hc,.:10sexualactivities.• 
• NOSZNKO has described an operation against KEYSERS (see 
below), but because of t.~e date of KEYSERS' arrival in Moscow, 
he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GOLIT­
SYN's two leads discussed above. On the basis of available 
information, it appears that the subject of this lead must 
have been either STORSBERG or HURLEY, the only two •milit~ry 
·-.code clerks• in :-soscow in the spring of 19EO. The subject 
of GOLITSYN's second lead could have been STOPS3ERG, HURLEY, 
or, in fact, anyone else at the E..-nbassy, although GOLITSYN 
suggested that he might be a code clerk and might be a mili­
tary man. By his statement that there was no KGB operation 
.against HUR!.EY, together with his description of the opera­
tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and 
his (and PRElSFREUND's) assertion that PREISFREUND took part 
in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORS.BERG--
• NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leads were 
to the STORSBERG operation, which ended in failure. This con­
flicts with GOLITSYN's report that PREISFREUND was involved 
in a successful recruitment operation in late 1960. There are 
also inconsistencies between the NOSE:,KO and GOLITSYN leads 
as regards the progress of the· operation. .<,OLI-TSYN reported
