l. Mr. Hunt took on his present duties ns EUR/CA in 
July 196_8. llis performance in this posi fiori has been con­
sistently Stro~g. 
2. From the period of 'his previous assignment to EUR 's 
Special Activities Staff, Mr. l~rit hns made a substantial 
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational 
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the 
termination over the ·p~st two years of many Ion~ established 
projects. lie has n ·une political st-nse and a sound grasp of 
"European realities and eiolutions. While concerned with the 
role and meth.ods of political action, his mind is essentially 
operational, imagin~ti~e. and perhaps at its happiest in the 
recognition o-f opportunities and tho stimulation of specific 
action in the field. In both these ar~as he has ~hown a power 
of ori~inal thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views, 
and persistanco and vi~or in helping get action underway.

played an important role in the Division's business, Tho 
first is in ~rovidin~ co~sistent staff assistance to Branches 
nnd Stations in the conduc~ of on-Koing CA action, and the 
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern 
t6 the Senior Starr nnd other divisions. He has brought to 
this work a baln~ced view ~f Division and Senior Staff equi­
Jies, ah excellent awareness o( realities in the field and of 
the practical limits imposed by the tield priori tics, manpower, 
and the requirements of security.
