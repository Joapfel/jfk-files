Hhould h~ rointed out that· this blankot ~ovrrn~e is ~seiul 
insurance that all Rctivity is .. ~~u~ht. Combined with th.:-
daily fi:-t~d surveillance reports un all rncmlJcrs of t:1e fJST~.\L 
installatlon, the ~tation can saf1.1ly ,:;ay thnt its covic.>r:i~e of 
FJSTE.,\I, installation inr,rcRR. Rnd ef!res8 is complete during 
workin~ hours (nnd nny extra hours which tho St~t1on vishes 
covered). Since l May LJLYRIC h:\S IJl•cn on duo· 57 hours per 
week: 0~00-1800 wcckdayR nnd OS~hl-1500 Sa turdnys. Cl.~u~ensura te 
wi~h their now schec;tulo (and th~• rt1turn of l,JEP.D,TY-26 to tho 
active roster), tho total monthly LILYJ!IC Ralary has ~ .. ~ne !rom 
4,900 pesos p~r month to 6,000 pesos per· month (LIE\TTYs 13, 
14, 2G, 1\nd 27, aro of coHrso, father, mother, and t'II\J sons). 
The fixed survoill_Rnco repo1·ts n~ used on a daily basis, since 
the .Station constantly has operat1ona1· 1nLercst in kcaving 
whether a particular }'JSTJ-:ALt:R w-as "in" or "out" at a rs.rticular 
timo, and if ou1., who he went with, what time he left, etc. 
In addition, LILYRIC has atandi.n~ instructions to not_i!y 
GERENDE (and G.t:RENDE the Station) immediately when Allk!rican­
appeariog visitors come to the FJSTEAL installation. E~bt such 
visits were noted in the reportin~ period, along withs nu~ber 
of other visitors who, for one reason or another, attracted the 
special attention of LILYRIC.

11. LH~lPTY-H slowed down noticeably in the report in..>:: period, 
He was ill sevcrnl times, his sun·e1llance reports \\'ere occa­
sionally inaccurate, and his photo~rnphlc work was poor. \ti th • 
the assurance that l,ILYRJC would be ahle to take up the sl!lck :. ·•.· 
(and give us better coverage for less money) the decision was 
made to terminate tho LHIJTF.D base house. While w·c are thc:.>rcby 
denied some o.t" the flcxiblli ty which we have had in tht' psst, 
it ls likely that LJl~MPTY-6 would slowly havo .faded out c1i the 
picture anyway. While he was in tl~re, he produced 911 op~rn­
tional rhotos, as well as daily fi.xed survolllance ref'<.,rts. 
Following bis termination (a report 01 which is bein~ forwarded 
separately) LIEiWTY-0 took a trip to Europe and has nou started 
working . .Cull-time in tho 1ns11rancl• business for his s·on-in-law, 
where he has ~atncd a new lease on life. In other words, the 
termination couldn't have been more nmicahlo. LIEMPTY-t- ,·:teated 
the LUII't'I::D ar1artment (he said he could not afford to; keep 
paying the rent) and it is no longer available to the-Station.
