stone stove, also 1dtl. a fire inside. There are sor.ie farn

co~plete, in one of the s~all natics there is a hurro in 
another, so□ e sheer, and ..• they all have a tcrrihle odor! 
But everyhody is happy ac~ taLir.~ pictures, etc. The waiters 
are dressed in national c0stu.:-:;es and the nationai ore estra 
plays too. Can ~ou i □ a~ine it, Luis? It's very nice The

a loud noise was heard-~ the cat knocked sonething over in 
the kitchen. But the frigrtened woman cried: "~un, c hus­
band is coming!" and her husband, frightened also, jurn ed 
out of the window in his rajacas. • 
Until later, Luisi I give you my hand. The 
between us, is that all right?
