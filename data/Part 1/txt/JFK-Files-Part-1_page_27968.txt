has resuited in Agency acquisition of_a well-placed agent 
within the Bu;rmese Embaasy at a timo when contacts with

deemed advisable (as in the WUTHAL case).

has been recommended for promotion to GS-14 a total of 
seven times (four by FE Division and, with this request,. 
thrc;e times. by DO Division). • Aside f1•om the fac~ that ho

thrs to· be an important factor to bo considered in tho 
present promotion request.
