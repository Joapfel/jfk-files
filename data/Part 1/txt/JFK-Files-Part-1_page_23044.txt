Suh,ic-ct surrendered his p1·i\•atc practice to l_hc Cub:111· 
Government, and receiv~s only his salary as Director 
of the llj~her Nervous Activity Research Jnstit:ute, 
which salary amounts to 800 Cuban peso~; this salary 
is insufficient to permit Subject to m:liutain his 
own home and his mistress's separate home and to le:-id 
the type of life to which he was accustom~d. 
g. Subject is described as lackin~ in. ncrl!!al 
affections, cold and. calculating, .ti typical schizoid 
interested only in himself, never makes.~_friendly 
gesture, has a)m6st no friends.· ~ubj6ct is ~erierally· . 
disliked and has many enemies who feel re:ll ·!Ja_te towards 
him .. The you-ng Revolutionary medical doctors refuse 
to have anything to do with him. Fidel ~slro does 
not know who Subject is and has certain}~- never been 
treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment 
from any other psychiitrist. Subject must be very un-­
happy and downcast at his present s_itua tion: His 
income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life; 
he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly, 
he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no 
representative office; he is not politically or socially 
prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest 
attention. Subsource states categorically that he 
believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be wil 1 ing to 
accept any offer. He would take the bait if given 
half a chance."

h. The trip that Subject made to the USSR in 
the early 1960 's was a "pleasure trip.•· So far as 
subsource knows, Subject received no training in the
