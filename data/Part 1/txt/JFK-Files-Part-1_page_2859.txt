Comment: From their modus operandi the "doctor from 
Riga" is undoubtedly VOLKOV and the "student" 
YEFREMOV. NOSENKO frequently used the opera­
tional pseudonym Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV 
and was called Georgiy. r"\b · 
• Al though fJOHNS01!1 apparently confirmed 
NOSENKO's ro½:'e, NOSENKO's version of the case 
is incompatible with what must have been the 
actual time frame. According to NOSENKO' s . 
version, within five days of e'9HNSO~s arriva106 
in Moscow the KGB had discovered that he was 
a homosexual, concluded from "two or three" 
censored letters that he was a threat, and ar­
ranged his entrapment. The rapid pace of . 
events suggests that \JOHNSO@' s homosexuality Olo 
was already known to '--Ehe KGB (if not to NOSENKO.i 
C)6 before GoHNSOjl' s arr i va 1 in Moscow. NOSENKO' s 
Ob ignorance of ~HNSO~' s preach~ng (pr:obably. the 
actual cause qf KGB concern) is further evi­
dence that NOSENKO did not know the complete 
background of the KGB operation, and that hi_s 
role was merely that of playing the ""Police 
Chief". 
, NOSENKO's participation in this case con­
tradicts his assertions about the timing .of 
.his transfer from the American Department.
