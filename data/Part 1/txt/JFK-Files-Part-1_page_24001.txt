1. Forwarded as enclosure are requirements for the debriefing of 
Subject. Together with the requirements is a IWDESK narrative on 
VEBGBS-ANDERSSOll-l!evolution complex for tbe background information 
of Katzenbach. l'urther background on Revolution can be found, if 
7ou bave not already done so, in the following dispatches:

2. We have not yet had ti• to review the tape of your first 
session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to 
get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February. 
The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable know­
ledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out 
his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear 
that, if given the opportunity, Subject Will tak& the bit in his 
., teeth and as much aoney as he can in his hot 11 ttle hands and be 
off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that tbe 
debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis. It 
would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of 
Agreeaent contract for Subject's signature before getting started, 
making sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKB's obligations 
and promises are liaited to the terms specifically enumerated in tbe 
document, We think that any aeaningful debriefing will take 3 - 5 
days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have 
:· illfonaation of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of 
Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long raoge operatiooal 
relationship with Subject. While we look at the debrie!iog as 
basically a CDe-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up 
questicma and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later 
contact. Therefore, the c0111municat1on •channel to Subject should be 
left open on a "don't call us, we'll call you" basis.
