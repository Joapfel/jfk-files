(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964 
aspects of his statements, including those relating to his 
supervisory duties and to the nature of Second Chief Direc­
torate operations against American and other foreign tourists. 
NOSENKO has retracted his assertion that he was a lieuten­
ant colonel, a rank appropriate for a Second Chief Directorate 
Deputy Chief of uepartment, and asserts that he was never 
promoted beyond the rank of captain. 
Most damaging to NOSENKO's claims that he was a supervisor 
in the Seventh Department is his assertion that he accurately 
describes KGB counterintelligence operations against foreign, 
particularly American, tourists. A senior Seventl1 Department 
officer would be aware of the Second Chief Directorate's pre­
occupation with American tourists: If NOSENKO is unaware of 
the extent of KGB activities· in connection with American 
tourists, he was not a Section Chief of Deputy Chief of the 
Seventh Department . 
Conclusion 
NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the 
American-British Comrnonwe~lth Section and was thereafter a 
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible.
