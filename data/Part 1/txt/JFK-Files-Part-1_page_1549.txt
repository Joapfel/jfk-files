TERMINATION 
COMMENTS 
By memorandum dated 2 October 1968, 
the Director of Security forwarded 
two reports to the DDCI summarizing. 
the results of the NOSENKO case to 
that date. The .reports are voluminous. 
One was prepared by the Office of 
Security and the other by the FBI. 
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO 
was a bona fide defector. A draft 
memorandum attached to this file·, 
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared 
by the CI Staff, raises question 
regarding NOSENKO's bona £ides 
and challenges the above two reports. 
NOSENKO continues under contract to 
the Agency. He is brought to Washington 
periodically to consult on matters 
germane to his background and expe·rience. 
Various reports are available in the 
files of the Office of Security which 
detail financial aspects of this case. 
No final accounting has been made since 
the project continues. 
(1) While the Office of Security files 
do document the rationale for the original 
confinement of NOSENKO, they do ·not 
document the rationale for his continued 
confinement over so long a period of time. 
A memorandum dated S August 1969 states 
that various congressional staff officers 
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that 
concern for his safety, as well as con­
cern regarding his bona £ides, prompted 
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6) 
(2) Office of Security files document 
a period in 1969 during which a mail 
cover was placed on NOSENKO~ 
(3) During the above period,· NOSENKO 
was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida. 
During this trip, Agency ~ersonnel, with 
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained 
the services of prostitutes. This 
apparently occurred on at least two 
occasions.
