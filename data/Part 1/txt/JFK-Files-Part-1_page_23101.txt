of Pees, Hungary, who will leavP. soon after collaborating with the 
Department of Psychology for two montlie. He has been working on

things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section 
of Transcultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association 
becaWJe this is a rather new and multi-discipUnary field (comprisiDg 
psychologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more
