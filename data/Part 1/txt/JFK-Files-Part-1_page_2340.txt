position of Deputy Chief, First Sectio~, Fi3:"st Department, during l 96~ .-
1961 has had the most merit in the controversy <>ver his statements 
relative to his KGB career. This particular aspect will be covered in 
detail in another section, but of note at this tiine is the controversy 
over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB, 
entails or does not entail. It is a fruitless exercise to att;empt to judge 
whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 - 1961 
on the basis of whether his knowledge of the total activities of the First 
Section was commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief 
in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch.

the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB 
may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure 
of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment
