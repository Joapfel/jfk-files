Mr. WigrP.n has excellent .substantive IJad;ground on the Soviet Union and, 
except for a. t\rn year· period oifa WE operations desk, has devoted his l'ntire 
9 yc:1.n, in the Agency to research on s~wid Intelligence in one way or another. 
His perio:rmance for the past year in a jl)U formerly helJ by GS-H's and 15's 
can only be described as superlor. He h:1.s not only assumed responsibilities 
greater than those of the f).revious incumbents; he has carried these out with 
a mi1iimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which.has earned 
respect on all sides. Although h·is analysts have often been relatively 
inexperienced, he. has geared their assignments to their capabillties and 
subjects design~d to increase their competence. His most important contl'l­
bution during this period has been in Ute formation of an organized pla.n of 
research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish­
ment.of improved records and procedures to carry out this program. 
Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assii;nment to the field as an 
operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of 
research and support of operations he is presently performing .. I would therefore 
recommend that future training be oriented along these lines raU1er than strictly 
operational lines, _and that planni[Jg for his eventual field assignment should 
cmpha[iile his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with 
other specialisJs in a "liaisqn" relation.
