Case . 
.. Officer·:-· 
·'~OSENKO: 
•. ;You know that I would not bring any pressure. 
That's something we understand because we are 
both in this busin~ss. 1ou and I are in the 
same business, so you can't--
Let me interrupt. Why are we bargaining so 
now? So that I will say something more to 
you. I said: 'Let's meet again.' :-taybe I 
will tell (more). Now I will give you only 
these two ite~s because we have ~ade a deal. 
I will tell you about these two cases. Let's 
meet again, if you insist. I understand that 
you want more. Well, I will think a bit about 
what I know. 
Case That's all right. 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: We can meet when I am abroad perhaps ... You must 
unders'tand me. =:!'his has not cor:ie to me simply. 
I had tir:ie tb think for a long time. I thought 
for a long time. You see, it's very difficult 
for me, very difficult for me. ;1.nd after I go 
it will also be very difficult for me. 
Case 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: 
But you knew that when you came. Why did you 
come to us? Why to the American rezidentura 
(CIA Station) and not to the British? 
I came here because you are strong, strong ... 
You don't have to explain to·· me. I know what 
makes me go. ·I told you it is hard for me. 
I still need to think. That's all. But I 
can no longer take a step ba~k because the step 
forward has already been taken. I won't re­
fuse if we meet before my departure. If you 
like, on Monday, on Tuesday, any day. Monday 
is better for me. Not Sunday, because I have 
to be there with my own [people]. 
This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two 
leads which NOSENKO had come to sell; the BELITSKIY and the 
"ANDREY" cases. :. 
As NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case 
officer asked when they might meet again. NOSE'~KO suggested 
that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as 
it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime. 
He then said that the case officer was probab:ty trying to get 
everything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because 
of the risk to his sec~rity resulting from such a permanent re­
cord of their conversations. NOSENKO said: "I will not tell 
you.anything particularly,interesting. But I can tell you some­
thing. But not,. t-oday. I can tell how LA.~GELLE blew POPOV--not 
I.ANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him--for your 
future use, so that you will know how to operate. But LANGELLE 
was not guilty. It was not LANGEtLE who was guilty. Another 
person was responsible for the compromise. Next time.•
