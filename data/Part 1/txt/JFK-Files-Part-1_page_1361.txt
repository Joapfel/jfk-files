on-island anti-Castro forces, and tying up CIA time, money, 
and manpower for an operation of their o~n creation. Following 
are some reasons which might have ·contributed to its failure: 
a. The controversial nature of the principal 
initiators, Tad SZULC, Jorge VOLSKY and MORENO. The 
AMTRUNK operatives made it known that they were ailti-U.S.G. 
and anti-CIA and accepted assistance only to accomplish 
their own purposes. They were not under CIA control. 
b. SZULC, _although reportedly not directly involved 
in the operation, was kept fully informed of its activities 
by MORENO and perhaps others. 
c. SZULC's direct contact with the White House, if 
true, placed him in a position to pass U.S. policy inf6r­
mation on Cuba· to the opposition. (There is a note by 
Richard Helms on a 23 September 1963 cover sheet requesting 
Alfonso RODRIGUEZ to maintain periodic contact with SZULC 
on Cuban matters at Presidential request going back many 
months.)

d. RABEL (AMLEO-3), who "defected" to the U.S. in 
1962, was· knowledgeable of on-island AMTRUNK targets. 
RABEL, following termination, returned to Cuba allegedly 
to hr ing out. his family, • and never returned. There is 
a possibility that he was a CASTRO agent. 
e. CUBELA was knowledgeable of at least some of the 
AMTRUNK agents. GUIN (AMTRUNK-10).was a codefendant in 
the CUBELA trial. (Believe GUIN may have been given 
a stiffer sentence than CUBELA and may still be in prison.)
