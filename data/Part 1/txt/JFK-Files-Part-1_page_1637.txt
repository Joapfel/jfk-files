DATE: l July 1963 
l. On 24 June 1963, Mr. Charles Matt, SAS/MOB/PM., extension 
6488, was referred to me by the SAS Security Of'f'icer, Mr. George 
I.adner, and visited me in Room 4 E 2l to request some operational 
support beginning l July 1963. Mr. Matt advised that two leaders 
of' the Cuban Exile Group were coming to Washington, D. c., on that 
latter date to confer with CIA and other Government officials, 
including probably Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General, concern­
ing the "new progl'SD1" for the exiles. 
J)i. Mr. Matt explain- ed that ~ covert site (#302 922) located 
atl.2.218 Aldershot Drive, Bethesda.JJMaryland, had recently been 
procured to billet these exiles and to serve as the meeting place 
for these sensitive discussions to take place. Mr. Matt said that 
SAS is vitally interested in what these two exiles say to each other 
when the u. s. Government officials have departed af'ter a day's 
discussions. He, therefore, requested that microphones be concealed 
in the house to monitor their comments. 
3. Mr. Matt said that the two men would arrive on l July and 
would be in Washington at the house for about a week or ten days. 
The audio coverage was requested for this entire time. Mr. Matt 
i D'.::S./ :rn;:; f also said that the house would be retained for several more months 
• ,:---·-:c-, :,.d; and that the two exiles would return to Washington several more 
. :::::-.:.:'.~.: u» 1 times in that period and that an audio surveillance would probably
