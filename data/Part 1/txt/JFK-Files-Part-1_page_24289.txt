B. This image of JKLASCE as a powerful,professional 
organization has been enhanced in.Q/l's case by the 
circumstances of his akent relationship, which require 
very professional handling. In..teed Q/1 has nroba.bly come 
to hold a rather glamorous "storybook'' image of JKLANCE 
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE 
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be 
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti.; ,,.u 
JKLANCE stories which he beard probably only serves· to 
accentuate the feeling on bis part o~ being a member of 
a very i1·pressive outfit. • ••• 
C. In bis political evolution over the years, Q/1 
bas become active in at ieast two "causes". In both 
instances be saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy 
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally 
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been 
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political 
outlook. (In other clrcwnstances this might be called 
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends 
as a detached observer rather than a participant. 
D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact 
tbat be is an American (and does not consider himself 
disloyal). Given his citizenship and bis disinclination to 
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he 
bas been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE 
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication 
that be views this as "squealing" on bis friends -- indeed 
the contrary seems to be the case. 
E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that 
Q/1 was recruited at a time when be was in serious financial 
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity 
of bis wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid 
him reasonably well and regularly, and bas enabled him to 
be independent of his wife's family's charity. 
F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination 
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1 
clearly likes bis work. He enjoys dealing with international 
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and 
tbe opportunity to exercise his language capability. In 
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which 
he has been able to live appeals to him. 
G. In assessing the relative importance of these 
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under­
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate 
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more 
underlying. Band F have arisen since recruitment and 
probably play an important role in 'bis current motivation.
