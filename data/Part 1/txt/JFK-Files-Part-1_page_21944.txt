a. ~.gents Reporting on Military Attaches 
Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network 
(agentura) at his disposal in operations against U.S. Mili~ 
tary Attaches during this period which began in 19~4, HO­
SENKO replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers• ... 
about ten persons, pl us the agent .• SERVIZNIY' and the one 
with the code name 'DMITRIYEV' ... These additional two 
agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether." With one ex­
ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans~ 
fcrred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955. lie met 
each agent about once a ~eek, except for the chauffeurs who 
were met three times a month in a saf-:?house or on the 
street. According to NOSENKO, this network was "just a 
supporting agentura, which ..,·ery !3eldom was worthwhile," the 
main source bf inforraation on the Military Attaches being the 
microphones in their offices.** 
. Newly added to the network while NOSLNKO held this 
position was a maid inserted to rE!port on Army Attache Earl 
L. MICKELSON and his successor, Fillmore K, MEARNS. Her 
name, .NOSENKO.tbought,w3s NOVIKOVA. She was an English­
speaking university graduate but "hid her k!lowledge of 
Eng1ish in order to overhear conve=sations or read letters 
wLthout taking them outside." 
Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was 
his agent, Mariya tlEVEROVA, code name "SIIVF.DOVA," and she 
was targetted against the Assistant Army Attache, Ira 
RICHARDS. He described NEVEROVA as a "little, old,'thin 
~~man," from whom he never obtained anything of interest. 
They ;:aet in a safehouse on Kuznetskiy Most. 
Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi­
fied Nikolay SHNYRYI::V, who was used by various of the at­
taches. "He reported where they went, what they said, 
whether they took notes or photographs, whether they had 
unusual packages with them, and so on." 
t:hen viewing photographs in September 1964, UOSEHKO 
iC:entified Vladislav VOROBYJ::V as the agent "SEi<.VIZNIY." He 
had been working in the Embassy since its establishment, 
starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time, 
performing clerical tasks. VORODYEV had no direct connec­
.tion with the Military Attaches, and NOSENKO said he himself 
did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in 
1954. Tho main function of this agent was delivering to 
NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone listings of the 
Embassy, issued monthly. 
"DMITRIYEV1 s• true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV: 
NOSENKO saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but 
was not sure, that this was his agent .. An electrician who 
worked on the Embassy ',s electrical wiring systems and eleva­
tor, ~DMITRIYEV" reported to NQSI:NKO on antenna wi.res and
