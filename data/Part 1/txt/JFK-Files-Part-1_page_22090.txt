(a) ?,OSENKO's Sourees 
Nearly all of NOSF.NK~'s knowled&e about the microphone 
system in the chancery building was, te said, d~rived from 
two circumstances: Fitst, his responsibility as Deputy 
Chief of the KGB's U.S. Embass)" Section, for receiving and 
disseminating transcripts_ of conver!{at_ions there: and second, 
a special meeting which he attended in tus dual.capacity a.s· -
Deputy Chief of tho U.S. E."lbassy Section and custodian of 
the microphone information. Additional infor~ation was ob­
hined by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 :from G.I. G-I-:YAZNOV, his 
former 6Ubordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the 
Section. In s11veral discussions with GRYAZNOV duting this 
period NOSESKO learned that some of the microphones were 
dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO's 
reassignment to the Tourist Vepartcent in Jr:.nuar)· 1962. 
NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources·of•infor­
mation on the microphones are presented in chronological 
order below. 
"We are listening to everythius the military attaches 
say in Moscow, the Mill tary, Navy and Ail· Force Attaches," 
,_. NOSENKO said on 11 June 1962. ''All the reports go through 
me. I read them .... Only a limited group of people read 
these reports. They are ali in the First Department of the 
Second Chief Directorate. Who are the,•? The Chief of the 
Department (we don't give them to bis deputies), the Chief 
of the [U.S. Embassy) Section, and 1--altogether three people. 
Sometimes we report to GRIBAXOV things we consider important. 
We conceal the fact that we are listening to the Americans 
from our workers in other departments, from.the English 
Department, from the French·Department~ ... We are listening 
to the three attaches and the Minister Counsellor. Don't 
even send coded cables abbut me (to Moscow). If you do it 
will be the end of me .... Only three people know that we 
_ are listening 'to you. Even within the Second Chief Directo-
rate it is a tremendous secret that we are listening.to you." 
JIOSENKO was asked on 12 June 1962 about the form in which 
"received the audio intercept reports and whether these 
1 ·.-' reports were delivered to bis office. • He answered:. "No.
