-'S,BIKO ahd, i~1 Erii,:11sli·, said -tl1::it hc1~ ht1sband would pick h·im

h.otel dr iv'en by· ;i chauf-Ieur. AMA uro-1 i,:-reeted S,\MKO- in frcint 
6! the hotel ~nd after exchanging a fc~ words, ·they departed 
for a nearby restaurant. (SAMKO was too preoccupied to make 
. note of .the· n:ime of the restaurant". We decided against any 
.. ·surveillance dui:in~ <t-!1e AMAlJl'0-1/SAMKO meeting t'.l a_void alerting 
:AlL-\lJl'0-1 .af1d/~r:his staff that the SAMKo· visit to .Madrid 
was pre--:planned.-) • 
-·13.: At lunch SAMKO and AAIAUT0-1 again reminisced. 
The}' d·iscussed the following: 
.A~- In one of his referen·ces, ·AlL.\tli'0-1 said 
th~_t. men like him are needed -in Cuba and 
noted that h~ would probably die fighting 
for Cuba which is young and aggr~ssiv~, 
,_,,,:;.:. but-,that some day it will be a great 
·cotmfry;'. ·• that. he has been_ fighting ·aii 
his lif~·· to relieve the oppressed and 
repeated that he. wni die fighting. 
(it is interesting to note SAMKO's rea,~tion 
here to AMAlIT0-1 's s·tatement. When SAMKO 
first visited AMAUf0-1 on 31 May, he was 
certain that under the facade of being a 
devoted revolution;lry AMAUT0-1 was indeed a 
capitalist at heart, but at this meeting 
SAllKO modified his comment by adding that 
it :i'ppears AMAUT0-1 is truly a communist, 
who rnai~tains strong convibtions of the 
righteousness of the revolution. The above 
comments by AMAl!r0-1 produced· the peg on 
which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity 
of AMAUTO-l's statement on freeing the 
oppressed,· but he was not specifically 
iristrticted to maintain a polemic argument 
on the rights and wrongs of the revolution 
because we felt this o~jective was secondary 
to !he ·re-establishment of a relationship 
between ihese two old friends,· A future 
meeting might include the exchange oran 
objective appraisal of the revolution as 
seen by SAMKO.) 
8. A?.L-\UT0-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an 
intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea f6od 
in the United States. He explained that 
-the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in 
tl_1e Canary Islands. The fish caught is 
processed in the Canary Islands and can be 
shipped to the United States as a prodtict 
of Spa in, not of Cuba. .-BIA UT0-1 added, 
"SMIKO, ·yuu're like a father t.o me, please 
. think about it (the agency)? A~L-\UT0-1 . 
explained .tha t ~A~IKO could earn about $200,000 
a · year in commission based on sales of 
$2,000,000. SA~IKO sa:i.d he would think about_ 
it, but privately to SACODER he said that 
he h.id no· intention to clisturb his· retirement 
wit_h "a fishy business. '.
