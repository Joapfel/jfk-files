Dear Olivera 
Wearing ny Crusade bat at this j1µlcture, let :ne fill you in u 'best I can on 
the history and developl!lent of the Crus&de operating bu~et. This is no z:iean 
job, sinco practically all" of the transact.icns concerni~ it were verbal -
a sit,uation I hope to correct in the futlU"e, startinc now. So here goes. ·I 
will make the special budget the wbject·or a separate letter. 
In December, Abbott r,ot the General's verbal approval of a Crusade budget tor 
1952 or approximately $1,000,000 if Aboott would $ta,y on. Eefore, any progress 
toward tirmine up this cOl!Jllitment had been m&de, di!ficu.lties arQse in coMection 
with our position vis a vh VOA. On Jgn-us.ry ·11th, CD and Ab't-ott met with everyone 
concerned in the problen in Ed Barrett's c.i'!ice. Out of t.'lis :neeting caoe general 
agreement that tho 1952 Crusade progrm should be considerably reduced in scope, 
which was duly reported to the Crusade Board the followinr, day. Allen instructed 
Abbott to draw up a proposed budget tor scmething under $~,ooo. This Abbott 
did under date ot January 21st and trans:;iitt.ec it to Allen 1li th a letter dated 
January 23rd. 
The budget subnitted, which I believe is in your hands, amounted to ~88,991, 
covering the eleven months from February 1st to December 31st., 1952. (The 
Crusade had meanwhile received on Ja.,uary 11th, on special request, funds covering 
the months o! Dececber and January.) 
It was initially contemplated that the total sum o!' ~-463,991 shC1Uld be transferred 
to the Crusade in a lump. It then de,.!:!cped that .because or fiscal year problena 
five-elevenths, or !222,270, would be tra:1s!erred i.cmlediat.ely. 
Within a week or so from January 23rd, Abbott recei~ed telephonic approval £rm 
Allen of the $h88,991 over-all, with $222,270 to be trans!erred in a lump sum. 
Early in February, Crusade was r.civised it wculd be more convenient for you to 
transfer just the February allotr.ient anc! post?one t.~e lu:::;, S\.:11 pa~ent until 
Marc:h. On advice, we therEii'ore mad1J formal i:-e<.uest for ~,I.SL fer February on 
February 19th. This pa;nnent was received by us on )larch Jrd. It. is the only­
installment ._.e have received against tr.e total (eleven~ont..'i) Crusace 1952 ·red.get. 
Duri~ ~ ti-ip be!Dre last, I received Yerbal reas~ra.'lce ~:at t..'.e balance ot 
the five-conth fi£ure would be for+..hco,~~. This t.'ien is t.o ur.re ytiu to put 
this in line for attention as soon as possible. 
To recapitulate, this is a roqu~st specifically !or $177.816, representing 
'41&,~~ a month !or March, April, 1,•ay, and June. 
Sincerely yours.
