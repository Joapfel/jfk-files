G. Very early in C'.!!" rcletionii>hlp Q ~id t.r.at ne would like 
t.o Ja&ke a career in Y.!-'BA.'if., outsicie now, pgrha. ., insir.:.e so.-.:ie day. He 
woulci ;;o~ in PB?~IE., or abro,;.d. There was no :lndic:iti.o.:1 the::, a.'ld 
has beE:;n none since, that he reE:3rds the prese~lt :-:..1.ati:mship as a 
distastef;tl. one to ~ terminated as soon as condit:.o:,s per::dt. 
Ee would like to settle in en expatriate 1s paradise, such as 
Paris or ::.a:e, pres1l:'..B.bly involved in jou.rr.ali;;c. a:xl o-:.her 'rlri t::. • .g. 
If be corill do these things in connection 'dith bis work ror.,us, so 
much t.he better. 
H. Q is conscious of the need ror sec-.i.~it.;r and handles hiDselt vel.1-
as vell. as an amateur could in this cmtext.. 3ut he is far more naive 
about t.ec:.r.i,ues ar.d e~pecially the nuancts of tec~i1ue than rto:iigast. 
wQl].d have expected i.'l on':l '\':ho had ber:n invol·.-ed i.'l the revolutiana...7 
movement !or so long. P.e often needs instru::tion 00 ot'Vio-.1s points, 
and responds quite we~2 to it., the exceptio:, tein1, his clu:nsy·h,;.nd1~~~ 
of t.he s/" ~thod-- ho h an int.e1.lectual and not a tec:nicia.n, end 
Rodigast a-'>simes that he (iLdigast) would not do s.i.ch better, if forced to 
use sane technical system. • • • i 
Q is quite observa."'!t. He will recall a pe::-sonel. remark made to 
him by Ro:iig'lSt. iroi:i one month to the next. His re?Qrts written scne ti:9 
ai'ter the event are thoCO'.lV} a."ld apparently accur2. t-e. 
F.e read A Spy a."ld Eis :-:aster b::, Christ..ophcr lellx, and has 
mentioned it a couple oi' times when a rema:-k by ? .. odigast reminds him 
of SCLT>8thing sa~ in the book. • 
Roiigast doesn I t think that even a f'ter tra.i.."Wlg Q vould be very 
good at tr.ra,.i.ng off surveillance (.ror exa::iple) as m seems too matter 
of fact. to be sl;r, and perhaF5 slight.ly hz;r ~bout ':!hat .:::ight be 
gratuitous behavior (e.g., changing :;ab'..taj t.rain!l or taxis just on the 
assumption that sO!lleone might be followin~ hin). nodigast 1s solution 
is not to .:iepend on \.! ,.'or such thin~, bi.it to a tte::.pt to pla..'1. ceetL"!g 
and staee other operations so as to lli.nbize the need ,'or depender.ce 
on Q • s skill in such areas. After patient briefing •~ does ur.derstand. 
the need fc:- tradecra.rt efficiency, and a.s already noted he folicr.-lS 
t.he advice. 
I. At first Q qas quite concerned about. ::ioney- be needed ~ 
advance for clothes, for travel, etc. His req_uests were really plaints, • 
and he D2-7 have left t_he impression that be thil:ks o: nothi.."lg but :!.<Eley. 
It was the CO!:lplex of a poor bo;r who nE::ver bad anyone he could t.urn to­
despite a scholarship he had to leave a :ine college a1ter a bril.liant 
freshma.'1. yv..r .. Once be received his advance a."ld. ,be'<a."l receiving his =one:, 
at the begi=J.! a rather than at the end of eac:i :::.ont~ anu when he 
z~a ·t he would, rec'aive COCl ':lte ·: pra:ipt.y rei.::ibursement of 
expenses, he began t.o relax. NOlf he suwits accountincs without 
bi.clselt totalling the fi511res or keeping his Olf!l reco:'d (?..od.igast,knovs 
t.bis for he ~ seen Q 15 r.otes), so be ;mist rely on us to tell biJ!I. ho·,1 !!!llch 
he cl.ai::led .:.'or (even aoiigast ;;ould never do that). He is, in sum, relaz!le. 
The sa:ie ease is to be noted in his substantive wo!'k; he suadts 
his reports knowin,~ he ha;; done bL, best, and con'! l.-ell; he accepts 
canpU. ... ents vi.th a very slight nod. :·:hen aodigast. iirst met Q in a hotel 
roa:i, Q had sa::iething o~ the hunted man. He still seecs harried, sll~..J.7 
, nervous at the manent 01 contact, but on the v.?.ole-he is core sure of 
bimseli. 
At t.!'..e outset, Q would ar5',le abo-.it assig J:18nt.s, sa;;..~sting 
aJ.temat.iVC?s, worrying ~bo'.lt not t.aving tbe t~ b;q ~ickets, or enough 
mon97 to pay for them. ?,ow be accepts instructions V"-tbout a lllUI'1!lll1",
