l. The subject report beint c~~. the writer is the 
only person observinr D!.:VUOIIO' ~ "·.:-:·:-.: and hc1s statements 
and commendations which should b\! :-.,fleeted in .':"lis fitness 
report. The contents of this r.,e:a.-c:::-s1ndum will be established 
in DEVUONO's file in other for~ a~ .later date by the writer. 
2. DEVUONO has comnleted dne v~d~ with CUSOG. ·Iri this 
~eriod he has shown a ~;mplete a~d-r:::-actical knowledce of 
paramilitary tec~niGucs and tacti~s. This knowledge is born 
of exoerience and acolica~icn. ~is a~olication of this 
knowledge for KUBAF.i( has resulted in. visible progrese in the ) 
techni~al abilities of CUSOG persc~nel. 
3. He has shared CUSOG respccsibilitics of organization, 
administration·and or.eration.:il ore!:'-aration in a manner to 
follow out KUBARK practices to i_ts· credit. 
4. He carries out clear instructions to the l~tter, 
reflecting a military background. 
S. Contrary to observances ncted in a previous fitness 
report D[VUONO has been found to be anvthing but naive in 
his de.:ilings with PBRUMENS during the ~eriod observed. 
6. His administrative and acccuntinE procedures within 
~USbG arc in order. 
7. Hesitating to call them ~caknesscs, the writer must 
state that DCVUOHO's entire experie~cc with KU9ARK has been 
field experience, usually far out cc a long string of contacts 
into a KUBARK _ihst~llaticn, a fact ~hich has prevented .:i look 
at any of the administrative sice cf p~ramilitary as conducted 
by KUBARK.
