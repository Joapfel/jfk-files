place an obsc•r:-vation post· there, c;.d that po::t was t:he:·e for­
about tr.ree mor.ths after A111DIAN's visit... That was in 1960, 
1961... They watched for thr-ee m::,:-:ths. 'Y.':c surveillance tea.:ns 
had to_be occ 1.ipi ed thece for 24 ho·.::-s ever:-y day. I was there

orally, KOZLOV was saying 'nothing.• J, week passed - 'nothi_!:!g, • 
the r.ext week passed - 'nothing'... I ~hall tell yo 1.i why LI 
didn't mention this to you ln June 196ij. B€cause I had 
occasions where there were many such places, and they were 
vetched for nothing. And it would Just pass away and in a 
month i~ vould be forgotten... So \ie -..aited a month, two, 
three. Nothing. So they l~t it go at that and had forgotten. 
Of cour:-sc, the surveillance team h2d it all recorded, but we 
had forgotten about that in the_F1r3t LAmer1caI.!/ Department ... 
In 1962, I was in the Seventh i_Touris_!;/ Department. I tra~s­
fer:-red in January 1962." 
On the basis of information st:pplied by 1lOSENKO dur:-ing 
April 1964, he was questioned during January and 1-'ebruary 1965 
on ABIDIAN's visit to Pushkin Street. The following, which is 
consistent with and somewhat more cetailed than earlier state­
ments not r:-ecorded here, is taken f~om these 1965 int~rroga­
tions:

- In 1961, while NOSENKO ~as the responsible case 
officer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from the U.S. Embassy 
to a residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow. 
A stationary surveillance post at the E!nbassy saw ABIDIAN 
ltave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the 
Embassy in a chauffeured auto.:lObile, rather than in the 
car he normally used. The su~veillance team assigned 
specifically to ABIDIAN thereupon folloved the car to 
a bookstore. Both Americans entered the bookstore, but 
Richard JACOB, a CIA officer, was apprehended while servic­
ing the Pushkin Street dead drop on 2 NovP.lllber 19620
