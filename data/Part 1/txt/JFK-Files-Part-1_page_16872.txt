3. The GlffiENDt problem.is unquestionably a serious one. We 
are for.warding uncf@~ scp~rate cover copies of several memoranda 
p·reparea ~Y- qERJ-.?iDE. • Ono outlines the history of his -marital 
problems, anot~er ~escribes the current legal· situation, and a 
·ttiir_cl _o.utlincs pri?"po$als for a ·settlement. There is 110 hope of 
reconciliation. The Station's position with Glill.ENDE from the 
$tart' has been. that be mus.t agree to an amicable settlement with 
• bis wif~ in ·oid~J:" to :in~tirif that she- would not feel forced to take 
.. steps which would jeoparda=e the s·ecurity of Station operations • 
.. • For thi1;1 ,Ctoason, the -·Station· insisted from tho beginning that any 
financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account 
the ·fact that be was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and 
that be could not fairly _keep this salary out of the settlement on 
tho grounds that bis wife could make no legal clAim to that 
salary. G~RENDb;1 s wife-V(as_mad~ aware of our position on this, and 
she was grateful, even thoug.b she realized that this arrangement 
was strlct~y informal. The Station fe.lt that GERENDE could not ~ 
allowed to use bis RVROCK salary as _.a wt>apon in the dispute with his 
wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to l'efrain 
from exposing his conne·ct ions. Indeed, events have shown that 
GERENDE's wife is a _vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear 
to her that she, as well as GERENDE, v,ould loso money if he loses 
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for 
his part, would have pr,eferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely 
out of the picture. Eventually, however, be agreed that the Stat.ion 
position was fair, and he said he would conform. 
4. Tho attached memoranda from GERh"NDE are, in the Station•s 
opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station 
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LiiillPTY-19) tee benefit oi the 
doubt, larg~ly_because her description of GERENDE's character 
weaknesses came-as no surprise (particularly his tendeucy to 
procrastinate, even whe·n his marriage was at stake). Early in the 
conflict, LI~MPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked poir.t blank what 
she could tell .her lawyer about GERENDE's salary. She was told 
she could not. me·nuon the RVROCK port ion under any circumstances, 
and that if she told anyone-that GERENDE bad any connectiott with 
L..\'PURE, the connection would be denied and GER.ENDE would be

terminated.' She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it 
meant she wou·ld have to scale her support demands down to the 
level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDE's monthly salary from 
R\'ROCK was ov·er 7 ,o_oo pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos 
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which 
l
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly). . 
Subsequently, LIEACPTY-19 w:1s told th&t the Station would see to it 
tba·t as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he 
would give her the same_proport~on of tllis salary that the courts 
determined should be paid from bis overt income. This, of course, 
was strictly an infor;nal arrangement, one which would stol?.._J:~ 
minute GERENDE stopped rece1.ving a salary. Later, as LI.C:MPTY-19 1 s 
15'osition hardened and lier vlndfctiveness beg:in to rule her actions, 
LIE...\IPTY-19 was remind~d by the Station that the longer it took fo1· 
.an a!llicable sorution tci be reached, the greater was the chance 
·:that GER.ENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him 
··arrested (which s~e succeeded 'in doing twice), his job would be 
je·opardized. While she continued to repeat sweetly that she bad no 
intention of-causing his terminati..on, and had never breathed a 
word to·a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in 
fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost bis job, she and the 
children, as well as GlffiENDE, wo~ld lose income. lier attitu1e is
