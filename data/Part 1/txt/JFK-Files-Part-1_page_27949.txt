--1. As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over 
r~sp·onsibility for release or denial 0£ DOO documents -under 
the Frec'dom o-f Information and, Pr.ivacy' Acts. The experience 
has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the 
issueJ in tran~ition from·a totally classified past t~ ~ new 
in~elligcnce environment yet to be defined. The t~nsion in 
lJw between ptotoctiqn of sources and methods and more open 
gov~rn.ment was_ apparent, da-i-ly, to those involved; s.:ood case • 
law was fuade ·as v~ ~ougfit to adhcr~ to both principl•s and 
to regain, through this procesj,· some credibility for t~e 
Agency. • • 
2. I've tried in the past to convey _my ap~reclation 
for the truly magn1ficent support I got from what is now 
the '1rivacy arid Information Action Group, through recorrunenda­
tlons for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI, 
through QSI'.s. and promotions, and through personal comment. 
All hav_c. work~d long hard hours and ~11, those now in PIAG 
and thojc~ho have lcfti d~serve credit for their profcisioual 
efforts in this arena; I wan~ to express my thanks to you for 
the a~sistance your people gave to me as the 000 Information 
Revie~ Officer.

recent ~rrivals, I w~nt to cxpre~s particutar and very 
personal thanks to Win Brown, Cis Cass, Lou Dube, ·Mary Felton, 
Doris LeBaron, Fred McC:ann, Karen Rice, llelen Stilson, Jon
