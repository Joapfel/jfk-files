SUBJECT: Nestor Antonio MORENO Lopez (AMICE-27) (201-312091) 
1. MORENO was born on 25 August 1921 in Havana, Cuba.

plan to overthrow the Castro gov_ernment. They discussed it 
with Jorge VOLSKY, who then passed it to Tad SZULC. VOLSKY 
and SZULC apparently conspired to have the plan presented to 
the "political authorities" (Robert HURWITCH arid the KENNEDY 
Administration) in Washington in order to by-pass the dis-
