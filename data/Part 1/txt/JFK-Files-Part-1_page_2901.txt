Contents of the CHERF.PAa.~OV Package 
The KGB documents in the CHEREPANOV package totalled 
103 pages in the original Russian version, divided almost 
·equally between typewritten reports in final form and hand­
written draft reports or notes, plus two copies of letters 
written by Soviet citizens to the American Embassy. The 
longest single document was a 33-page Top Secret report, 
dated 18 April 1959, entitled "Operational Conditions in 
the U.S.A. and the Activities of American Counterintelligence 
Organs against Soviet Installations and Soviet Citizens in 
the U.S.A. in 1957-1958". The report was signed by Colonel 
A. FEKLISOV, [alias FOMIN, the former KGB rezident in 
l·lashington]. whose title is given as "Chief, First [American] 
Department, First Chief Directorate". The rest of the 
documents refer to KGB coverage of various American Embassy 
and American diplomats in Moscow during the· ·period August 
1958 to 15 October 1960. Most of the documents were prepared 
by or for one senior case officer of the Embassy Section, . 
First Department, Second Chief Directorate, Major V. KUSKOV. 
(NOSENKO has identified V.A. KUSKOV as an officer of the 
Second Chief Directorate who shared an office with CHEREPANOV 
from about 1958 to 1'961.) Two reports were on Americans who 
had left the Soviet Union, Edward L. KILLHAM., Second Secretary 
from July 1957 to July 1959, and Wallace L. LITTELL, Attache 
from June 1956 to July 1958. There were operational plans
