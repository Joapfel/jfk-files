ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (SUPPORT) 
_Security Office 
We recommo.nd that the burden on the Security Office for 
support of the DD/P be reviewed (see DD/P section). In the 
meantime, we believe that a careful look at the Security Office 
ls ncceasary to insure that the volwne of work it h carrying 
ls not ln any way jeopardizing it ■ primary responsibility of 
' insuring that every'poseible measure is taken to keep the Agency 
secure. 
We· recommend that all security clearances be centralized 
undor tha Of!lcte of Security: e.g., clearances that are issued 
by DPD, OCI, NPIC, and other Agency components. While we 
would leave the policy of granting clearances with the appropriate 
officials, we believe that the Office of Security should maintain 
a centralized index for special clearances and do all of the 
processing of these clearances. 
Audit Staff 
We recommend that the Inspection and Audit Staff check 
regularly on activities in ili,~):~ti'~-~~plant which are of vital 
, 
concern to the Agency.
