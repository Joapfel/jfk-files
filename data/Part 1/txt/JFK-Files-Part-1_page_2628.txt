(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS) 
which took place between 1953 and 1957, but he was not sure 
that the operation actually resulted in a successful recruit­
ment, as was alleged in the study. 
Comment: Edward Ellis SMITH (a redhead), Embassy 
Security Officer (and CIA employee) from 
July 1954 to June 1956, reported to the 
Ambassador on 5 June 1956 that he had received 
four letters from the KGB. The first, 
received on 2 June 1956, enclosed incriminating 
photogra~hs of himself and his Russ~~n maid and 
requested him to come to a personal meeting 
with KGB representatives outside the Embassyo 
When he did not do so, SMITH subsequently had 
received three threatening letters. In 1 reporting the matter to the Ambassador, SMITH 
admitted having been intimate with his Russian 
maido SMITH was recalled from Moscow on 
8 June 1956, and he left CIA employment a year 
later. When interviewed in March 1962 on the 
basis of the GOLITSYN information, SMITH 
admitted that he had maintained his affair 
w~th the Russian maid during most of the time 
of his Moscow assignment, 20 July 1954 to 
8 June 1956, and confirmed that to help her 
he had in fact passed unclassified information 
through her to the KGB for many months. 
NOSENKO clearly ascribed the SMITH operation 
to the period when NOSENKO was in the American 
Embassy Section, in 1953-1955. SMITH's state­
ment that he rep~rted the blackmail attempt to 
the Ambassador in June 191.§. is confirmedo If 
NOSENKO was~ ag he ·says, transferred to the 
Seventh Department in 1955, he could not have 
played any role in the KGB approach to SMITHo 
If he played such a role, he was in th~ Embassy 
Section in 1956, not in the Seventh Department 
as he claims. If he played a role in'the SMITH 
case as well as in the Seventh D~part~ent 
recruitment of[!'URG!] (see P• 115), it remains C/o 
possible that tie was neither an officer Ln the 
Embassy Section nor Seventh Department and was 
acting in some other KGB capacity. •
