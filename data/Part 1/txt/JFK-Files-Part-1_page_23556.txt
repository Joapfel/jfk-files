On i1ednesday 18 !iovember 1953 subject ,ras introduced to Jot,_'1 Heyn. 'Ihe 
introduction Y;as de~ed advisable, inas.."!Uch as it would p!'obably facilitate 
sibsequent meetinrs in Buenos Aires 'l"tlere it is anticipated that subject will 
be operating, providing his visa is groited. • 
BIRl.DIAL indicated r.e had not heard from· the Areentine Embassy of Costa 
Rica., hence is planning to have his rife Tirite to follow this matter ~ately. 
BIRADIAL.nentioned' the fact that his wife's relatives, ·and with whan he 
may d~~u when he first moves to BLenos Aires, may be in a position to assist 
in obtaining a -nsa for subject. Ile indicated t.-iat having a native of the 
country rend.er SOJ:le assistance in t:ds reeard may be the solution to any possible 
difficulties. It apµears logical, ho'.'l'ever, he was inf"ormed not to make any 
approaches at this tiu.e. 
He ag?!n noted that inaS?lluch as it will be necessary to stop in Costa Rica 
to pick up his visa when granted, he sugr.ested the possibility of leaving for 
Costa Rica shortly following the teroination of his covert tr;,ininr,. AB previously 
indicated he felt that his presence in Costa Rica, where he can plausibly r.aintai.:l 
himself and his fan:ily, and where he r:.ay be in personal touch with the Argentine 
imbassy., may be to his advantage in securing his visa. 
On 2h Noveciber 1953, subject called to infom he had received a letter 
.fra:i the Argentine Eroassy in Costa Rica informing him his visa had been denied. 
He infon:ed he still felt he could obt.a:in it but it r,,.ay be nE:cessary to seek 
assistance from his wife's relatives in E~enos Aires or it cay be necessary to 
go back to Costa Rica for a short period to finalize the matter. Too, he 
sugge:.ted that in the event he cannot obtain the appropriate permission to enter 
Buenos Aires the AE,ency may desire to send hil:t so~e where else ·in Le.tin Ar.:erica., 
possibly Cuba (he t:entioned specifically) or • some other coW1try. In thiB 
connection, he felt that c6ver-,,,;ise he and his family would be in a =ore secure 
position ii' t.'..ey Wt:J:·e in Costa Rica imile amiting placement. 
I plan. to see EIRADIAL on 25 liovember 1953.
