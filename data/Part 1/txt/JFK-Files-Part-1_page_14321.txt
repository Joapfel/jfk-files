e. · To assess M'.AUT0-1 's feelings t6ward 
the United States and toward h·is own government. 
f. For S,HIKO to talk favorably about the 
United S~atcs usinG himself as an cxamplc,(the 
son of • iir.migrant parents who made good in business); 
to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone 
with imagination, ambit~on and aggre~sivencss~ 
g. If the opportunity prescritcd its~lf, 
to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the 
Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton 
sugar goal and to ask whethe_r the non-fulfillment 
·of this• goa,l would adversely affect the economic 
development of Cuba. It was our hope ttat some­

volunteer to discuss his country~s economic 
· situation _which might have opened the conversation

were trying to draw out iHlz\t!fO-l's personal analysis 
~f the U.S. position vis-a-vis the ~ar in Vietnam 
and to compare his statements with ·the Cuban Gove·rnment 
po_sltion . 
J. Although. SA~.!KO was determined to see ,HL.\lTf0-1 even 
if' he had_ to camp outside A~L-\l'T0-1 's home, we reminded hir.t 
that b~causc of A~t.\lIT0-1 's posit ion, he mtl:ht refuse to see
