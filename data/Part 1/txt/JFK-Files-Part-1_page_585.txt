and resultant li~iicd time a~ailablc for Committee matters 
plus other factors, it might be possible.to handcarry 
selected KCIA documents io the SSCI for reading by. 
Mr. Kramer.· This office objected on th6 giounds of ·the 
sensitivity of the material, the ground rules established 
for the Congressional (and D0J) review of this material 
'· 
by staffers and the proble-s which could be. caused by 
exceptional treatment .bein~ ~£forded to one.Committ~e or 
staffer. Mr. George Cary provided the compromise_. solu~ion 
which is acceptable to all p~itics, to wit, that Mr. Garbler 
invite Mr. Kramer to the Agency for lunch after which time 
he would review the requested ~aterial in the Head~uarters 
buil~ing-. (ESVidal) • 
4. MEETING dF SSCI STAFFER AND DDO: At Mr. Hal 
Ford's request a luncheon meeting-with Mr. William Wells 
• h~s been scheduled for 26 October. Mr. Ford is researching 
_material fer a study on Chiria reporting and wishes to 
discuss this ·s~bjcct ~ith Mr~ Wells due to his extensive· 
background .and experience in f;ast Asian affairs. '(ESVidal) 
5. ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTEE: Counsel.G. Robert Blakey 
met with DO,. DOA/Security and 0LC representatives to 
determine how he mi~ht frame his requirements to best meet 
·our· capabilities. ·His efforts appear to be aimed at the 
possible CIA role ~ith the Mafia, and a double Mafia role 
with Castro. He has information which implies that 
Trafficantc was playing both sides. The JG, particularly 
Scott Breckenridge., has responsibility for the Bill Harvey 
asso~iation and the analysis of the Schweiker report. 
Blakey has agreed that.DO will concentTat.e initially on 
the Bayo-Pawley afL1i r and the "Soviet ·nefector" cover 
oj1eration. Non identified informants have told him that 
Col. "Rep" Robertson was involved. His queries.are 
logical, _managcab-lc, and, if we can keep his requests to 
Specific people or events, we should be able to respond 
to his requirements. (It would be, in O\Ir opinion, an 
excellent idea for the ADDO to mc_et informally with Blakey 
over a :luncheon. This would be useful in giving Blakey a 
pi_cture of .HIW/\VE, hut also .it would perhaps·givc Blakey 
a perspective on his.own terms of reference. (JDl\'alker)
