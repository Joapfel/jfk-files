Rico left Panama for Venezuela on 22 October 1963. 
Travel ~o~ords contain no information on tho arrival of any 
person with the name Armando Conte during tho period in question, 
and tho narno is believed to bo a pseudonym used by Rico. It 
is interesting t,o noto that two VAN sources. identified the 
visiting Moxican Journalist by the name of Rioo or Risco; 
however, oo PDP sourc·o ha a reported thn t name-, and SoW'.a 's 
comments as reported in paragraph .2 tend to indicate thnt ·the 
vied tor concealod his identity from tht'I PDP.
