(Proposal for A&E Assessment of Potenti~l 
#90~KIN Agent Candidates) 
1. Reference is made to my previous memorandum pertaining 
to the proposal to initiate a change of policy w:i.th respect to 
the processing of potential REDSKIN Agents. 
2. • As will be noted, it was initially recoI!lr.lended that 
potential RErSKTN Agent candidates be provided with· an AR...:E 9-ssess­
ment by OTR prior to disclosure of Agency interest in them and 
prior to the disclosure .of any class:i.fied information.•. This 
assessment will be conducted utilizing a ~~nofficial cover)2,;rt· 
was initially suggested that TSD1s Psychological Assessment '1 
Associates .finn now ilsed by Dr. GITTINGER be used for this purpose. 
If the A_R.£ ass.essment we're favorable, Security ·would be requested 
to conduct a full investigation of the Subject and he would be 
subsequently contacted under alias CIA credentials. At that point, 
he would be requested to perform a mission for us and would be 
given requirements f9r same if he agreed to accept such assign.ment. 
3. Attention is invited to the attached memorandum dated 
8 February 1961. •••• A copy of this r.:€rnorandum 1-as· furnished to 
the writer with the verbal request tr.at credit checks be conducted
