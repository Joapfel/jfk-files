MAHOhi:Y arrivi«i. io Moscow on 4 October .1960 as the 
Asslstant General Set-"\· ices Officer at. the U. s. Em!>assy. 
His specific CIA mission there was to support the handling 
of PENKOVSKIY inside· the Soviet Union. l!AHO~EY lived in 
America House. From t:hc sta.rt cf his tour he wa!; active in 
. his attempts to facilfgtize hi~self ~ith Moscow and he 
frequently toured various areas of the city on foot. In 
checking locations connected wit~ the Pf.NKOVSKIY c_ase, 
MAHONEY went to the Pusbkin Street dead dr<>p location on 
two occasions during ·-November and Decel!lber 1960, and he 
made a thorough examination of the dead drop itself as 
well as of its related signal site on 21 Janua~y 1961. 
Throughout, !i1AIIONEY was subjected to in tensi1:e . .,KGB surveil­
lance. In a report dated 25 October 1960, MlIDL\N com­
mented on this as follows: "I find this type of coverage 
(five surveilla11ts on a recent trip to the barber shop) 
completely out of character with that which is usually 
given a new arrival of sirnilac rank. ~Y only 1n1erence 
is that the KGB has at least strong :::;uspicions of MAHONEY's 
primary role [CIA officer!. As for surveillance on my-
self, it continues to be occasional and extremely discreet." 
George BLAKE, the KGB pcnecration of :,!J-6, was arrested 
in London on 11 Apl'i l 1961. l11 his confession he said that 
he had passed the KGD a master list of the names of persons 
connected with the joint U.S.-BJ'itish project wi.th which 
,MAHONEY had been connnected in Frankfurt, &s ;vcl 1 as other 
materials on this project. On this basis, ''AHONEY was 
relieved shortly thereafter of further duties connected with 
support of the PEJiKOVSKIY open ti on; he was withdrawn froca 
Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.
