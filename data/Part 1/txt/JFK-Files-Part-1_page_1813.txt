We are concerned about Agency relationship11 with the White 
House insofar as handling of intelligence matters ie concerned. We 
would like the opportunity to discuss thia with you orally before 
framing recommendations. 
Research on International Communism 
We are concerned about the reported inadequacy of research 
done on International Communism. At the presel}t time some is 
( done in ~e DD/I area in both OCI and ONE, some is done in the DD/P 
area in the International Communism Division of the Counter Intelli­
gence Staff, and some is done in the State Department in the Special 
C . 
Studies Group of INR. The DD/I expressed himself as believing 
this was sufflcienUy covered. The Chief, CI Staff believes it ia 
insufficiently covered. Representatives of the Departnient of State • 
urged that greater expertise be brought to bear on the subject. 
Inasmuch as it will fall squarely on the shoulders of the DCI i£ not 
enough is being done, we urge that the matter be reviewed by the DCI 
at an early date to satisfy himself that all necessary research in this 
field is ·being accomplished.
