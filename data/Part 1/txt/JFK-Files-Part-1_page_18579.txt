I he_?rti:ly endorse this reco~'menihtion th~t-Mr~ I_llcks be· 
promoted to GS-14. A:; hi::;·•s'upervisor points out, Mr. Hicks, 
when he came. to the InteHig:ence Watch, was essentially a 
<flerrilla warfare field operation3l officer. Po::;itive inteUl­
gence information reporUng q.nd the handling of reports were 
~ew·to him~ and called for professional skllls and other 
qualiti~s radically different from those which most of his 
previous ex.1-'erience had brought into play. Yet in a relatively 
short time, Mr. Hicks has-developed the skills required of a 
Watch Officer, and th~s. to this and to at.her ·strengths has 
become one of the most valuable ciiicers ln the unit. . '
