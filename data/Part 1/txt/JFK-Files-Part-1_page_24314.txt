A different cover for a move to Rome might be developed, 
but ~that of a Maoist developing new cells. Rome Station is glad to 
have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever 
he visits, but would they want him permanently? ? 
c. Substance: More generally, QRPHONE cannot just simply 
show up and start forming nuclei •• there !!:!, already Maoist nuclei •• 
the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they_ may be) 
that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help. 
If he were to have something to offer them -- money, preferably --
they might welcome him with open arms. Otherwise he will encounter 
built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all 
over again. 
d. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual 
Maoist??), QRPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he---,'\ 
has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved i 
with is Manchanda's insignificant group -- and even with that be has 
1 
never carried a placard, and I doubt if be bas even helped them with 
making up a placard. He bas helped them with their press releases, 
leaflets, etc. In short, with the written word, not the deed. By 
nature -- which we must also t~e into consideration·-- QRPHONE 
ls no longer a "doer" -- if be ever was one. And I doubt very much 
that be can at this stage in bis life become a "doing" radical. We would 
be misusing bis natural talents, ·which could still serve us well, in 
favor of dubious undertaking. 
In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have 
QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet 
material. I cannot judge if that -would be worth the cost ($40, 000??) 
to Rome, but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about the "Andy Ness" 
/ operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility 1 
in a sophisticated European community. 
,. 
e. Book Dispatch Sale: Shopping him around to the European 
Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place, 
any Station likely to have a use for,.¢\~ is already extremely well up 
on QRPHONE' s background. There are only three Stations really
