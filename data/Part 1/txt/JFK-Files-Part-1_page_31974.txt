SF.CTION C NARRATIVE CC~NESTS 
Ile h_andles __ a contra.:-t a~t'nt 1oho, in turn, handles a low 
level penetration of the orthodox communist pa1·t--y. This 
marginal asset is kept on the payroll at a modicum cost for 
the purpose of filling gaps, and for spotting, until better 
coverage can be devcloreJ. The contract agent, 1ohosc 
administration is almost identical to that required for a NOC, 
also produces informition on the extremist target through his 
marital connections. • 
Also haildlcd under Dutr No. 1 is a high level 11\ember of 
a legal political party of socialist pcrsuasjon, which has 
traditinally demonstrated a propensity for cooperation with 
the commun-i·ia~s···and/or extremists in Nicaragua. This p:iid agent 
produced twenty eight ··int.ell igence reports with a Value Quotient. 
(VQ) average of 4.07 civer thi$ period. This agent, handled ' 
directly, requires.and receives ~lose and alert guidance. He 
has provided val~able spot%ing inform:ition, which the Case . 
Officer has followed up. accomplishing the full cycle of assess-· 
ment, development ·and s~ccessful recruitment of a meiber ~f the, 
communist youth orjani:ation, who will be targetted against bot~ 
the communist youth, the orthdox party; and hopefully, into 
_the FSLN (terrorist organi:ation.) 
Acting upon~ lead from ERl~TCHET-2, a former media asset, 
this Officer also contacteJ, assesst'd, developed and recruited 
a student who was formerly with the· Revolutionary Students 
Front (FER-support arm of the FSLN terrorist organization.) 
This asset is being targetted against the FER and FSLN. 
Considering the paucity of leads available on the elusive 
but important FSLN tar~rt, (a Priority 1 Objective of the 
Station), these two recent recruitments are judicd to be very 
significant achicvemt'nt~. attributable to this Officer's 
lnn,uage fluency, sincerity, experience and style, which makes 
it all look easier than it really ls.
