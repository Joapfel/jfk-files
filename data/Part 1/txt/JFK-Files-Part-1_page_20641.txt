I thought you would be. pleased about.a refcrencti to you whic~ 
came up in tho.courst! of a longish com·ersation last night with 
Dr. Hector G.lrcia-Godoy, former Frcsid,mt of the Dominican 
Republic and now :\mba1111ador here, about the turbulent eventit 
in his country three years a8o• 
"You know," ho said, "looking back o\·er those months when 
things seemed pretty bleak, two namcs·comc immcdiat~•ly to mind 
as able and effective rcprc1wntat1vcs of the Unite<l States. They 
are Ellsworth Bunker anJ David f'hillips." 
·1 thought such a pleasant echo of a rough period would help 
heal your ulcers,
