Tho fir,.::t few mcetinr,s at that th~2 (late _lio\'e::ibcr and early 
Decoi:bcr) wore arranged by fl-:RN/\W by tclcp!lc:!c to LIE:IT?T'/-4 and 
primarily concerned Lllla>TY-4's repo1·ts on G1:i11:::m1~•s family problc□s 
and related security ~rrangements. Since mid-December,- LIJ:::.:PTY-4 
resul!led a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at 
pre-arranged sites and th1es. Lii;'.::PTY-4 has been civen a special 
extension in the Station to which he-111ay call ri.s "Dr. Carlos" to 
leave a eessnge for "Victor" (FJ.::IC{ALD).. FI:ru;ALTJ can chanr:e • 13:eetiog 
plans by diree;tly calling LIE!JP'fY-4. Th<J only personal problem 
directly involving LIE:.n>'rY-4 wa.n sur(~ory on his knee which required 
his wcarin3 a full cast on his leg for over six weeks. During 
this periou _when l,IE'..!PTY-4 has bc:en unable to drive, FF.I:lfALD has 
been cceting LIE:.lP'l'Y-4, for tho exchange of LIC\LLA/LILYHIC films _ 
and prints,at LIF.J.!PTY-4 1 s office, under n suitable pretext and with 
appropriate security precautions. LIEl,IPTY-4's services aro 
invaluable a ince the Station could not, on a co'ntinuing basis,

SECURITY

personal problems, there have been no security problems during tho 
reporting period. 
FtrrURE PLANS 
J 11. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion 
, that be must be terminated. This is not an easy deci~ion to cake, 
I nor will it bo: easy to confront Gr:m:JiDE'with this decision. lle

as noted above, in spite of bis talents the Station has been able 
- 1· .to ,get'•O:tlong without bis services~ FurthcriJo.rc, the con. s_tant 
security risk posed by his wife is, franklyi an unacceptable risk. 
To try to molify her. by promising her a portion of his salary is 
• probably _unworkable ·in realistic terms, particularly since her • 
attitude has progressively hardened.· The Station, .therefore, 
ir.tends tp terninate GERD.1lE prior to tho end of FY 1970. GZRENDE's 
contract calls for a teniination bonus of one month's salary per 
full year. This would cO!!le to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons, 
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by 
ensuring that the termination is acicable, it will probably be 
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GF.RENDE about $10;000 
(USD). Furthermore, it will be· necessary to inform Lll:,;.tPTY-19 of 
the termination, and,· to keep her from revealing what she knows, ,. 
she w_ill undoubtedly have to be giv~n·some :!loney herself. The • 
Station does not -believe that it would bcequitable or s:>und from 
a. security point of view to use the moneywhicb GERENDE himseH·has 
carried for this purpose. Therefore, while tho figure Vlill remain 
negotiable, the Station believes that the·slll:l of $2,"500 (USD) 
would be a reasonable a~ount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in. 
the_ LIE.IPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than 
$33,000 _(USD). The Project has been approved in the a:aount of 
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It_ 
is therefore requested that the LI~TY·Project be aoended for 
FY 1970 to provide an additional SS,000 (USD) .to be- used in the 
GEREIDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.
