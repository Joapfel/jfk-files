ORPHONE/1 
Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not 
be operationally advanugeous to have him switch roles, for he 
cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time. 
He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could 
not cope as effectively with a new one. 
Conclusion: 
Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive 
individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency 
by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted ·and liked; 2) a material­
istic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyal­
ties, i.e., the far left or radical moveme-.at in this country. 
Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life 
history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his 
future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances. 
One statement that can be made is that, given his personality, 
it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances. 
But if not personally involved with someone from this agency 
who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look 
elsewhere for bis need satisfactions.
