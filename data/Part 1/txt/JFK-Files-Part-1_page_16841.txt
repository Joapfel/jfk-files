PRODUCTION 
7. KDLITERAL: Be'fore being closed down, KDLITEAAL, through 
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover­
age of PCS and TDY •MHHARSHers. He provided an average of three rolls 
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his I 
visual .observation of the target area. 
s. 1'0.1\BSINTHE: Operated by KOFACTOR-5; KDABSINTHE produced an 
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source.for 
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially \ 
"WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR 
was also our main source of information on Ml~HARSH license plate~ • 
and automobiles. ! 
9. In adgi tion, KDLITERAL and KDABS INTIIE both provided de tailed 
"attendance sheets" on all MiHIARSH personnel. With the loss of this 
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identit)· personnel assigned 
to the MHHARSH installation or to rr.onitor their daily ll':OVements in 
and out of the compound. The two surveillance point::; also provided 
periodic photo studies of the ~U!HARSH installation itself with empha­
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi­
tions made to the communications antenna system.
