especially his current whinink for trncJo openings with thou. s. as 
opposod to pust claims that u. s. sugnr purchnsus k(Jpt Cuba in a state 
of colonialism. Much· wns mado of tho remark of the Nicaraguan de le­
gato to the UN that Guevara's addrvss on bC!half of Cuba was a Russian 
speoch with an Argentina accont. It was nleo noted that "Che"_ admittbd 
Cuba's support of th.o terrorism in Vonozuela. 
d. Cuba's worsening economic situation wa~ as h~rctofor~, a 
constant theme. Featured this month worv tho obvious failures of the 
foraging trips of Carlos Rodriguez and ''Cho" Guevara, and· a host of • 
specific examples of mntorial shortages admitted by Cub'1n public media. 
e. The Martinez Sanchez suicide and tho lack of precise· dotail , 
oxpocially in its aftormnth 1 got considorablo attention in AMSCROLL 
propaganda, along with other notos on GOO strife. 
• _ f. The Sino-Soviot rift was expected to continuet ac~ding to 
AMSCROLL, and the situation doos not bodo woll for Castros relations 
with the now K1·cmlin leaders. Examples taken from press clippings. 
g. The CT\' bo.ycott against free-world ships trading with Cuba 
was favorably noted as nnothor facot of tho tightening of the noose 
around Fidel's neck. 
h. End-of-year broadcasts centered on the decline of Communis 
after a half century it still fails to improve the living standards of 
the peoples engulfed, but instead increases terror and oppression to 
forge the populations into automatons for use in the r~alizatiou of 
its mad dream of world conquest. 
4. Among letters rocoived during the month wa•s a request from 
P:i.lo Alto., California for a complete set of AMSCROLL publications for 
the Hoover Institute 1 s archivos on world revolutions. 
5. AMFRAAIE-11 who is na.v second man in the AMSCROLL Propaganda 
Ser.tion by dint of his demonstrated imagination and initiative, came 
up with a proposal durin~ the month to test reaction to printed 
materials being sent to Cuba. Implemented immediately, it consists 
of a small coupon which accompanies each item mailed to 151 000 
addressees on a rotating basis each month. The total is divided into 
four groups for sample purposes, each group being asked to respond to 
requests for general, readily available information on the basis of 
different stimuli, either to have tho respondent's code name announced 
over the radio or just listed among the "many" others who are contri­
buting to the effort to overthrow the Castro regime. Theoretically, 
the assistance would be more fully acknowledged after the liberation. 
on the basis of results achieved dnring the first few 1:10nths1 the 
system will be 1•efined until the most successful method for testing 
Cuban audience reaction is found. A report will be submitted when 
sufficient returns are in. The AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report, 
attached, contains further details and a sample of the coupon. 
6. We were pleased to receive EGFA 43043 which credited AMSCROLL 
propaganda with a minor IIH\'IPER score on a West German firm which \\"ns 
doing business with Cuba. Evidently a number of free-world firms are 
disturbed in the same \\'SY by AMSCROLL's t-<abre-rattling letters on the
