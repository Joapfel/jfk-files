on rather shor -.;mJ,i named ~"la • • 
Acting D/COS. He served in this capacity from early 
April µntil hie departure on 16 June 1965. 
2. ,Within a matter of days he was performing 
the assigned duties in a superior manner. lie moat 
certainly demonstrated s~und judgment, dependability 
and mature tolerance. The latter is an e'ssential for 
the daily problems unique to any post type _service. 
3. As to his executive or leadership qualities 
I believ_e .. I can -save several paragraphs by stating 
si~ply that within ~~eek of assuming his new assign­
ment I left on a ~-day ·rny and wilhin 30 days de-
parted soµth for ·over 3 weeks- and in each case departed 
with al>tiolute assurance the Station was in good hands, 
and -it was. 
4. I would appreciate it if this document could 
be passed to Chief,' KUSODA and if appropri.11te a copy 
placed in his personal file. / /7
