NOSE~KO was asked in Geceva in 1964 ~hether hu was 
involved in the arrest of ~n J',_-narican- to'..lrist in the 
USSR in the fall of 1963. Almost at cnce, NOSE~KO 
identif~ed the c~se as that of Bernard KOTEN, a guide for 
Afton Tours in l~ew· York City ( and hence an employee of 
Alexander SVE~ClihN~K!Y, s.::e a'::lovel who had been arrested
