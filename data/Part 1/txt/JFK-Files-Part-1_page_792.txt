1/ 5. I· asked some clarifying questions on the OAS report 
of a possible demonstration against the OAS Assembly in Santo 
Domingo in June 1970. He said that Rolz-Bennett normally 
maintains contact with the OAS Deputy Secretary General 
Urquia, who is a close personal friend and is also a Central­
American. The head of the UNDP office in Santo Domingo is 
Hugo Navegas. He has been asked to get the information on 
the possibility of such a disruption. 
6. Victor Paz Estenssoro, is one of three experts picked 
up under an OAS contract with the University of Engineering 
in Lima. In actuality, Paz will receive a P-4 salary from 
the OAS. The project is up for board approval and will last 
at least a year. 
r;:r· I 7. ~SLAB/l}went on at length on the difficulties between 
Miss Alexander, the former Bolivian ambassador to the OAS whose 
parents w_<pre murdered in La Paz, and Sanj ines. In brief, Miss 
Alexander'was accompanied to Washington by a catholic priest 
Father Eduardo. Sanjines offered to find him lodging in a 
Washington monastery, but he demurred. Whenever Sanjines 
called Miss Alexander during crises in Bolivia at early morning 
hours the father would answer the phone. He also helped with 
Miss Alexander's work at the OAS and was around the Embassy 
office. Sanjines once found them doing some research in his 
files. Colonel BUnzer, when assigned to Washington, said 
that there was an intelligence report that Father Eduardo 
had been involved with the guerrillas. The military finally 
forced the father to leave the Embassy. Miss Alexander sent 
him $100 on which to live. When her parents were killed he 
reappeared._ When Miss Alexander returned to La Paz she read 
a written report submitted by Sanjines on her affair with 
the priest, and when she came back to Washington she called 
up Sanjines.and told him off. 
8. Sanjines said that his relations with the State 
Department have cooled off. He ·thinks that the nationaliza­
tion of Gulf Oil has weakened the government. There is a 
vacuum in Bolivia and this has caused the present Bolivian 
government to be much more subservient to the United States 
than was the government of Rene Barrientos. He believes, 
however, that his own position with the Bolivian government 
had been strengthened. Sanjines is going to San Jose for 
the presidential inauguration. He heard from Colonel Ayoroa 
that Victor Paz Estenssoro as a personal friend of Figueras, 
had also been invited to the inauguration. Sanjines said 
that it would be interesting to talk to Paz. 'l . .
