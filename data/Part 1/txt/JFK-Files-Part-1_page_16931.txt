The oquipment -: camera, :acopo ~d tripo.-1 •. 1a mounted in one ·bedroom behind

- 5. OE1tflID8' s COOlll!8r'lt. It seems to me .that any caref'ul observation by 
the Sovieto vouid have revoaled the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds 
in both the old and the nev ba.ses. I ·have no doubt that the Soviets realize 
they are under phot9 surveU.lance-. The move by the fMIU,y fl"OIII the old to the 
nev building must surely have been noted by the Soviets. PosBibly the Soviets 
think tbe family is vork.ing vith the local authorities due to LI~-1,•a 
former association with the Mexican Army. 
6. Station COC11ments. The station agrees vith OERENDE that careful 
observation by tho Soviets would have revealed the missins cl..::.t tn the venetian 
blinds and also the fnct that those bl.ir.-lr; nre soldom open. The Station also 
asn-es that tho floviets ren.lizo thllt. th,:-y are under ph0to surveillance. 
This was pointed out recently vhen a :::Oviet shielded Rn LNi:1<00 valk-in when 
tl1s>y passed the front gste of the 0nbnsny anil made a siy,n to ~.he vall:-in 
indicating th11t they could bo seen l,y sooieone watching vi th a teleecop._, 
t'rot11 the buildings across the street. Also, as l!ectlqllf\l"ters is nvare, thel_"e 
hn.v.:- been numerous comments by residents of Mexko City to t.'ie effect tt.at 
anyone entering the Soviet ~rnbnssy io photographed; however, seldOlll ha:, tt 
been rumored that the "Americnlld" are doing it, which might indicate mc,at people 
belteve tho Mexican Ooverrm:ent io doine any such photographing lllld thereby 
re11ffir111ing OEllEND~'s stntomont that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican 
Government runs the base. 
7. Olven the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blovn, the Station at 
this point doeo not plant~ terminate or revamp th~ LILi'TIIC installation. 
A:ny operational ch~e by tho operators would be spotted by the Soviet.a and 
if the Bnse vero cl~sod the Soviets vould start looking for a nev inntall11tion. 
The LILYRIC Base is perfonning a useful function and it is believed that it 
Vill continue to do so. The Soviets nave had opportunities to complain to 
the Maxican Government about being monitored photogrnphic!ll.ly and have not 
seen fit to do so and it is believed that they probably vlll not do so unless 
thero is a radical change in :Joviet an:J./or Mexican policy. The Station has 
instructed G~U:?Wi to tako every precautton du:ing his meetings Vi.th LIOO'!"i-13 
to assure that LI~-13 does not lead the Soviets to him and thereby 
Jeoparoizing other operations, especially LICALLA.

8. The operator of the LIMITE.D !lase, l1El-1PI"{-6, is, to my knowledge, 
the oldest hand in the photo 11urveill.anco of the :.oviet target ar.d poaa!bl,y 
the mcst likely to be "bumed" .. His residence for years at the foJ"ll:er llflse 
(nov the site of the nev LILYRIC building) end his move to the present baee 
co\!ld not have gone wmoticed by the Soviets. His co.~~ is that ot an 
insurance oaleslUl.ll 1 but he actually does not vork at t.he .cover and te ut 
a disadvantage in tryin~ to explain his source of income. At times, in years 
past, he bad 1;o a.fforo full-time coverage from the base, vhich al.l.OW'ed him 
r.o t1:e to ene~~ in credible cover activities. 
9. OERENDE C0111111ent3. I do not believe that LIDIPl'Y-6/LIMITED is a 
security risk; ho.-gver, his present means of working from an open door leading 
.to his balcony probably ctm be spotted by the Soviets. Ln:,(PI'y-:-6 is extremely 
cautious about checking hi1J1Sel.!' for surve~l.lance vhen mak.ir-6 meetings.
