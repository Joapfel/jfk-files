appreciation for an assignment 
of the H 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/ 
Ev~luation Boards from 17 April 
I well'. recognize the complexities involved in the 
comparativc·cvaluation of 560 clerical careerists --
a task_ further cc1~pl icat(;'d by this being only the second 
year ft has 'been ~ndcrtak~n. Your deliberations were 
vital to the Direc~oratc's determination to bring to this 
group of valuable employees the ~dvantagcs of the merit 
systern. • 
Full-time service ~ith the Evaluation Boards 
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's I 
program of personnel assessment and management. Not 
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but 
recolllI:lendations for car~~r development and training 
were also extremely helpful. 
I believe that your ~crvic~ on the Board broadened 
and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of 
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent 
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware 
of our need for complete, careful and candidly written 
appraisals of our employees. 
Sincerely,
