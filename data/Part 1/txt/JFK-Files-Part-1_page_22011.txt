Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations 
Introduction 
Among the numerous KGD activities against American code 
clerks in !l!oscow which !.OSF.~KO has discussed arc five opera­
tions ~herein tha KGB intended or effected aFproaches for 
recruitment/defection ·purposes.. According to NOSENY.O, none 
was succe-ssful. . The fiva. major .cases are reviewed separately 
below, o·ne of the1n in tne context of duty trips abroad by 
NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV.*it-
NOSENKO said that, upon ~.ssuming responsibility for 
supervising operations against American code clerks, he 
found a very_ "difficult situation." Prior to the assignment 
of KOSOLAPO\' to the U.S. Embassy Section in late 1959,· all 
operations against code clc:-ks had been handled by A.S. MALYU­
GIN, but during )1ALYUGIX's two yaars of effort. there had 
beer. no operational approaches and no successes. When 
*The Edmund STEVENS-case is.discussed in Part V.C.2. 
**GOLITSYN on 20 March 19ti2 identified KOSOLAPOV's photograph 
as that of a veteran KGB officer with whom he was personally 
'acquainted. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB 
i& about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a 
member of the First [American] Department oi the KGi3 First 
Chief Directorate under United Nations co\'er in New York City; 
subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the 
First Chief Directorate at KGB Headquarters. According to 
GOLITSYN, .the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferr~d to the KGB 
Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960.in line with .. 
a KGB policy for only married men to be sent abroad. As of 
1960, GOLITSYN said, KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks 
. stationed in the American Embass:y in Moscow. He added that 
KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English. Prior to GOLITSYN's 
identification, CIA had no indication of intelligence acti­
vity on KOSOLAPOV's part~ ~etween February 1953 and April 
1955 he was assigned to the United Nations•Secretariat Trans-· 
lation Unit as a translator;· in August 1958 he bad been an 
interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detection; 
in September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV o,n. his. trip to • 
the United.States (see Part V.E.3.d. which describes the 
role of NOSENKO's target John ABIDIAN in connection with the 
KHRUSHCHEV trip). KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.
