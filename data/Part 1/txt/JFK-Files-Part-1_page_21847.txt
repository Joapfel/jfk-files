United States, and in the earlyeven .. ~g of 12 Febr'.lary he and

thence to a safehouse in the Washington area. 
At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSE;iKO 
met on 14 February with representatives of their respective 
Washington Embassies in the of_fices of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. He told both that he had defected·of 
his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no 
desire to return to the So·.:iet Union. In anewer t.o the questions 
of the Soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and 
rights as a citizen of the USSR. 
CIA completed its i~itial de~riefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru­
ary, and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of 
the FBI for quc:stioning. At about the same cime, there was a 
marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline: He became evasive and 
uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his 
debriefer~, both CIA and FBI: his hightlife in Washington and 
nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bo~ts, crude beh~vior, 
and disputes with his security escort, He explained these 
actions by saying that he was under great tension as a result of 
his defection, abandonment df his wife and children, and the 
disgrace that he had brought to his family name. It ~as against 
this background that CIA acc~ded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca­
tion. On 12 l~r~n, therefore, NOSENKO l~ft Washington with a 
.CIA case officer and two CI.~ security guards for a two-week 
vacation in Hawaii. There his behavior deterioriated still fur­
ther: He drank heavily and almost constantly: he engaged in 
sexual acts with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude 
in pabl'..c places: and he spent money extravagently ($800 on 
one prostitute) and conspicuously (a $100 bill for a restaurant 
tip). 
During NOSE.;KO's absence, cdnsultations were held with 
the FBI concerning steps to be taken to restrict his movements 
and activities. Both agencies feared that his behavior would 
bring abo.ut un...,anted attention and publicity, perhaps police 
arrest, and that doubts about his bona fide~, which were be­
coming known to a widening group of people--rn the ~.s. Govern­
ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself. The 
FBI on l April said it would "not interpose objection" ·to·the 
CIA plan to limit NOSEUKO's freedom of movement. The Acting 
Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House 
were also notified of the CIA plan at thic time. 
In the morning of 4 April NOSENKO was driven to another.• 
safehouse· in a Washington suburb, ostensibly only.for a poly­
graph examination. At the safehouse NOSENKO was given a rou­
tine polygraph examination, lasting over three hours, he
