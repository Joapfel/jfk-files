2. FRAMi OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCARBON-1 
When AM CARBON 72 in t1·oduced AflCARBON-1 to RlroTEMXN, AM...,u ... , ............ , 
reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating 
with REU'l'EMAN.1 Thif:1 review was conducted for AMC.ARBON-l's 
benefit, in otder that he might clearly understand the frame of 
reference which should prevail in his rela•i.:ionships with REUTEMAN. 
In this review, AMCl,RBON-2 pointed out tha·c it was the policy 
of the Iden ti t'y 3 that it would take no ac•cion which would • 
purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations. As 
a result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations 
in South ·Florida dicl come to the attention of the Identity 3 1 this 
material would be bl'ought _to REUTEMAN1 s inunediate attention. 
AMCARBON-2 maqe it clear to AMCARBON-1 that such items should be 
discussed witH REUTEMAN in a frank manner.- In addition, AMCARBON-2 
made the point; that. after an item was disGussed, AMCARBON-1 
should follow/REUTEilAN's guidance relative to how any particularly 
embarrassing item might be l1an~led by the ·cdentity 3 1 so that it 
would not expose KUB.!\RK operafions and, at- the srune time, would 
not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3. 
In addition, 1',MCARBO"if-2 pointed out that, Lf AMCARBON-1 brought 
a potentially emban:assing i tern to REOTEMK~ 1 s attention and 
remedial action on ·che ma tt,~r was not takeL1 by REUTEMAN within 
a reasonable ~eriod of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free 
to expose any ,ineptness on KUBARK 1 s part. AMCARBON-2 pointed 
out that in r~turn for this cooperation from the Identity 3, 
REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be available for contact by 
telephone or period le personal meetings at which Al!CARBON-1 
and AMCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in 
La tin American affa lrs. AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON-•l that this 
arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect ta obtain 
any classified infocmation from REUTEMAN. The point was also 
lllrtde that AMCARI30N-L should not press for the obtaining of 
classified informatlon, but he should be alert to stoering tips 
which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking ne\'ls stories. 
AMCARI~N-1 in~icatej that he understood the frame of reference 
which had been outlined by AJJCARBON-2. This frame ot reference 
has pl'<~vailed throushout JMWAVE1 s relationship with AMCARBON-1 
during the period December 1962 to March lJ)64. 
3. AMCARBON-1 'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER. AMCARBON•-1 originally 
started to work for the Identity 3 in 1957 on the Ci~y Desk, 
and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment 
which entailed covering major political developments in Florida. 
At a later date, AMCARBON-1 became a feature writer :for the 
Id<.::ntity 3. Thon in July or August 1962 1 _AMCARBON-1 was 1!1adE:• . • 
the Identity 4. _'!'his assignment was considered to be a s1gni.f1cant
