MEMO FOR THE RECORD (6 Sept 77, Russ Holmes) 
re meeting with HSCA reps 1 Septembe~ 
''The following topics, given ... response and comments follow each topic. 
"Agency's file on Loran Hall 
Blakey had called the Agency on 30 August 77 asking to see the 
agency's information on Loran Hall. 
Comment: According to testimony given before the Warren Commission 
by Silvia ODIO of Dallas, Texas, three meq, identifying themselves as 
Leopoldo, Angelo, and Leon Oswald, came to her apartment on 26 Sept 63. 
Leopoldo claimed he and Angelo were members of JURE (Cuban Revolutionary 
Junta) and wanted Silvia to meet "Leon Oswald". They introduced him as 
an American who was very much interested in the Cuban cause. Next day, 
Leopoldo called Silvia and said (still according to Silvia) ' ... our idea 
is to introduce him (Oswald) to the underground in Cuba, because he is 
great, he is kind of nuts.' 
In response to a request dated 28 August 1964 from J. Lee Rankin, 
General Counsel of the President's Commission, the FBI initiated an 
investigation to identify the two men who accompanied "Leon Oswald" to 
Silvia's apartment. On 21 September 1964, the FBI informed Rankin that 
the Bureau had identified the men as Loran Eugene Hall and Lawrence Howa1 
"Leon Oswald" was identified as William Seymour. 
Response: The Agency has little information on Hall beyond what is 
already available in overt material ......... "
