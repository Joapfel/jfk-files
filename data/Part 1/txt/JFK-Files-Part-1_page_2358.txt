and other personnel, and changes of personnel, as well as diagrams 
of the offices of the Chief and !)eputy Chiefs of the SCD during 1956 -
1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO 
could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not ---- - -~· •• \ ·--
immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in pa.rt, with a sou:rce 
. . . 
or another officei"· who has defected Sill.Ce mid-1964. Ji these diagrams 
and memoranda. were not relatiyely correct, NOSENKO, who is quite 
.• astute in matters of ~~unterintelligen:ce·, would hardly have voluntarily 
prepared the material in such detail. Th~s type of information is ·, 
. . 
·peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable source or by another 
defector and could, i£ not relatively correct, permit a rather positive con-,. 
clusion that NOSENKO was. lying or fabricating information. 
! NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB 
operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 -1961 1 and 1962 -
1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is 
~s for the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation a.nd attitude 
'".until 195S - 1956, which a.re me~tioned elsewhere, should be given 
consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so 
that his claimed assignment during 1953-- 1955 is considered sufficiently 
substantiated even though his actual job performance undoubtedly 
deserved a low rating.
