There has been no change In Project LIEMPTY which would alter the 
validity of the remarks ·made ln Section Ill of last year's project renewal request. 
IV. PROBLEMS 
The security problem ln connection with the LICALLA-operatlon, which 
was described In last year's renewal request, ls still present but has not caused 
&ny known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion ln HMMW-9736, the LICALLA 
base was reactivated on 29. M;.1y..J961. rn1e rose operator has been cautioned to be 
ever alert for any unusual.incidents which might lndlcate that the base has been 
compromised. This ls the only problem experienced by the LlEMPTY Project 
during the past project year. 
V. PLANS 
The Station considers that the project Is now operating at Its optimum slze 
and does not plan to expand lt during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be 
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational 
arrangements. •
