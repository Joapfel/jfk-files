llB: OKLI\ - 42,-UO, 26 .January 1965 
1. 0a 11 February KUB&BK Staff Agent Errol s. KULPA, who bad 
contact With GIBSOM in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made 
the following comments, which ma:, be helpful to Katzenbach. KULPA 
felt that the GIBSOM that be was bearing on the tape bad indeed 
cbaaged rather radically since the last time KULPA bad any cont.act 
with him or the Revolution. KULPA remeabers GIB80lf as anti-white 
and probably (because of this racial orientation) anti-U.S. KULPA 
is therefore quite suspicious of GIBSOB's motivations and advises 
that extreme precaution be taken in tbe lwldling of GIBSON. 
2. KULPA's view of Gi1Bon1 s aotivatiaos: 
KULPA bas strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation 
on the part of GIBSOJf. Be recognizes the obvious monetary 
motivation and feels that this probably plays a large part 
in the man's being willing to talk to ODYOKE. Another very 
possible motivation is GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES. 
Parenthetically, IWLPA added that in Algiers and probably in 
Paris, GIBSOH was really nothing more than a name that VERGES 
wanted on the masthead. GIBSON's primary duties as "editor'' 
were probably in the area of translation. In light of this 
KULPA feels that perhaps BOIIIG legitimate in.formation of value 
can be obtained in the area of tbe Revolution. Again, paren­
thetically. it might be noted that 'lt1LPA felt that GI!!SO!f 
1ll'ILS not as "ided.istic" as his wife. Where GIBSON might adhere 
to the aspects of Ka.rxism-Leninism that called for revolutionary 
change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world 
in which tho black man bad to eudure a certain amount of 
discrimination), he is not a strict doctrinaire in any of 
his beliefs. 0a the other hand, KULPA pointed out that 
GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by birth-­
not British) is idealistic in the sense that she feels ber 
brand of leftism must be internally and idealogically 
consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSOB's writing 
for Encounter and vb:, she probably would get upset if she 
knew exactly what type of game her husbaad 118.S currently 
playing w1 th ODYOD.)
