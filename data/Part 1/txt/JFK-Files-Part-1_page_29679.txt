Mr. M.tksym.icc also took the J\nny Gcm!r•;d C.lnsr;ification Test, Civfl.ian 
r:r.lition, to f.intl out his ov1_•r,1.U J1!v1•l ofml'11t.1I. ability. _llis score rclie.iJ.cd 
that he exceeds approximately 78 pct·ccnt of adults in general- mental capacity_ 
as mci1s11rcd by thi_s in~tn.un,~nt. 1' safer evaluation of his performance· is 
that he is probably jn the upper 25 percent or adults regarding h.is global 
fotc.l.l igcnce.

On the Michigan·VocalJ~ 12·nfilc Test, ,111 .instrument that attempts· 
to measure a person's iriteJ..1.cct11a.l. i11te1·ests nn w1:.ll as the amount of infor­
mation he.has retained i.n v.ido11H m·eas of knowJedgc, Mr. Mnksyrniec .indicated., 
·when comp·:u-ctl with college f1·e1.;l11ncn, that _he exceeds approximate.Ly 50 percent 
in his h.11owlcd~e of human relnt ions, G9 percent ln government, and 67 percent 
in the pli~·sical sciences. On the lower side, he docs as well or better than 
211 ·p_cl'Ceut· in his familiarity with cnrnmerce, 3.L percent in mathematics, and 
2ij percent in fine arts. 
In order to find out Mr. MakHymiec 's ability to handle Engllsh, a 
basic· necessity for· one to perform well in col.lcgri, he was given the 
Cooperative. D1gl i sh Tests. When cump.:trcd • to coJ.J egc freshmen, he showed that 
he cxcc_ctls fro;n 52 percent to 78 percent in his u11tle1•sta111..ling of vocabulary; 
from 5 to 17 percent in his abiJ.ity to comp1•chend what he reads; from 2 to 
11 percent in his speed of comprdwnsion; and from 18 to 36 percent in his 
overall ability to know and Lmdcrstaml what he reilds under tjmed conditions. 
In his skill to express himself properly in Eng.lish, he exceeds from l to 
G percent of col.Lege freshmen. l\1hen· reading and expression are combined 
into one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec exceeds from 6 to 12 per­
cent of college freshmen in_ hi1, ov12rall us.:igc of r::ng.i.ish. 
The results of.the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymicc has made 
the most of his learning opportunltics both w.ithi.n and outside the military 
service. ,Uthough he completell only eight years of school, he has acquired 
a ·considerable nmount of know.I.edge by observation, rcatUng, and personal 
experience. In spite of his broml experiences and acquired knowledge, it will 
be necessa1•i for h.j.m to improve his reading and writing skills in I.:nglish, 
however,· befo1·c he b"egins cu.Llf!ge emfrscs . .l\lthoug)1 he manifests a high 
interest in engineering and scientific -fields, he should probably not con­
si_rlcr these fields as majors because of his defic.iem:y in mathematics. It 
is believed the skills in English can be tlcvclopell but it is doul1tful if 
the mathc.'lllut ic;:i.l deficiencies can· be overcome sufficiently to major .in a 
scientif.ic area. It is probably advi.sablc, therefore, for Mr. Maks~'llliec to 
cm1s_ider one of the social sc iencc:s as a college major. His background in 
photography and military subjects, combined with a <:allege major in an ap­
propriate s_ocia.l science.,would' probably provide him with the necessary 
qualificatfons to become a geographer or an intelligence .:.naly/st in govern­
ment service. 
It. is understood that Mr. Maksymiec has enrollee' . .in Montogomery Junior 
College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will 
take a special English course concentrating on the funda~cntals of rP.ading
