~, M ~ ,-.prr.,AIAAt,c& 
LA/COG has six op.crations officers performing duties similar to 
tho5c assigned to Mr. florcs--Casc officer responsible for recruiting/ 
han~ling agents directed against a hard target and also staff duties 
as a Desi: Chief. These tasks arc unique within the l.atln America 
OiYi~ion as th~s~ officers serve as field cas~ officers and also as 
tleac. 1 u.arters desk officers. All on- island Cuban agents arc handled by 
these sii e~ployccs. I would rank Mr. Flores in the middle of this 
crou~. but it must be taken into consideration that all the other 
office~s are senior in grade.
