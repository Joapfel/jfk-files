1. The followinK comments are for the information and nssistance 
of tho~c officers who are in the process of determining the future 
of the LIONION operation: 
a. The AMOTs have received and reviewed· a number of tho 
print~ from the LIONION operation and report th~t it 
is a time-consuming and largely unproductive effort. 
b. The prnctlcal results of such a review, i.e., the 
identification of the greatest number of visitors to 
LIHING, can· he rca lized best through the widest cir­
culation of thb'print~ among the AMOT staffers, con­
tacts, and informants. This practice would result 
-c. 
:!.n wide knowledge nf the existence nf the operation,· 
and in the expenditure of many.man-hours which, it 
appears, could be more productively spent in other 
pursuits. 
-
The AMO'f organization currently does not have either 
the qualified personnel or nvallahle space ahd equip­
ment to process the film as suggested in paragraph 
three of rcfcr~nce. Until they move into new quarter~ 
~nJhopef~fly/mid-1968 1 the single AMOT photographer 
will be working in v~ry tight quarters. 
-
2, It would appear from JMW:\VE's experience with AMOT exploitation 
of the LIONION operation, that further activity in this connection 
at JMWAVE would be ·unwarranted.
