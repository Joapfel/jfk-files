SECURITY AND SECURITf-CO~SCIOUS~'ESS 
15. RUIZ se~ms to b~ ~articularly sensitive in the area 
of security-consciousnEss ... -This attitude can possibly be trjces 
to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his

ackground and espGciallr his political views '(sec be-1011) 
woulcl appear to arg-ue. ~g;dnst his .-iffil iati on. RUIZ is ~uick to 
wa:..·n visiting Cub:1ns :a;;;;.inst the efforts of what he tErms "J n 
companfa, socicdad an::,::i;;:a·• • to compromise them, even before­
they leave I!::ivana, indicating RUIZ' possiiJle belief in the 
omnipresence. and power of the sociecla<I anonim;i. He censors mail 
going to and coming fr~ Havann, nncni"c rcpcafcdly states that 
his office is bugi;cd, :Zis telephone is tapped, and th:H he is 
followed quite openly \'.:::.ereve1· he goes. He attributes ttiis 
surveillance to the Sfi=':.!ridad, and he prob;ibly ·ascribes it to 
the Spanish. (Note th~::, clcspi tc his "lrnowlcdr.:-c" that his words 
go to hostile surveill~nc€, he still clarcs to express critical 
opinions openly). 
16. This securit:r.-consciousness is apparently the big 
reason he h;is askccl H!n-ar::a • for funcls for a new Embassy building, 
where he pl·aris to h,n'e 3 shielded room free from bugs. lfe .. intends
