1. Attached find contact and subject reports covering 
activities of KULPA during the month of January 1963. Tbe two 
outstanding characteristics of this project remain a helter­
ak~lter operational pattern and the usual difficulties in 
adminiatraUon. 
2. We can not really blame KULPA for the former. Bis 
forte ia,aonng around and being able to convince. These tvo 
Qualitiea are rare enough not to demand in too loud a voice 
for the tbir1--serioua concentration on a long r&Dgo target. 
It lo not that KULPA lacks tbe proieaaionallem, rather it is 
tho terapo of bis personal and professional lite tbat inclines 
bia to speed rather than accuracy. As last month was urked bJ 
the atop and go of SCDIJTAR/6, so this month was baapered bJ 
the upcoming Congo voyage. It is not that these venturoa are 
uniaportant, it &imply remains difficult to Judie KULPA1 a 
perfonaance on events occuring outside our area of caapetence. 
3. We can say nothing new or nothing untrue on the adain­
iatrative aapecta of the project. The cry ie the aue frcxa 
all aDall atatione--why ■uat·eo much valuable time be &pent on 
tiny adlliniatrative detail. In ICULPA'a caao tho aatter ia 
porbapa compounded by bis transfer from C~sablllnce but his 
ca&1plete file is living evidedce of the imbalance of tho outside 
staffer. Jn tbe regular four way breakdown, tne file reflects 
alnoot no paper in Plana and Development, Production is not 
fat, Operations ta fuller but traneitory, Support ia a awllon, 
bliatoring DOnstor. We see no ond to it. Our oreaent agenda 
for tbs next KULPA meeting calla for a discussion of eleven 
aoparate administrative items. One more chestnut and we are 
finished. The JCULPAS of the world take precise careful cnae 
officering v~th sufficient time prior and poot tbe meeting to 
bring order;froa chaoa. It is Just this time that _a am.all 
■tation lacks. So far~ we are glad to state, KULPA aeema to be. 
... 
worth the price paid. : -• ..i,..o.J,p eµ, ~ ~
