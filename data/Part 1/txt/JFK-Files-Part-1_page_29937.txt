1. Long before ~lr. 1,!urphy departed for Pa.ris in .June 
1968,. he began preparing himself for this ass,t,;11me11t as Chief 
of Station hy reading· files, interviewin~~ personnel, and 
discussing--cases. :\s a result, on arrival in Paris he was 
al.ready· we:11 oriented concerning the Station's problem:'! and 
had formulated plans for revitalizing it. 
2. The entire vcar in Paris has of course been over­
shadowed by the Vi<.•ti1:1m Peace Conference and a lar~e p1·oportion 
of the Station's C'ffort has per.force been devoted to m1pporting 
the U.S. ·dele~ation. The Station has responded exceptionally 
well to this demand though· it has forced a slow-down in normal 
Statl~n activities. 
3. A numhe1· of other even ts have a I so taken p 1 ace in
