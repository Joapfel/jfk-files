(PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY) 
Korea. In spring 1952 NOSENKO suddenly fell ill. Returned 
to Moscow and given a medical examination, he was diagnosed 
to have "a small spot on a blood vessel under his collarbone" 
and he was confined to the Hertzen Sanitorium outside Moscow 
for two months. In summer 1952, again eligible for duty, 
NOSENKO was offered an assignment to the Military-Diplomatic 
Academy, but he rejected the opportunity because the 
curriculum was almost identical to that of the Institute 
from which he was graduated. 
In summer 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to the Baltic city of 
• Primorsk, "the former German city of Pillau". [Baltiysk, a 
. larger city close by Primorsk, is the former German city of 
Pillau.] There NOSENKO was involved in the formation of 
"agent-observation posts", in which candidates from among 
Soviet seamen·were formed into three-man teams and trained 
as stay-behind· agents in the event of war. In early 1953, 
after less than six months in the Baltic assignment, NOSENKO 
returned on leave.to Moscow where he met at his father's 
dacha KGB General KOBULOV, First Deputy to then-MGB [KGB] 
Chairman B:eria.· KOBULOV, on finding that NOSENKO did not 
care for his RU assignment, invited him to consider joining 
the KGB. • • 
NOSENKO's Information-1964 
Prior to NOSENKO's graduation he had been tentatively 
assigned by the Institute' s military commission to the RU,· 
and on the instructions of the Institute's "secret unit", he 
· was interviewed by a· RU ColoneLKALOSHIN at the RU Personnel 
Department. After passing the state examination on the 
·second ·try, NO.SENKO entered the Navy in- September 1950, when 
he received orders calling him to active duty as a junior 
lieutenant. He alsoreceived orders assigning him to the 
Intelligence Staff of th~ Seventh (Far East) Fleet. He 
·left Moscow approximately 1 October 1950, travelling for 
ten days by train to his unit, which was stationed near 
Sovetskaya Gavan'. He was there assigned to a Reports 
Section with duties which included translating American 
naval publications and making summaries of Order of Battle 
information of American naval forces in the _Far East. A 
· radio signals intercept unit was connected with NOSENKO's 
unit, but [contrary to what he asserted in 1962 and 1965] h,e 
was .not personally concerned with that unit's activities.
