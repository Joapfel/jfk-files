SUMMARY 
1. The LIEMPTY Project hns thus far, survived the•11bsttnce from 
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H. ''GEIU.JIDE, as well as the 
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERl::NDE's 
marital p,·ubloms. n1·uce H •. F.l.;RNALD bas been handling nll Project 
.personnel since early December 1969, when GEHIDIDE was deactivated 
and placed on half-pay. No problems have resulted t"rom this, other 
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERN~LD is unable to meet 
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was). The security 
threat will remain a~. long as GEREND~'s estranged wife has it 
within her power to"•expose Gl::REND.t's RVROCK conuectiou and the type 
of work he was engaged in. She has continually promised not to do 
this, and thus far she has kept her word. 
2. The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the 
Station. It continues to play an important CI role (particularly 
for LNEP.GO and LNREAD) but its g1·eatest value, as far as the Station 
is conce.1·ned, is in the positive field. Two recent examples 
underline this: The elU'~Y,_,-,(and th~s; far only) debriefing of 
AEMIDRIFF wAs accOU1plished almost ex~lusively by showing her photos 
of all MHHARSH E:c:uassy pE>rsonnel and getting from her a character

LILYRIC and LICALLA. Secondly, LlLMP'rY observations (as oppo!led to
