A. OPE.BATIONAL 
• 
1. During December there wns considerable pressure on AMSCROLL 
to join political groupings being formed. by ex-Presidents Urrutia 
-and Pri.o. Fortunately, AMSCROLL was able to stay out of both.without 
incurri~ the wrath of either. 
B. PROrJVCTION 
~. Although a number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by 
AMSCRC>LL for approv~l, the only new item .for Cuban consumption • 
actually printed during tho month was the pony bulletin. This·and 
other items al-ready on h.3'11-d1 including· 51 000 Christmas cnrds, totalled 
47,000 pi.eces which we·re sent i'n 20 1 000 covers to Cuba. Another 
19,000 items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 111 700 
-to addressees· in the u. s. Most of the two latter catego1·ios were 
based :oi;· requests from religious, social, and civic organizat_ionll. 
Samples of the items and a breakdown of the actual numbers of each 
._ distri1Y.it€d are. in the attacncd AIIISCROLL P1"0pngnnda Section report. 
3. A.MSCROLL broadcasts continued as sch~duled. Chief among the 
themes, ,rbich also pervaded the two issues of the AMSCROLL house orgen 
publisb~d during_ the month ~nd the above-mentioned pony bulletin for 
Cuba, were as follows: 
a. The Congo in lurid deta-il with outrage at the Communist 
hand behind the atrocities, nnd with scorn for the so-called neutralis·t: 
for their attitude for the rescue mission. AMSCROLL editoralized that 
except- ~or the canibalism, Congo tactics including ravage and wanton 
murder are what brought Stalin, Tito, Mao, and Fidel to power.
