3.. P_.\[(SAALL. said ~e knew A~)lDLW-1 hdd some wnar,or.s. 
A~BIDJY-1 re·?lied that tne wea;,ons in :Hcarap_u~ r.,,d oeen _ 
gi.ve_n tc- the 'd.carar,uan Goveri-u~er,t, but ,\A~S~iALl. continued 
to press the point, s.1yinr. he i:.new there ;.rnre otr.ers. 
AHJIDDY-1 at last reluctantly ada,ittec.l t!'\at he Jili l",.tve .r,.-.. ,,i 
·few more scatterP.d around unuer tii;.ht security (he says -1th-is 
is not true, in fact), but indicated th,t he h•d other pla~s 
for their use. !-1i\i<Sl!.I\Lt !"~L! h~ ~i-:! 'H">"'= c"NO wt.P.re thev 
were or what they cost, he would buy them. A~SI~JY-1 asked 
hi■ why he wanted weapons so badly, and,1 ~ARSilAL.L. repUe,1 that 
he ·was always in the 1!14rk_et for weapons. _ A'iBIDDY-1 said he 
was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just 
another routine business deal. He went on to say that ht! 
would not even consider releasing any of his a?'!lls without 
knowing where the·v were going and for _what use, and that ne 
had heard that HARSHAL.L had sold weapons previously to the 
Comaunists. He would have nothinP. to do with su·n di\ opera;_ 
tion, regardless of any possible profit in it. He tried to 
elicit as much infonaation as possible, but got very little. 
HARSHA.LL said they had a COIIUllon friend in General SOHOZA, to · 
which AHBIDDY-1 replied that this was fa~rl1r rece:"lt as so:mzA/ 
and MARSHALL. had been bitter enefties up until about the last 
- three years. AHBIDDY-1 said he had to ).;now how e.,.:ny al'llls 
were wanted, when• where, and for what purpo!!ie. MARSHALL said 
he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica. 
and the reason waa that he knew a _c,oup was being prepared and 
he wanted to get his own people ready in tiae. AHBIDDY-1 said 
he would have to think about the proposition and would give 
hi• an answer in about three weeks. (He intends to stall and· 
uke no co .. itllents, hopinR to draw out more inform~tion. He will not agree to aell any _aras.) · 
'• On 7 Deceaber 1966 1 AHDIDDY-1 talked with Daniel 
ODUBER at the latter's office. ODUBER said he was worried 
about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica­
ton of poa~ible violence. ODUBER again mentioned to AHBIDDY-1 
U..t he hAd a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaragun 
border which haa an airstrip adequate __ fc;,~ a C--~6 or C-a.7 
type ai..-Creft,_and·made an effort to feel out AHBIDOY-1 about 
the possibility of landing al'lfts on that airstrip. AMRIDDY-1 
vas noncoaital and ODUBER did not pr:oess t·he point. 
I. AMBIDDY-1 said (as hia opinion) that he had gotten 
the impNasion fl'Om talking with HARSHALL and ODUBER that. 
I\ 
ODUBER is pushing MARSHALL to stage a coup attempt in the hope 
that he, ODUB&R, can r:tep. in at the li'.'ight tir.-1,0 and c~. thet:. 
. Presidency. ODUDER conaiders Jose •Pepe• FIGUE:RtS .-to i:>e .his
