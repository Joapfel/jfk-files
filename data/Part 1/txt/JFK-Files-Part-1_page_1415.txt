1 July 1976 
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security 
.03 
FROM : CSherwood R. Bosworth) 
~xternal Activities Branch 
SUBJECT Manuscript by David Phillips 
1. Attached herewith is a proposed letter to 
Mr. Dayid A. Phillips outlining deletions which the 
Agency' would like made from his book. The general tone 
of the responses from Agency components was that, if 
possible, this book should not be published. In the view 
of most. it dangerously reveals sources and methods, 
internal organization, missions, and functions. It also 
provides public confirmation of covert Agency activities 
and the disruption and·reduced morale created by Agee 
and others. 
• 2. However, on the assumption that publication 
could not or would not be blocked, the operating components 
catalogued their most serious concerns. The attached 
letter to Mr. Phillips includes many of these res~rvations. 
The chapter by chapter review, which appears later in 
this memorandum, contains those recommendations for deletion 
which, for various explained reasons, should not be forwarded 
to Mr .. Phillips. 
3. Before proceeding with the manuscript review, 
we would like to advise that Mr. John Greaney of OGC has 
volunteered his services to accompany you or Mr. Stembridge 
when our proposals are placed before Mr. Phillips. Due 
to time limitations, he has not had a chance to review 
this memorandum or the proposed letter to Mr. Phillips 
as of this date.
