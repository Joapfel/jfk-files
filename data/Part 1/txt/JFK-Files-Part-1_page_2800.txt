(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
-Receiving, reading, and filing all reports of 
surveillance and other operational activity carried 
out by various KGB units. 
NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. Even 
if he were absent when such a request for travel was made, 
he would have seen all documents upon his return; he did 
not recall seeing any such documents in ABIDIAN's file. 
Comment: ABIDIAN who is of Armenian origin and speaks 
the Armenian language with a high degree of 
proficiency, made a trip to Armenia between 5 
and 9 October 1960. While in Armenia ABIDIAN 
visited with various churchmen, their parish­
ioners and an Armenian who.had repatriated from 
Greece in 1946. ABIDIAN attended a service in 
Echmiadzin celebrating the anniversa~y of the 
accession 'of the Katolikos VAZGEN I, and also 
visited some relatives of his in or near the 
city.of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow, 
an Armenian whom ABIDIAN met on that trip 
tried to contact A..BIDIAN at the Embassy·, but 
ABIDIAN refused to see him. 
After being told ADIDIAN had attended a 
service celebrating the fifth anniversary of 
the Armenian Katolikos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO 
recalled that ABIDIAN had gone .. to Echrniadzin 
and that an agent had reported a contact with 
him there. This agent, NOSENKO recalled, was 
a priest or a monk, and the report concerned 
only his conversation with ABIDIAN; the agent 
had • no further contact with him. • . NOSENim said 
that this was his sole recollection cdncerning 
ABIDIAN' s trip .. 
With reference to ABIDIAN's travel to 
Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO recalled 
having~been on leave at the time. However, 
NOSENKO's reconstruction of the timing of his 
alleged leave still placed him in Moscow at 
the time of ABIDIAN's trip. In 1966, NOSENI<O 
·stated that he had lied, that his 1960 leave 
was taken in January, not October.
