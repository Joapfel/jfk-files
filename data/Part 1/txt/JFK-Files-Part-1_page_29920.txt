l. At .the end of ~lay 1974, Mr. Murphr wil.1 leave 
Paris after a most successful six-yi:ar as~;ii:nment as 
Chief of Station. lie dist.inguished himself hy having 
mol<le<l this Station into a cohesive, well-disciplined, 
and highly productil;'.e unit. I reiterate mr evaluation 
of Mr. Murphy as, overall, the most cffe~tive chief of 
a major station in the European Division. llis earlier 
fitness reports and his ~xccllent record in Paris 
attest to this. 
2. In the past year under Mr. Murphy's Jircction, 
the Paris Station has continued to make significant 
progress on all maj'or fronts. As examples, I can cite 
two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an ima~inative

relationships, a marked increase in ·both qua 1 it r and 
quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting, 
the acquisition of new sources to cover the Frt·nch 
internaf scene, and a revitali:ation of several existi~g 
assets into prcduce·rs of valuahlc intel ligcncc. Althouih

with the individual operations officers con(:erncJ, i:,
