last r.or.,cnt, t;.o days before the delc-~atioa wac: sched:1led to 
leave Moscow, the Central Comrni:tee ol the Con~unist Party 
de~anded that ~uch an officer go along. Because there was 
no tine to do other\oiise, SCSE~~O was chosen for this job 
since he already had a valid passport and authori:ation to 
travel abroad. Visa arr3n~emcnts were ~ad'! for the transit 
countries and N05E~KO left i,.-ith the dele~ation, returning to

explainC;d that he could not use the name SIKOLAYEV because 
the 3uto~otive delegation cover he pla~ned to use in the 
United States conflicted with the sports/cultural cover he 
had used in Great Britain, ar.d th~ KGB feared that this 
would be ncticed "hen the A.~erican anJ British services ex­
