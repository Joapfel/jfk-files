MEMORANDUM FOR: . Acting General Counsel 
SUBJECT: Mr. Eo Howard Hunt .. Alias Birth Certificate 
1. On 30 October1973 I saw Mr.' John S. Warner, Acting 
General Counsel, to discuss two outstanding requests from the Special 
Prosecutor's office in regard to U. So passports which had been issued 
to E. Howard Hunt and a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD on Mr. 
Robert Bennett's session with the U.S. Prosecutor Silbert in July 1972. 
I handed Mr. Warner a memorandum listing the type, number and dates 
of the 2 passports which·Mr. Hunt was issued between 1950 and 1970. 
In reviewing the information in this memorandum, I mentioned Mr. Hunt's 
tour in Spain in the middle 1960's and the fact that I had been instructed 
not to include Mr. Hunt and his activities in my inspection of the Madrid 
Station in 1965. I also mentioned to Mr. Warner that I remembered two 
discussions with Mr. Skip Dunn late in i972 during which he inquired of 
me whether CIA had ever issued an alias passport to Mr. Hunt. I said 
that as I recalled, CIA did not initiate the issuance of a U. s. alias passport, 
but that Mr. Hunt did have in his possession an alias travel document. 
This came as a surprise to Mr. Warner. He had not been previously 
aware that Mr. Hunt possessed a U.S. international travel document in 
alias. As a result he called Mr. John Richards, Office of the IG, and 
asked whether Mr. Richards was aware of this and whether Mr. Dunn's 
reports provided this information. After an interval, Mr. Richards 
called back and told Mr. Warner that I had provided .information to Mr. 
Dunn that Mr. Hunt had a tourist card in alias. According to Mr. Richards, 
Mr. Dunn's memorandum quoted me as saying that my information came 
from an " A -1 source." At that moment, I could not recall having made 
such a statement.
