3. Motivatior. 
Part of one's ~otivation for such a drastic act as 
treason or detection may not be '1holly co:iscious, .ir.d there 
may be underlying causes which any source ~i~ht not want 
or be able to ad~it even to hinsclf. Thus, what !~SE~KO 
said about Qotivation need not be taken at face value, and 
for this reason the whole question of tis aotivation must 
remain a air.or weight in the o,·erall asscss::ent of ~ fides. 
NOSE~lCO has tried to present a eeaningful expla~atlon 
and has changed or adjusted his story to ttiis end. Be 
initially insisted that he had no ideological motives but 
simply \lanted to "make a deal" in order to get out of 
trouble; yet thisclaim is open to question: The a120u:ot of 
operational money ,1,hich NOSESKO 11eeded to replace was hardly 
enough to have driven hi■ to treasoa, especially sicce 
there were friends in Gene\·a like GUK and KISLOV wco might 
have helped him make up his loss. Furthenore, o~ly tw2 
days after CIA had re~cued him with the funds, _NQ~-
spent" the CIA morici--in ·ranother -drunk-en -debauchery (with the 
samc--companion) and ca!lle· backnceding -more.-The discre­
pancy bet...,een the degree of tt.e need and the scriocsness of 
of the act was so evident that the CIA case officer commented 
to ~OSD,lCO at the outset that there must be so:ne deeper 
explanation for his act. Thereupon ~OSESKO added new 
rensons: His distast~ for certain aspects of the regi%e, 
his resentment of KHP.USIICHE\', a:id his liking for .~11ericans. 
Dy his defection ic 1964 XOSDiKO ch1nged the ccurse of 
his life, although he had 6aid in 1962, fo~cefully and 
unequivocally, that he would never do so unless in acute 
danger. ln 1964 he could give no coherent explanation for 
the change of heart and in October 1966 he denied, for the 
first time, that:hehad said in 1~62 that he would not de­
fect. His only motivation was that, havin~ risen to the 
level of Deputy Depart~ent Chief, be would not g~i to travel 
abroad any more. (This contradicts XCS£-KO's 196~ state­
■ents: anticipating imminent pro::.otioo to·Deputy Dep:irtment 
Chief, he said that he would lea\·e the L'SSR at least once 
a year in the future.) For no visible rea~on SOSEXKv seems 
to have abandoned a purportedly successful and pro■ ising 
career, an undisturbed t"~ily life and cbildren of s-llom 
he was fond, cast shame on his father's meaory :ud bis re­
maining relatives, and departed forever frcn his oTil country. 
His own unease concerning bis motivation evidently con­
tinued until, in 1965, he wrote one cohesive expla=.ation. 
No part of this statement was ever borne out by his conduct, 
attitudes, remarks or reactions. He appeared, whenever his 
reactions seemed spontaneous, to dislike the United States, 
to have no in~erest in it politically, culturally. or 
scenically, and to preserve~ prefer~nce for the GSSR. A 
CIA graphologist commented on KOSE~KO's "strong emotional 
ties to his traditional background," while a CIA psycholo­
gist reported: "E11otionall)" he has not defected in spite 
of his atter:ipt to intellectually rationalize that he bas." 
The psychologist also said that it is "almost impossible to 
determine bis true loyal tics and true bel iels. ·•
