NOS~KO's counterintelll~ence production includes all of hia 
information on the Soviet intelligence ar.d security or~r.sz 
their st:-ucture, functio~s. methods, ar.d proce<lures: 
- their officers,_ ~d their a1ents of Soviet citizenship, 
- their oper~tional activities inside and outside the 
USSR. 
For the :"lSOSt part this portion of the paper (as in Part V!II.C. 
through Part VIII.F.) follo~s a format in vhich the ~vidence is 
swrruarized, the facts interpreted, and conclusions presented.

Ability to discuss the structure of his service in general 
and at least scrr.e of its coraponents in partic\!lar !s ~n ?~s_ol\!tely 
mi_!}.!mal r~ircrr.-ent for anyone who claL-:1s to have bee:: e:rr.ployed 
wit~in that service. At the same time, current info"'~ation o~ the 
or1anization of an intelligence service is of class~c interest to 
opposir.g intellige~ce ar.d security services .. Organizational 
cr.anges are ir.d1c3tors of policy and planning tr~r.ds in the ser­
vice; shcrt of a !)er.e~ration of the service"s leader3hip, such 
changes are perhaps the most reliabl~ reflection of c~anges in 
operational e.7.pha~is and tactics. 
Had NOSENKO's infoITDation en the organizatio~ of the KGB 
~en novel in this se~se, it -..,ould r.ave been of cor.s:derable 
value, while the expos~re of this intomatio~--clt~ough perhaps 
r.ot a raajor loss to tr.e Soviets--woulc nonetheless have been 
against the KGB' s best interescs. :iOsen<o • s r~pcrts on the 
organization of the. KGB in 1964 (Pa~es 352-358) agree vith and 
are a logical extension of that frarne«ork of KGB organization 
nevly revealed "ay the 1961 sources, but this weighs r.either for 
nor against him as the so-.1rce: !n the absence of co~tradictory 
information, te cannot be subject to criticism or to suspicion 
beca~se his repc,rts show r.o redirection of the thrust of the 
KGB. Furthe:n:10re, 1:os~'XO' s staterr.ents indicating tt.a~ there· 
have been no major changes in the years bet~een the 1959 re­
organization and 1964 are a=3epta~le in the light of available 
information fror:i other sources. The information ~hich SOS~KO 
provided on the KGB's o~ganizatio~ therefore neither supports 
nor discredits his l:x>na £ides. 
NOSENY.O's information o, 30Cle 1,000 Soviets connected with 
intelligence and secur{ty activities is an impressive achieve­
ment of memory. These identifications, ho·.,ever, must be evalu­
ated according to the aa.-uage inflicted upon the Soviets by his 
exposur~ of these personalities. In this respect, the discus­
sion must concern ne« identifi=ations, for intelligence person­
alities previously exposed could not be da:naged any further 'b-/ 
a repetition of their compromise. This discussion m•.:..st be fur­
ther restricted to new identifications of staff pe~sor.r.cl, be­
cause the enti_re Sovi~t p0P'.1lation is available_to the KGB for 
occasional use as it sees fit, with the loyalty and discretion 
of the individual as the only limiting factors: to lea:::, that a 
Soviet employe1 at t~e u.s. Embassy in Moscow is an agent re­
porting to the KGB is to learn nothing that has not already 
been taken for granted, and ~si~es, no action or. such infor­
mation can be ta~en. Finally, the new identifications also
