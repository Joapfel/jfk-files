Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal 
address which he had previously utilized. Copies of the 
contents of this letter are attach~d under separate cover. 
The one paper, dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a 
list of Costa Ricans who visited Cuba under the auspices of 
ICAP. T~e second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians 
who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made 
a· visit to C.•.1ba as part of his presidential campaign in 
. Brazil. 
4. On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo 
ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop 
sufficient information .to evaluate his information and 
deter~ine the extent of his access. ALFONSO claimed he 
had no idea as to the identity ' __ of l>ancrasio • and was unabl_e 
to suggest possible candida\es from his relatives in Cuba,· 
former work associates, classmates or neigt.bors. ALFONSO 
had retained the envelopi from·cuba which contained Pancrasio's 
second message and a short message to ALFONSO, The note to 
ALFOSSO stated that Pancra§io had received ALFONSO's name 
and address from some unidentif1.ed individua 1 and that it was 
requested that ALFO~SO forward the contents of the letter to 
the A)ISCROLL address which was enclosed, ALFONSO was 
cauti~ned not to mention anything concerning the matter to 
anyone, e·specially to relatives in Cuba. Pancrasio stated 
this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the 
material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the 
first had been sent di1ect to the AMSCROLL address. It was 
stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO would 
·· .• serve as intermediary and that other letters would come •··•• --'·=---~•·.,-
at infrequent interv~ls. Pancrasio had decided to use an 
intermediary address as the AMSCROLL address was too well 
known. Rancrasio concluded his note by saying that he 
preferred to remain anonymous anj that he would be remaining 
in ·.Cuba for two more vears. In addition to the above cl ted 
message, the letter to Al,FONSO containe9 a calling card with 
the name Dr Luc B. l~'NOCENT, President· of the Haitian 
Revolutionary Movement. On the back of the card was typed in 
Spanish "without coOJl!ent". 
5. JMWAVE traces on FERNE~"DEZ, IRSULA and ALFONSO are 
negative. INNOCENT, according to HZPA-12507, dated 2 August 
1962, is a Haitian terrorist, Fidelista, who was planning 
to enter Panama from Columbia. 
6. ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received 
from Pancrasio in an expeditious manner and JMWAVE will 
follow any leads obtained which might help to identify 
Pancrasio in o:-der to develop him into a more productive 
source of information.
