Although the KGB considered it possible that OSWALD 
might be an American agent, the KGB did nothing to 
investigate this possibility because "this would be· 
done after the person is allowed to stay in the Soviet 
Union." Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after. 
his request, and OSWALD was not interviewed by the KGB 
in an attempt to .establish his intentions. KRUPNOV 
sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on information 
which had been received concerning OSWALD. The memorandum 
cited reports by KGB informants at the Hotel Berlin, where 
OSWALD was staying in accordance with an Inturist itinerary 
and a two-page report by the Inturist interpreter to whom 
OSWALD made his initial request to remain in the Soviet 
Union. A file incorporating all information which KRUPNOV 
had collected was thereupon opened in NOSENKO's section. 
From this information NOSENKO and KRUPNOV concluded 
that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB, and both agreed 
that OSWALD appeared somewhat "abnormal." For th.is reason 
... NOSENKO instructed KRUPNOV to. advi,se OSWALD through the 
Inturi:st interpreter that he would not be. permitte<;l to 
remain perrna:n~ntly_ in the USSR and that he-must depart on 
·the expiration of his visa,· then seek re-entry. as a· 
. permanent resident. through . normal channels at the Soviet. .. 
Embassy in Washington. K_RUPNOV followed NOSENKO.' ·s· orders, 
and either that day or th·e next NOSENKO learned that OSWALD 
• ·failed to appear for a scheduled tour arranged by his 
Inturist guide. • This prompted a search,. and. after several 
.hours, OS.WALD was found in his hotel room, bleeding heavily 
from self..;;inflicted wounds.- • Af·ter hearing of this inci_dent 
.from KRUPNOV, . NO SENKO then reporte_d it to K. N. DUBAS, Chief 
.of the Scventl1 Department. NOSENKO believed that DUBAS in 
turn reported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief 
... Directorate~ GRIBANOV uphela. NOSENKO.' s original decision 
that the KGB should not become· involved wi·th OSWALD. and • 
that ·osli.ALD should riot be permitted. to remain in the USSR. 
'I·here was no attempt to debrief OSWALD because "he was 
not an interesting person ·and wasn't normal • ." OSWALD was 
never questioned on· his past nor asked to write an • ·auto­
biography.
