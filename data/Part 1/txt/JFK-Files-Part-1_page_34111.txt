tor • long time. (1962-1963) from entering ~~stern European JW"kets.

Dlmiping as practiced by these countries, the lack of adecquate ~tockn tor 
_ the Europeans' taste, diftic11ltie11 and delays in deliveries (duo t.:, shortap ot 
ohips) have made the Europeans shy avay from buying larger qu3.Dtities or Cuban 
leat, .am, many European importers have learned that Cuba is not a reliable 
source of suppl7. 
Due to the above statecl reaso.is, t.he Col!lllllnist regime can barely place 
2,000 H~T. in Weetern Europe, for an ar~ual revenue of about lE~l,SOO,(X)().
