l.· Introd~ction 
NO~ENKO has not tndica~ed that his professional status in 
the KGB, his standard of living in tbe Soviet Union, or his 
family life pro111pted him to volunteer to American Intelligence 
in 1962 and to defect to the.United States in J.964. He initially 
told CIA that he had been.unusually successful during his ten­
year career as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest 
friends and the people whom he aru:ii~ed most were members of the­
KGB; he enjoyed his work. The !iOSENKO 'family held a high social 
position, and-their economic situntion was "luxurious by Soviet' 
standards." NOSENKO described his family life ~s close and . 
harmonious. He spoke with food:iess and pride about his two 
daughters, of his wife's· tol,eraoce and understanding, of the 
companionship she gave hi.m~ He .e:icp-resse,1 love ?;,nd a· sense of 
responsibility for his widowed ~other, who heavily depended 
upon him after the death of his father in 1956. The elder 
NOSENKO won his son's ·admiration-for having worked his .way up 
from an apprentice- pipefittcr in a shipyard to the _position .of 
Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. The NOSEmm na::ie is hcnored 
in the home town of Nikolayevsk, ~here the shipyard has been 
rena!llcd for the former minister and where a statue of him has 
been erected in the town square. By his own account, NOSENKO 
. thus r.ad had a rewarding home life and a successful an_d enjoy­
able career in the KGB. 
'2, Collaboration in 1962 
At the ,,utset in 1962, :SOSENKO said he wanted to limit his 
reports to twa items of information. Before the first meeting 
with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de­
tails on the KGB Sec·~nd Chief Director~te and nther operations, 
and he offered to meet again. (Four core meetings ensued in 
1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB,) 
He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety 
was endangered by the KGB. Motivations ir, coming to American 
Intelligence, according to NOSEXXO, were his financial emergency 
in Geneva and his disaffection for the Soviet regime. 
a. Readiness to Report to CIA 
During his 9 June meeting with David MARK, NOSEXKO said he 
realized, even before talking to representatives of American 
Intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two 
,items of information alone--he expected them to insist on more. 
He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the same 
day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue 
took place: 
NOSENKO: 
Case 
Officer: 
NOSENKO: 
You see, I am not planning to be your agent ... 
and don't think that I am going to work with 
you in Moscow, No. No ... 
As you have' said, I am an ·intelligence officer 
as are you. And I think that we will understand 
one another. 
You want to place our relationship on an agent 
basts.
