2, I was infonned of this propooed prc3entation on Frida:, 
afternoon, October 17. I obtained th,e qt,tar,hcd from Mr. Grcenlca., 
.. NCPE r,,mernl Counsel, today. NCFE do~n n!')t .lmow that Mr. Greenlea 
has been in touch· w:l th us and shoTJld not. kr.ov. 
J. I sur.r-est that you review, with !~r: Wianor, wheth~r NCF'F. 
should ~.ke such a presentation. In ea;)enr.1?, the prcnentation is 
an attack on the McCarran Bill. I s,1v,r'.ezt th.at, pcrh11ps, NCFE 
should not t.eJtify for two reasons, 
a. Thi:; is close to a clear P.Xa'l'IJ)le of a true exempt 
charitable orranization, attempt.in~ to innuence 
lecislation and; 
b. Tho political i.mplicationz ll!"e liable to be an 
embarrassment for CIA. 
4. Apparently, NCPE ia makin;~ thio preEcntation in the hopes 
or receivinr vide publicity so the-/ will te in a po:iition to say to 
thP. emii'.rt:es with whom they deal, "lo,;;k what we are tryin~ to do for 
you. 11• 
5. I urge your rapid concern, for the presentation is due to be 
made tomorrow afternoon.
