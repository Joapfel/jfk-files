regara to what NOSENKO has ~aid about KGB procedures, DERYABIN 
stated: "Asked to describe how he conducted n::une checks on a 
Scviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy in 
1953-54, NOSE:-1KO gave a superficial d~scripucn of how such 
checks were done. However, he resisted every att<.>mpt to get him 
to describe this process in detail, and he made several blunders 
wr.ich show that he never actually ran such a check himself. For 
example, he did not know wnere the records of all Soviet citizens 
who have been tried are kept, and he at:.ter:!pted to improvise an 
answer (cor::pletely wrong) that t't,ey would check with the Militia 
about this. NOSE~·U<O correctly said th;;t Archives .,.,ere located 
on Kirov Street, but he was completely unable to stretch his 
limited knowledge to provide a de3cription of ~ow these various 
repositories were actually checked. NOSENKO was also asked to 
describe in detail how he ran such a check on a Soviet citizen 
in the 1956-59 period. Here again he was in difficulty and re­
fused even to try. He did not even know the everyday term Spets­
provP.rka, which means a check for clearance. 
"It was particularly interest.i,ng that he did not feel able to 
dispute my challenges of his infQrmation, even though he undoubt­
edly knows that I do not have first-h,md kr:.o·dedge of procedures 
in this period. I even tested this on one occasion by asking 
NOSDiKO the diffP-rence betw~en the 1st~ Otdel (Special 
Department - KGB cards and files) and the Operati•.-no-Uchetniy 
Otdel (Operational Reports Department - the functional name for 
the 1st Special Department). He answered that the 1st Special 
Departmer,t !lolds the files on Soviet cri!:'linal cases •r.ile the 
Operational Reports Department is for political and ~spionage 
cases. It sce::is he invented thi$ answer on the spot. In addi­
tion, it is wrong that political and security cards are separate 
from criminal er.es in the 1st S~cial Department. They· were 
in my time and must still be com~ined in one card file. 
"NOSENKO states that he'}ulow~ nothing about the files of 
the First Chief Directorate. It is unbelievable that in ten 
years of service in the Second ctlief Directorate NOS~KO never 
Raw a First Chief Directorate tiie: how else would he be able 
to check information on foreigners, especially on American Em­
bassy personnel? The first stag~ in such a check is an inquiry 
to the Fir&t Chief Directorate and a check of a"y files they 
may have on the subject. Accordlng to his own account, NOScra.o 
should have l::een doing this type ~f thing the whole of-his ten 
years of service, without regard to whether he was_assigned-to 
the·- Ameri'can Departmen·t or the Tpurist Department."
