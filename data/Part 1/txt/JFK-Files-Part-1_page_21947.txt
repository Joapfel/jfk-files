RICilARDS. The one agent reporti:.g on RICHARDS whom NOSENKO 
could name was the maid Mariya NEVEROVA, KGB cryptonym 
"SHVEr::.OVA," but she had never pro'!idecl any worthwhile in­
formEJtion about RICHARDS. In addi. Lion, some Soviet dr.i ·1ers 
repcrted on RICHARDS, but. nothing useful was obL1ined from 
them. 
/,ccording to CIA records, RICl!i'\RDS served in Moscow 
from July 1954 to July 1956. There was a microphone in the 
office which he shared first with MICl'.ELSON and lat•~r with 
ME/~R'.~S. RIClll-lkDS confirmed that Mariya !'.EVEROVA was his 
maid and described her as a "mousy" woma!1 who had a heart 
attack during the period she was employed by him. (This 
incident was not recalled by NOSENKO:) For about four 
months of his Moscow tou-::-, !UC!l?s!WS took Russian-language 
lesso:1s from Ludr:ii.l,1. GJZCX·lf.c.KOVA i11 his apartment. Dur_ir.g 
these lessons, :i.ICIJARDS often uiscussed labor conc:-i tions and 
wages in the Cni tcd Stat es and, on one occasion,· had :1er 
record her speech on his tape recorder. GROMAKOVh \s'as preg­
r.ant and unmarried at the time. (NOSE~lKO has named GR0:-1,vi:OVA 
as a KGll agent in another context but has not rn•.:.•ntioned her 
con::acts with RICJLI\RDS.) * RICHARDS identified one "Volodya" 
{i.e., first naruG Vladimir) as his principal driver. About 
62 y~ars old in 1~5~, Volodya was the son of a rich jeweler 
in Moscow during the Revolution. Voloc1ya himself wc1s well 
educated and, on one occ2sion while picnicking outside Mos­
cu:, he spoke intelligently with RIClll\RDS c1bout the Revolu­
tic.-!1, propaganda, and news :nedia. (NOSEt,KU did not l:no•,: of 
Volocij•:..) Further dl~t.ails from RICI-IAEDS are given in the 
fol lo·.,ing. section on FELCl!LIN. 
(iv) FELCHLIN 
NOSENKO identified Howard L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant 
colonel who served as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and 
stated that he was FELCHLIN's case officer. FELCHLIN was in 
the Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being 
declared cersona non qrata. NOSENKO diJ not recall the 
na.'112:~ of any agen~specifically targetted against FELCHLIN, 
although he thougl1t 2ELCHLIN must have had a maid ~nd she 
wc,:ld have been a KGB 2gent. Additionally, NOSENKO said, 
the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and 
drivers, and these were his agents. Unable to recall the 
precise date of FELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to 
some event regarding Soviets itationed in the United States 
for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kind. 
NOSE~KO was imprecise as to the pretext useJ to expel FELCH­
LIN, but said the action was based on information which had 
been accumulated from a number of sources and incidents. 
For example, FELCHLIN had been caught taking some photographs 
and a report had been written; along with other similar 
indications of FELCl!LIN's activities and reports of agents 
in contact with FELCHLIN, the report was filed away for pos­
sible future use. NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH­
LIN during the February 1965 interrogations. Ile said then 
that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona~ grata, 
and that no other attaches had been involved. NOSENKO
