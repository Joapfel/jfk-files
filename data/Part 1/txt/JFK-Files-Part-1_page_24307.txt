PROJECT QRPHOXE 
PABT A. CHARTS REQUESTED 
Chart I: For the period FY 1967 through FY 1971 
provide the number of disseminated reports according to 
the subject field of the report. The headings would be: 
Fiscal Year, African Independancc Movements, Anti-US 
Demonstrations, European Maoist Groups (etc., or whatever 
other subject fiolds you wish to set up). 
Chart II: List the specific events or organizations 
against which covert action was in fact undertaken and 
give· the number of QRPHO~E reports which were submitted 
on such events/organizations. 
PART B. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. What is the basic reason for tbis being a CA 
Staff project (other than history)? To provide multi­
divisional tasking for FI purposes of general U.S. intelli­
gence interest? To provide CA operational information. 
for possible DDP use? 
2. As regards FI reports, which have lately been 
described as being of only marginal interest, the main 
criticisms appear to be a lack of depth and detail. 
CA Staff's counter to this has been that QRPHONE goes as 
far as he can, and can go no further through elicitation. 
Have these depth/detail criticisms been valid? Is our 
defense valid, or could he reasonably be expected to 
elic~t more depth and detail than he does? 
3. 
we wish 
That he 
goes to 
to us?

- /::-:: .,. ;-- -
,J 
If he can go no further through elicitation and 
to keep him on the FI path, what is implied? 
develop and run agents himself? That he actually 
work for an organization of intelligence interest 
How realistic would either of these lines of 
be?
