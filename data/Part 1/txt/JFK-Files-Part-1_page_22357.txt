There remains the possibility that t.0SENKO has misrep­
resented himself and is a witting part of a KGB operation. This 
hypothesis could accor-~odate the arglll'!lent that the KGB would 
not ~ispatch a iGs staff officer as a couble agent against a 
hostile service te=ause, whether or not the argu::ent is valid, 
NOSEh"KO (as indicated in Part VIII.D. above) has not proven his 
claim to having served as an officer of the'.KG~. If he has 
been and is now under KGB control, it woul~ cppear that he was 
being built up for years to look like an officer and was sho-.n 
to ~esterners in certain r~cruitment or,crations.• This could 
explain NOSE~KO's revelations to,FRIPPEL'and others about his 
family and background; the othen,,is,: pointless W.E. JOHNSON 
case, and NOSE~IKO's a!=-pc~rance i.n t~.e B,\RGHOORN interroqation. 
It could explain t-;0S1:.!iK,1' s uneven memory and performance under 
detailed q1..estionir.g: Much of -hat he should have known by 
personal cxpcrie~cc could have ~~en ~ercly memorized as part 
of t.is KG a briefing. Nc.t:,ing ... n SOSl:~!'.O' s prouuction ( see 
Part Vlil.B, above) would preclude his being a KGB-dispatched 
agent. That he was d KG~-dispatcn0~ agent ~as the co~cl~sion . 
independently arrived at Lij• t.!1e CI/\ specialist •,;ho administered 
a polygraph examination to ~CS'.::~!<O in Ap!'.'il 1964.

The first alter~ativ~ above has been rejer.te~ while the 
possibilit:,· that ?:05£!~KO or. his own mi~represcr.ted ~imself 
is u.~acccptaclc. The remaining possibility is that NOSESKO 
has been manipulated by the ~G9 in an operation directed 
against Al:lerican Intelligence. 
* His Aroertcan Department service in 1960-1961 was not supported 
by any sue~ •shew• appearances--he did not insist on the 
t.ruth of his claim to participation i~ the KEYSERS case,
