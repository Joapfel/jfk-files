·»uring early August-1969 a_ close business associate met with Colonel ( fnu) 
·Coreccolli (phonetic) . and members of the Honduran Army General Staff. Colonel. 
.Coreccolli and members of the s•.'lff were alarmed by the continuing reports of 
arms-and a111DUnition stockpiling by El Salvador. These individuals· were of the 
. opinion that the armament of the Honduran Armed Forces was inferior to that of

needed to arm personnel "ith.prior military service in case of a renewal of 
hostilities with El Salvador. These individuals were considered to be a re­
