NOSENKO has stated that his original approach to "sell two 
·_ pieces of information" was his own id~a as to what was most likely to 
be successful. NOSENKO has stat~d that _h~ wa_nted to make a contact 
. • with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the 
• time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a "KGB co~nter­
intelligence officer who wanted to give information, 11 he very possibly 
would be rejected. It _should be noted that NOSE-NKO even during his 
first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information'' 
and began to_ talk quite freely on other matters. 
Ii NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962 
contacts, would have been very carefully briefed and that his remarks 
or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any 
suspicion in regard to the bona £ides of NOSENKO. Instead. a current 
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 1962 
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite 
likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO 
and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO 
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in 
Geneva.
