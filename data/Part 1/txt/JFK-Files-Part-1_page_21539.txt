iss1..e, it is eminently reason..ble to conclude that the encounter took 
place but that ~O.SE~KO simply has no recoUcction oi it. There is

1961 has had the most mex<t in the controversy over his statements 
relative to-his KGB career. This· particular aspect will be covered in. 
detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy 
over what duties the position oi Deputy Chiei oi Section in tile SCD, KGB; 
entails or does not entail. It is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge 
whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chiei oithe First Section in 1960 • 1961

KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties oi a Deputy 
Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in 
the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB 
may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure 
of CIA, but any similarities are surely .not such as to permit a judgment
