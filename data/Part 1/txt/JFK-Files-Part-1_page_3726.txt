!U:30ZO has said this would be so. :ie recently told c:.e

&. In response to my queries as to what dirtection 
'the nev Cuba policy migh~ take, ARTI~E said in Uarch 1969 
that he did not expect~ e NIXON administration to a~dress 
itself .:o the Cuban 'problem before :iay of this yea·r. 
Then he exoects a concerted effort to make the economic 
blockade work. If that does not yield results, he exnects 
that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban 
exile raids against Cuba from non-u.s. bases. He hope•; ti,. 
• be the man chosen ·to lead in this endeavor. · Again• in 
response to.my questions, he said that exiles could b~ 
trained in Nicaragua •. He favors using Haiti as the actual 
1,ase of operations, i.e., the raiding parties vould leave• 
from there. He mentioned having talked with President 
DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for. 
such operations. 
7. ARTIME said that operations againat Cuba would be 
deaiined to knock out shipping and port facilities •. He 
bas not rec:.antly r,eferred to his earlier invasion plan 
a outlined in MANAGUA 6752 of 23 October· 1968.

termed ~lsewhere ~the old. exile hacks" who have not given

1.n·unseating CASTRO~ he is beginning to go to fat· a bit. 
I saw him in a bathing suit not long ago·and thought that 
he would do well 'to get into trim if he hopes to lead in 
any military operation. 
9. ARTIME has never made any discernabla efforts to 
pi-y secrets from. me; indeed, he se.:.,,.-:3 to have taken special. 
pains not to do so. He is mature and quite objective--can 
see various facets to just abeut any problem. I believe • 
it ie well vorthwhile maintaining ~(~Jasional conta:::t t,ith
