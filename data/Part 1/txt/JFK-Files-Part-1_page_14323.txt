you like a brother~ I didn't:want you to return to Cuba, but 
I couldn't stop you. We were
1
all in favor of Castro." Bill I

and the pay was good, .but :idd~d that "I had to go. I was in • 
the States illegaiiy.'' • -SAb!KO _added "you.know, Bill, _I never 
was blessed ii.•ith any children;· you were like a son to me, but 
when I heird you died in the m~untains in Cuba, I blamed myself 
for le.tting you go." Bill replied that he was wounded on his 
left side.· SM,JKO explained that if All.\UT0-1 was in the States 
illegally 1 SA.MKO could have arranged for him to remain in. the 
States by getting assistanc~ ft·om some police and _detective 
fr'iends in· Florida. SAllKO repeated his delight to again see 
AMAUT0-1 and how happy he was ~o kriow he is alive.
