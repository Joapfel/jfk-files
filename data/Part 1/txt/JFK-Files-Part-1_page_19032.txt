not seem to be under s~rious con­
sideration at the moment. It 
would violate Germ'.in trn,11 t.t:on, 
and might produce a ren1~tion in 
favor of the NPD, enabling it 
to overstep even tho new ·margin. 
Although tho growtti of 
the NPD is disturbing, alarm does 
. not seem to be warranted. In the 
···early 1930s, Germany suffered 
from depression and high unem­
ployment, and had bitter memories 
of a recent inflation which wiped 
out savings. Powerful clements 
in the government and society/ 
including President von llinden­
berg, the army, the courts, and 
heavy industry, were highly re­
actionary and either cool or hos­
ti le to republican dcmocr.:icy--as 
were the professors and students. 
Racism was rampant and more or 
less respectable, and unwilling­

• elect a. new assemol~• before the 
19_69 federal elections may help 
to prevent a real bandwagon de-
•• velopment. I,t must be emphasized 
that the NPD is still a small 
party, if no longer a mere splin­
ter group. 
The Coalition Problem 
German observers tend to be 
more worried.about ~~e effect of 
the NPD showing on foreign op.in­
ion than about -the increase in 
NPD strength itself, and their 
~reatest ~oncerh is over the pros­
pects for the grand coalition, 
resulting from the SPD losses. 
A Baden-Wuertternberg SPD conven­
tion voted on 18 May against con­
tinuing -the coalition in s tut t_gart, 
a~d the old state SPD leaders 
resigned. This ·would seem to 
make the prospects for the Bonn 
coalition less favorable . 
At the same time, the FDP 
appears not to be in a rnood to 
return to a coalition in either 
Donn or Stuttgart. Da~rendorf 
has suggested that there might be 
a CDU minority govern:r:en t in the 
state. State CDU lead~rs may, 
however,· prefer ·to ca-11 new elec­
tions if a coalition cannot oe 
formed. In this event, th.ey 
would appeal for an at-solute ma­
jority from the voters. If they 
got it and if the NPD ,·ote de­
clined, this would be encouragin9, 
but new elections might also have 
a· less favorable·outcor.ie.
