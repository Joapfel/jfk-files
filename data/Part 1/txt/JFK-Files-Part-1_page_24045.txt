z. In term• of our operational atlllsatlon of QRPHONE/1 at thl• time, 
,_._ 
while they reserve fl.nlte comment antll all the retul"DS (per above) are in., the 
Medical Staff did streu the paralllOGDt importance 1po.Joper reat and of not over­
taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular, 
warm, balanced meals in. accordance with the dietary restrictions uaaally imposed, 
anrl complete absence of alcohol, in o=der to prevent a relapso, So long as these 
caveats are adhered to, however, there ls no reason why he could Dal make soDle 
more short trip• during the next !e,w months, if neceHary. However, since he 
also has an office to set ap and we would lllte him to concentrate OD the Kambona 
offer, perhaps lt would be a good idea to keep those trlp• to a 1PJolmam for the 
t1me beln.g. 
J. The Medical ~taff will be glad to rmew any further chemlcal test• per 
para. I above eaggeatlone, or any others which hls doctor may have already run.
