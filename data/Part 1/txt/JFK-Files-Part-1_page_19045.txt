Thielen's departure-clears 
the ~ay ·for Von .Thad.<;len form.'tlly 
to .take over leadership.of the 
. NPD. It. is doubtful .that. Thielen 
.. h~s the .personal force or 'follow-. 
ing to organize a party with 
significant strength. The impact 
of the new party on the NPD will 
probably be small since the bulk 
of the NPD membership appears to 
prefer the leader~hip·and ideology 
of the Von Thadden·group. On 
the other h.:rnd, the strengthening 
of extremist te:nden~ies within the 
NPD signaled by the ·triumph of 
Von Thadden may hurt the party's 
interests in the long run. The 
result is also likely to assist 
,those acti~ely seeking a formal 
government crackdown on the pa~ty. 
Program 
In addition to its leadershi~ 
difficulties, another failing of 
the NPD ~sits inability as yet to 
offer a clear, positive program 
relevant to existing problems. 
Xenophobic and opportunistic, the 
NPD feeds upon nostalgia for an 
older German nationalism, discon­
tent with the existing social or­
der, and Cer.many's international 
star.din''] and frustr;it ion over the 
fact that reunification remains 
as distant a prospect as ever. 
Its stated objectives are ill de­
fined, when not deliberately am­
biguous, and are sometimes incon­
sistent. Its electoral ~pproach 
is generally·negative and destruc­
tive!~ critical rather than af­
firmative. Its ·principal targets 
incl.ude fo~eign intere~ts and cul­
ture which undermino old values 
.. and N•de-Gcrmanize 'tho fat.herland~• 
It attacks the renunciation by 
those in powcr·of what the NPD 
regards as justified German ob­
jectives. It deplores what it 
c6nsiders the miseducation and 
corruptiop of youth, "crime in the 
streets," foreign aid, and th~ 
competition of foreign workers •. 
The NPD demands an end to 
German dependence on the US and 
calls for the revival of German 
national consciousness. It at­
tempts to draw a parallel between 
West German - US relations and 
those between the East German 
regime and the USSR. In order to 
free Germany from foieign domina~ 
~ion, NPD spokesmen maintain, 
~nerican "occupation" forces must 
go, although not before the with­
drawal of Russian troops, which 
the ~PD would have occur simultane­
ously with that of US troops, 
G~rmany must again become master 
of its 6wn fate, party leaders in­
sist, and the "lie" of war guilt 
and war crimes trials must be 
ended and a new German general 
staff created . .l\,key demand is 
that the reunification of Germany 
cannot be limited to uniting West 
and East Germany but must include 
the lands beyond the Oder-Neisse 
border now !1eld by Poland. Al­
though it docs not advocate the 
use of force to achieve this ob­
jective, the party holds out hope 
that recovery will be possible by 
a Machiavellian deal of ~ome scrt. 
NPD spokesmen at present renounce 
a national nuclear capability for 
Germar.y.
