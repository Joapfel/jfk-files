• T9 the immense· regret· of. this writer Ann Goo~pasture·. 
is riti~ing very soon. It wotild b~ silly to rate her , 
~ompetftively against any of her colleagues, male or fem~le,. 
yourtg or mctelywcll-prc~crvcd. Cdncerning her fitness be 
it recorded that she is-very fit indeed to perform any of 
the tasks list~d ~sher ciu~rent ones o~~lmo~t any 6thers 
I can th'irik of -a( :alinost.:- any grade, • I venture to rate he.r 
over-all performance, thirty _years of i~, as OUTST.-\NDING. 
Ann is .one of the tough warp-threads on. which th-is organiza- .. 
tion is woven, and ~hen she retires th~ fabrit o~ this 
organization wil.l b~ weakenea, • •

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a -fine officer who consistently 
turns in a Str:ong performance when she. is not; doing an out-_ 
standing job. • She is 31'. excellent office and proj~ct manager 
-::who is cost conscious and she is a careful tho·rou·l!h instructor 
~nd briefe~. Hei•retirement will leave a ~reat gip in CI/OPS 
and, as f.lr. Johnson has said, .in ~he organization. I hope 
she gets the ~fficial Agency recognition she deserves for 
the many years she has made substantive contribution to the 
cs. ~-s~tr,,~ .
