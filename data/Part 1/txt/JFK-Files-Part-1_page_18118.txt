tightened and put .Jn excessive strain on the motor.

3. To prevent f.Ji lures of this type in the future, Raymund L.. 
BARCENA:; is making a snwll battery charger flt a nominal i:ost that 
can be floated ~cross the battPrics keeping them fully charged. 
We arc cloinq It this ,-1ay rather than ordering a DC power supply 
because it is less expensive th,rn o commerci;tl model c;1nd ,..,111 not 
be bothered by house current interruptions or fluctuations. If 
however, WOACRE/PB foresees any problems hy doing it this wav, please
