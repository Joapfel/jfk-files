Directorate of Police and of tho Special Group, aanaller, 
somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested 
on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated ab:>ve. 
On 1 F·ebruary 19t>7, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA 
i:equest because.ot indications that Subject was involved in 
clande~tinP. sabotage activity and there wero suspicions that 
he.had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL. 
Station Caracas was directed to h.:indle Subject as a "hostile". 
The Station was advised that they could m.:iintain contact with 
Subject aa a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL 
and the Special Group but th/'l~ .. no requirements were to be 
levied on him. The St-ition· wa·s advised that they could make 
spot payments for inform~tion received fcom Subject. CI/OPS 
co-ocdinnted on these directions to Station Caracas.

demurred on l:leadquacters' interpretation of J\MCLEVE-.l5•a 
activities. The St,:1tion stated, in effect, that assets are 
often unsuvory .indiv.iduals, who are neve1.· under complete con-
trol and who seldom discloi::e the complete .1:ungo of their 
activities to their supervisors. The Station addccl that they 
wece intercstc:d in Subject bE!cause of his positJ.on ils a "trusted 
confidant" of certain highly placoo Venczuel.:i.n security offjcials. 
3. In the ensuing months the Station came to desc.:r.ibe 
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the 
intelli-gence iufonnation _and opcnitional reports he furnished. 
For c·xample, he reported on the invoLvement of the Vene::zuelan 
mil.itary in ,l Cuban exile plan to ·att;:ick Cuba. And, he also
