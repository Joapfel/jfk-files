It is interesting to note that the attached list contains the names 
of approximately 20 GRU officers whom NOSENKO relates to the early 
1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews 
and in other memoranda, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelli­
gence personnel whom he knew in the 1951 - early 1953 period. 
Page 52 of the above sUinmary and other related pag.es question 
whether NOSENKO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Intelligence 
and even question his geographical knowledge of the area. Attached is a 
copy of a handwritten memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by 
NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his assignment with Navy 
• Intelligence in the Far East and the Baltic area. The memorandum was 
completed by NOSENKO without any reference material and a review of 
his diagram,s indicates they are quite accurate. 
NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic 
area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and du~ing current interviews recalled 
that the former name of the place, an almost deserted fishermen's 
village, was Fishausen. The previous designation given by NOSE:NKO 
for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsk Primorskiy had 
caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non­
existent. A further check in the matter would have disclosed that the 
place was not.nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and 
that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen.
