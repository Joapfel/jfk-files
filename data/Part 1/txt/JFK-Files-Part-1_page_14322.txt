Ttie. boy apparently 'Cai-l~d .,for·. someone in the 
· house. A maid, not shown· in thisj,hoto, but 
who can be seen in photo L, came out and 
• appro.iclled SA!-IKO. In his· halting ~panish, 
S.UIKO said he wanted to see "el Senor". 
The maid said. he wasn't in. He explained to 
the maid that it was "very importante" to 
see the Senor. By this time another maid 
·appeared,-shown in this photo,· and she gets 
• into t~e ~ct. She repeats that el Senor is 
not in. S,UIKO, sensing he wasn't getting 
anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to 
see "la .senora". The maids went into indivi­
dual monologues, but SA~IKO could not understand 
what they were s:iying. Finally, SA11KO produced 
_a note, which he was asked to prepare, and 
·1t:inded it:. to the maid in this photo. SAMKO 
· repeated that it was "very importante to see 
el Senor." 
The maid ac~epti the iote ind returns'to the 
house. Three of A~L.\Uf0-1 's. children observe 
the activities from· the front_ entrance. 
A:.L.\UT0-1 ex~ts~ with note iri hand and looks 
toward the driveway. S,UIKO spots him and 
calls out, ·"Bill, don't.you remember me, 
it's SAMKO." Bill replies, "S..\llKO, muy bien, 
come here, come here." Actually, AMXUTo-=r­
goes toward SAllKO and they embrace. ('l'h~ 
driveway slants toward 'ihe house and Irofu ou~ 
observation post we could not see the embrace.)
