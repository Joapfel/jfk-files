;10." BOLSHAKOV, Robert K~nnecfy, and the Cubin Yiss'ile Crisis 
a. Introduction • 
~os~o voluntce1•ed at his ShCOnd me:etm g wit~ CI.-\ 
in Janu:\ry 19o4 that G.s. BOLSHAKO'w V..3.S hi:,;, '"old friend" 
and that he was a colonel in the GRU. On. 26 Jan~ary, 
1 February, and 19 Aui;ust 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKCV's 
naron, emphasizing that he was a GRU officer and a "good 
friend.'' In the 1 February inter\•ie:w, afte:r displaying an.· 
initial reluctance to dise:uss with CIA such a ·"sr::nsitive" 
subj-::ct, he provided a number of details on BOLSIU,KOV's 
alleged relationship in 1962 with tto then Attorney General, 
Robert Kennedy. His information on this subject, he said, 
derivP.d from his f.i•icndship with BOLSHAXO\' in ~-loscow, where 
BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 follo,1,·ing -:i to~r 
in Washington as Novosti correspondent and Editor of the 
magazine USSR). 5uSENKo claim,,d a personal role in this 
• affair, int'nat;- he personally proposed to th~ KGB ·leader­
ship that the KGB. take over DOLSHAKOV' s for!:!er (GRU) con­
~act with Robert Kennedy. 
h'OSE?\1(0 claimed that an information ch!l!lnel of co!l­
munication between OOLSHAKOV and-the Attorney General had 
developed at Ken~cdy's initiative. Ha de~crlbed in detail 
the circumstances of their ir.troduction at a social function 
by a journalist (whom he ~id not nim~). He said that he 
"thought" that the Kennedys knew that ~LS!L\Y.O\" wa:.:; a 
"military intelligence officer," and he implied that they 
regarded these private conversations with BOLSrLtKOV as a 
useful instrument of diplomacy. Accordiug to XOSENKO, the 
KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship--i~ 
was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it th·at way. -
NOS~'XO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States 
"during the Cuban missile crisis,"* no one took. over his 
role as a confidential channel to the White House. After 
the assassination o'r the Presid::.>nt, N03E:SKO continued,. the 
Kennedy family tried to rt>establish the relationship through 
their close friend, the artist Willi~ WALTOS, during t!le 
latter's visit to lloscow in 0.?ccmbt!r 1963. ~OSENKO re-ported 
that be had urged that the KGD trr to take o\·er the Rotert 
Kennedy operation f1•om the GRL' and that he llad proposed two 
plans which would have enabled this to take place, the 
second involving WAL10N. Neither came to fruition, however.

there actually were such weapons there. -
According to other sources, BOLSUAKOV left Washington 
for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2'0ctober 1962. 
On 23 August, about the time that CIA w~s reporting urgently 
to thu President that "something ne-w and.different" was 
going on with respect to Soviet.aid to Cuba, Ambassador
