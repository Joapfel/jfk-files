Phillips has been here too short a time and there has been too little 
opportunity for us to work together for me to be able to discuss his 
performance in detail. I am able to say, however, that he has 
·impressed me and other Embassy officers with whom he works, including 
"-Ambassador Elbrick, very favorably, inde·ed. He is a cool-headed, 
straightforward, intelligent man who seems professionally very 
capable. He has a clear understanding of the appropriate role fo;-
hil:lself and his organization within the Embassy and is working to 
achieve a genuinely low profile. He has already demonstrated his 
interest in the best possible relations with the rest of the U.S. 
Covernment organization and he knows how to act in order to achieve 
such a relationship. He has come to me a number of times to volunteer 
Ill. detailed information which he did not feel important enough to bother 
the Ambassador about, but he has kept the Ambassador fully informed 
about all .those subjects which were of sufficient interest to him. 
I see every reason to assume that he will be a positive, constructive 
and very dependabl~ and reliable factor in the Embassy. 
Mrs. Phillips is an attractive and personable young lady who has 
particularly impressed my wife and me with her attitude and intellect.
