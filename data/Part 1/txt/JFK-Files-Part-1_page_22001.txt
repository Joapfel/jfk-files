·to operations against American code clerks, the "number or.e

been selected. for this position.or who had reco:n:~ended him for 
it. 
_NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved 
upon repbrtir!g for duty in the u.s. Embassy Sect.ion. He replied: 
"Nobody." He was then asked to identify .the persons fro:n whom 
he had assumed certain of his duties as IJeputy C::ief of the 
section (these are C:iscussea in detail below). ~;oSENKO said that 
he took the responsibility for rr~int~~ning the section file on 
the security of the u.s. Cmbassy from the Chief of the section, 
V. M. KOVSHUK . .,,* Regarding his responsibility as case officer for 
the Security Officer of the E:nbassy, NOSE:S:KO explained that be­
cause former Security Officer Ru~;sell L~~GELLE ~ad been declared 
persona -:!lQ!! grata in OctoLer 1959 and becduse his successor John 
ABIDIA.~ w.:is not to arrive u:-:t1l M2rch 1960, no or.e in the section 
had this responsibility wher. he, !WSENKO, urrived in J;;!nuary 
1960.. Asked who had been LJ..:·IGELLE' s case officer, NOSENKO rc-
pi ied: "LA.-...GELLE was hand_!ed py sevet·;.11 people - by LA.S;} MALYU­
GlN, then after that by LV.A.J KU.SKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then 
* In late December 1961, GOLITSYN also comrnent(=d on this subject 
to his CIA handling officer: "The task of strc:-igthening of 
wor:: against the Americans has been a standing r·equ1remer.t, 
both in the past and most particularly Qt this ~ime. This 
work was particularly intensified after the appointment of 
SHELEPHI to the KGB... In 1960, it was cecor.t"'.lEnJed in the 
KGB to intensify the work qgainst the Amer.i.::ans at the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow, and ugainst A~er1can colonies in other 
countries ... This question of intensifying work against the 
Americans was up before the Collegiwn of the KGB. Thereafter, 
there was a directive from SHELEP[N regarding the intensifi-
cation of work against the A.ierican cipher-clerks." 
**There is an apparent contradiction between NOSENKO's desig­
nation of KOVSHUK as Cbief~the... f.it:.s..t.-D:l,.S5 E@bassyl Sec- ,_, 
tion itll960 and information earlie1· supplied by _GOLIT.:iYN. 
GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in 
,January 1961 in Moscow (see Part v.E.3;c.2. concerning a. 
recruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS­
BERG) but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American 
Department officer, without indicating his position. The 
only time that GOLITSYN has given a position f~r KOVSHUK was 
in the context of questioning concerning KHRUSHCHEV 1.s "Secret 
Speech" denouncing STALIN in 1956., ,GuLITSYN,' said that at this 
time KOVSHUK was Chief" of -the American Department (sic) of 
the Second Chief Directorate. On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN 
! . identified Vladimir PETROV as• Chief of the ",sect;ion concerned 
t· with the American &nbassy of the American' Department of the t- .·. ;L· ,. _,_,., Second Dir.ectorate" in 1960., NOSENKO had identified PETROV
