"sclf-dghteous indulgence'!," however.. It was shortly after this that 
• .. Subject was approached by a- member of the AIS w!-lo was ·following up on 
Subj~ct as·an -ops lead furnished by a cousin in the US who ~as a 
moderately suctcssful lawyer, and who had becri long since recruited as 
an agent -~potter for cithnic Georgians. Suhject was favorably assessed 
and removed back from France, because of travel restrictions .imposed • 
under his par~le status. I believe that this opportunity rekindled 
his. old feelings ·or exhilaration and uatcful enthusiasm for the 
opportunity to pcrfor~ his_ deeds of d~ng for an authority, sanctioned 
by a national state, in this case the AIS.

and basic tratlccraft quickly and with great applied flexibility. 
F. It was duri~g this period that Subject began to confide 
regularly and in depth to Undersigned. Subjcct_would often tell 
Unde-,,r"signcd, "-Fn.·d,- you must believe me, I want to do something." 
"I i,,·ill do anything you tell me to_do, only tell me:-"" "You (meaning 
the Agency) want me to kill somebody. • Okay! I_ do it anyway you say." 
I believe Subject was genuinely sincere, and that this wa~ neither an 
attempt to iMpress his C/0 or a trust/assurance maneuver.
