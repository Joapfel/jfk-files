from the Organi_zation, his ~o~tinued presence at this Station definitely 
appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite 
conclusions concerning the l~vei of sustained_pcrformance over a somewhat 
longer period than that reflected by this report. 
On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to 
greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken 1:1oinewhat more 
aggressive. efforts fo expand Jtls range of contacts in immediat c proximity 
to the primary Station targctr:i", This officer docs bring many talents to bear 
on his_._O!)erational activity: he has _absolutely fluent French~ a solid and 
exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community. 
Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in 
depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and purs.ue 
IJ,cm actively either to the point of recruitrnent by anothc1· officer or elimina­
tion from further developm cnt", for whatever reason. 
In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable -improvement in this 
officer's pe.rformance during the period under review, the ~cviewcr submits 
that the letter grade for specific -duties 2 and 4 would.more properly have 
been a "P", and that the ovcTall_"rating, at this.point, would more accurately 
be ·set at a lev-el _b.ctween "P" and "S'i, probably closer to the former than 
the latter. 
Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared
