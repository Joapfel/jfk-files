SCENARIO OF CONTACT 
i arrived abo~t-0900 and took an inttructor. 
About 0950 oieq~ arrived to play with antl in­
structor on the adjoining court. He made no ef.fort·to 
greet me. He had been pointed.out to me by Val, but 
I had not been pointed out to him 60 my ~nowledge-~ 
though it is certain that Oleg and JVal must have 
discussed- the "players" in thoir"gamc'' and counted 1 
me as possibly on ~ho other team. That is, I am sur~, 
that Val has pointed me out to Oleg, but Oleg would 
not have wanted to acbnowledge this. 
-.At 1.000 rny hour was up and I told my instructor 
I was throliqh--I did not want to continue for another 
hour. As I 'ltas.paying my instructor l; noticed that 
Oleg was paying his. It ls very unusual ar.d posslblp 
even bad form to take an instructor for les~ than 
half-an-hour. I am suggesting that he_ wanted to bq 
free to contrive an accidental meeting with me. 
I set a course for one of the several gates 
from the courts we "1ere using. I could see that Oleg 
had headed for the same gate (this could have been 
perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some 
thirty yards wocld bring him to the gate at the same 
moment as I (this w:is not entirely natural). 
Since I had an excuse to greet hirn, h<\ving had 
hirr. pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto the preceding 
week, I did so. I rutkx:'1 said Good l'-:oi-ntng an~l asked 
if ~al were hore. He lookod v6ry pleased (I kthough~ 
possibly relieved) when I took tho initt«tive and 
recognized l".im. •
