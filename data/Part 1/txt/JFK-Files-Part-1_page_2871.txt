'SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
NOSENKO did not actively participate in the case until he 
received in Geneva a cable from Moscow directing him to give 
advice to the young and inexperienced .case officer V.L. ARTE­
MOV. ARTEMOV had not worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow 
either; he also had been sent to Geneva to work on counter­
intelligence matters and only to direct BELITSKIY d.f the Ameri­
cans should contact the agent. BELITSKIY had been ''inserted" 
in a World Health Organization Delegation in the hope that CIA 
would "find him". 
As a result of that KGB •instruction, NOSENKO jc.-1.ned with 
ARTEMOV in directing BELITSKIY's meetings with the latter's 
••. American case officers. BELITSKIY was first· mer in Geneva by 
the American case officer "Bob", and later by "Henry", who 
was "called out from the States". BELITSKIY noted tha,t the 
·name on the door of.the apartment where he met his American 
case officers was not the same as that of the_ person whose 
apartment it was alleged to be, and.that the apartment itself 
had an "un-lived-in" look. 
When the American case officers asked BELITSKIY whether he 
could establish contact with a Russian on the DisaJ;"mament 
Delegation, NOSENKO advised ARTEMOV not to use anyone from 
the Soviet Fore,ign Ministry. NOSENKO proposed instead that 
BELITSKIY claim to get information.from the head of the 
American Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV. The information, 
• of course, would be (disinformation) furnished by the KGB. 
In case the Americans would check, NOSENKO and ARTEMOV ar­
ranged for BELITSKIY to be introduced to KISLOV. 
The KGB believed that CIA had accepted BELITSKIY's bona 
fides. From the.KGB viewpoint, however, while BELITSKIY was 
not a bad agent, he was apt to go to.o far sometimes, and "add 
things .on his own". For· this reason, the KGB limited BELIT­
SKIY's time spent with CIA, to lessen the chance that the 
agent might say something which would cause CIA to sense that 
he was a plant.
