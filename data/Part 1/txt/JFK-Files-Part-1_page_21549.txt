When I worked 11 years in MVD-KGB I understood and found 
' 
out very many things, details and the real deal of the existing regime, ,, 
i 
·! about methods of the wo1:k of MGB-MVD-KGB and about their doings, 
about hundreds of tl1ousand~ of foe people of Russia who were (and 
still are) considered "politically" dangerous and around whom .was 
(and still is) going an active work of all. organs KGB. 
At the same tune when I was several times abroad I have 
seen personally the so-called "decay" at the West. I have seen in 
reality how is living people. 
Several times when I was abroad I"was thinking about staying· 
at the We&t and not returning in RuE1da, but .. only one thing was keepi,ng.;,·, .. 
' ,•' ,;: ',. ,, ·,, 
me •- my family. 
In 1962 in Switzerland I made the acquaintance with the 
. Americans. From my part "the sell of the information" was a real· 
show, ·1 was thinking that they would not. _believe me o-therwise. In 
that period of the time there was going a big struggle in me to stay, 
abroad or to return home till the last days o! living in Geneva an~ even 
when I was returning home in Vienna. 
In ·1962-1963 I decided definitely t:.at I did not want and could 
not live more in the Soviet Russia. In this period o! time_I have done· 
all my best to go as soon as possible abroad •.
