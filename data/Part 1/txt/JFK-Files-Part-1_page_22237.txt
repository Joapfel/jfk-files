NOSEl,KO has been the souc.:e of :na,~y interesting details and 
examples of KGB ~ocus ope~ar.di (Pages 359-3EO), but while useful 
for ill-..;strath·e p",Jrpo:;es and ,·aluablc because of the fact that 
the mc::terial 1,,·;is e3si ly collatable for st'.ldy p-.irposes, ncr.e of 
the r:ietto<!s described could be cor~!:idercd ne·• and revealing, and 
their E:XfOSure i:-, any event woulJ r.ot prev".?nt their cc-ntir,ucd cse 
in the future. ?.OSDIKO' s ciscussior. of ti":e or.ly double agent case 
in which he cla:ffi~ to have played a rol~. however, demonstrates 
his lack of kncr-lc.dge of the p:-i.nc1ple.;; ar,d p• .. q:oses of such an 
operatton. This case. EELIT~~IY, is a sub]~~t of :;e~arate

**Cther evidence r.as contrc?dicted state::,ents by NOSENKO to the 
effe~t: that certain Soviets were ~ot aftilia:ed with the KGB: 
in Geneva, for example, ~here he had daily access to the KGB 
Legal Residency for reonths and clai~ed nearly co~plete know­
ledge of KGB personnel, ht! r.amed 15 of a KGB staff which he 
said totalled ac the most 18: CIA ide:it:.ifi.:ations of KGB offi­
cers in Geneva on the basis of oth~r sources, investigations 
and analysis totalled at least double this number ar.d probably 
triple, as many as 55 of the approxi~ately l~O Soviets station­
ed there -(a proportion -..,hich is ccnsiste:it -with other-areas-
and def~ctors' estimates). NOSENKO was not entirely accurate 
concernittg evE:n KGB officers on his own delegation in Geneva, 
as noted on Pages 12 und 13. Therefore, the accuracy of 
NOSE:iKO's original ider.tifications, positive or negative, 
cannot be accepted without q",Jestion.
