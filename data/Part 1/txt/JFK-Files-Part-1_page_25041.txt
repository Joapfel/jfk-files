iof the RE!JTOP c;cc-tion who 
have been carried ur.C:e:r sn/ca:i. :foi• a fairly bng period o! 
tine. Since the tn.rc-cts of their access ·change froci time t·o 
time, aa well as the nature of the infornation they provide, 
fie do not believe they ,rnrra11t fipccial or r.ew projects to 
cover thc:,1. \1e do b~lievc I hov:cvcr,. th.:'lt they c.boulcl be

OD each. • 
b. Since their activities closely pnr~llel those of 
assets already co,vercd by LISACK, ,•1~ believe~ it would be 
logical .to include' LI:!O~Brn-1 and -2, LIOP.Dl~R-1 and Subject 
of 201-f.-1:JCi!i9 (on ,•,h<.,::t v:c a1·c av;aitinr; an Operational Approval) 
in.this Project. Althouch none of these is paid~ salary, 
such a change will rcr.uire soi:1e cost a1wnclrncnt to tho J>rojcct 
to account for minor operational o:,.:pense;s \'lhich have heretofore 
been charged to SB/OJ,\. Separate corrcsponclcnct! vill follow 
OD these nsi:;ets. •
