and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing 
to an interview or in any other way. 
Nosenko's Status 
To recapitulate, Noscnko entered the United States on 
12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions· 
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and ~ationality 
Act. Parole responsibilitf is delegated to the A~ency by 
the Attorney General under the terms of an agree□ent executed 
by the Attorney General and the r.:I on 10 February 1955, 
which states: 
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel­
ligence Agency will assume responsibility for 
care, supervison and control of a kind and 
degree it believes consistent with the interna1:· •• 
security needs of the United States during con­
tinuance of their parole itatus." 
In accordance with our understa11ding of this agreer:ient, and 
because we had reason to believe that ~osenko was a conscious 
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we 
ensured that he was under our dir-ect obsen·ation and control 
at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United
