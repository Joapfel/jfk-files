1. From about 1330 OLtil 1530 on 29 3eptember,19~7, LIRil;G/3 :Was 
given ah 3GSiIRL eza.:llination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu­
baya) with the SG:a'IRL operator at 0930 that ~~ming and remained vi.th 
the operator until the ezati.nation was co~pleted. ne had not biven LI­
RlliG/3 any previous notice of the nature or e~t.:lt or tbe·examination, 
but suiply asked hi~,on 27 September, to keep t~e entire day or 29 Septem­
ber tree for a le=~hy d.icussion with aowton. ~o·.ton introduced the SG­
S'dliL operator as se~or ~lbertini, a trusted nsc~io", and spent the first 
hour or so revie~iLg bis relationship aith LinI::G/3, ostensibly for the 
doubts tt..at he .hall u. the pa.st conce~g I.nc:;·'.V3's reporting, stated 
that Albertini had a ~eans or checkin5 scientidfically the trutb.f'ulness 
or LIRISG/3's sta~e:ients. Rowton explained t't.'it he was parti_Qularly con­
cernt:d abo-.:.t the :pssiblity of Lin::G/3 having doubled back with 1,-:-;;p,G 
and.maintaining vi.th them a secret ~--reement o! so~e sort to report on 
Rowton and his activities. 
2. LIRlliG/3 w:[et into a state cf visible shock at this and stated t:iat 
eve~ the thought or betrayiLg Rowtcn '!lad never occurred to him at any ti.me. 
-Vhen the S33•L:U. cpe~ator explained t~e scienti~ic means he was to ~eon 
LIBTh::i/3, the latter stated that be coald .not p-:ssibly 'accept this ~~ili­
ating means of testing hilll since it iifas dia;i:e::itrically opposed to bis 
principles. He pointed out that he had accepted Aowton·at his word and he 
could JDt see or_ ur.c.erstand why Rowton C-ll..ld not do the : sa...e for hill~ addi.nG '. 
that the whole thing smacked or methods used !>y o1CFA~ and LIRIIm. lie added • 
that il this meant that he would h::ive to breai with Ro~on, _then regret­
f'ully he would have to accept this al~ernative. ae explained th::it submit-
ins to tbe SG3~"IRL examination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and 
, profound relationship which be bad previo~sly !elt he enjoyed ~ith aowton.
