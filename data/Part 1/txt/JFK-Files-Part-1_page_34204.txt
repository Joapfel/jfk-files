1 • e..,•~inning with the brondcns t fo1• 19 Oc tobor 1965 the Station 
nt its 1•cqut.•st bognn receiving n summary of each AMSCUOLI, AMTIIIGH 
program. 1·" forward by scpa1·nto cover these summaries throuKh the 
ev~nin~ of 20 Jununry"l966 (with tho exception of the periods of 
28-30 November and 2-4 Januni·y for which no summary- wn~ prepnrod). 
Henc~forth those summnrie1:1 will bo forwarded on 11n at least bi-weekly, 
basis. 
2. Tht) Station is nttcmpting to improve both tho punch nnd the 
qunli ty of these programs. Wo bcliovo, for cxnmplo, .tha t more 
emphasis should be plncod upon- regime failures ,~nd uf:m tho needless 
economic tnt)ss. Further, we arc ti•ying to refine tho "irritability" 
f'ncto1· so fnr as Castro and the 1·ogime nre concerned due to the 
sensi Uvi·ty of Castro to this type of attack. Calling C~stro (on 
19 Janun1·y) the "Soviets' barking hound dog" is· a sally in this 
direction. • 
3. As usunl with programs of this, nature the size nnd reaction of 
the nudienco is most difficult to nsccrtain. It is some comfort to be 
able to record that dul'ing this period· lo letters hnve been received 
by A.\ISCROLL t"hat have been inspil'ed by._ this prog'l'nm. Tho President's 
- uncle, Carlos Dorticos, told Al\fSCROLL-3 that he hnd been n frequent 
listt:tne1· -to this program and thn t ho had 11s tcued to this program at 
his home the night before he left Cuba.
