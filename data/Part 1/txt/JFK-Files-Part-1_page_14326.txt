thnt.a.coup~e of ,-pats on SAMKO's ·back is sufficient to reward him. 
fo; Contact w'as again ·made with SMIKO on the eve of his 
possible luncheon engagement with AMAlITO-L We again reviewed 
the objectives ~nd he ~as given a defensive briefing as suggested 
by \HI/Miami. He was told that, PACHANKIS probably would not 
visit with him for about two weeks after his return nnd tha~ he 
shoulil not attempt to get in touch with P,\CHANKIS, He under­
stood why this was necessary and agreed with·the briefing • 
. If u luncheon could .be atrangecl, SAMKO was asked to concentrate 
on the following: (in addition to the requirements he was given 
b~fore his first· meet with AMAUf0-1) 
.-\, Try to ascertain AMAUf0-1 's future, his: 
ambiti?nj, his next possible assignment. 
B. If possible engage him in a conversatio~ 
regarding the United States to get his 
reaction toward our problems. 
C. Build ·up your successes·and reflect on how 
A~L.\lIT0-1 might have achieved similar' goals 
had he remained in the United. States·. 
D. Be alert for any opening to inject questions 
relating to the Cuban economy vis-a-vis the 
failure of the "ten million", but to avoi_d 
criticis.m for this. failure, and show,syr.)pathy.

ment. that he h~d to remain in the hotel until Saturda~. 6 June. 
l{e spoke dii-ectly with the manager and told the manager ttnt 
he was planning-· to leave on 7 June for Barcelona _and would stay 
at a sister hotel and asked the manage1· .to make resen•a t ions 
for him~ The crisis had passed. '
