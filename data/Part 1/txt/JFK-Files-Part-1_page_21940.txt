fi~H were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO 
stated that h~ read the files on th~se seven perscns •slowly 
and made some extracts for myself in my personal log--such things 
as notation·s of their dates of arrival, things I could not remem­
ber,• He was also given the files .. _on the agents surrounding . 
these correspondents, their drive£~, rnai<ls, and ccoks. 
b.· ~onta Reporting on Correspondents 
NOSENKO said he was responsible for haridlin; the agents who 
were reporting on SHAPIRO, WHIT~F.Y, SALISBURY and th~ G!LMOREs 
and mcl with them regularly to learn whether "anything was n~w, 
who did SHAPIRO meet,· what might be interesting in his beha•,icr, 
what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contact~ng, 
etc," lie then reported to KOZLOV and woul~1 som~times prepare a 
writton report of his conver~ations with the age~ts, Asked to 
describe these meetings, NOSE!;r.o replied: "L~t us take the same 
case of SHAPIRO. r would meet drivers about three times c1 month 
or even two times. ht the lt'eeting I would ask thE> driver what 
was new in SlihPIRr.'s behavior aince our. last meei:ing, whether 
.SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with foreigners, about his neet­
inqs with Russians, were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was 
SHAPI no walking Le hind the person h,~ met. And then the man 
(agent) would begin his report. Of course, if he spots anything 
suspicious !1c calls immediately, and I would see ni:n the next 
rnon1inq, Otherwise, I wc,uld tell hirn at the rneeting that I 
w6ulrl aje him again in about ten days or in two weeks, but if 
there was something interestir,g he should call ir.:mediately. 
It was the sar'.le with the maid and the cook. t:pon returning to 
the office I would have to report to KOZLOV about my meetings, 
either orally or in writing. If, for example, [V.M.)'KOVSHUK 
(also of the U .. s. Embassy Section) had a m~etir.g with his agents, 
he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni­
ent to both. If the meetings were taking place late in the day 
and lasted until midnight or later and there wera no written 
materials submitted at the meeting, I could go heme and then re­
port the next morning." 
KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various 
ag_ents surrounding the correspondents. "At first he was teach­
ing me. Then he would go in cases when something interesting 
would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop 
but ~hen there may have been a hint in a case of some other case 
officer." 
NOSENKO's age~t network consisted mainly of domestic and 
clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their 
families, Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964: 
•My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was workir.g at 
GILMORE's place. She also worked at the Associated Press later. 
Her codename was 'AGLODHJA-' , a funny one. My second agent was 
a chauffeur whose codename, I think~ was 'SERGEY'. I think he 
was driving WHITNEY. Then I also had SHAPIRO'S chauffeur, a 
funny little fellow. In other words, charwomen, chauffeurs,' ·,. 
this was my. agen tura [agent network] . " Al though NOSENKO was·· 
able to give a.breakdown of this network in terms of the number 
and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he 
( had forgotte:1 their ~rue names and could no.1;··prov~de deta_iled 
personality 1.nformat1.on on any of them. He expla1.n.ed: •1 don't 
remember now. They all passed by.like a river because they were 
~urned over often.• NOSENKO did recall that it was he who 
aele_c:ted _an_d. handled the agent who was. placed in SHAPI.RO' a office. 
~• a secretary; thi_s agent had e_arlier worked in the offices of 
.Hoacow News, an English-language newspaper published in Moacov. - .
