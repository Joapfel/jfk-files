chnrnctcristicnlly kceping:·.his actions con·cct, !las stressed 
to the Spanish thnt Cuba ,di 1 not use the trn.nsmi tter for other 
·thnn legitimate commcrcinl ·purposes. RUIZ even off<:rcd to allow---­
Spauish cit-izcns to operate·· the sta_tion in order to emphasize 
his point. • 
2.0. Correct ns he generally is in his professional 
behavior, RUIZ madu what appears to ue R mistake in discussing 
with members of his staff the possibi-J i ty of t~el ling Hav:rna that 
n Spanish forci,;n sci·vice off icei· scheduled for duty there (Juan 
TORHODA" Gome;-:, cf. OS~IA-25692) might he open for recruitment. ·1r 
one ·recnlls RUIZ' constant w:-irninGs that his off.ice is bugged by 
Scg-uridnd, the discussion auout TORHOllA clearly exposes him to • 
nefion by the Spanish nuthoritfes. 
21. RUIZ himself is the tnrgct of whnt appears to be 
control by Juan Antonio .CUTU3ELO Lemus (201-7335,H) who is • 
· Rllegcdly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs 
but w!to seems to be the "security man" in the Er.1hassy. (We 
note that CUHBELO' s photog1-;i ph v;a::; shO\Vn to J\!,!.DED~l','-1, who did 
not recognixe the likeness). RUIZ has cti~Jlnincd nt least once 
that he needs a·"real" cultural attaehc. ·cur.BELO has i11structcd 
the front-d9sk girl to pass on to him a sum1~::iry of who secs whom 
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including flUIZ' visitors. 
(Given HUil~' near-mania for runnin~ his own shop, CI!RDEI.O must 
indeed exert an ,acknowledged security control). 
22. Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears 
Rddicted to taldng automobile jaunts by himself to the interior 
of the country. _: He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he . 
is probably cxpo'si°ng himself to attack uy Cullan cxi les. Given tlic 
reception accorded to Carlos AI.F,\R,\S . ."1nuando 11:\flT, and Ca1·los 
CIIAlN at the·narajas ai.rport in June 1068; RU~Z niight be • 
unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told nnyonc of 
\I/here he i;oes or· what he docs, and both his. wife and CURBELO 
strongly disapprcJVc of his custom.
