I found the somiDD.r"extremely in!ormatlve and worthwhlle from the 11tandpoint 
of examining the historical progression 0£ the ADP from sev~ral polnh 0£ via.w, All 
the speakers were high½' quall!led in their particular field 'and their presentations wero 
well prepared, All were exceptionally apt ln fielding questions. 
Mr, Bert Engelhardt. As soc:late Director, ADP Management Center, csc, was 
...... a. ... gr:acio11a-h.o.t,,a,nd,ha.ndled .. b1.s. .. r.ole..,a,&.modera.tor.,.ln.a tr.uly. proi.easlanal.manner. He 
has an engaging, friendly personality anci ls cfiec:ilvely articulate. If I were to singltt 
ou~.~~y we~k_neas ll would be Mr. Engelna·rdt's)'!cture. He spoke on the Systems . 
Arialy·st~ In his presentation he seemed not to tilke Into c:onslderatlon the professional 
level of the group and tl!)voted.an lnordlnate amount of time on basic managerial 
prl!ICepts .. TMa seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue 
0£ their positions had considerable experience in the management field. 
Overall I would say, notwithstanding the above observation, lt ls an Interesting 
and ef£ectlve program, . '.
