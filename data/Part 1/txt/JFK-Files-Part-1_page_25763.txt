B. l™MW-7959, 12 August 1959. 
1. Forwarded herewith as Altachment N::i. One is GERf!NDE's signed 
contract amendment. GERENDE is most appreciative': for the ral.w In salary 
and is delighted with the new Terminal Pc1yn,l!nt claus::. 
2. The Station interprets the TermlMl Payn~ent clause 10 mean any 
termination by the Govt!nrnwnc or acc~pcance uf GERENDE's rc~l;~ation in 
the "~~t interests of the Govern:1·,cnr." Exa mplcs in connecl Ion • ..,. Ith the "bc.;c 
bter,.:su uf the Govem:nem" Interpretation would involve GERENDE's resib'llatlun 
for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a dwng~ of rcsid~ncl.! 
to some geographical ar~ where his s:.:rvices could nor be utillz;,:J by KUBARK. 
Assuming that no security problems arl.! Involved In making such a payment, the 
, Station also interprets the clause co be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate 
in the event of his d~h while In the employ of KUBARK. 
3. TI1e Station und~rstands clearly why the clause was not written as • • 
origlnally requested and concun, in ~katlquartcrs reasoning. Cc.mainly, the Station 
would not wane to glve GER ENDE a terminal payment, and he ha~ l,cen so informed, 
if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other 
career. The s~ation hastens lo add, however, that to the best of ltR knowledge, 
GERENDE has no Intention of resig:nlng from his prcs,::nt KURAHK job. 
4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Anachmem No. Two are the 
original and one copy cf the contract amendment dared 1 s~ptembcr 1957. Head­
quaners wili. note that the amendm .. >nt was accepted by GERENDE and approved by 
the Chief of Sration, but was not formally witnessed. It is suggested that Matthew 
S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquaners, re requested to witness the 
document. DrnGLEY ,.-as the Case Officer handling GERE."'lOE at the time this 
amendment became effective.
