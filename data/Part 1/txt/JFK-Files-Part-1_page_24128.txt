1. QREB0NY/1 told RODIGAST at their ciost recent !!1eetln11; that .~e did not 
have to file an overt tax fonn for 1966 because his ~oss overt inccr-:e for 1966 
was less than $600. This will oot be true for the 1967 tax year a:1d he will 
have to file in the Sprine; of 1968. The operative sentence in the 1966 Tax 
Guide For US Citizens Abroad, US Treasury Dert IP.3 Pub No 5 .. states--"Every 
citizeo of the United States, regardless of where he resides who is under 65 
years of age and has a e;ross inco:ne of $600 or more durin~ a tax year must 
file an Income tax return." 
2. For the record the undersismed who is as yet unfa'1iliar with all 
administrative details, would appreciate HQS confinnation of the above.
