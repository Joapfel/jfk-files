had been involved soaehow ~1th her Bister who Jive■ in Florida. ABAD 
a■ked wbetber AllfAUNA-14 had been a irood friend of AMFAUNA-3, and ahe 
■aid tbat ■be had been. ABAD a•ked whether AIIFAUNA-14 had ever heard 
AMl'AUBA-3 ■peak about the B■cambray insurgents. AMFAUNA-14' ■ aid that 
■be bad not. ABAD a■ked whether AIIFAUNA-3 had had contacts with any 
nbuay people, tor example the Spaniah Bmba~•Y• AMFAUNA-14 said that 
■be did not know of any such contact■. 
3'1. • ''Bow abc-ut AHCUTLRR-2?" aakecl ABAD. "W13 know ~hat she spends 
a lot of time thtlre." AMFAUNA-14 ■ aid she did r,-:>t know. 
31. ABAD aaked AMFAUNA-14 if she were a revolutionary. AJIFAUNA-14 
■aid tbat &be wa■ not, but that neither was !,he against the re-~,olution. 
lb• ■ aid that ahe had joined the militia eaxly in the revolution; but 
bad ■ooD dropped out becauae there were som4 thinr,a about the revolution 
wbicb ahe did not understand. For inatance, she could not understand 
wb7 tbere ebould be so many shortages and rationing, whereas before the 
rnolution there had been plenty. ABAD expl 1111ined that the shortages wer 
tbe reault of tbe imperialist blockade ot C\.~ha. AMFAUNA-14 &8\id that 
abe could understand thia, but that it did not explain why there should 
bit a aborta,re of coffee when Cuba grew its own. ABAD said that coffee 
waa in abort supply because Cuba was sending coffee to the Soviet Union 
tn ll"&titude for Soviet assistance in overcoming shortages caused by the 
iaporiali■t blockade.· • AMFAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical 
now that it bad been explained to her, and said she wondered why tbe 
revolutionary 10vernment did not publicly say so in order to put an en_d 
to public srumblin1 on the subject. 
39. · Barly in the morning of 9. October, ABAD produced the letter ·-.... 
wbtcb a•AUNA~l4 received from AIIFAUNA-1 on 7 October and held up the 
letter to the light, examining it carefully for traces of SW. AKFAUNA- I

wbtcb abe did in the presence ot ABAD, "Carlos," and.· a third man whom 
11be WU unable.to get a good look at. All were very surprised and 
dtaappointed when no secret writing appeared. They kept asking her it 
&be nre aure she was doing it right, and began intimating that she was· 
dece_iving them. (Station Comment: It ts indeed surprising that no 
■ecret writing appeared, because this letter was almost· undoubtedly the.~ 
one containing SW message no.· l to AMFAUNA-14.) _:;-
40. AlllAUNA-14 also explained the use of her carbons. The only 
accoamodatlon address she gave away was AMFA~NA-l's JMWAVB area post 
office box. She deliberately protectqd the @?•• JUSTIZ 'address. (the 
boae of AIIPAN-2), not knowing whether this was a re~J ozt'a fictitious 
~n~. ~~l 
41. "Carlo•" and ABAD now invited AMPAUNA-14 to work with them. She 
,eplied tbat ■be might be willing to do so, but first wanted to know 
wbat work would be expected other. For instance, ■he said, she would 
not tnfon on people in her office. They told her that this would not 
be uadar ber, because that sort ot work 1• done by the Defense 
Collaitt•••• Ber work, they aaid, would be much more important, namely 
-1nt•inin1 a link between tbem■ elves and KUBARK. She said that would 
m a11··riabt, but mbe was afraid that it would not last long because 
&VBAa would probably put her on ice as soon as they learned that she 
bad been arreated. They told ber not to worry about.that. 
41. • "Carlos" and ABAD suggea:ted to her that AMPAUNA-1 had briefed 
ber to agree to cooperate with them. She denied this, claiming that she 
bad not really wanted to work with AKFAUNA-1 at all, but bad-merely let 
beraolf be i■posed on for old times sak&. They asked whether they 
could trust ber. She ••Jdahe thought so, and asked whether she could 
truat_ tbea to ksep tbeir>promises. They assured her that she could, 
and •aid abe would be releaaed the following day.
