Continuntion of Section ll of Fltnc% lkport on llaniC'l Flore's, 
GS-12, for period 22 June - 19 November 1976 •••••••••••••••• 
niques for n U.S. citizen who l:1 scheduled to scr\'c :ts :rn NOC 
Officer in the Caribbean. 
Th<' first independent training task given to Mr. Flores 
was of a third-national flrld aKent serving as an :t~~c:-s agent, 
but this tusk was cancelled at the last minute wh<'n the con• 
cerned Base discovered grounds for field termination of the 
agent rather than providing tutorial training for the. agent in 
the U.S. Hr. Flores was juHifiably irritated at this turn of 
events which denied him 1..Jwt held promise for being :1 challeng· 
ing initial training program. 
It was with regret that we learned, early into what turned 
out to be Mr . .Flores' only _independent training progr:1rn, that 
a priority requirer.icnt of his homc-hase llivision w~uld ncccssi·: 
-----~ tate his r<.'turn to Division duty soonest. The nivii;ion agrcNt ; 
• to our request that Mr. Flores conclude the training program 
he had tailored, and begtin, nnd Mr. Flores is to he co~~cndcd 
for having done an exceptionally· fine Job in this assignment. 
The completion-of-training report was also well organi:cd, and 
the questionnaire which asks for an evaluntive follow-up from 
the trainee's field_Station is to the point. 
Early in his assignment Mr. Flores took over the maintcn- . 
ance and improvement of thr U~it's operations trnining sliJ~s, 
c<;>nsolidatcd them into an extremely functionr.l pack:t>:e, nml 
solicited ideas from other instructors to improve th~ r:1ckagc, 
Much to his credit and the Unit's benefit, Mr. Flores m3nagcd 
to persuade another Agency to~poncnt to undcrtake--without 
charge--a major rcvampini: of ~omc of the slides using comp11tor­
.dcsjg11e,I nrt worJ.: to replace some of the less imprcssin• early 
work in this field.
