- Dear~~,-~, 
0 YALERIY VLADIMIROVI~H KOSTIKOV-
1. Please refer to our conversation of 6 May. KOSTIKOV, born 17 March 
1933, Moscow, was posted to Beirut in 1978 as 1st Secretary and may still 
be there. He is identified KGB and _s_e_rv_e_d_i_n_M_e_x-i_c_o_C_i_t..,_y_f_r_o_m_1_9_6_1_-_7_1. 
There is a reference to him on page 307 of BARRON's KGB which suggests 
that he may have been Department V. We do not appear to have asked LYALIN 
about him, and are now doing so. 
2. We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that accerding to a CIA 
telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City. 
According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and 
November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly 
a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive. 
3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious. As 
you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in conanon with other Western Missions, 
has been subject b threats and violence in recent months, and in view of 
earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records 
of KGB staff in the area who might have been involved in promoting strong-arm 
tactics. 
4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to 
be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and for 
any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. In 
particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that 
KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Beirut or Damascus whose 
trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse? 
5. We should be grateful for an early reply and as I said on 6 May will treat 
anything you can tell us on a strictly Service to Service basis.
