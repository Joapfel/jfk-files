- -·. - · a. Bogota, The AMSPELL team arri\·ed in Bo~ota on 12 February 
1964. but -.·ere unaLlc to make contact with the local Al.'.SPE.LL/AMDARB 
contact until tlic ucxt day. They were u1:able to ge·t adequatP. ndvance 
publicity and had. -trouble finding space for tt1e exhicit. A!Jout 200.. •

. appi•oxima·te-ly 485· persons. HLDA-69llrcportcd@Ij~~-9's observations 
on the local reaction to the tour, which 11e ju<lgecr"lifo t-e indifferent. 
The AMSPELL teaiii frceiy admitted tQ WAVE that the Bogota operation was 
something less than s_uc_cessful, but···blamcd the lack of adnrnce prepara­
tions and the existeuce of an unfrlend ly press for t?:eir failure. It 
should also be noted tha.t the. AMSPELL team was not on the best of tel"JIIS 
with some of the·':local CubanS 1 and ·this fact p1•obabl;, had a good· deal 
to do with the poor showing. 
b. Medel l!n. The showing in Medellin was better than in 
Bogota. The press was lukewarm but the director of the C;iracol radio 
.station g_a,ve thei,n:_collSiderahle publicity, and they were able to hold 
tile exhibit in a:;,.central spot in the city. About 400 persons visited 
the ex.hibit O\"er :,a period of three days, and 850 persons attended con-. 
ferences given .by the • team. • 
c. caii. Tho team received ~ood. advance p1-ess ptay in Cali, 
which was perhaps one reason for the fact t!1at the local Communist party 
was also well prepared for their arrival .. On the very first morning 
of the exhibit, a large crowd of·co~munists tried to enter tne exhibit 
with the obvious intention of starting trouble: and when they were . 
locked out began to throw rocks m'id "stinkbombs" into ttie exhibit hall. 
The incident provided considerable publicity for,. AMSPELL, as reported 
in BOGO 4332. A total of 100 persons attended tile exhibit. The AMSPELL 
team claimed tnat the Communists were very strong in Cali and that work­
ing there was like swimming upstream. 
3. ECl'ADOR. 
a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend­
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas fo1· Peru. 
QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality c lash~s with the 
local AMBARBs. and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team, 
who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities 
fo1· tile exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th. 
One member remained in Bogota to hold confo1·ences, attended by 3~5. 
persons. While not accepting the blame for this fiasco,· the AMSPELL 
team gene1·ally corroborated trte above story in their debriefing by WAVE. 
After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867 1 _ we are reluctant to 
recommend an, future tours. 
b. Guay~au.1,1. The AJ.ISPELL team considered Guayaquil their 
most successft:l opcra~fon·, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base who 
termed it a "resour.d ing success." (See QUIT 5867 and. HEGA 2900). The 
exhibit received front page· coverage in "El Universo" and "Ei Teleg1·afo" 
and they wer~ ~ive11 a half hour on a ir.ajor TV station. An estimated ' 
total of 1 1 200 persons visited the exhibit, and the team spoke before 
40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional. 
4. Santiago, Chile. 
The :\~!SPELL team arrived in s~utiago on :i March to coincide 
with the opening of ~he Latin American Youth Congress {L-\YC). The 
Santiago operation was a complete loss because Cl_1ilean customs authori­
ties would not 1·elease the exhibit during the congress and the AMS.PELL 
team- was unable t.o obtain space of any kind to hold c.-:,:,.ferences dt:e to 
competition from the congress for space. (See SAGO t-377). The ,')MSPELL 
team had bee::i counting on a contact in the Catho\ic r:i~versity U:.ernando 
SANHUESA, )to facilitate their activities but ~AXHl"ES.\Jta,ld th;m that 
the LAYC \\"as a failure from the Communist side and that"t'he AMSPELL tean 
could contribute more by remaining quiet than. by actively propagandizin,::
