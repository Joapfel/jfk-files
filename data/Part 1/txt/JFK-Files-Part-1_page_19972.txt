I have had opportunity to observe subject's perfor~ance closely 
for ntne months and ~hil~ I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings 
of the duties as listed, it should be noted. that these s·ame duties could 
be performed ec~ually well by a more Juni.or Intel Clerk o_r Intel Assistant 
and, therefore, the overall rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not 
accurately reflect his capability. In my opinion it w9uld be very diffi­
cult, if not impossible,. for subject to perform competitively with ·other 
Intel Assistants at a GS-8 level, and I recommend his position title be 
changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs. capably.
