penetration o! the CommuniBt Party; sn_d ·press placement activity. The breadth of these 
operational commitments attests Subje~t•s profe1111ional ability and vereatility, (This 
would be ·a ocnior case officer's load by any de!lcription and Subject's perfor111.:1nce at 
it wao the r.l"aaon behind our recommendation for accelerated promotion last year.) 
.. ran~f_ularly against the difficult MFCIIEEK target, this officer has displayed 
admirable determination despite the-inherent frustrations and disappointments of work­
ing against this remote and_ suspicious group, During the period under review, his job 
has been the more difficult·since the HPCHEEKS, in all probability reacting to a 
Station attempted recruitment operation (in which Subject played a major role), have 
withdrawn into a defensive shell which makes access operations verge on the impossible, 
Nevertheless, he has.continued to probe their defenses, and has managed-to develop t~-o 
leads whic;h, with the exercise of patience and application of his proven operatioraRl 
reaources, could eventually give us access to the official MPCIIEEK Mission here. This 
officer refuses to become discouraged, a quality o~ficers working on hard targets must 
have.

As described, this officer is a steady and solid performer who carries a major 
case load securely, productivelr, and without complaint. He has even volunteered 
to take on-additional work when he has seen opportunities to help the ~tation's 
overall mission. Because he blends in w~ll on the local scene, he is often 
drafted for afl kinds of ad hoc operational work. This is invariably well done. 
He io operation.ally aggreBsive b11t also shows lively awareness of the tricky 
operational cl1mate here and does not push b1,yor1d what the traffic will bear. 
His agents respect his seriousness. which permits him to get more utility out of 
them. Ila ls a pillar of this Stat-ion,
