4. Q feels that she ls eraotlonally unstable--hls fin:mess in dealing vith 
her, his caking ii: clear he was not out for uer body, have Eade blm a guardian 
and true friend. She seeDlS to be n &ood political reporter, understanding her 
own (confused) political yearnlngs and vhere her varicu: co:it..c:s stand.i sh~ • 
also seems to have a good me1110ry for details. Q says that her "ant1-revis1onism" 
is incipient ant1-C011111Unism. lie could eventually recruit her as an ODYOl~ witting 
agent, but that would take a lot of time and trouble; with cuch less effort he 
could effect a false-flag recrultt1ent, and indeed, he has already cione this on an 
infonnal basis by making it clear that he was collectln~ i.iaterial for hi& Chlcom 
friends. She would undertake further assl:;naents for ~im. ile actually asked her, 
"Suppose I asked you to go soaewhere, would you so?" To which she re?lied. "If 
it's not cold." It 1s unlikely, however, that she would be able to return to Dar 
because of Phombe.ab'• hostility. Wherever she goes, her 1aaiD asset vill be ber 
physical attractioa. 
s. She could be debriefed further on any point raised in tbe tape interview. 
Tbe ideal would be to have the questions by the time Q goes to Rome in the second 
half of April, but tbi~ does not seem to be a likely possibility.
