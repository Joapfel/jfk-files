A day er two boforo I sailed for ~'urope in Janunry, 19SJ,·I recaiv-ed 
a·.typcd manuscript copy of tho ''Progress Rep0rt on th<.1 College ~o l'Europe 
1.1.bre", wh1.ch ha:> no-;; appeared 1n mtncoln•aplied fer~! under date of February 
27,. 19$3, over t?:.> s.i.gnaturu11 of il0yall Tyl(!r and :tlchard Soarsl 
· I adnit to considerable curiosity when thls doc~nt appoared. In 
tho covering lett.!: Ro7nll Tyler J:10roly statdJ, "It comes frrun riick St!arsQ.

illll?"Cdiatdy that t,his nir_:ht,. be a counter foil to Hhat it w:.!J e:xp~cted I 
would find. In 1"11,ily to a direct inqu.lry from ,:e, Sears now states it was

eituatio:-,. It e::x-dics a point of.view that the operntion at Stra::ibourg
