1. TDY in 1962 
Wheri NOSENK'l ar1•tvrd in Geneva for··thc first time on 
10 March 1962, he waM listed officially as a Soviet ~inistry of 
-i Foreign Affa.irs "~xp111•t" ~i th the Delegation to the disarmament 
talks. Early durit1K his second meeting with CI.~ on 11 June 1962, 
NOSENKO was asked to oxplain precisely why he had been sent out 
to Geneva. Ho rr!plirnl as follows: ."Right now, I came to pro­
vide counterintel 111-(t'llcc support to the Disarmament Delegation, .. , 
There ia a special [KGUJ d~partment for delegations, a special 
one, recentl)' cr•~ntn,I, And ·the chief of this dcpartrr,ent is 
simul talieously a deputy chief of the [ Second Chief! Directorate. 
He is both chief oJ' ·the department and deputy chief of the 
directorate so that lhurc will be a person who can be held re­
sponsible if anythiu~ hap:;,ens. Understand? The chief of the 
directorate [O.M. GlttUANOVj hated tci sign ail sorts of recom­
mendations and SrJ on, when som€:one can run off in Belgium or 
wherever he may be~ This happened ~ore than once, and he was 
summoned before tl1r. I CPSU! Centra_l Committeo. Therefore, he 
decided to crcat•1 a 110w position. 'i'hP pPrson holding it is 
sjmultancously chief uf the department and deputy chief of the 
directorate and per~µ11ally signs off on all matters ccncerning 
exits !from the USSIII. 1his was in order to avoid being called 
on tlie carpet ... :;o t.111\t hlame would fnll not on the chief of 
the directorate, but on his deputy, who is in char;e of this 
department and who Hi~ned off ... 
"This department," NOSENKO continued, "is concerned with 
departures abroad, thnt is, it checks all Soviet citizens who 
intend to travel abrund, both alon~ and as members of delegations. 
S_ince GOLITSYN [dcfrwted] in Finland, we have an O!'der that no 
delegation is to bo 11,t out without an operational worker, not· 
a single dcleGation.,, With me it happened as follows: I was 
not planning to go. 'l'hey told me: 'You are going.' I said: 
'I can't. I have a Hcction. I have 15 people there, all 
operating people. Am ·1 Eupposed to dump them? What can I do?' 
'No, you are going,' was the reply. 'And what did tte chief 
order?' I asked. Tho chief (NOSENKO was referring to GRIBANOV 
when he spoke of the "chief".) said: 'GROMYKO is going this 
time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is going, and somebody 
on an appropriate lovul must go with him. Not a case officer, 
not a senior case officer, not a deputy, but the chief of a 
section, or the deputy chief of a department, or a department 
chief.' Well, I was the most junior section chief. I was 
called in to my chiaf, my immediate chief, who is concerned 
with the Seventh Depn1·tment. They had told him that it would 
be for a month and on this basis he gave me permiss.1.on. And 
I have been here since 10 }!arch." 
Later during this second meeting NOSENKO voluntee_red that 
in addition to his 8ccurit~ officer functions in Geneva, he had 
a special issignrnent to ch~ck on P.F. SHAKHOV, a senior advisor 
to the Soviet Delegation.• SHAKHOV hnd been noted in contact 
*CIA records show thnt SHAKHOV has served in and visited the 
United States on numorous occasions since 1942. when he was 
assigned at the Soviet Consulate General in New York. He
