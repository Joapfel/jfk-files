she should tell LIRe;G-2, felt, after listening to LIRISG',.:.4' s : 
report, that the latter had at least partly succeeded in i 
lessening LIRIXG-2's suspicions. These su.spicions may have I 
been further reduced after LIRIXG-3's discussion with LIRl~G-~ 
on 26 February. ROi"TOX did expect LIRIXG-2's questions and k 
felt in the end that he had "passed the test." r 
6. The StAtion does not know at this point whether I 
LIRIXG-4 will get a PBRUME~ 'entry visa b:it is still optirnistid 
that she wi ~ 1. The PBRUl!E..~ers appear convinced that there is f 
serious trouble bct~een her and LIRING-3, and LIRIXG-1, to I 
whom LIRIXG-4 wrote for help recently, asked her to be patient, 
pointing out that re4 tape in PBRU!IIEN takes time. The !' 
possibility that the PBRUl!Bers may allC7'11' LIRIXG-4 in their i 
country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband 
and some of her friends has occurred to ROWTOX and the Station. 
Such a possibility is, however, most unlikely as the object 
of the PBRU~ suspicions is Llft!XG-3 and net LIRIXG-4, ·,;;;ho 
bas several times told them that she knO'B's little of what 
LIRING-3 does. The most important consider~tion, however, is 
that LIRIXG-4 is married to a }!exican citi;.·_,1, and as 
suspicious as they cay be of the latter's doings, the

this Mexican has done anything against their regime. On the 
contrary, LIRIXG-3 has time and again warned them of impending 
difficulties or problems. The fact that LIRIXG-4 is married 
to 3. ~;r,xican and that she enjoys the status of immigrant in 
Mexico is also the best assurance that s~e would be allQWed 
to return to Mexico, as the PBP.U~ENers ..-ant no trouble with 
✓the Mexicans. The SGSWIRL exaDination recently given LIRISG-4 
bas cleared the air at least on two points. First, that ' 
LIRING-4 is not an enemy penetration, and, second, that ~he 
has not revealed the nature :a!!d extent c! her contacts ~ith 
ROWTOS to anyone else than LIRI~G-3. The Station agrees with· 
ROWTOY that LIRIYG-4 would, if given a chance, prove herself 
to be a good asset. As for the question of being left .-ith 
continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRIXG-3 anci 
LIRING-4 know that there is HTt-l,o ~QW"IV\'I:' rnnlrl rln hoynnrl 
providing legal-type advice to bring LIRIXG-4 back to Mexico ' 
if the PBRl'MEiers refused to allow h~r to .1·eturn to her husband, 
an unlikely possibility as me~~ioned above in vi~w of current 
Mexican/PBRUllEN relations. The letter of understa.u.iing signed 
by LIRIXG-4 specifies the extent of ROWTOY's col!IIDitment and 
leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations. :The 
Station hopes that LIRI~G-4's relationship with LIRIXG-3 .will 
not improve with time to the point where she will lose the 
proper cotivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUYEN 
for which she bas been trained and briefed. ' 
7. The attempt made tc exploit Carnen LOZADA's trip to 
-PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information 
on a number of persons she knows who have operational po~ential 
turned out to be a complete failure. LOZADA ran into such 
difficult family problems in PBRUMEN' that she had no tim~ (ori 
as it turned out, desire) to obtain the information requestedf 
of her. The strain of her personal problems was such t.bat 
she nearly bad a nervou~ breakdown after returning to Mexico­
City on 16 February. Not even LIRI~G-3 could get anythirlg out 
or her. The victim of a type of family blackmail by her!pro-! 
Alrl'HUG husband, LOZADA returned to PBRl'~ on 15 March. ~ ; 
ROWTOY did not fare much bette-r with Rodolfo REYES Cortes, 
who returned to Mexico City in early March. REYES, who ts f 
preparing to go to Chile to put on_· a ballet performance, bas. f 
been extremely busy since his return with private and I 
professional matters. ROWTO~ nevertheless mana&ed to de~rief
