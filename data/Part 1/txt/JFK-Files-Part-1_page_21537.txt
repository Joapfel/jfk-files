in Soviet organizations and more specifically in the KGB. As an example, 
a Chief of Department in the KGB or the Chief of a Residcntura abroad 
may have Z, 3 or even 4 cieputies, one oi whom is given the tit~e oi 
First Deputy. This particular deputy acts in the absence of the Chief 
of Department and in gcncr;d has supervisory functions over all the 
Department se·ctions. The exception to the latter is when the Chief of 
Do?partment retains direct supervision over what he may consider t~e

with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department 
in la,te May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the Fiut Section, First Depart­
ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available
