take part in some M-L study groups but didn't 
say what exactly would be studied. The 
following are some general comments QRPHONE 
provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like 
Newark, be bas been mugged several times and 
would like to go back to California; however, 
that is not possible at this time, so Bergman 
will instead move to New York City. Bergman 
is pleased with the current development of the 
RU. He said that the recent trip to China by 
several RU members was successful and that the 
trip bad been pleasant for them. QRPHONE 
commented that it appears that Bergman does not 
have the same control of the RU that he formerly 
had, although be is regarded as the "guru" of 
the RU.

QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting 
to sell the English language rights of 
Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA. 
Ward bad been trying to get Lyle Stuart to 
purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy 
toward Wilfred Burchett,· "that old Communist" 
according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett 
apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't 
want to publish anything with bis name on it. 
QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and 
convinced him to at least read the manuscript of 
the book before be turned it down.· Ward ·bas a 
South Vietnamese student ll°ving with him as a 
combination houseboy/companion. This student, 
whose name is David Truong, is the son of the 
South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong 
Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 Sauth Vietnames eleetion 
on a peace platform and who is now in prison._ 
QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large 
collection of books on intelligence, that the 
books are expensive and that be doesn't have any 
idea where the money to buy the books came from. 
He also said be doesn't think Truong bas 
immigration. papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I 
·asked if Truong was in any way involved with the 
recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE 
stated tba~ Truong knew the hijackers and might have 
known something about the attempted hijacking 
because the hijackers bad also stayed at Ward's 
apartment.
