It ls Important to Il(Xe here that LICALLA occuplc::s one of the tour 
LIMUST properties. While lt la believed that LI?-.;TICK·39 oocs ! 
noc know th.it KUBA RK owr.ii the Base or haiJ an;,thtng to do wtth l 
the other three houses, it ls entirely C"'C'"'"ivable that iihou.ld one l 
of the local police agencies or the LlMEf,lCK p,~rson.'lel become 1 aware of UC.ALLA acttvitica, they could v.:ry easily arrive at 1 
some logical conclusions ahout all of t!i~ LL\illST propeny. Thts •,' 
would be <letrtmental, tf not fatal, to our aims. However, 
another Starwn vtewpotnt on thls same problem ls that U comprr.>mlsed, i · 
LICALLA would divert su.-,;,tcton from, r.:ther than to, LIMUST. 
Should one of the local pollcc agencies be1,'1n an tnveottgarton wbldl 
mtghl Involve UMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be"" • 
sacrtftced to protect the Ll\.nJST Base!, These posslblllttee 
become 6omcwhat theoretical and perhaps lmpracrtcal due 
to the Jack of predtettbUlty.of me-,~;j,olt'c~'ig~les, buiicuvenh~-·-·· 
lesa must be weighed one a;alnst the other. 
In vtew of the apparent trnportance of the LIMESA/LI?-.ruST 
operat\on a lot of thought and dlscusstoa have tran.splrerl at the 
Statton about cc-:tlnutng the LICALLA operation in i.liJ present 
loatloo or suapendtng tt tor the tmmeo.wte future and attempttng 
to find another suitable loel'.tton away from the LL\-RfaT property. 
A oound &rgument can be made for terrr.b.itL,z the base stnce such 
an alteraiitlve mlgbt have the ettect cf ltmlttng any knowledge 
LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LLlJ£5A/LL\1UST tn&.allattan. 
However, the termlnarton of a productive base such as LICALLA 
would require an explanation to LIPSilClC-39 which could DOC help but 
leave hlm a bu suspicious. For Headquaners tnformatt.oo, the 
local rmtal lawa are such that LIPSflCK-39 would not be able to 
comprehend why we dtd not tnstst on htm rr.alntatnlng "squatters 
rtghta" (aa stated previously, LIPSTICK-39 apparently does nae 
know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest tn any of the 
other LIMUST propertt~ whtch can easily be done tn Mexico. 
Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more 
of a security problem wtth LIPSTICJ<-39 than permttttng 
LICALLA to operate as lt f.s now. Another posslbiltry would be 
1:ermtnattng LlrSTICK-39 and putting another agE!l't tn the preaem 
LICALLA BaBe. If thts measure were followed, tr would n« 
eltmtnate the faa that LIPSTICK-39, even lf termtnated, would 
still know of the extst&nce of the present LICALLA Base. Still 
another possibUlty would be to terminate UPSI1C1C·39 and the 
UCALLA Base; however, since UCALI..A and the other LlMUST 
properttes are ~tenslbly owned by one ma:t, LIMOUSINE, susplclcns 
1.nd tnvesttgattona could Still lead to LIMUSf.
