4. 'In searching_ for an area where .Mr. O'Connell might strive 
.. for fl.lrthcr improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light o( 
his consistently high performance record. l do believe, however, 
that Mr, O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost- some of his 
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his pcrformanci-, for 
the first six months. in this position, lt is possible that this is due 
to·iite fact that the problems we encounter today require mo,c 
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusias1:\ and 
initiative. Nonetheless I would like to sec Mr, O'Connell strive 
for a better balance in· these essential performance characlc,i·istics_
