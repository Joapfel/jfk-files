4. The facts in the attached chronolg{y are subject to 
question since they are the result of@oberts) own explanation of 
his· affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from 
independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to 
be the ~owledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of 
0 ~ @obertsJ affiliation with CIA. This knowledge }s borne out by 
the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bring;J 0 obert~• name 
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations. 
One of the questions to be. answered by~t,P_pLOBE personnel is 
whether or not(Rob~~ts) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva, 
Switzerland, in March 1966. There appears to be no record of 
O)~ oberts_Vhaving explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or 
what his financial contribution was to the(!aw firm of Itkin, Robertso~ 
and Greenbaum.) 
5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI 
that the Newi:\ York District Attorney may be considering prosecution 
against@obgtt} for having absconded with funds received from 
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate 
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to 
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

6. With regard to @_,obert Delsoaj there appear to have been 
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use 
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February 
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations 
Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO 
Division advised Security that/Delso~ was not going to be used ~ .:)°]( 
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather 
ominous allegations against members of the firm of (pelson, Levin<.?8°" 
and Gordon~ indicating that one member of the firm was a card­
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time 
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr. (?elson)
