The point has also been made that any career of NOSENKO 
in the KGB should have ended or he should have at least encountered 
difficulty when his benefactor General KOB ULOV, together with the . • 
brother of General KOBULOV, .was arrested with the BERIYA group in 
.. 
early June 1953. NOSENKO has during current interviews stated that he 
encountered no difficulties but is aware that the KOBULOY connection 
was discussed by·an officer from the Personnel Directory with an 
official of the First Department.· Under other circmnstances NOSENKO 
would very possibly have encountered difficulty; but, .it should be noted 
that the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that NOSENKO only 
.met Genera~ KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENKO has stated 
that although his father knew General KOB ULOV, his father could in no 
way be considered a member of the BERIYA group.
