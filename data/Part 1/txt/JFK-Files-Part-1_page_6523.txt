Resc~e_ Committee (IRC on: 10 -May 19Hi _fo ·the co~rse of our conversation. 
Sternberg noted that we'.had shown_.qu_ite a bit of.interest ln Soviet arrivals 
(defectors) recently .nnd suggested. tha't it would be. of a great advantage. to 
us if we were abte·fo irttroduce ourselv·es ils,. for instance. representathrei 
of_a scientific institute rather ,thtin-Agency employees. • • 
• 2. We are qui tc ::~ortaln tha~ 5t'etnberg meant well and had our benefit 
in inind when he made th'is suggestioiL : Sternberg has been: cooperative and 
. helpful t~_i.ls ove,r a number of years. llis·suggcstion part1cularly aims to 
···--• simplify our problem of 'making initiai confact with USSR nationals. They are 
part;cularly sensitive and 'sus·prcious, and CIA_h_as a very ominous meaning to 
them .according to Sternberg. • • • 
3. We explai~ed fo·'sternberg that we cannot do what he suggested. but 
in -turn we sµggested that in fostailccs ·where a new arrival is ill at ease, 
we should wait a few weeks or months until the new arrival hos settled down, 
.found a plac·e to U_ve, and hopefuily,, a satfsfactory place ·of· employment •. 
4. We did, however, tell Sternberg that we will discuss his 3uggestion 
with our associates interested in this particular problein. 
S. Do you have any advice or comment? . ' •
