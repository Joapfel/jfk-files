t~chnofogy, and emplacement.; Ile continu'cs to lie co~scicntlou!:I, responsive, \ 
and aggntHHivc in the management and development of these technical programs. 
Further, durl.rig the past year giant strides have been taken in U1e coordination 
of many o( thc,rn efforts with their eventual consumers, Thil:I coor-dination has· 
been above and beyo~d that required by existing Agency regulations.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. H9wever, 
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in 
truly lar,le HtcpR forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness c·annot

saved thh; "Ag(:ricy many hun.clreds of thousands of dollurfl. i
