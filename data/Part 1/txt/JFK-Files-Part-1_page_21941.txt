He first identified GlLMORE's cook, •AGLODI~A," as Yelena 
S. KOSIE~O in the fall of 1965, while revie• ... inq a list of Sov-,. 
ie.ts employed by Amer_icans in Moscow. He. told CIA at that ti.me 
·that he had taken ·over KO~IENKO from TOr.MOZOV upon entering the 
U.S. £::l!Jassy Section in 1953, and th.it she subsequ•:rntly worked 
for ar,d reported on GILMORE• s successor, Richard KhSISCHKE. 
NOSE?iKO • said that KOSIENKO "never provided any il')teresting in­
formaticn." 
NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for h~ndling 10 
to 12 agents in operations against the correspondents. This, 
he said, was a normal load, although more experienced case offi­
cers might have as many as 15. In April 196-1 NOSENKO broke his 
agentura down as follow3: 
Target 
Eddie GI L!-tORE 
Thomas WHITNEY 
Henry SHAPIRO 
Harrison SALISBURY 
Agents 
1'Wo agents, the cook and the driver; 
one operational contact; a part-time 
cleaning girl; and a girlfriend of 
GILMORE'S sister-in-law, who reported 
on the sister-in-law and GIU!ORE's 
wife. 
One agent, his driver. 
Three agents, SH12IRO's secretary 
and his cahuffeur, plus an old woman 
who was a relative of SHAPIRO's wife 
and lived with the SHAPIROs in Mos­
cow. (The secretary and chauffeur 
later worked for Kenneth BRODNE'i and 
reported on him to NOSE~KO; BRODNEY 
temporarily took SHAPIRO'S place in 
Moscow.) 
Two agents, SALISBURY'S driver, "SER­
GEY• and a part-time cleaning girl. 
NOSENKO classified two other of his agents as •neutral,• in 
that t.~ey did ~ot have specific targets on whom to report. The 
first of these was the director of MOSGRAN, a Russian-language 
training program for foreigners in Moscow. His cryptonym was 
•RAKETA,• but NOSENKO could not recall his true name. The sec­
ond, •voLODINK," was a female teacher in this same program who 
instructe_d some of the correspondents, including BRODNE'i, and 
Embassy employees in their homes; he could not recall the true 
name of "VOLODINK." When NOSENKO was relieved of his responsi­
bility for the correspondents i~ 1954, he turned over all of his 
agents to other case officers in the u.s. Embassy Section with 
the exception of •RAKETA" and "VOLODINK,• whom he continued to 
handle in his work with military attaches.
