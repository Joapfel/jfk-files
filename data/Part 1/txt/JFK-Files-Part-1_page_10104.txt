4. Future of the Oooration: Although for all intents 
and purposes the LITAJ.1IL-7 operation has co:ae to an end, tbe 
StatiOll intends to maintain a casual contact with her. It 
is very likely tha.t she a.ay kDO"if nev personnel assigned to 
L!RIXG and.a.ay be ab!e to furnish information on these I 
individuals. There may also be developl!lents in LIRIN'G vhicb, 
on the basis of her lengthy service in LUllSG, sbe might be 
able to assess and clarify. Since LITAMIL-7 was not· a 
salaried agent !or the Station, the operation cost nothing 
more tb.an the investment of Case Officer tiae, and aa 
occasl~nal gift of flowers. In viev of her iatense pride, 
there is little reason to believe tbat sh6 •111 accept lltOA8J' 
in the future. If sbe is able to provide information to tbe 
StatiOD it will probably be done without any thought of 
-coapeaaa tion .
