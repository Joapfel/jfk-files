a·gainst lf'lv:in:t, bccnuH~ of what he terms the 'incor.,petericc there. 
In his opinion, this r:encrnl i;.:cd incompctence 1 will cau·se C,\STI!O 
to cnrry out a- majot• pul~~e nftcr the 1970 harvest is in, (lie 
specifically repents th:it "rio one in H:.lVana wants to make any 
sort of decision''). One ·of his favorite books is The Pd er 
Principle, to \\'hich he refers conslantly, and ,he uses this , 
boo~toilu:;cribc what is going on in 11:wana; !_In RUii' view, 
Havana is nlwa)·s tryinr. to interfe1·e with the 'J::nibassy in 
Madrid, a situation \":hich results in n lack of,. coordination 
and cooperation. RUlZ directs the snme criticism against his 
staff in ~.Jadrid, because li:i."s personnel lack qu:tl ifications for 
the jobs they hold. lie once told an associate: "They think 
that I'm a fool, but I don't miss anythi11g .they do," 
Jl, In turn, he has also bE:cn the tar:;et of criticism 
from Havana, first fron, Zoila GOMEZ (?), who m:::dc a critical evnlu­
ntion of the Emb:iss. RUIZ' reaction is .ins.tructi.ve.:, '.'.I decided 
not to answer it. I took n librium, smoked n cigar, and forgot 
all nbout it," On another occ:isiou he complni_ncd to Aristides 
DIAZ· .that he had rccci\;ed nnother critical report from llav:ina 
rer.a1~ding his program .for t·hc- Embassy. llavan:i wns complnining 
that not r.mch had been achieved. RUIZ rioted that the Er:1bassy 
had accomplished much th:it was not in tlie pln:i, and he intended 
to answer that particular criticisni ih dctnil. 
12, • Perhaps the most sririous criticism of his activities 
cnme in,. a coded cabl.: received by the Embassy early in October 
Hl69. Havana questioned the way that nuu; was handling the com­
mercial treaty neg·otiations with Spanb;h autho1;ities. In n 
communication dircctc-d to Rat:11. J.EO:: Torres (201-725G24) (Under 
Secretary of the ~inistry of Foreign Commerce) and in rath~r 
strong language, RUIZ defended his right to be informed and 
consulted on the ma{tcr, denying that his cable number 521 wns 
offensive to Jonquin ALVAREZ: (Director of Trade wi. th Western 
Europe and North_ America), who was evide11t1y the source of 
~riticism against RUIZ.
