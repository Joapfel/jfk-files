22 March 1976, for any and al! .1.nformat1on the Agency. 
held on ,.A Quaker ;\ction Group" also known as "AQAG." 
.· In the. ·?,<J July J976 initial response, 24 newspaper 
·' ··c·lippings· and 011c' 1-eaflct were released to him;· two 
documents ~er~ denied • 
. . . . ,}). · Ori :z3 August 1976 Subject appealed, requesting _ 
that further information .be relcat.ed to· him on the group. 
c. : .. nu.ri'ng' the _appeals review 11 additional documents 
we.te :located and are .included in-the recommendations 
bcl~dw.· These d9cuments were n.ot considered durin~ the initial 
tcvie,w sinc;:c, they were not considered to nieet the criteria 
for "records"''.<>xt:int at that tiMe and they contained only 
incidental references to the subject of the request. 
. d. During the appeals review WP. were un:ihlc to 
ldentify any Air Force docu~ents concerning the subject 
of this rc,pwst. The rcque:;ter should be tolJ that this 
wn~ appirently an ~rror~ 
c~ ,Di1ring the appeals revi~w we were unahlc to 
identify .:rny 1'cpartment of State documents concerning 
A Quaker Action ~roup. T~o State documents !ocated, and 
possibly rc!crrcd to in the initial response, Jo not 
concern A Quaker Action Group. The rcqucstor should be 
inforincd that th.is was also apparently an error. 
3. (C) Rccommendat ions: 
_ a. My S?ecific recommehdations ar& shown on the 
Appeals Reviow Form attached to each document. A 
classificatihn review has been c~nducted and all documents 
nrc considered properly classifiP.d and marked in accordance 
with E.O. 11652, as amended .• 
b. I recommend that ~he two documents denied in toto 
under the initial review continue to be denied. One of 
t~em (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive 
sourc-e. The other (Tab 4) was ohtained through a sensitive 
opt'ration conc..lucted jointly by, American and German 
authoritjcs .
