Agency Employees with the Surname of 
Bishop 
1. The Office of Personnel is gathering files of 
present and past employees of the Agency who were on 
board.in the 60's. Attached are brief excerpts from the 
OPFs of the first group shown to me by Doris Houdesheldt. 
2. I am trying to assemble a book of photographs 
of these different employees to show to the two witnesses 
who think they knew a man named Morris Bishop in the 60's. 
The photograph or photographs that you may have concern­
ing the persons listed on the attached pages as near as 
possible to the first half of ~he 60's would be helpful. 
3. I expect to have more names in the near future 
and will forward those to you as soon as they are 
available. 
4. It would be appreciated if you could give this 
some priority attention.
