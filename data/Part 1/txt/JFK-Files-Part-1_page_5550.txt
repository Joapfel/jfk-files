2. Site Evaluation 
a. Blue llole is an excellent har!:or: protected ~ainst 
all weather. and with six feet of water at foe t-ar. Ia surroanded by ,·ery 
steep slop!'S, hea,·ily 110oded. Dock (acili"ties are presently ,·eiy ceag:er, 
but could be quickly and easily iapro,·ed. ~ iuel ior a boat is a,·aiiai;le 
at Blue Hole, aud at Fort Antonio ( the closest ;;ource). the fuel ai.·ailable 
is diesel fuel or aatocotive gasoline; no aarice white gasoline ·is a,.tilable 
auywbere i:1 the area. This is a nost sign.ifit"aut factor in !J~lecting a 
suitable boat.
