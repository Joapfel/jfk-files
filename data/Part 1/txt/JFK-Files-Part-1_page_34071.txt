'Ne expected by now some dction from your end or from tt~e American 
·Authorities to whom we had sent our previous c9pied com.~unicatlon ~o 
you(\·/ashington,forcign Ministry, and u_.S,A, D:lbessy,London), but regret 
that, at least to our knowledg9 1 "1:1? action has beer. taKen yet, and we 
assume this by virtue of thP. ract that the ships we ment!oned pr_eviously 
'just carry on the voyages ror which have been rixed, and their Owners 
op~nly negotiate further similar business rrom ~uba I es most of tha 
trade to Cuba is presently done by Red flag shipa. However, we supplement 
-our previous letter by gtving you some additionnl 1nformotion. 
,A. 8me ~erohants in Cuban Trading, but mainly D.'Knree, or Paris.and Geosr

vhero the cargo will/dlscbarged, as often cargoss are shippod end not

The■e options start from Cc1ablanoa/Continent and continue into all 
Hedi terracean/Efld ~ea/P.Gult /InJia/Coloc:iboiMalflya ports, soc.etimes • as

:·As stated, the Lebanon Authorities oestensibly allow Lebanoc flag ships 
·.to carry th.z::Je oargo~s to -Arab Countries only, always subject to 
· license. Owners apply _tor .. su~h Ucensa for Arab counti-ios, ac:1 then 
"1f the- L!erohant ordors the ship to say Italy or Germany or Japan, tbe 
ehip just oarrlcs the oargo. Some O'Pners just do not apply tor a license· 
at all, and the L~~anon Aot4ori~ies know what goes on, but turns the 
other way. 
Oreek ond Lebanon tlag ehips just carry on trade in Cuba, and it you 
-say they to not. then either you do not know about it, or they must 
oanoutlage th~ir tlag3, or must take ( as regnrds eventual dest1cat1on) 
their 4oci.mont~, ~uoh as eharter perties, Bills ot Lading, manifests 
eto., E~en the number ot shipo trading in Cu~a I given in your 
olroulara, ls not oorreot • it la much larger, may be you do this 
l!ltentlonally tor political reason~ or maybe because you do not know. 
c. Both the Oroak and Lebuon GoTarxaents are in a position, in aocordanoe
