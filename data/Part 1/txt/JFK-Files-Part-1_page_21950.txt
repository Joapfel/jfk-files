MULE 
NOSE!',"Y.O identified Walter AiULE as an Assistant Army 
Attache ~nd said that he was the case officer responsible 
for him. :SOSENKO descrihed an operational approach to MULE, 
in which he himself participated: In 19~3 or 1954 there 
had been several defection 2pp:·oachcs to Soviets in the 
United States on the basis ~f money and the pro~ise of a 
new life. After the KGD Second Chief Directorate decided to 
try the same measures, MULE wns selected because he was only 
a captain despite his lengthy service in the Ar:ny and because 
material from concealed microphones indicated that he was 
often disparaged by the other attaches. When MliLE received 
letters from home, he threw them in the trash, and the 
maids turned these over to the KGB; from this :r.:...il it was 
understood that MULE did not have a house in ·the United 
States but lived with his family in a tr~ilcr. The father 
rif two children, MULE had sent his wife from ~oscow to Ger-
meny for an abortion, as a third child would have imposed 
too great an economic burden. On the bnsis of all this the 
KGB appointed N,:,l. f,;JP.ODI:-l, a recruiter of the A:nerican De­
partment, to attempt to defect M!~E. Together ~ith BORODIN, 
KOVSHUK, and L.A. LEBEDEV (from the Second Ch:ei Directorate's 
special technical sec~ion) :;OSEKKO travelled to Leningrad 
for the operation. LEDEDEV instnlled a clock containing a 
concealed camera as well as r.1icroph0:~E's in MULE's hotel 
room, and BORODIN entered the room to await ~!UL.S's return. 
When ~IULE started to ente:r the room, he caught sight of 
BORODIN and tried to back out, but NOSENKO and KOVSHUK 
cl•Js.~,g-~.d_::>_!2E~_the hall ar1~--P~:Qi~ntqc(:~T_s~~~_p~--*~ BORODIN rcvir!wed l<H' ~1Ul~l-;-fne·Tacts the KGB had accumulated 
Rlwtil"""lfislacI-·or success in tile Army, the disdain of his 
fellow attaches, . .ind his shortage of r.1oney antl then offered \ 
him a job as a "consultant." nor.ODIN had either $5,000 or 
$10, COO in an envelope to encourage MULE to accept. Ac- \\ 
cording to :WSEN"K'J, ~IULE refused outright, telling BORODIN 
to get out, that he would not talk to him, and that he was 
a captain in the American Army. 
CIA files show that MULE reported this incident. He \ 
said that be ~as locked in his hotel room and subjected to 
a recruit::ie~t attempt b:,· :1.n ~!VD agent calling himself Jack . 
SIEGAL, who offered him $10,000 for "work" on a long-range ; 
basis .. SIEGAL emphasized that MULE would not be required 
to procure documents from the Embassy, and according to 
MULE, SiffiAL was aware of facts concerning ~LT::' s personal // 
life that could have been obtained only from listening de­
vices in MULE's apartment or office. SIEGAL left after about 
20 minutes, having warned mn ... E not to report the incident. 
~E was unable to identify NOSE~KO's photograph.

After NOSENKO had been transferred to the Tourist De­
partment in 195~, BENSON, MULE and STROUD were the targets 
of a KGB operation which resulted in all three men being 
•Precisely the same role was played by NOSENKO in the re­
cruitment approach to James STORSBERG, according to NOSENKO.
