bis lac·k of inforiution conc<iJ ning a sixth {G . .\RL,\'.\0) is 
discussed in detail in Pages 166 throu~h 219. SOS[NKO's 
information on a number of other cases, less i~portant in 
his opinion, is describc-d in the tabulation of ~merican 
case leads give~ on P:g~s 364-410. Certain of these cases 
are furtter examined below to determine whether ~OSE~KO•s 
knowledge equates with details which the deputy and acting 
chief of the U.S. Embassy Section could reasonably be 
expected to know and retain. 
(1) The STORSBEP.G Case 
The operation against STQRSBE.HG (Pages 166-185) was, 
NOS~;:o said, the ll\u.,;t lt,,portant case he had as supervisor 
of code clerk operations. The KGB, whil€- al>le to break 
certain State Department ciphers, had had no success with 
military cryptographic systems, and therefore NOSE~KO 
"dropped every thin~ for a year'' to involve hirn~t-1 f with the 
development of James STORSDERG, ttt-military code clerk at 
the U.S. Embassy. The following fatts are pErt1ncnt to an 
evaluation of ~OSE~KO's story of tr.is case. 
NOSF.NKO originally raised the Sl'ORSBERG case indirectly 
at his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962. He told how 
GOLITSYN, during a visit to the Ai:1erican Dt'partment in 1960, 
at a time NOSE~1CO was on leave, had r&quested permission 
to use a U.S. El!lbassy ~ection agent, a Finn, in his o-ao opera­
tions in Helsinki. During his discussions in the American 
Department, GOLITSYN learned that this Finnish agent was 
being used in operations against Embassy employ~es living in 
America House. NOSENKO said that the KGB rEalized that 
GOLITSYS had passed this information on to the Americans 
following his defection, for the regulations gover~ing 
visits to America House by third nationals had been tightened. 
At this 11",ecting N05E.NKO did r.ot name the Finnish agent or 
specify his involvement in any particular operational acti­
vity nor did he date the visit by GOL11~YN. 
Later in the 1962 meetirg:; ~0S[SKO gave a detailed 
summary of the Finnish agent's involvc-me:nt in the unsuccess­
ful recruitment att&mpt against an Amcricar. military code 
clerk. XOSENKO, without naming the Finn or th~ American, 
said that he personally conducted the rEcruit~ent confron­
tation with GRIDANOV present. T~ese early acc6unts were full 
of quotes of what ~;osF.~1(0 said to the Americ·an and vice 
versa. descriptions of the American's reaction to the confron­
tation, and statPaents of N05ENKO's admiration for the Ameri­
can despite bis refusal to work. Following his defection, 
NOSENKO recounted the case in e•.-en greate1· detail, in fact, 
in more detail than he gave for an)" other case. He identi­
fied the Finn as PREISfREUND aPd the American as SlORSBERG 
and described and referred to the c.1se wili:'never possible 
(over 50 times). When asked for details of other code clerk 
cases, for example, he repeatedly diverted to discussion of 
the STORSBERG case to illustrate how the KGB operated against 
code clerks in general. 
After defecting ~OSENKO denied that he personally con­
fronted STORSBE.RG. He said that his personal role was limited 
to directing STORSBERG into the hotel rooa where the approach 
was made; after first saying that he had never claiaed any 
other role, be admitted that he aay have been "painting"
