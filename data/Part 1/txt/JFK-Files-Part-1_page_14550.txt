BACKGROUND : Guillermo RUIZ, familiarly known 
as El Guajiro, probably comes from a huil':!?ie 
family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar Lin 
Cuba, • a slum dwelling] in Marianao and began 
to work when he was only 14 years· old. 
In the fifties he emigrated to the United 
States, travelling throughout the East Coast 
·and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to 
work as an,_ apprentice butcher for a Polish-
·- American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a 
grocery store on Flagler St. in Miami. He 
did·_so well in attracting Latin-American customers 
to the _store that be soon began to distrlbute • 
meatin.-the ar,a for SAMKO. 
He has said that when he left Miami • 
in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house 
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a 
thousand dollars in the bank. • 
But his "'success" could be traced, perhaps, 
to another acquaintance that he .i~ known to 
have had.
