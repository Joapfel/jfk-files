' lle\ationahip Between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINrO 
l. In response to ,, conversation between Chief. SB. anJ the under­
·s1gned 1 LIREAut·l was questioned iq(ietail on, 25 Septell!ber concerning 
the relationship which exixts betwH'n AEDIEHARD apd Gloria PL"aO with ·a 
. view toward possible e!!lbArrassinent of M:Dll:P.ARD before his sup11riou. 
·---Z. LIREALM•l Alfd his wife both belle"e (but have no rroof) that 
- .it is probable that .Glori.a l'I?l'TO is h3ving or has had an affair with· 
AEDIERARD. Both UREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINI"O's 
and know that Gloria is strongly attracted to AED!EHARD w!i.:- b both 
phy&ically and intellectuallt superior to her husband. tue to Gloria's 
continued friendship with AEDIEHAllO at the Fren-:h Club anel other places, 
LlRE.-\LM·l feels sure that Glor1a·'i1 husband, Pepe~ does not yet know of 
the affair. • • 
J. ;t.lREALM·l characteri:l:i!d Pepe PINTO ns: sweet• slow-witted and 
be~ow average in intelligence. ·He is a physician specialb.ing in lung dis­
orders, born in ·the Canary Islands. He consider-ii himself & Spaniard with 
the (ha~acter:lstic Spa~ish lack o{ respect for women. He.attempts to 
• ti~tly ·c~ntrol Glc,,ria 's activities while I according to Gloria• havin'g 
aa many affairs himself as be .~11. Gloria Aseatly reaents Pepot1 s atUtude 
toward her. Pepe -ls basically defensive and would a not \.l8nt anyone to kaov 
if Gloria were having an affair ,11th anoth"r man. Be ll011ld probably deny 
:Lt 6f anyone said so. aven lf he were aware of it. -He wculd take it out on 
Gloria. however, and would probably beat her and restrict her il!Ovementa even 
more closely. , . . . . .

nothing to gain, and perhaps BJCb to lo68e I by any atte"°,t at exposing_ ~er . 
supposed affair with ABDIEHARD. tin~~ ~be now appears tot,., in coatact vith 
SHEVCH!NKO, ilLlch bttter to hope for better devolopmenta in this case •. •
