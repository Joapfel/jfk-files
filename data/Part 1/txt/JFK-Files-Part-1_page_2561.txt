during 1960 - mid-1961 when_ he was forced into retirement from the 
KGB. During the above period of time, NOSENKO claims to ·have 
been Deputy Chief, First Section, although he does not claL.-n to :!::.ave 
had a direct supervisory responsibility over CHEREPAl';OV except 
in the absence of the Chief of Section, Vladislav KOVSHUK. NOSENKO 
also claims to have participated ~n the. hunt for CHEREPANOV in

Consideration has previously been given to the theory that the 
Cherepanov Papers were passed to Americans by the KGB through· 
CHEREPANOV to support the bona £ides of NOSENKO. This theory . 
·, 
seems ~o have little ci-"edibility since the papers contain r.o information. 
which wo~d even support the claim of NOSENKO that he was in the 
First s'ection, First Depal·tment, 1960 - 1961. The papers also contain 
no information which would indicate there was even a Deputy Chief 0£ 
the First Section during 1958 - 1960. 
Statements by NOSENI(O are emphatic that CHZREPANOV was , 
not under KGB control, that he passed the papers which it later developed 
he had taken from the First Section prior to his retirement because b.e 
was disgruntled with his treatment by the KGB, and that the action by 
CHEREPANOV caused consternation in the KGB. 
There is no collateral evidence which cont:radicts a::iy oi 
the statements by NOSENKO about CHEREPANOV. Further, t::.e::e is
