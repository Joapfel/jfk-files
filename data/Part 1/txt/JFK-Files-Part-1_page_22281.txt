control.• He has also used thia~~xp:anaticn to suppc=t his claim 
that there were no recruitn:cnts of :3ilitary attac:ies during this 
period. 
• An exception, wherein the l<GB "did caref'Jlly compile a great 
deal of vulnerability d'"1ta on ar. Armf Attact-.e, ... as des..::ri.bed t.y 
NOSENKO in connection with the approach to Walter M~LE (P~ge 104). 
On the basis of these cxpi.anations, IIOSENKO' s Jo:r.o·..-ledq~ of the 
offici~l and unofficial activities of his alleged targets in this 
period deserves at~cnti0n. 
NOSENKO knew almo_st_ nothing about the personal bc1ckgrounds 
ar.d families of the eight '.me.rnbera of the Arny Attache Office 
whora he identified as his tar~ets (Pag~s 99-106\. hl~hough he was 
able to identify each by ran~ and position in the r~bassy--some­
timcs inaccurately--a~d in a few ca~es to describe certain cf 
their operational activities, he was u~a~are of or had forgotten 
such facts as: 
- Colonel Earl L. ~ICKE:..SCN, the .\.r:ny Attac!-.c in 1934 
and 1955, was arrested twice ~::· the Militia outsice of :1.0s­
cow in 1954. 
- Assistant Army htta=~e Ira RICHARDS was a language 
student of GROMOKOVA (id~ntified by NOSE~KO as a KGB egent); 
by RICHARDS' account she sought to elicit biogra?hic data 
from hin:. curing the lessons. 
- William STROUD, the Assistant A=rny Attac~e, travelled 
to J<:'larkov in May 1955 to interivew an ,\.,:ierican defec~cr. 
(NOSE~KO has identified Franit SISCOE, -ho accompanied STROUD,· 
as a suspected CIA officer; he was coopted by CIA.) 
NOSENKO, furthermore, was ignorant of i~portant events, known 
independently to CIA, which ~ere within the sphere of what he 
claimed was his direct, Fersonal responsibility: 
• 
- NOSENKO claimed direct personal responsibility for 
the file of and operational activity against. Lie~tenant 
colonel Howard FELCHLI~ {Pages 131-103). ;te claimed to be 
receiving ager.t infort:i=tion on him but ~ould not recall the 
names or cryptor.yms of any su.;h agents. (.;le said, for 
exall'ple: •1 thi~k FELCriL~~ must have had a maid, and she 
would have baen a KGB agent.•) NOSE~IKO described FELCH LIN 
as by far the most aggressive of his targets and hence the 
object of special interest: yet he did not know or remember 
llOSENKO hunself, when giving the reason whj• he did not know 
more details about the U.S. £1'1lbassy Section's targ~ts while 
he vas its Deputy Chief in 19f0-1961, said that as a sufervisor 
he was too busy overseeing subordinates; hence,.NOSEtlKO con­
tinued, he could not be expected to remeJl'.ber as ~~ny such de­
tails as would be possible had he been a cas~ officer working 
daily with only four or five files. In another context, NOSENKO 
e~lained why he was unable to supply the details of planning 
and organizing operations against tourists in the period 1955-
1959; he contrasted operations a~ainst tourists, ~ho often 
cane and went in a matter. of a !ew days, to the work against 
the Military Attaches and diplo!ll.ats station.ed in !-toscov on 
permanent assignments, who could be studied systematically snd 
slowly.
