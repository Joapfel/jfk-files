CHILEAN REFUGEES IN KETHE?.LAriD:3 POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES 
,6:ditorial by N. van Uieuwenhuysen1 Reformatorisqh Daeblad, 
Dutch, 19 April 1974, p 5l 
The Chilean refuEees: in the Netherlands seem to be 
having ~djustmerit proble;s. These rather prolonged symptoms 
seem to be caused amone other things by the fact that they 
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of 
their r,:arxist president. is definitely over and that their 
country is ~ow being ruled by a small group of reactionaries 
~ho are trying to keep the people·under control throug~ 
terrorism, repression~ and torture. Such probleras will tak~ 
you quite a ways in the r:etherlands and those idealists were 
quick to take advantage of it.

What is the situation? Most of the approximately 
250 refugees with a high school or university education do 
not work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis 
ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on 
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. 3oard and 
lodging are fr·ee and at the end of the week they pick up 
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive 
free lan€uage instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and 
compensation for each trip they have to take. 
Do you get the idea that they are better off than 
many. old people in the r;etherlands? You are probably right, 
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare, 
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been 
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile. 
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.
