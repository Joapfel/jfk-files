S~CRZT 
14. GIBSON and eeourtty, to thia roint1 OI3SON bas met only 
111:yeel:f", under alias, and under the i!IIJ•ression that I vile here tem,rorarily. 
This idea vas ap,i;:arently made to stick, throughout our oonvere!ltior.s. 
Ve vould propoee that, i:f" GIBSON be recruitvd in :f"act, he be handled in 
alias and at a good, safe distance - mor& than ana 1 s len~h. until 
auffioient operatior.al testing hru!. baen carried-out, ve would suggest 
that be not have a "resident oase officer" an;yvbere - i.e., neither 
here nor in Algiers. Control o! GIBSON is partly exercised by the 
doCW11ente ve have received from him (receipts, mego or understanding) 
plus the volwunoue taped comments. These, vhile not worthy of a court, 
are sufficient to do him consider&ble proteaeional and ~reonal duage -
note particularly that bis vite, according to him, would not approve of 
any or our oontacts, and this appeue to be quite meaning:f"ul to hiua. 
:Financial control would be a continuing factor. And, t,erhapa to an 
unusually high deeree, we reel that GIBSO~ would feel considerable 
gratitude to whoever (i.e., lCt"BARX) rescued him from hie present and 
difficult poei tion, "forf'1ving all", and providing him vi th _a measure of 
respectability (at least in hie cvn eyes) that he has henceforth been .. ·,.-~ 
unable to achieve and m:aintain. In sum, we i'eel that a reasonably 1 ., •• • ' 
strong combination of control factors exist, lllld can be continue4 for 
aa long an GIBSON' would be properly handleii • 
15. We should also like to co~ent on the reliability or GIBSCJ'a 
c011111enta in the course of our m~etinee to date. We have found him to 
be thoroughly consistent in his comoente And attitudes throughout. 
Ve found no indication of ~eliberate deception or serioue attempts to 
nislea4. He mRy b,\ve provided some erroneous mat&riale, or he i::ay have 
9J:'.il"Oneously interpreted some eventeJ but hie comments and attitudes 
re·mained suffioiently consistent to lead us to believe that be was 
being reaaonably honest all the waj. He pl3.Yed dovn some items, no 
doubt, and played up others. In the course of a debriei'ing such as this 
was there seemed little or no point in pushing hard at such points -
besides, hie knowledge of the areas oovered so tar out.dietanoed mine 
th~t I OO'~ld not l:avo atteapted to probe or pin him dovn cm specifics. 
(Note also hie tendency to make corrections in the d&brietine qu6stionnaire, 
as_ when the: wrong name would appear for a poli tice.l group in Si1Jl tzerland.) 
16. 0Il!SO?l1 s present status is that be ia out of vork, in debt, ana 
vithout any prospects of reasonable employment in the near future. !:!e 
is sOGlewhat occupied vi th an article he is vri ting for FnoounterJ this 
will probably keep him from taking another job for the next fov weeks. 
Beyond tb'lt, nothing is definite. If ve would like to give him a try, 
then, some move should be m~de to formalize matters With him before he 
accepts some job that will put him out of the me.rket. 
17. Recognizing that there are risks involved, 1t nevertheless seems 
most undesirable to paBB up what has the earm&rks of being a highly 
uaetul asset. We request, therefore, that Headquarters review and consider 
the entirety oi' our knowledge of G:raso:, to this point, and give us a 
re~ on his potential worth, as_ viewed by LOHARVFST, AF Division, 
Kt.TD ICG and otqer.'intereated parties. It, tc-,· reaaona of which 
Headquarters is aware, and we ue no~, OTI!SON is considered unacceptable 
aa a XUTL'BE asset, let us know. If, on the. other hand, there appeue to 
be a market tor his talents and capabilities, 1ve should move rather 
rapidly to pre-empt him • . Hie present· flexibility is no~ likely to last 
i'or long, and any plan to use· hio ehould tal,:c this into account. As 
VE/BC ia av~e, we are not in " lk)Si tion to p,.1t this into the f'crm of a 
London Station projeot. Thie should not be the reason ~or neglecting 
what appe!Ll"B to be such a potentiall;, revardine asoet ~or mBA.iut, however. 
18. lle would appreciate & reply vi thin a couple of' veelca of' :Rea4-
quarters I receipt of' this dispatch.
