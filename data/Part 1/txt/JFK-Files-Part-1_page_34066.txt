The economic research unit of AMSCROLL has throughout the past 
year received seven anonymous letters from Athens. These letters 
describe in detail Greek a.nd Lebanese shipping with Cuba and appear 
to have been written by someone knowle~geable of his subject. The 
author apparently has access to AMSCROLL publications as he mal~es 
reference to "your circulars". We forward a set of these lctt-:-rs 
by separate cover as they may be of interest and of possible use. 
The IU.ISCROLL shipping studies have made a veiled acknowledgment of 
receipt of this material by referring to information received.from 
friends in Greece; howeve.r, AMSCROLL has used only those facts that 
we can check out here. As indicated on certain of the lette1·s, -· 
cc.pies of various ones hava been sent to the "liinistry for Foreign 
Affairs, Washington"; the U.S. Ambassador; London; or the U.S. 
Ambassador, Athens. A copy of the last letter received by AMSCROLL V.'3.!: 
sent ail three.
