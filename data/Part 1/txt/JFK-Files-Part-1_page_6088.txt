1. SUMMARY. Tbe Reference A .. AMSPELL exhibit toured six 
Latin American countrles during a five-Booth period, February-June 
,1,·':' 
1964. With the exception of Guaya:tuil and La Paz -- -A·here excel-
lent results 'A'ere achieved -- the· tour was only moderately success-
ful, and must be classified a faiiure in Qufto, Santiago and 
Montevideo. According to AMSPELL, the total number of persons who 
vie-A·ed the exhibit was 6,720~ . .\nother 2,792 persons reportedly 
... 
--.;~_;~~f-:· 
attended conferences at wbi.ch the AMSPELL team gave talks on the 
Reference A. exhibit and the -daogers ... aocLweaknesses. .. of..--Ca-stro-- ·-·-~ 
Comml•nism .. __ Pub-licity was given the exhibit by 34 ne11·spapers (47 
items)-, 30 radio stations, and six television stations. AMSPELL 
estim.:1 ted the TV audience ·a-t 1,300,000. Sample clippings are 
enclcs<?d under separate cover. Reports from WH statious and the 
WAVE debriefing of the A?.ISPELL team lead us to conclude that the tour was. a moderate success that could ba·ve been mucll better if '-
if had b·een better organized and if the A!.!SPELL team had had more 
experience. ton balance~ we believe the tour was well worth the -approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however, -. 
believe it should be ropeated in the foreseeable future in view 
of the relative inexperience sbov.-o by the AMSPELL team OD the 
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to '- organize the exhibit in the various cities.
