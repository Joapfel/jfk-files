• story _t-9·_"h_is siftJ:s-faction. Ile also 'shed a few tears .when he 
_r.«;!pe;itid·tne sfor,y ()f -his wife's death and the doctor's' 
recommerid:i:tion that he take -a -vacation. He.continued his 
softening ,approac::'ti' o~ ~MAuro-1 ·by adding: "Bill,· when my wife 
·-.took -:i'll ·s·ol!IEf:'years ago, she asked me to divest myself of all 
bu~iness int~r~sts, but if you were there with rne, Bill, you 
could have handled my affairs and you might have been a 
millionaire today." S.-UIKO sensed that AMA!J.t0-1 and his wifo-
. were moved by this comment ·and were literally drooling with 
the thought of being millionaires. The wife asked a number 
of questions regarding SAMKO's wealth, his real estate activity~ 
collection of silver and his success in generali The wife 
was astounded with the simple explanation of how SAllKO went 
about building and financing apartment houses. SA)IKO made 
a suggestion that A~L-\lJf0-1 invest in silver bec::iuse the scarcity 
of this metal would eventu::11jy rai~e the market value. He 
explained to AlL~UT0-1 that he was collecting all silver coins 
stamped prior to 1965. The next couple of hours were spent 
at t_he amusement park where, on arrival, ~MAUT0-1 stee1·ed 
SAMKO to a cafeteria near.the ·main entrance. In short ·order 
fwo men arrived on _the sce.ne, friends of A~L.\.UT0-1. They were 
introdu_ced to SAMKO, but· SA11KO could ·not remember the names. 
After a few moments a couple arrived and they, too, were 
itit1;oduced to SAMKO. (S.UIKO could not identify the persons 
he met from the- i;hotographs in our mug- book.)- AM:\lrfO-l's 
friends .took a number of photographs of S.UiKO and .Ul:\UT0-1 and 
after a short while together~ they left. The conversation at 
the park was aimless.· They discussed the kids and SAMKO repeated 
how delighted and proud he was to know that one of • .\lL.\.Uf0-1 's 
children was named .. Alexander - his namesake. A~t-\t.;70-1 had 
_a wide grin while SAMKO was talkin!-'· about Al::?xander. He asked 
. .\)L.\UT0-1 about the oldest boy. AM.:\UT0-1 replied that the oldest 
,ms in Havana studying civil enginee1:ing. SA~IKO suggested to 
A~L.\UT0-1 that he sh01,1ld give his children the best education and 
have them stay away from politics ~nd political courses but 
conceritrate on the p~ofessional fields, engineering, law, 
.cedicine, etc. A~t.\UT0-1 admitted that his intention was to 
keep his children away from a political career. S,H!KO said he 
would send Alexander some commercial slides of Cape Kennedy 
and othe~ points of interest in Florida.
