b. NOSENY.O's Conduct in Meetings 
NOSENKO in brief, super!iclal, uncritical debriefings {of 
the sort which characterized the 1962 and 1964 Geneva meetings 
and the debri~fings.prior to 4 April 1964) was reas~nablr con­
vincing in hi9 manner. For example, on the basis of the hur-
ried sessionb of J'.lne 1962 in Geneva, which did not allow tir.e 
for systecatic or detailed questioning, the CIA case officer 
in commenting on NOSENKO's conduct mentioned "the ease of his 
manner, the sureness of his knowledge of matters which he should 
have known, and the amount of checkable information he provided.• 
NOSENKO seemed to that case officer to be •l•~.:ier little or no 
restraint as to the amount and nature of what he told us• and 
•made a convincing and good p~rsonal impressi~n: a vigcro~s, 
temper~~ental and vital man.w Similarly, nothir.g in ~OSE!;Ko's 
manner caused douuts on the part of the FaI represer.tative& who 
took tlOSE~KO's reports in February, March, an~ earl] April 1964. 
It beccll'.e apparent, how,:ver, when the cases t,OSENl~O had 
mt:ntioned briefly in early meetings were taken up in detai! in 
leisurely debriefings after the defection, that he could not add 
facts consistent with what he had said before. He ~as unable to 
recall r~lated incidents or additional c·i?:..:u.,1star.ces which did 
not come to mind in the first telling, despite being aided by 
~uestioning from different ~ngles or in different co~texts. The 
sa:ue results were obtained in exhausting his !itore of operational 
leads (with a half dozen exceptions) and his info::-c.ation on KGB 
procedures, installations, and operational methods: Havi~g once 
reported on these general topics, NOSENKO could offer nothing 
more when deb~iefed again, regardless of the method of question­
ing tried. Repeatedly he used the same stories to illustrate 
his points; new stories did not emerge. In a peric~ of nine 
months, NOSEtlKO was drained of information Pon nis p~i'Sb;ica.. and

• A technique NOSENKO has frequently used to explain his in-
\ ability to supply details and to forestall further questicr.ing 
-
has ·been to claim poor memory. "Dli_ferent people have different 
ty~s of memories,• he has said on mauy occasio~s, or on o~hers: 
1 I ave told wfiat I remember.• The case officers who have 
handled NOSENKO agree, on the other t,and, that !le has an excel-
• lent memory, although perh3ps a peculiar one: NOSE~T.O did ~ot 
always recall most easily those events \oihich tad occurred nost 
recently, or those incidents which were most closely related to 
him. He was able, for example, to remember detailed infor-...ation 
on the penetration of the Courier Transfer Station in Paris and 
to give a long, detailed, and ordered account of ~he compromise 
of PENKOVSKIY, in neither of which he claimed ar.y personal role; 
he has been able to name hundreds of KGB officers, to gi·;e the 
dates on which ~any of them transferred from one compone~t of 
the Second Chief Directorate to another, and to d~scribe their 
responsibilities at particular times. Yet NOSENKO forgot \ihere 
he himself served in the GRU: he could not consiste~tly dis­
cribe the circumstance~ o[ his divorce: he f~iled to provide a 
consistent date for his entry into the KGB and fer his transfer 
from the American Department to the Tourist Dep~rtment in 1962. 
Likewise, NOSE?IKO remembered details of KGB operations which, 
like the •ANDREY• case in 1953, took place in the relatively dis­
tant past, but he could not recall the travels, friends, a.~d 
activities of his own target __ ;ohn V. ABlLi • .\N or c!etails of opera-
