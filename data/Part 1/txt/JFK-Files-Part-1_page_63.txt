While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the 
~t effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in 
~~~ico. He has been described as being ~ithou~ mor~ls, 
education, and manners.:- Shortly.after ~1s arr1v~l in 
Mexico in 1968, he was arrested 1n front of a house of 
prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with 
some locals. It appears this incident did not affect his 
position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it 
received a good deal of press coverage. 
We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in 
June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there 
now. 
Although our file indic~tes that Kostik@v may have 
been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action) 
(Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to 
confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB 
has not engaged in such executive action since 1959.
