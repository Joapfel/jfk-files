WIFE TELLING i-iER _ Tl!AT HE HAD JUST BEE 11 PITCHED ON BEHALF Of 
WODUAL. SHE REACTEIJ BY SMILING PLEASANTLY AS IF THERE WAS 
ABSOLUTELY N~THING WRO~G WITH WHAT HAPPENED. 
J. ArCHALK/5 COMMENTED TO CASE OFFICER THAT HE DID NOT THINK 
AMWOLF/1 ~OULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/5 BELIEVES WE SHOULD 
.\i/AIT A FEW DAYS DEFORE ATTENPTir..'.J ANOTl-!ER CONHCT EITHER BY ANOTHER 
i':r::nu:a OR TELEPl!Om: CALL. ST,.HIO~ AGREES WE s;:OULD WAIT A FEW· 
DAYS .. BUT TtiAT A TELEPHONE CALL SHOULD PRECEDE A3iY MEETI 00. IF THE 
TELEPHONI:: CALL PRODUCES A CONTI riUED NEGATIVE RE~CTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED 
WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE 
WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM QUTimD IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
ANOTHER FACTOn IS THAT AFTER. TtiE rncourlTER, AMll'CLF/1 WENT TO THE 
EMBASSY BUl DID NOT REMAIN. SURVEILLANCE WAS NDT ABLE TO LOCATE
