Visits to the Geneva KGB Legal Residency 
· Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to 
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for 
more than a day or two, Legal Rezident S.I. GAVRICHEV would 
invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself. 
GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference, 
and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March 1962, 
NOSENKO gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled 
members of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at 
GAVRICHEV's request, although it was only after some h~sita-. 
tion on the part of the Legal Rezident that all of his subor­
dinates were brought together to hear NOSENKO. In return 
for helping the Legal Residency to perform countersurveillance 
on several occasions, NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed 
by GAVRICHEV ·to have the use of an operational car and driver 
to go shopping and carry out other private errands. (NOSENKO 
was not under CIA surveillance at any time in 1962 in Geneva 
and his claims as to his activities there, aside from his 
meetings with CIA, can be neither confirmed nor refuted.] 
KGB Officers within the Soviet Delegation 
NOSENKO claimed.that he would know of any others, and he 
• was the sole KGB .officer within the Soviet Disarmament Dele­
gation in 1962. Antong delegates he identified only Oleg 
GRINEVSKIY as having any connection with the KGB. GRINEVSKIY 
was one of NOSENKO's own agents within the delegation: in 
Moscow .he was handled by KGB officers of the Intelligentsia 
and Correspondents Department of the Second Chief Directorate. 
Among other delegates NOSENKO described A.K. KISLOV and V.Go 
FILATOV. According to NOSENKO, KISLOV was head of the Ameri­
can Section of TASS and was. "a genuine correspondent"; "de­
finitely not an intelligence officer". 
Comment: CIA had tentatively identified all three of 
the delegates as KGB officers. "KISLOV was ob­
served in apparent KGB operational activity in 
both Washington and Moscow. FILATOV served as 
an alternate contact with the KGB agent in NATO, 
Georges PAQUES O \British IntelligencEt] has re- l / 
ported that GRINE'\TSKIY was a member of the per­
manent Soviet delegation in Geneva who handled
