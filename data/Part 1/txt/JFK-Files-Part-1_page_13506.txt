1bort range commun.icaUona, etc. 1 is available from many 
manufacturers. Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a 
am~u number-of radio &witches based OD tbeae devic?S with a 
considerably lener degree ol security !tom false signal triggering 
with a lead time of 6 to 6 w~eks. Simple mechanical protection 
against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of counting 
switches, for example, which reqaire a preset number of !iring 
impulses intenti<mally transmitted to produce the final closure of 
a relay and !iring of a charge. 
5. Reliability of operation in terms of response to a 
tranamltted signal o! a given power ls quite difficult to predict when 
conditions of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be 
foreseen. Location of the receiver .in a target building will also have 
a strong bearing o~ 1range 1 from the transmitter. Building construction, 
intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre­
quency sources will affect performance. of the set. 
6. U you wi•ah to discus.a the pro.,. 1-.ma in greater depth, 
we recommend a conference with audio •echniciana or engineerR. 
It rnay serve to clarify the appropriate ·,haracteristics ~hich special or m

operation. PJdblema of camouflaging the explosive or in'ce.ndiary material 
to serve operational requirements would be minor _compared to the 
necessary consideration of ·effects on the receiver awJtch concealed 
within which could ~ve important effects on performance. •
