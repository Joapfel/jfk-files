Venezuela~s Ch~istian Demo­
crats (COPEi) have· str.ong hopes . 
of duplicating the victor~ of the 
Chilejn pa~ty· ih 1968 and appgar 
to. have nar,rowed the gap. between 
thiir 22 percent of tha•lector­
ate in· 1963 and tho_ governing 
Oemocrati~ Actioh's 32 p~rcent. 
COPEI Secretary General Rafael 
Caldera, "One of the· few tatin 
American CD leaders of interna­
tional statuie, is •xpected to 
be the party,'s standardi.bearer •. 
in his fourth try for ti'le presi­
dency·. 1fo has re.cently come out 
in favor of a politically expe'­
dient move to the right, thus 
filling the vacuum of.the cent~r~ 
right of the Venezuelan political 
spectrum and opening new sources 
of support. • 
In El Salvador, the POC 
garnered 31.2 percent of the 
votes in th~ March 1966 legisla­
tlve election· and one of its. 
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duartei 
retained the mayoralty of San 
Salvador. In less than six years 
the PDC has become the leading 
opposition party. It has little 
chance of capturing the presi­
dency in·l967, but should be a 
strong contender by 1972, with 
.·Notre Dame .- educated Mayor 
~Duarte the likely candidate. 
Applying even the most gen-
.erous criteria to the judgment 
of pote~tial, there are not more 
than four other CO parties--in 
the Dominican Republic, Panama, 
Brazil, and Guatemala--that might 
develop as moderately important 
forces·over the.next five years. 
The Dominican Revolµtionary 
social Chri~tian Party (PRSC), 
led by Coanabo Jav1cr, has abttn­
dc,ried, at least for the t1me being, 
the ir·resPQ·nsible policies it 
adopted after the April 1965 re­
volt ~hd h.:is moved toward the po­
litical center. .The party has 
made"iis opposition to the Bala­
guerigovernment cl.ear, but has 
also·!hdicated that.it intends to 
operat~ within bounds ~cceptabla 
to the President. The PRSC hopes 
that this moderate line will in­
crease its. following and enable 
it ·to improve on the poor showing 
• it made in. the 1966 elections. 
The party ha·s developed a small 
but talented cadre, primarily 
from the university ranks. 
The Panamanian POC was reg­
istered some five years ago and 
pollect·only 3.1 percent of the 
votes in 1964. Although it con­
tinues a minuscule party, it has 
made significant organizational 
strides and its philosophy of 
social justice gives it roots. 
lacked by most Panamanian parties, 
which are largely personalistic 
or tied to financial interests. 
The PDC is currently negotiating 
.ith the mass-based Panamenista 
Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's 
largest--in hopes of forming a 
coalition for the May 1968 elec­
tions. The CDs have offered to 
provide t~e•Panamenistas ~ith 
much-needed administrative skills 
in return for a share of the as­
se:ilily seats in the next election. 
A long-range goal would be to 
acquire support within Arias' 
party and inherit his mass fol-
101.-ing when he passes from the • 
scene.
