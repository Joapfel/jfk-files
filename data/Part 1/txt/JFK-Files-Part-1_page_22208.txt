b. DERYABIN • s Comrr.ents 
The follo~ing statements by DERYABIN are based or. his question­
ing of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 Augus~ 1965. The questions 
asked an~ the statements attributed to NOSENKO (referred to as 
Subject) ffere during this pe:riod. Altho~gh the Soviet State Secu­
rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954, 
this term is us~ for co~venience sake, except where the specific 
organization of the M:,D or HVD is under discussion. DER¥ABIN's 
comnents follo~: 
"NOSENKO's Acceptance into State Security* 
• •Taking ~OSENKO's o.m statements at face value, it is highly 
improbable th~t a person such as he has described himself to be 
~ould be acceptable for a position as a staff officer 1n State 
Security. The follo~ir.g factors are important in this regard: • 
a. It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring 
the children of high goverr..:r.ent officials. 
b. Untib STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the 
aan who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain ~ntrance into the 
service, had no influence inside the MGS apparatus. From 
about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office 
irside the MGB or the '.:VO buildinga .. · I know personally that 
in these years KOBULOV ~orked in Germany as D.;puty Chief of 
the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad)** 
which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and 
later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The office was 
located- on Chkalova Street, near the Kurskiy Rai-lroad 
Station (three blocks fro.~ my. former apartment) ..

** NISMUT A.G. in Germany was subordinate to GUSIMZ: for a 
further discussion of KOBULOV's r~le in helpin~ NOSD:KO
