The KGS document elsewhere states: •h guide of a.tourist 
group, John Milton FRANCIS, born 1934, an instructor of Russian 
. at a college of Yale Uni versit:/~ _when iri Odessa with a group of 
tourists,--Ar.ierican students--:-~~parated himself from .. the group 
and. travelled through the city alone. In a n·o·tebook ·which was 
lost by him, notes and sketches were found which p61nted to the 
fact that hu utilized his tiip-for tho purpose of selecting 
suitable places for the placing.of deaddrops, or for checking 
those deaddrops which were earlier selected by American agents. 
In Moscow he selected. routes which were used to check and dis­
discover the existen.:::e. o·f surveillance, utilizing passable backyards 
and following skillfulmethods. At the present ti:ne FRANCIS is 
the chief ir.terpreter of the State.Department, servicing Soviet 
delegations in the USA." 
FRA.~CIS did have.such a mission in 1958 and brought back a 
notebook with sketches of the sites he selected. He did not 
mention losing his notebook. In 1954 ar.d 1955 FRANCIS was in 
frequent contact with V.V. KHIVOSHEY in Berlin; KRIVOSHEY, ~ho 
served there until the late 1950's, has been identified as a KGB 
First Chief Directorate offi~er who later became an officer in 
the C·::>rrespondents Department, KGB. Second Chief Directorate.* 
FRANCIS was also a student of Richard BURGI at Yale in 1956, the 
year that NOS~NKO was involved in BURGI's recruitment (see Part 
v.o.4.b.). NOSENKO has not mentioned the FRANCIS case and did 
not recognize his name. 
Besides these and other examples in the document GOLITSYN 
gave CIA, there are indications of KGB awareness of the clandes­
tine activities of many other CIA contacts who travelled to the 
S_oviet Union as tourists during the period from 1955 to 1960.
