(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
was promoted to the position of a (one of three) Deputy Chief 
of the entire Seventh Department. A year later, he was made 
First Deputy Chief, and thus second-in-command to CHELNOKOV 
and general supervisor of all Second Chief Directorate tourist 
operations. The Seventh Department, which had a strength of 
about 100 KGB officers, was responsible for all operations 
against tourists in the Soviet Union. From this period NOSENKO 
claimed to have learned, either by virtue of his position as -
Deputy Chief or otherwise, of a number of KGB operations 
against Americans, including two arrests, one recruitment, and 
investigations of a ·suspected FBI agent and of Lee Harvey 
OSWALD. NOSENKO as well attributes to his senior KGB posi-
tion during this period his knowledge of an American GRU agent 
and of the KGB investigation of a disaffected American Embassy 
Section officer, the latter occurring just before NOSENKO re­
turned to Geneva for the second time, and defected.
