MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
1. At.0900 this mocning I talked with Frank Friberg recently 
returned COS Helsinki re Warren Commission inquiry concerning 
the timetable of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, including 
his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. (Copy of the Commission 
letter of 25 May 64 and State Cable of 22 May 64 attached.) 
2. Friberg gave me the following information: 
a. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to 
downtown Helsinki; 
b. By taxi, it would take no more than 5 minutes to 
reach the Soviet consulate; 
c. The Soviet consulate probably closed at 1300 hours local 
time 6n Saturdays in 1959; 
d. Passenger lists (manifests) at the U.S. Consulate in 
Helsinki are retained for six months only and then are destroyed. 
Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at 
the time. 
e. A copy of State's cable inquiry would go i:o the Helsinki 
Station and they would assist in preparation of·a reply. 
3. Mr. Friberg agreed that it would be worthwhile to cable the 
Station concerning points not covered by State in their inquiry. He 
suggested changes incorporated into the cable sent to Helsinki.
