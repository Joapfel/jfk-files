631. 
- In January 1964, entirely out of context, he asked 
vhether G0LITS'il? had reported to CIA that Finnish President 
KEKKCNEN was a XGB agent. (He ~39 not able to explain in 
later questioning why he had not infor.::ed CIA about the case 
before he made the foregoing in~uiry.) 
- N0SENK0 asked precisely how American Intelligence col­
lection in the USS~ is directed and coordinated. The CIA case 
officer responded: "What was thJt question?• N0SENK0 there­
upon said: •1 t was not a questi,..':1--just general interest." 
When the case officer urged him to repeat the question, he re­
fused to talk about it and diverted the co~versation to other 
0atter11. 
- He asked where CIA secretaries resided in the Washing­
ton area. 
- N0SENK0 tried to find out the grades of the CIA offi­
cers in contact with him. 
- N0SEUK0 inquired in early 1964 whether the CIA offi­
cer who met him in Gcr.cva two years earlier had received a 
medal for that phase of the operation. 
(ii) Acceptance of Contrary Information from Other Sources 
Under interrogation, even when accused of lying, N0SEHKO 
rarely challen9ed the validity of CIA's infom.ation nor claimed 
superior knowledge. The only facts he challenged strongly were 
incontestably true, such as the date of G0LITSY~'s defection, the 
date of ABIDIAN's visit to the P~shkin Street dead drop, K0SC­
LAPOV's travel separate from JENSER, and K0S0LAP0V's November 1960 
trip to Helsinki. It seemed at all times that he accepted that 
CIA knew more than :-,e did on to~ic·s including ccnditions in the 
OSSR and cases and people for whoo he clai~ed direct responsibility. 
·Be never challenged DER~ABIN's statements abcut KGB procedures, 
although avare that his own infor::iation ~as ~ore rccer.t. 
(e) Discussions with N0SENKO on His Own Performance 
After admitting his inability to respond to questions about 
operations in which he said he participated, S0SENK0 sometimed 
gave a general appraisal of his own perfon&ance. He ~culd ad.~it 
that it was •impossible to have such memory breaksn and agree 
that his response was neither reasonable nor acceptable ("In your 
place I wouldn't believe it either,• or on a..,other occasion, •rt 
will look bad to your boss•). Admitting that the questions were 
fair, logical, and clearly put, he acknowledged ~t least a dozen 
.times du.ring the January-March 1965 interrogation that his per­
formance under questioning was·bad and unacceptable.
