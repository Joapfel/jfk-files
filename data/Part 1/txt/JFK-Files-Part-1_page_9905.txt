1. LIRING/3 !'epo!'ted to L,owton at C900 on 30 Gctc'.·er,1967~ that he 
bad finally ~enged to have a private talk .ith Rodolfo! Reyes Cortes, 
hie Mexican chereograpoer friend, ou the afternoon of f7 Gctober,1967; 
and that, it the course of conversation, ?.odolfo iieyes; had revealed 
to LIRrnG/3 in confidence ttx:t the reason why the l..I.<U.NGS had asswned 
a rather cool attitude toward ll.:tH:G/3 over the pas~ y·ear. .aodolro 
Reyes explabed that the last ti:ne he was _in "-'av8.,Ila he la4_ hear<:l rugiors, 
uong his friends in the 11exican colony, that LinI:iG/J was working 
•either for d8?Iilli or the Cubans". Rodolfo went o~ t~ say that the 
oriE,1ll oi ~Ills rwwor, as rar as ne could asc~rtain, was the fact that 
Llfil~G/3 had cade two trips into Havana for no knoli:l apeci!icreason and 
at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that ae himself did not 
believe the ru:nors or, at least, did not care whether they vere true or 
not, co:::.mented to LIRHIG/3 that other mecbers or J r--r7':G/3 • s profession 
were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of t~eir group and were 
always quick to draw their owu couclusions. 
2. LIRING/3 co.:.mented to Rofiton that, al though this news had shaken hi.· 
and LlilNG/4 badly at the time, neither of them c~d -partic~larly whit 
the LIRiliGs thousht of them, since their o;m co!!sci-en~e ~as clear~. ll­
BING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop:.hi.s 
co:;:imercial ~ctivity in Ohiapas ( especiall7 since iicdolfo Reyes' home is 
by coincider.ce.located in San Cristobal) so that ao::-d!would gradually_ 
filter back to the Ll~J;;~s that be actually did have financial resource& 
outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that o~viously the ~Ga 
clid not have ailY specific proof or they would long ago have cut off al.l 
I 
contact ~it~ him as well as LI.i:UNG/4. He concluded that since the LIRI!iGs 
_had.certain suspicions, they na~urally ~ar~ed all bislfriends and ror:er 
• ·-'-contacts (1:lcludin6, of course, :.rnol Hodriquez), to atoid close contact , , 
vitb him until their doubts could be resolved; J' · ~--·· .---,----
). 'Tn rep~y to iowton 1 s query LIRlNG/3 stated that a olfo Reyes and Carmen I Molina (separately) had commented to him that they •ere favorably iGpresseQ 
b7 Rovton· at:d did not voice any suspic-ion or Rowton'srbona tides (as a 
Greek ~eft_ist· businesswan). Car:nen Molina, in fact, htd gone so far as to 
abo·.t some irri t·ation that LIRiliG/3 had not introduced her to Harlen pre­
vio~~~-~since she was anxious to develop soce sort o!,luc~~tive business
