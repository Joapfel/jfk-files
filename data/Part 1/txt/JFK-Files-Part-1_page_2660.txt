(KGB ENTRY) 
KGB Ehtry: Summary and Conclusion 
N0SENK0's assertions regarding the KGB in the 1953-1954 
period throw no more light on the actual date of his KGB 
entry than did his claims of when he transferred from the 
Naval RU; the contradictions and inconsistencies are 
interrelated. 
It is possible that a former KGB officer, relating the 
truth as he recalls it about events occurring ten years 
earlier, could be inconsistent; that he could forget his 
date of entry, not remember what administrative procedures 
were~ fail to recall the circumstances of the organization 
-.he joined were~ be.inaccurate about what his pay was, and 
be vague on what h1.s KGB identification document looked 
like. Recognizing that administrative regulations and 
procedures are on occasion honored in the breach, it is 
also possible that N0SENK0was accepted by the KGB despite 
·the ·fact that he was the son of a senior· official, that .he 
had.tuberculosis,- that he was unqualified for Party member­
ship,_ t_hat lie had beE;n previously rejected and all at a 
time when the KGB was not acceptiri~ new fcicruits. • 
.The probability of these events being coincident, however, 
Is remote. On ·examination, N0SENK0's latest admission~ that 
he •iactually" entered the KGB in March 1953, is no better 
sub~tantiated fhan.earlier accounts citing other dates. 
Conclusion 
N0SENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner nor at the 
time he claimed.
