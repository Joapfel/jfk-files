1960 when he applied at tho Amerir.an ~basay in lifo~;cow for a vi~a 
to enter the United States as a ~ember of an automotive delega­
tion. The following conth CIA obtained copies ot his pas3port 
photograph nt two separate points on h1a TOY route to Cuba. 
There was no 1nd1cat!on of intelligence affiliation, and when 
};OSEXKO arrived undc.· true na:M) .vi th the Soviet dclcgnt ion in 
Geneva in t2rch 1962. he wns ~ccutded no more th~n the interest 
routi1:ely given by Western intclligcnc~ services to Soviets 
travelling abro&d.* After arriving in Switzerla&d, howe\er, Lut 
before cstal,lishing co:itact with CIA, ~osr.:;Ko was involved in 
at least two incidents ~hich hrou~ht him to the special notice 
of the British, ~~Js~, Arncric~~. nnd possibly the ~est German 
servicE:s. 
. . 
The first of thPse occurred in April 19f2. At a cocktnll 
party in Geneva, N0:-3£~:KtJ met :i female sccrC'Uiry cmployc<.l t>· the 
British foreign Offic.:c. He s:iw her scver.?l days l;iter in tht::· 
corridors of the P:·l'.lis des ~atiom; :>rid a.<:;ked her to hnve dinner 
with him, and a date was made for several cven1n~~ later. Ac­
cording to the sccrcrary's later account as reported by her 
superiors: "They t3lked about :,tarx1!>m, the Chjn•csc, Y:igosl:wio, 
and love; NOSEXKb was obviously smitten ~1th her, became v~rbally 
a~orous, and told her that he would like to take her off to a. 
dese1·t island.'' The girl felt that NOSEl-iKO probablv was not 
intercst~d in her for intelligence purposei. but seemed to be 
genuinely attracted by har. From har conversations with SOSESKO 
she wa.s able to report that "he had been in submarines during 
the war and, according to himself, hnd risen to the rank of 
Cl):r:.t1ar,der. He was a :icmber of the Communist Party. His father 
was in the Mini:.,try of Shippin~. Ile hi~sel f had served in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1948 and 1949 ond had appareatly 
visited Er.gland but h:id not .be.en stationed thf)re. '.' ~;osE:nw 
also told her that he was acquainted with ~of the 
~publishj1ig h•Juse ln LcH~don. •it Wh<!n :,;osE:-;Ko became too 
pers1ste~t in his attcutions, the secr~tary reported the contact 
to her superiors, wa3 withdrawn immediately from Switzerland, 
and later r~sign0d from the Forei:n Of!ic~. 
This same incjdcnt also brought NOSENKO to the attention 
of the Swiss service, which L1t1?r reportl'd it to CI,,, without 
details, as an attempt on NGSE~KO's part to recruit the girl. 
*Although NOSE,r,;Ko was dcscrlbc-d in re-ports (held by CIA) con- ' 
cerniog recruitm~nt approaches to lmerlcins in Moscow.prior to 
Its first arrival in Geneva, there was 110 basis in th•:se re­
ports to identify the Soviet describ~d ns NOSEXKO. The name 
NOSENKO did not appear in these earlier reports. 
•~ .was one of ,N~SENKO•'s targets during a 1957 trip 
to tile SrJV iet Union. 'iOSENKC> used the. all o·s NIKOLAYEV in his 
contacts withlillit and, in CIA debricfir.~s. gave this. as the 
reason he wns forced to use the name NIKOLAYEV in the two trips 
. he mad~ to London in 1957 and 1959. The secretary knew NOSENKO 
by true name. (See Parts V.D.3.d. and V.E.8. for discussion of
