NOSENKO has also indic;,::~ed that foe KGB sometimes suspected, 
and on occasion actually became aware that va:rious agents did not 
fully report everything of interest to the KGB. The KGB oi course 
was aware that CECC?.:I was involved in the black market. However, 
whether he reported to the KGB everything he did and with whom is 
open to question; viz., tb.e:_Maurice ZWANG) case below. 
The comment was made in the previous su..--nmary that NOSENKO 
was \maware that
1
MORONEjmet some Soviet .females in the spring of 
1961 at the apartment of ~arwat el SHAZLY, an Egyptian-national KGB 
agent of the Sixth Depart...--nent who was also reporting on Americans, 
and was intimate with one in this apartment. 
A review of official :records indicates that :MORONE) did report 
having met some Soviet girls at the apartment of Sarwat, but there is 
no indication that he admitted or that anyone else has reported that he 
was inti.Inate with any of them. The conclusion of the previous su:mm.ary 
in this regard was based on a misinterpretation. Accordingly, since 
there is no reason to believe that any compromise incident took place 
in the Sarwat apartment, the story of NOSEKKO on this matter is con-
sidered completely acceptable.
