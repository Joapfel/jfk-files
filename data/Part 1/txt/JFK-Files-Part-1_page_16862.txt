MEETING ARRANGEMENTS 
3. LIEMPTY-13: He is 111et by FERNALD il the early hours 
of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from 
the basehouso. LIEAIPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a 
central park o~ Cnlle ttoracio where he is intercepted within 
a ten-block distance by FERNALD, driving his car. During a 
drive together, instructions and product are passed hetwcen them 
and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the 
salaries for LIEMPTY-14, -26 and -27. After drop-off LIEMPTY-13 
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-tlme Job, thus 
avoiding any direct route back to the basehcuse operation, 
4. LIEMPTY-9: After completing his strveillnnce workday 
from 0800 to 1500 hours, he comp lot es his w11 L Lt!n :repo1•ts and 
drives to meet FERNALD at around 1630 hours, also on Tuesdays. 
The location of car meetings _varies but rc::i.:ins within a quiet, 
fairly secluded section. After leaving FER~ALD, L1EMPTY-9 
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's au1omobilc dealership 
for the remainder of his day, again avoidin, any direct route 
_ from FERNALD back to the basehouse. 
5. LIEMPTY-4: After receiving the unJrocessed take from 
LIEMPTY-9-and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested 
by log entries that accompany -the take, and goes to, LI EMPTY- 4' s 
medical office waiting rootn in the late afternoon. 1-'or these 
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pha·rmaceutical salesman or 
a patient and gets to see LIEMPTY-1 only after all other visitors 
have departed. At each meeting, FERNALD d€livers films from 
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing anc retrieves the 
_proc·essed take that 1 he had left the week before. While this 
arrangement means t;t,<>t some of the product (those photos taken 
soon after meeting with LIF.MPTY-9 a.nd -13) arc almost two weeks 
old when received at the StaLion, wo have 3dt fotind this to be 
unacceptable. When speed is of the essence in special 
circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the 
process·ing. ;
