H oy:d lies by a Contract Employee 
l. You have requested the opinion of this OHice in regarrl to 
the retention of future· royalties which might be earned by TerenL·e S. 
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is 
entitled to retain such royalties without an oCCset against his Agency 
salary.

CRABANAC's cover docs ncit include the role of a writer; CRABANAC 1s 
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service 
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may. 
ren1ain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he wriks as 
a profitable hobby w_ill not be emoluments received Crom or thron~h his 
"cover activities."
