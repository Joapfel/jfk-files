Dear Olivers 
This is an at't.empt to give you tr.e backeJ"ound ot our special 'US! BAY,ER bucfeet. 
This is the balloon project, initi.r.tM:I last tall after the first Tlinds 0£ Jo'reedan 
one and scheduled for Christnasti.--.e. It was then known as E.a."lh Claus or SUGAR 
CP.ARLIE. Arter de.finite cancel_aticn tor Chrl:itnas and poet;;c-:-.enent to Easter, 
it became known_ in our accounts as Zutl!r aIDny or EASY BAY.ER. 
In a manorandum to John DB.'.!lewoo<!, c!.ated lieccmber 5, 1951, Ab':;,.:,tt said: "Attached, 
also, is request to cover costs ot oi;e"ration Santa Claus to date. txcopt £or • 
some continuir.r; preparal..ions ir, the field, tJiis too is being :Cept on ice pending 
further word .fran you. You will recall t.~at AWD authorized the purchase or 
vehicles, etc., at our conference in his office in October. We ~stiJ:lated at 
that time that the tot.u project would .run approximatel,y tl 75,000.• 
Fonnal request to the Foundation !or the &51,5'00 was ma.de Jar:r.ary .3rd, tog.other 
with request for December and Januar,y operating expenses. !11 these BU.111S wore 
received by Crusade January 10th. 
On one of.Abbott's January or Febnt2r7 tripe to your city, he received a promise 
·to transfer to us the balance of the EASY BAKER budget {Sl2.3,$00). I would ✓ 
strongl,y recommend that this would be the neatest wa:y of handling this account. 
We naturally keep separate accounti~ tor thi-s bud,:et and c~lc give ;rou an 
accountine to date at any time on re-;;ueEt. To make s-.ich a transfer now would 
also enable you to dispose or this aue,eet in your current tieeal year, in which 
an allocation for it has presunabl7 been ma.de. 
I should ··perhaps set down for U:e record that it cannot be guaranteed that an 
EASY BAKER type operation, llhen an~ 1! it should be defin~tely put on the schedule, 
can be carried off for the original bud?,"et of f.175,000. T'::.ere are too many 
variables. And, while the major p;.rt of the budget spent or to be spent goes 
for quasi cai:i tal. &Guipment, Ba!le o:: it goes or will go fer expencable operation 
(publicity, cOl:lll!Wrlcations, anc the like) -wtrlch would have to oe repeated 1n 
eonr.ection· with another balloon o;::eration. 
Attae!ied is a sct.ec..lle o! e.xpws,;,e i.r.,J CWll!U.tments as of llarcn 21st a;.,;ainst 
the EASY e>.Krn rue.get. FrOll this TC'J. will see that we have h~ to use general 
operating funds o! about $21,000 tor ~SY BAKER s.s or that date. A rough estimate 
ot iadditional costs of· t..~e prayer op~rat.ion, Tlhich belongs to US! :-.:AY.£.~, is 
$9,!tl(). (I also attach for your i.r.!cr.nation a mimeographed report. indicating 
the acceptance or the prayer opera ti.on &l:1011(; the churches.) 
To recapitulate, this is a rec;ueat !or transfer or the balar.ce o! !12.3,SOO of 
the EASY llAi,"1:R special buqet.. 
Sincerely- ,ours.
