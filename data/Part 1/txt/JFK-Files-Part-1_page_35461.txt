With respe~ --~ plan !or clande_etine operations in Cuba, 
he stated that 300 men could be counted upon for commando action, part 
of them he.re, part in Cuba. He reiterated that a commando operation 
was essential to bolater morale among the anti-Castro elements in Cuba 
and in exile as well aa to conduct sabotage that would further weaken • 
Cuban economy and the Communist regime. He said that for this operation 
U. S. help would be nzcessary in providing weapons, ammo, demolitions, 
_equipment; and funds. He proposed that if this plan was considered to 
have merit, that 1 arrangf.! to have someone meet with hie military men 
to Work out the details. After all preparations had been made and 
materiel provided, etc. the operation would be purely a Cuban affair, 
(NOTE: Plan turned over tQ Thompson at our rm eting at 15:30 on 
6 October for transmission.) · 
4. Request !or Arms, etc, to send to Eecambray 
Dr.MIRO remarked that over a month ago he had made a request 
to Clark for arms for the anti-Castro insurgents in the Eecambray, but 
to date had heard nothing relative to the request. He commented wryly, 
111 ask but never hear an answer. 11 He said that the fighters there should 
be supported. Dr . .MIRO stated that he had a boat (provided by us) and 
a mea11e for ·delivery of the arms. Osvaldo RAMIREZ is chief of the 
Escarnbray group.; 
COMMENT: Has anything been done about this request? 
5. Information on Arms Received by Castro Regime 
Dr. MlRO handed me a long report which he said was brought 
to him by the Argentine Ambassador to Cuba when the latter came to the 
U. S. at the time of President FRO~IZI'e visit.* He said the Ambassador 
would not dh-ulge the source of the information but commented, "You will 
know. 11
