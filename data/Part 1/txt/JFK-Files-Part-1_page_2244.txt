United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA .. 
Note however that the listi~g would contain only those personalities with an 
OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those 
with no OI- code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that 
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also 
that when retiie~g lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific 
as the occupation code· (Attachment 1). The· occupation code for a_ courier.·
