(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO' S I<GB CAREER) 
Comment: The Komsomol membership elects only the 
·Komsomol Committee. The latter elects the 
secretary.

tary in any specific manner. He does not know who was the 
secretary of the KGB Komsomol organization, nor could he 
describe his dealings w~th that official's office. 
Comment: The secretary of the Second Chief Directorate 
Komsomol organization is directly subordinate 
to the KGB.Komsomol secretary and would have 
occasion to deal with the latter frequently.

.Komsomol Congress while he was Komsomol secretary of the 
Second Chief D.irectorate, but that the Congresses were 
ordinarily held yearly.

held in March 1954, entailin(! considerable 
work by every I<omsomol member and especially 
by the unit secretaries. 
As Komsomol secretary, NOSENKO collected the dues of the 
members of his unit: All members paid in the amount of two 
percent of-their monthit silaries. •
