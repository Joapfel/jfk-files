l. Mr, Williamson reported to \\11/Cublln Opt:!rntions 
Group in Februnry 196G and immediately took over the 
functions or Chief of tho fl Drnnch. This Branch is 
concerned-with thp_conduct of positive intelligence 
operations on u world-wido basis against tho Cubau 
target. A smnll proportion of those operations were 
conducted directly from llcndqun1·tors (including the 
dir-,ction of as'scts insido Cuba, n dented arua). The 
larger number o.f those oporutions was conducted through 
third C'ountries.: and supervision involvt•d tho provision 
of staff suppori and guidance and extensive donlings 
with other Oivi~ions nnd, ·to a lesser dugroo, with 
representatives of foreign liaison sorvicos. Mr. 
Williamson took hold of these dutios quickly and force­
fully And cnrriod thom out offoctivoly nnd efficiently. 
2, In July 1966, Mr. Williamson was appointed

3. During this period, Mr. Willitunson has primari­
ly been Jntorested in substantivo oporntional matters. 
Ho has c~rriod out efficiently and promptly those 
staff functions which I hnvu assignod to him, but I
