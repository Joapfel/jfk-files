'RUIZ seems • to have certain admiration for 
Francisco FRANCO, ·who,. in. his view,· is the only 
re~son why Spain has ·cot turned communist. Of 
course, it is doubtful- that he really believes 
this. 
He does not hide his favorable opinions 
of the American people, who are !'frank" and 
"simple". "They treated me very well," he 
told Raul LEON Torras in December 1969. 
On international matters he is up-to­
date and well-informed, Following are some 
~of .. his views, which are contr·adictory at times: 
" Cuba is a political power, not a military 
or economic power~ 
"The USSR has neutralized u.s. sea power 
in the Mediterranean. 
" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever· ft· 
chooses to do s·o, although_th-2 base has lost its 
strategic valu_e to the United States. 
". US-China rapproachment should be feared, 
bµt ~~so a_ Japan-China alliance.
