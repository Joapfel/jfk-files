LIPSllCK-24 docs not know GERENDE nnd, prC4umably, know• 
only LlPSTlCK-2, with whom he works on the pho<o true.le. Hls 
caver ls as a salesman of electrical appllancea; however, he 
does not pun.me hls cover Job to the destrabl~ extent. LlPSTICK-24 
was recruited by LlPSTICK-2 aoout one year &f.O a.,d l8 currently 
recetvlag a sol.ary of $1, (X;i). 00 (~-IN) per month. Slnce he has 
now worked a year for the Statton, and performed satisfactorily, 
hts 6llL1ry Ghould be rnlscd to $1,200.00 (MN) per month (LIEMPTY 
\\ill provide tor thls tncrease). 
(3) C.Ommuntc.'ltlons - CERENOE meets LIPSTICJC-2 two to three 
rtmes a week. These met:!ttngs are arranged by phone and take 
place at prevtously selected coruaa points which can be referred 
to tn telephontc conversations by Innocent ·sounding code names. 
LlP~TICK-2 also lcnowii GERLNDE's true name, where he lives, and 
hls pb~no, DUIJ?l>er. Jn tJ:i_t, ~~kq°-_has ha<,l~~~-,~ !~~tx,ne 
CERENDif at'the latter 1·e-ho'me;r 'LIPSTICIC-·2·1tnowa i:5INGLEY, and 
could. in an emergency siluatlon, contact OINGLE.Y. However, 
GERE.NOE has been instructed to arrange a complete commlliltca• 
tlons plan with LIPSTICK-2, tncludtng a reserve mearufof contact. 
For security reasons, GE.RENDE has bec:n uwtruaed to Inform 
LIP5TICK·2 that hls only conrnct ls wlth GERENDE and thAt tn 
the future he ts not to contact anyone elae 1n the organization 
w1L'1out GERE."'lDE's pcrmt:;ston. Alao, that should contact wttb 
GERENDE be dlBrupted, he ts to await for the htgher echelon to 
C6tabltsh contact wlth him (all agents lDlder GERI::..~DE are being 
f.O lnstrucied). Tots ts panic.ularly tmponant tn the case of 
tpsttclc-2, slncc he has by-passed GERENDE ln two or three 
Instance. ln the past. 
( 4) Securtcy- Probably the mosc serious security atruatton 
tnvolvtng the photo truck, LIPSTICIC-2 and Llpsttc.ic-24 ts the 
baste knowledge of the LIPSTICK surveillance team lbnt such an 
asset exlsts, even to the point that one of the team mem~rs 
(LIPsnCK-34) is the listed owner of the photo t~ The personal 
knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operation also represents· 
a securtty hazard of the ftrst class. For example, tf LIPsnCK-2 
were compromised and arrested as a result of hls aatvtttes, 
there ts a posstbiltty that he could compromise hta brother, 
LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE 
and our Interest ln the highly senstttve LL\1ESA/LIMW:,1 operatlon. 
(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and rhe former 
LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICI<-2 have 
been reminded on several occasions during the past few years 
that they were not to discuss any aspect of thelr operations wtth 
each ocher. Also, L~,iCK-2, to the best of the Statton'&
