(1) Introduction 
In the many and long interrogation s~ss1ons ~here emerged 
habits of behavior noticeable t.'.> t::a.~h .:>! the CIA officers present. 
Tr.ese characteristics of ~os:::t:Ko ~ere his ~a~r.~r of recour.ti~g 
eve:its and his evasiveness, ir.--prov1.sc.t1ons, ar.d other defer.sive 
tE:::hniques. They are cevie· .. ·ed t..clo ..... 
(ii) Ha!!ner of Recounti;29. Events 
Typical of NOSEHKO's performance: int.he inte::-rogations were 
the following points. 
- Talking about. operat.io~s he s~pc:v1sed a:-.d a:,out his pe::-­
so~al role in the KGB Headquarters aspe:::ts of other operations, 
NOSEXK0 habitually used the passive \'Oic.e ("it ...-as decided") or 
ir.di.cated that he was not alor.e 1n these: a:::tlVities ( "there was 
no a~cour.ti.ng on ...-ho wa5 ~ori<i.ng on any cxe cler~ case--it .as 
GRYAZNOV, ,0.5CLAPO'/, NC'SENKO, a:,d also worki:-:g \,:as KLYPIN, GiHBJ...~­
OV," or "We macle the declsior.--I and KOVSHUK and GR'iAZNOV," or "I 
and GRYAZNOV discussed this with him. 'l When asked -where a par­
ticular conversation ~ook pla::e, he rarely located it in his own 
offi,:-e (·'I was in l<0'/51-:UK•s offl..::E .. t-.er.. KCSLC'J .:a':.led him atx:>ut. 
the trip" or "I was 1.r. KLYPIH"s offlce ar.d he \.'as talking to 
JCOVSH"vl<") • • 
- At the other extreme fr0C'1 being impersonal, NOSENKO some­
tirees quoted conversations in ·•h1ch he took part ( ··1 u~~n said," 
''he said to me," et.c.l, but it ...-as in just such matters that 
NOSENKO m~st often contradicted hL~self (e.g .. his relatior.ship 
with GRIBANOV ar.d his pa1t. 1n the re~ruiu~e~t approach to the 
.Acerican code clerk James STORSB~RGi. 
- In repeating certain'st.ories (the O!EREPA..~V case and the 
provocation against Professor Frederick BA.QGHOCPN are examples) 
NOSENKO gave them in precisely the sa-ne o::-der, aithout addition 
or· om;.,ssior.. , In relating ti',e PENKOVSKIY story, -which he stressed 
he learned ulittle by little' ftom several differe:it sources, he 
presented the facts each time in nearly ider.ti~al order. Asked 
for more details on these cases, heir.variably ins1sted--often 
with irritation--d.at he knew r.othi.ng more ar.d if he did, he 
would have reported it. Other fact.ors cor.t.ritut:ed to th~ im­
pression that in such inscances NOSENKO had deli~ered his infor­
mation Ly rote: Statemen·ts llke ''I don't. remember what I told 
you before" when queried agair. on a particular case: detachment 
and a lack_ of emotion when des er ibing the c.or:ipror.ase_ of Soviets· 
lfflO, like himself, had cooperat.e~ with A.~e.i~a~ Intelligence: 
POPOV, PE.'ilCOVSKIY, and CHEREPA.~OV; an ir.ability to correlate 
dates ar.d evE:nts in different. ooerat.i.::>ns •••hi.ch he said he vas 
handling (such as co~flicts ir. the timing of his afproach to 
W.E. JOP.NSON and in the date he g,1ve for .John V. AEIDIAN's visit 
to tl:e Push.ltin Street dead dro:,. and conflict bet.~een the dates 
of his participation in the MC'~ONE =ase and his travel ~o Cuba).
