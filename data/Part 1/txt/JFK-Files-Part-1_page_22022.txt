E.,nbassy Section in 1959 and he:c:1 this positio:1 t:?1til early 1SG2.

characterized him as a capable officer with abo~t 15 years of 
1(Gi3 experience, at least. tc-n of tl:crn i:. t':,~ l•.r.;crican Department,

KOVSHUK was handling KGB ager.t Henry SHAPIRO. CIA records show 
that in addition, KOVSHUK was involved in the :-1oscow and Wasr.­
ington phases of the "A.~.:;RE'l" case (h~ wns ider.tifiec1 by Dayle

**GOLITSx'N's passport and travel records held by C!A confirm that 
C-OLITSi'N travelled only twice to the Soviet Union after his 
6rrival in.Helsinki on 20 July 1960. 'i'he first of these trips 
was on 19 January 1961, -.,,.hen he· flew .directly from Helsinki to 
Moscow; he returned to Helsinki by rail a week later, on 28 
January. GOLITSYN's second trip to the Soviet Unio:i was from 
9 to 15 April 1961, when he appears to have spent all or most 
of this period in Leningrad. A Finnish national, whom GOLITSYN 
had been developing in Helsinki, has reported that he met .with 
GOLITSYN in Lening~ad on a daily basis from 10 through 13 April 
1961. Moreover, GOLITSYN ·has never rr.entioned being in Moscow 
during this time. • Since GOLITSYN remained in Helsinki from 
April until December 1961, when he defected, it appears that 
he erred by one month in reporting the_dat~ of his conversa­
tions in the American Department and that he learned of the
