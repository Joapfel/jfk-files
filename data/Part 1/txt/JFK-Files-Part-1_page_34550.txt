lives and works. In this case, the Oswald file was in· Minsk. 
Moscow would .have an almost identical file on the subject for 
control purpcscs and for instructions on how to handle and 
develop the case. This hcaclquar~ei"s Cile Is called the. Control 
File. 'fhi9 file exists on the person who is already an a;c:it or 
who is under dcvclopn,cnt or' training.
