with t;ho assfstanceJ>f his wife, KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons, 
KDFACTCR-e· and .;.9. • KDI-"ACTOR--5 has also served .JKLANCE in. this 
capacity sinc·e 1957 • .-
PRODUCTION 
5. KDLITIBAL: During this report.i,ng·period, KDLITERAL, 
through KDFACTOR-2, continued to bo th~.- S".'nrce of within-the-compound 
photographic coverage of PCS and TDY ~HHARSHers. He produced 76 
rolls of film and provided weekly written reports b·ased on his daily 
visual observat;!.01i: of the target area. 
8. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDADSINTHE produced 
167 rolls of film and cootinued to·be thepr-incipal source for infor-
.. _ ina~lon. on visit'ors to the MHHARSH installation, •1th speciai atton­
t-ioil giyen to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles. 
This segwnt of KDFACTOR also.continued to be the main source of 
information ~- .MHHARSH llcense plates and automobiles. 
• .. 7 •. KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed 
"attendance. sheets" on all'- MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined 
coverage, it WC\!ld be ~ifficult to identify personnel assigned to 
the MlffiARSH installation or to monitor tbeir daily movements and 
activities. 
SECURI1Y 
8 •. There were no known problems of security relating to the 
. projec~. The tormination of KDFACTOR-1 should pose no security 
problem: Contact·was broken nmicably, and it is highly probable 
that ho would be mor~ than willing to help out again Jf his services 
are needed. Of the remaining assets, nll five havo been SGSWIRLFl> 
in the past. They derive a substantial po1•tion of thei1• livelihood 
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus. lose a great deal if 
.security factors ever: necessitated a ter1oinntion of theil· work for 
us. As an additional safeguard·J the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTIIE opera­
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never boon 
any indication that either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's 
exis tcnce·. 
9. Contact is maintained with· only two of the five assets, 
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom aro responsible for the operation 
of their respective base houses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met 
weekly to obtain the KDLITERA~ and KDABSINTHE product for timely 
processing and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs. 
Meetings with KDFACT00-5 coosi~t of car meetings early in the 
morning along his route of travel to his overtJ>b. These meetings 
last only long enough to pick up the product, provide new supplios, 
and pay salaries, rents, utility bills, etc. Em~rgency Contact 
Plans are on file at the Station and have been forwarded to Head­
quarters on both KDFACTOR-2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are 
members of KDFACTO.q_5,s immediate family and could be c~ntacted­
througb him using his emergency plan. 
PROBLEMS 
10. Thero were no known problems connected with the project 
during the reporting period. 
FINANCES 
11. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 and tho subsequent elimina­
tion of outside photo processing costs accounts for the drop in 
anti.cipated project expenses shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973.
