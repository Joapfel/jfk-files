4, .It) searching for an area where Mr, O'Connell might strh-e 
for_ (urthei' improvCTnent, 1 am hard put to find any in the ligh~.of 
his (:'onsistcntiy high performance record. I do believe,. ho":e,,er. 
that.Mr. O'Connell h-as lost or app,~ars to have lost some of his 
enthusiasm ·and cager initiative which marked his performance for 
the fir_st si,c;!;months in this position. It is possible that this is due 
to the fact that the problems we cnco,inter today require mor;, 
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and 
initiative. Nonetheless I would like to sec Mr, O'Connell strive 
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics 
S. Mr. O'Connell has seen this report.
