3. In line vttb tbe need to put the debriefing on a busineaalike 
(rntber than a .,flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start 
by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement fros tbe 
time of bis first entry into leftist political movements tot• 
present day. (This can be presented to Subject a.a a basis for aa 
to formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal 
"confession" on his part.) In addition to providing us with a 
check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefiag 
conducted on GB&BX's terms, not Subject's. It is important that 
it be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want facts, aot 
speculation, commeatar, and analysis. 
,. Please charge paJJ118at& to Subject for tbe clebrtetlng to 
Acct. Rr. 5137 - 1488 (Bqs. LCBARVEST OOl). Three buadred dollars 
for the initial 2l hours talk with Subject is on the steep side. 
Weare thin.kine ia terms of $700 for five days debriefing with a 
bonus for a copy of tbe Revolution mailing list.
