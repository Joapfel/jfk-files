was of such import-ance that special-reports were 
written to the ~entral Co!lllllittce of the C~SU. How­
ever, I canriot remember ary speiiffc iricid~nts or 
events which these cables reported nbr any ipecific 
evaluatioos or recommendations made in these. cables. 
b. -Also. from the microphone in the !,linlster 
Counsellor's office, I rEm~nbcr itat he dictated fitness 
reports (kharakteristiki) on about twelve officers in 
the Embassy. I canl"'ot remecb1cr who an~• of these offi­
cers were or any details fro~ the reports. There was 
nothing in these reports which ~as interesting or 
useful to the KGB. 
c. From the microphom, in t11c ~lilitary Attache's 
office I remember t:1at the M1 li tary Attaches rcg'Jlarly 
discussed pl;rns for trips w1 thit1 the USSR and the tar­
gets that they ,...,anted to CO\'Er. Th€y also discussed. 
th~ results.of these trips after their return: How­
ever, I cannot reme~ber any infor~ation about speci-
fic trips planned O\ sp~cific ~1litary Atta~he per­
sonn~l or any sp~cific targets ~~at they planned to 
cover or any specific results from any trip. I <lo not 
remember any s~ecific op~retionai activily taken by the 
organs of the KGB 3gainst ~ilitary Attach~s on trips 
within_ tl\,c USSR w:1ich was b,H,E>cJ on infor::i.ition obtained 
from this microphone. 1here was no ~ntcresting, impor­
tant, or useful information about the personal or pro­
fessional lives or about the vulnerabilities of anyone 
in the ~ilitary Attache's office (Army, Navy, and Air) 
obtained from this microphone. 
d. I remember that from the microphones in the 
State Department code room occasionally a code clerk 
would read numbers. These numb£rs w€re only of inter-
est to the Eighth Directorate (Communications and Crypto-
logy) o.f the KGB. I do not rern~mber any conversations 
from this microphol!c. There was no information from 
this microphone oo any of the cod~ clerks which was 
interesting, important, or useful to the U.S. Embassy 
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, 
·KGB. 
During the approximately two years in which I daily reviewed 
the production from all the microphones in the American 
Embassy I do not remf'mber any information .on any American in 
the Embassy which was interesting, import'ant, or useful to 
me as the Deputy Chief of the E:abassy Section-except the 
points noted in the above paragraphs.'.' • •
