Why have I told you this? Because unJer other circumstances 
perhaps I would not havo come to this. So this is the reason 
for what has happened to me. This is perhaps the incident that 
drove me into contact with you. It all somehow grew within me.

11 June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself 
rafsed the issue of motivation. His case officer had just said 
that CIA would r~spect his wishes in connection with a particu­
lar request when iiOSENKO said: "Speaking of respect, how can 
there be respect? I don't evun respect myself for what I have 
done. But, but, take the press bulletin, the communiqu;; of 
the Summit Conference in Moscow on vz.rious questions. /..gain 
lies, lies, lies, to nhow that we have hau great successes. I 
can'bsee them [the successes]. No, excuse me, I k~ow somewhat 
more than the rank and file Soviet man b.acaus~ I work under this 
system. I can see what irbeing dcne and what is not baing done. 
Lies, more lies. ThiG was my mood. I say, 'Jlow much is it pos­
sible to deceive the puople, the Soviet people? How far can 
you go,7' Our people .ire very poor. It is sor..ewhat difficult 
to arouse a people such as this. If we stir ourselves up we 
will know how to stand up for ourselves. But I feel for my 
people. How often can you say that things will be good; how 
often can you say that we have achieved big successes? Where 
are they? Show me them. I can see no trace of them. This is 
what I say ... that there is resentment in my soul. Do you under• 
stand? A terrible resentm~nt. I love my country. You may say 
that this is nothing. But I tell you that I cannot act like 
GOLITSYN, like KHOKLOV, like PETRO\', because I want to be there. 
I want to be with my family. That's all. But I feel that not 
only the government is making mistakes. I feel that there are 
faults throughout the entire system of socialism. !faat I mean 
is ~hat things arc bad in Czechoslovakia, things are bad in Po­
land, things are bad with KADAR [in Hungary), they are starving 
in China. This means that there are great mistakes. Well, 
that's all. What did you want to ask me, please?" 
At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money 
was unimportant as a motiv~ for a continuing relationship: "My 
name must not be used anywhere, even in your offices. Understand? 
It would be the end of me. I am not afraid of this. The devil 
with them. Because I have had such a life. I lost my father, 
everything. Why do I say this? I did not come to you simply 
because I needed money. I don't need it. I came because.I am 
resentful inside. Do you understand this internal resentment?

this. Listen to me. Let me speak honestly-.· Have I not had the 
chance to live as a person should? My father was a big man. He 
had a dacha and a state-owned autosnobile .. I have my own Volga
