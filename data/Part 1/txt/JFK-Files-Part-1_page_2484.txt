among the indigenous employees of the American Embassy, did not 
recognize their photographs, and did not give sufiicier.::: details con-
cerning their specific activities is considered to be an unwarranted 
criticism. NOSENKO indicates that in general t:-ie handling of agents 
in the First Section was the responsibility of individual case officers. 
It is also apparent that the philosophy in t...½.e KGB was to maintain 
a single handler-agent relationship a.s much as possible, and that respon;..

had access to a target w!-io was the responsibility of a case officer other 
tha.n the handler oi foe agent. This apparent philosophy is of particular 
interest in connection with NOSENI<D, who even though he. was the case 
officer responsible for ABIDIAN a:ud together with KOSOLAPOV and 
GR YAZNOV worked actively against code clerks, did not have an agent 
network which }J.e specifically handled. Mere use of an agent fo::.· report-
