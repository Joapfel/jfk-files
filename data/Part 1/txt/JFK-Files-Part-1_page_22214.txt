"Unescorted Er.try into KGB Buil<ling with V~sitor's Pass: In 
describing his first day at work, uos~,KO sair. th.Jt:. he ._.er.t from 
the Pass Office, where he obtained a visitor's pass, to the 4th 
entry of the B·.:ilding Ho. ~. wher~ his pass was checked by the 
guards, and tten went unescorted to KCBULOV's office or. the third 
floor. Challer.~ed on this point, he said he v~s sure that it was 
possible to enter ._.itnout an ~scort. In fact, it vas absolutely 
impossible to go through any entry of Building ~o. 2 without 
escort if you did not have a proJ)<frly stampe-:l KG~ (HVD) identity 
document (see below). 
"KGB Identity Document: NOSE!IKO was asked to describe the 
KGB identity document that he rec~iv€-d when h~ first entered the 
KGB. 1-!e was then asked if t"!'",ere ·.-as a::ythin,; ':.lnusual in connec­
tion with this doccment at that ti~e. He repticd th~~ he kne~ of 
notr.ing unusual. He was then reminded that ;;,~ ,-_~~r STAL:n 's deat~ 
and again after E:_E.Rii'.k' s arrest it was ne=e.$S<.1'. .. r' to have special 
stamps placed in the 1rlentity doc\!fr.ents to vatidate them. With­
out the right st~~p it ..,as impossibie to ente! the KGB ::,uilding. 
NOSENKO was ignorant of this and was ur.able to recall anything 
about it despite a n~~ctr of hints and leading qu~stio~s. 1\ctu­
ally, during the period of upheavi'll followir,':1 S"!Al.I:~ 's death and 
ac;-.1in after 3ERIYA' s arrest, all KGB identity dor:uments were tem­
porarily wit"!-,drawn in order to hc\·,c special validation s-=.a.'Tlps 
placed in ttem, and it was literally impossible to get in the 
KGB buildings if one did not hav~ the ric;ht st.a.~p. Th1s was the 
subject of numero•.is anecd::ites at the time ~d is hard to believe 
that an officer who set"Ved in th~ KGB at the t.irne could have for­
gotten it completely. 
"Gastror.om: Asked to describe the sign in front of the KGB 
Club, NOSE:;-,1'.'.) ~aid that he did not rerr.ember any sign (there was 
one in 1953) but mentioned that there was a Gastronom (food store) 
next to the !<GB Club. Asked whEtn the Gastron::,m ..,as cpened, he 
_said fjrmly that it was already there wt.en he .start€-d to work 
in the KG9. In fact, this Gastronom ..,as defir,it.ely not there as 
of 1954. It «as opened SO!tletiwe tetween 1955.antl 1957, as ~.oscov 
directories show. The KGB Club is in entry So. l of Building 
Ro. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Square, and :jos~:Ko would have had to pass 
it every day he ~ent to work~ 
•Chief Directorate of ~ili~ia: Asked where the Chief Direc~ 
torate of Militia of the US.SR -.,as located in 1353-54, UOSEln<O 
replied that he did not know, and kne._. only that later it was 
located on Ulitsa Oga~eva. Actually, in 1953-54 it vas located 
next to the main KG& building at Dzerzhinskiy N~. 2. A sta£f 
officer in the counterintelligenc~ directorate would have fre­
quent occasion to deal with tne Chief Directorate of Militia. 
•K.I. (Comnittee of Infonnation): Asked where the Intelli­
gence Directorate of the MVD was located in 1953, NCS~""KO replied 
that it was s~attered bet..,een Dz~r_zhif'lskiy No. 2, the Agricultural 
Exhibition, the K.I. buildir.g, and Kiselniy Pereulok. This is 
a confused and -iricor-rect-ens..,er. -Asked for-clarificatior:-, NCS:;.- -
ENXO said that he "had never visited ":lither the K.I. or t~e First 
Chief Director_ate_ buUdi.:-.g ~t the _Aqricult1,-_ral Exhibition. Thus, 
NOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since 
1951, end that the K.I. building and the building at the Agri­
cultural Exhibition were one and the same place.
