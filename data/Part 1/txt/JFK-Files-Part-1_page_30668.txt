·an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of

guidelines and to provide a 11en!lc of disciµlinc, all aimed toward giving 
better counterintelligence guidance and sup;.h>rt to the operations of the

the direct guidance of the Ch.ief, Counter .Intt•lligence Staff, a number of 
extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and 
.devcloprnentally. The ca>1es rcq1.1ired not only keen operational sense in· 
their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved 
frt>rpu~nt. high-level discussion and nei;oti;1tio:1 with othc1· component~ uf 
CIA as well as with outside agencies and d,•partmcnts. ln fulfilling these. 
responsibilities, Mr. l\HLER h,,s worked without regard to hours or to hi's 
personal convenience •.. lfo has assiduouslr tried to reflect th,: thinking of: 
the Chief of the CI Sta.ff and to relate it tn th<' op~rational problems ht: is.·:

ment to the orientation and development ,)fa D,iputy Chief, Op,·rations, 
another important innovation in the Stafi' s oq:anization.
