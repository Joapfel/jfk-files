Judged by his ~ajor inaccuracies and by the demonstrable in­
completer,css in some of his reporting, tiOS!.:~KO is not an authori­
tative or reliable source of informdtion on cperations against

;._rnericans by the U.S. :..::::;.:.assy Sectic!'l ar.d the ;..-nericar, Tourist 
'iSectic,n. Pro'✓ en uatr:.istwortny in ot:1'=r catcgc:ries of operational 
1leads, there is r.o reascn to accept at face value NOSENKO's state­
'rne.:at. th:u S.MiTW,,..as ~he only !-!osccw :AiJ3ssy e:t.plcyce ,..orkir.1 with 
'the KGB fro:r, 1953 th::-cugh 1963; inueeci, evic.!ence to the contrary 
exists. The sa~c may be true regarding knerica~ courists and 
correspondents i ri Mc.:.co•,1, i.e. , other :-E:crui t.ru,::.t-s not mentioned 
by NOSE~KO could h<'".'e occurred. Fur-:~ermore, w1 t..'l -the question­
able exception of the JOH~S0~ case, t~e KtB lost nothing of great 
value in consequence of NOSCNKO's leads but ga1~ed an advantage 
by occupyi~g the attention and facilities of J\;;lerican security 
authorities. 
It is therefore concluded that SOSENKO has withhold infor­
mation on recruitr.-.ents of Americans in !~-scow,-or·-he-is unable.to 
provide a cooprehensive review cf such activities because he _did 
~Q!_hold_the clai~ea positio~s in the U.S. E:ncassy and Ar.lerican 
Tourist Sections. Either explanation forces stro .. g reservations 
about the bar.a fices of NOSENKO as a genuine scurce, and these 
reservationsarereinforced by the relative cos.ts to the KGB and 
U.S. security authorities of the ~OSESKO leajs. By itself, this 
evaluation of his production on Ar.le~ican cases suggests the possi­
bility that the KGB dispatched NOSE~KO to report to CIA, antl that 
the KGB did so for tee purpose of misleading t.r.e U.S. security 
services.
