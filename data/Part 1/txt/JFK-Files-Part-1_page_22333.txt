t:OSEr:r.o said th,"lt at the tine SvniCHANSl<lY ·.as recruited 
in 1961 that, because SVENCHANSKIY ~as known ~o have had con­
tacts with A~roR~ ir. Hew York, there was some suspicion that 
he mignt be an FBI agent. NOSENJ<O waa unable to be more pre­
cise as to tile basis for these s~spicions ar.d, when asked how 
NOSY.CV had resolved them, was able to say only that NOSKOV 
•felt• that SVESCHANSl<lY was not an Araerican agE:nt. 
NOSESKO knew little about S\"ENCHANSKIY's background fro~ 
the one-volume file kept on him in the Tourist Department: He 
did know t.hat SVEtiCHl'.NSKIY ...-as recruited in 1961 on the promise 
of commercial favors, that he had at one tin:e been detected 
in black.market transactions 1~ the USSR, and that in addition 
to his travel agency, SVESCHANS_KIY ran a Russian-language book­
store in Chicago. FBI and CIA records show that SVENCHANSKIY 
has been er-ployed by a series of registered Soviet Government 
organizations in the United States since the early l930's, 
that he wu released from his position as a United nations rad_io 
officer broadcasting to thu Soviet Union in 1952 when he failed 
to answer questions of tl-,e Senate Interr.al Security Coinr.:ittee 
concerning alleged subv~rsive activity, and that both his travel 
agency ar.d his book store are affiliated with registered Sov-
iet agencies, Inturist and Mezhkni~a. Allegation3 on file of 
SVENCHANS)(lY's Cor.'llllun1.st sympathies and probable Soviet espion­
age activities date back to the Second World War. In August 
1950·, Har:y GO:i..D linked SVENCHANSKlY to the Soviet espionage 
network i1~ the U:iite-4 during the war. The FBI has re-

e. The OSWALD Investigation 
As First Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, NOSENJCO 
said, he was directly ir.volved in the in•,estigation of OSWALD' s 
activities in Minsk ~hich was ordered after the assassination 
of President l<E?lNEDY (?ages 136-144 and Part VI!I.D.5.). It 
is from his role at this time and his reading of the Minsk KGB 
file on OSWAI-0 that NCSE!,KO derived his authority to state that; 
the KGB •washed its hands of OSWALD• after ~is attempted sui­
cide in the USSR, that there was no attempt to recruit either 
OSWALD or his wife, and that KGB interest in OSWALD while he 
lived in Minsk was restricted to p3s&ive observation.

case, in whicn NOSEHKO claims to have been involved in Novem­
ber l,962 while Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.
