L Yntroducti~fl 
The extent to which NOSENKO rr.ade himself available for 
meetings with CIA in Gf::neva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed her,_; 
in cor,nectio:1 with his st.:!tcrnents about tr,1: KGB d•.1ties assigned 
to him for these tries, his visits to the ~GB Le;~l Residen~'l, 
and his personal assoc1ation with other Soviets. Although 
NO.SE::1KO was not precise about ho·,, he spent hj s d2.ys and nigl,ta 
in Geneva, he did ir,d 1cate that he was his own boss, disposed 
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little to 
do. At the first me~~1ng with CIA in 1962 he acc0unted for his 
freedom of movE:ment by saying: "1 can come and go as I p.leacs,., 
at ar,y time. (Ambass;;dor) ZORIN knows w·no I am, almost the 
entirs, delegation knows ·,1ho I am, because I don't need to PLC·· 
tend. Nobody pays any attentio:, to me. They know that I am 
not a Ministry of Fcreign Affai:s man (at the conference 
sessions). I sit, listen, leaf tr.rough some papers. For this 
reasor. I can leave t~e co:-iferer,ce at any time, er I do not come 
at all, and no onr~ will say a word to ,r.e." CIA n,ade no att-:::mpt 
to place NOSENKO under surveillance in 1962 and 1964, and t~ore 
is no evidence from other sources confirming or disproving 
HOSENKO's statements about his activities while away from the 
Cl.1\ safehouse. 
2. Official Duties in Gcnev~ 
In 1962 :ms:~"\/KO said he was the sole KGB officer in the 
91.-man .Soviet delegation to the Disarmillnent Conference and as 
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the 
entire delegation.* To assist hi~ in carrying out these security 
officer fur.ctions, KC.3i::NKO had the services of a m:.mber of 
coorted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega­
tion. In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check­
ing on suspicions attached to one of the delegation members, 
P. F. SHAKHOV;>* but ty the time he establisr.ed contact with CIA, 
he said, this assignment had already been completed. 
In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to 
handle the ~eneral security responsibilities for the Soviet 
delegation, as he had done in 1962. There was no specific 
mission sur:h as the o::e concerning SHAKHOV in 19620 
NOSENKO :,as described his iavestigations of SP.JI.KHOV, but 
he has nevsr indicated either that he conducted security checks 
of other delegation members in 1962 and 1954, or that he re­
ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from 
the KGB cooptees who ~ere supposed to be reporting to him. 
Likewise, NOSENKO has not said that he prepared communications 
for KGB Headquarters regarding his clandestine assignments in 
Genevao 
3o Visits to the KG3 Legal Residency 
Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to 
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for 
more than a day or two, the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV, 
~ould invariably ask ~OSENKO where he had been keeping himselfo 
IoS. MAYOROV and M.S. TSYMBAL also arrived with the delega­
t:io!l _in ::ai:-c_h_ 1962 but had left Geneva by the time NOSEln<O 
contacted CIA. • . ~p ... ~ ..
