and indicated that shortly ve would b0 faced_ 11ith what . 
lie at _least considered to. be two probleJ:Js on· which we ·;. • 
would like the advice of the Department of Justice. 
First.,. lfe would seeon feel CQ!:lpelled to begin hostile· _ 
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth 
with·-respect to his ;dssiou for the KGB nnd we wondered ~ .~ 
what the' legal position would be in circm:istances in .

place. 
4. The qwstion of the basis for detention was again 
raised and rel,ted by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under 
which Noscnko is in this country. He is hon, as an nox.­
clusion an<l parole case" which ;!leans he bus not been
