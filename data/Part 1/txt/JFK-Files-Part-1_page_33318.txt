In October 1971, the Government, carrying o,:.::.t .a long-standing 
pledge, announced that COR FO (the Govl•rnment D,:·.·dopmcnt 
Corporation) had opened ncgoti;.tions to Luy out t:',e P;;?clera through

a camp.'.lign to warn the p·ubiic that tlw free pre~:;. 7,-,,..:ld be cri?pled 
if newsprint distrib•;tion were placed .it the mere:,· Df Government

argued that news pr in! ?ro<luction was essenti.'.l! tc :2-e State_ and must
