(continuation of foou:ote from preceding pag-e) 
code clerk John GARLA.''JD (Part V.E.3.c.i.). CIJ.. record:; 
show that AEIDIAN mailed the first of ~is clar.iestine 
letters or. 1 April 1961 and his second, the one to 
"ARKHA."lGSLSKIY", on 2 July 1961. If AE'!IDIAN 's recollec­
tion is correct (a review of Embassy phcne lis~s show~ that 
KEN:-!SR was in Moscow in June 1961, but was not there in 
Auqust of that year), it appec1rs that E"EOOROVI•::-i: could not 
have been responsible for the ~tka which, !W.S2~KO said, 
led to discovery of che firzt of these letters: also, it 
is possible that sh"=: \.Jas not employed by ABID-.!-.'.I at the time 
the letter to "ARKHr.NGE!,SKIY" was m2.i l<2d. hBI::>:AN 's third 
clandestine letter was mailed on 1 Sept.e~ber 1961, appar­
entlv ofter FEDOROVICH c:arne to work for him. ~ih':!:1 NOS:::t.KO 
was told in January 1965 that FEDJRO\II::-! cou)d not have 
been applying rn,:,c..t:.K?0 1 ,,CJularly to .'•..:'HDI.~: 's clothing at the 
time of tr-.e "l>.Ri<.H;..:1GELSKIY" J.-2t:ter-r::ail :i r.g, he repeated 
that no or,e but FC:DOis.OVIC.1! hdd t:11e possibility o!' t'!oing 
so and that he was sure she, r.'3d. i'lher, his int:errogators 
su;gest'::c: that l:'EDOROVICH rnc1y havE, occasior:ally cleaned 
AEIDIA:~ 's apartment on an i?,forrnal basis before being 
formerly hired as his maid, NOS~NKO said that this was 
possibly '~f"!E: case. (CIA does not know whether Uiis was 
so or not, but ABID!AN gave his inten•iewer the impression 
in Decemter 1964 that he did his own housekeeping until 
hiring FEI:0~CIVICH.)
