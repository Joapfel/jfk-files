Memo on Cover Statua - Arthur G. Vaivada 
La llabana, Cuba • 
1. Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in i:ee!'.'ine ""i th the 
nature of this notional cover plan:.of a temoorarY r.atu~ • Careful 
consideration has been given to a number of idec<S, all or ~~ich were 
rejected.because !)OSSible local conflicts. This. idea is still general 
enough ( and I hope convincing) to le;;ve opporturiit7 for_ changes ar.d/or 
improve:r.ent at Headquarters. The idea, and the terir.inology, ··was 
gleaned from the pages of "Investrrent in Cuba", a July 1956 study 
published by the U.S._ Department of Colllllerce. 
2. As I W1derstE.nd this cover arrangement, the PSI shculd mail me· 
a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information. Tnis 
should 0 hold us" for a couple of u-i0ntr.s, with possibly some queries from 
me occasionally. Then when our oreretional picture require:: ir.•,•estigation 
in some particular field, ?SI can be notified through the Station to 
reouest a survey or poll in that field •. 
J. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and 
allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration 
of this "Agency" and the.c advise PSI as to the legal rec;uir~ent.
