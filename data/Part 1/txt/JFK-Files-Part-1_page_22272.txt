Briefly, the o~tlines of ~0S£NJCO's account of his military 
service are about as fellows: 
He studied for the equivalent of 7th, 8th, 9th and 
part of 10th school years in na'lal schools in Kuibyshev, Baku 
and Leningrad. This would non:ally have nothing to co with 
r.iilitc1ry se.:.-vice, exce?t ':.hat ?IOSE:,KO says he t~ok the ;:nili­
~ary oath at the Baku S~hool in the fall of 1943, at the 
age of 16. (According to av.iilable collateral information, 
the oat:,--fcm.:.1 -:::~t.cy i.nto the military forces--was at no 
time given bc!ore the uge of 17, and never for purposes of 
"show• or •morale• as NOSDiKO claimed it was here.) He 
claios to have deserted this school after taking the oath. 
Also, he shot. himself in the hand only about two months 
after starting anew later the sane year in the naval school 
1.n Leningrad and never fini&heu school properly. 
- He was coa-nissioned in th~ •reserves• in 1947 after 
co~pleti~g his secor.d year at the Institut~ of International 
Relations in Moscow. 110.ever, he cannot remember what 
branch of the service he was in, except t~at it was not the 
navy. He avoi~ed active ~ilitary duty thereafter by volun­
tarily doing military translations at the Institute. While 
at the Institute he contracted ·,enereal disease at least 
twice and this went on his record. 
- .In the spring of 1950, he was assigned to the Navy 
by a mandate c0C1.~ission at the Institute. Ho.ever, he 
failed or.e of his examinations c•~tarxism-!.eninism•) upon 
completicn of the I~stit~te of !~ter~acional Relations later 
in 1950 which d~layed ~is ciploca--a~d hence entry into 
the service--until suc~essful re-examination later that 
year. (At about the same time, he «as considered and turned 
down by the KGB [then ~G3] because of his school record, 
drunkenness, and other bad marks in his record.) 
- He was processed for entry into the naval GRU in 
1950. He said he visited the GRU personr.el office several 
times for interviews and to fill out queetionnaires and 
write his personal history in connection with the required 
security check. He was accepted into naval GRU.despite a 
record which showed desertion, self-inflicted wound in 
* There is no single account of this period of NOSENKO's life 
which can be examined because NOSE~KO has altered the cir-
. cumstances and dates importantly f~orn one telling to the next.
