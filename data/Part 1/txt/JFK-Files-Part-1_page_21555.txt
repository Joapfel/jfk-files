NOSENKO has furnished quite speci£ic information on KGB 
operations during the 1953 - 1955; 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961,. and 1962 -
1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is

until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given 
consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so 
that his claimed assignment d~ring 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently 
substantiated even though his actual job performance undoubtedly 
. deserved a low rating.
