AttacheJ please finJ a summary of a document written in 
1967 to•the General Counsel outlinin~ the ~osenko case anJ 
explaining to him :1ctions-which had been taken with rer.ard to __ _ 
Nosenko. As notcJ in the first para2raph, in October 1967 
Noscnko t&ok up residence i11 the Washington area and was 
advised that, should he wish to leave the ap:1rtmcnt for any 
location whatsoever; he was free to so <lo. In other w9rds, 
-:-·rroiri tliat date, ~OSl'nko was cssenU ally a totally free· man. 
• 1~at he chose not to flee in any way may he indicative of his 
attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to 
Ot'.tober 1967. 
While one can cr.iticizc the fact that Nosenko was kept

society, he was consiJcrc<l·-to be a continuing threat -to-::,·:::-f 
national security. ·•.' 
Recognizing that only legal experts can judge defini­
tively the merits of the case, it seems to the writer that 
the Agency had. no choice but to hold ~;oscnko incommunicado. 
pending resolution of his bona fi<les. lie was admitted to 
the United States unJcr the provfsTons of Section 212 (d) (S) 
of the Immigration and ~ati6nality Act, na~cly as a parolee 
to the Agency. As a parolee, Nosenko de facto from the date 
of his entry to the- United States <lid not-enjoy the full civil 
rights of the norm:11 citi:c-n. lie w~s a war<l of the Agency, in 
a_ sense, and the AGcncy ~as ultimately responsible for his
