. warded. tc ·subject. The man· to whe,m the telegram was. sent was on ·leave and upon

informed as ·he shouici have been. We are t·erribly sorry· _and hope that. Subject would 
-:1ppreciai:.e_. such a _minor matter~ . •• '[n any event, ~e remi ild~d Subject that he_ had· not 
een prOl!lised a letter on ·or about .1 Feb?"tiary but rather told that he ~ould expect 
, t:Jea_r from us then. Subject agreed thfs was .so._ • • 
subject was fa:- less 1n_tP.!"ested in expianation thi>n a dee is! on. Ile rhetorl cally 
.asked whether he was acceptable, a1dlng he was obllged to assume he ..-as not, and 
c~rnment lr.g that al~hough there are "rr.any -two legged peep le in America_ als'o" he 
thought ·he was probably a unique perscm from the point cf view of language ability, 
experience as an ct>erator iri dangerous si~uatlor:is,. etc. we replied th.,:s: One .man 
(the psychologlst):has ·already c,oine all: the way" froril the States Just to see Subject 
and another was cn.;his W'J.Y. • From_ this !oUbject could .'fa! rly cone lude the impor:tance 
"Headg1Jarte;-s" :attaches to -Subject's candidature and that far from _beir.g a dead 
• issue, Subject ':s pr;ospects were good, al though all depended on him. - - • 
.:e then turned to the matter of Subject coming to Paris. - subject explained 
that Paul ( . - ·_ • - ) had··bcen sent by the Paris station 
·to .Ann,ick- aJ1d h:a,d nbt done ver.1 well. He had failed to cor,vince • Annlck that he was 
sent by ~-!Ike (friganza) and apparently although we did net go inr.c, the _details of. 
this, he did net g~-~ the .message straight. In any case Subject irnrned:ately said 
that he could come ~o Paris anytime although 'he would be c-:blige.1 to· travel
