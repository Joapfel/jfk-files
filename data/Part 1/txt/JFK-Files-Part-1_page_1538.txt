Calling the attention of the Government of the United 
States to the inadmissibility of such violations of the 
air space of the Soviet Union by American aircraft, the 
Soviet Government states that all responsibility for possible 
consequences of such violations rests with the Government of 
the United States. 
The Soviet Government expects that steps will be taken 
by the Government of the United States to punish those 
guilty for the said violations and to prevent such viola­
tions in the future.
