Soptelllbe, 17 ~ 1g53 
I have 11. feeling that no one OD oU:r s 1da le prepared to keep A firm band 
on tho Jean Pa!.ll DAvid trip. 
David la himaelf a kin5-aia:o lroe wbaeler. Although ho ia. llllqu.eot!onably 
·one ol the.French ''doers," as oppooed to "talkers. II in tbia field. ho 
Is aloo·1uito a big-mouth and h:1.cllned to over -talk, over-prom!ae and ovor­
lnd.ulge lo cloak~and,-dagger otago eettiog. U ho hasn't got a auard, armed 
to the teoth, with 11. beret and a hall-burned cigarette glued to his underlip, 
lurking outside the dining-room, he can't enjoy hilt meal. : 
Tne plot 1a complicated by the·fact that as Car ao tbe U .. S. le .concerned 
he bas always been strictly covert. This timt- he arrivea as etricUy 
• "overt" so·no·o1u1 on our side will really know how to behave since 
everyone will have to·do a;id be the oxact oppoaito of what they did IU1d 
were durliig Davfd'o laat trip. • 
I would suggut tbllt you show the attached to Abbott Waahburo, Georgo 
Morga:a, Tom Briulcn1 and/or Bill Durkoe, and Jcu:, Phillipa (alao true, aoto) 
and auggut thi\C they work out wbo:11ho11ld consider himselC reaponelble. 
I pers~nally hope Joe Phillipi wiU be willlos to tako it on~ -
IActdentally, tho American who handleG David beat is Helen Kirkpatrick. 
She might conceivably be dratted as chaperone Cor this trip •.
