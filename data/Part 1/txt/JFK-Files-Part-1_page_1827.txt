Liaison with Department of State 
We urge that the DD/P centralize liaison with the Department 
of State and maintain careful records of all discussions bet\veen the· 
Agency and State Department officials. We note that nearly every . 
. area division chief has a weekly meeting with hi:, counterpart in the 
Department but that under.the present system there is no organized

Advice to State on Bla~k .Propagand·a 
" 
,ve recommend that the DD/P develop procedures which will 
insure that other appropriate agencies of the government (Department 
of State,· Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately 
informed of black propaganda activities which otherwise might be 
n,..isunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a :foreign 
power. \Ve have in mind our discussions with the Department which 
heard expres9ed concern that the Department was unaware o! certain 
black propaganda activities relating to Communist China and conse­
quently was led aah·ay.
