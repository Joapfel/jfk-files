IJl'Cl8Di■b eyes, dark skin~ grey-brown wavy hair, rough laborer's hands, 
and two teeth missing from the lower jaw. He smokes both cigars and 
oi1arettes, bis manner was soft and kindly, and AMFAUNA-14 believes 
be :la probably poorly educated. He is married, but AMFAUNA-14 did not 
1t:i' earn wbetber he has children or what his address is. He wears civilia 
'✓ lothea and drives a black 1956 Pontiac with a grey roof. Discussing 
a raan later in the AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by Pedro

about the course he has taken. 
(b) "Carlos" aka "Samuel": AMFAUNA-14 does not know hie. true 
name. Be was born about l942 or perhaps a little earlier. He is -~ 
about 5 18" tall, weighs about 150 pounds, and has a muscular build,·· 
drooping eyelids, .light olive skin, wavy chestnut hair with a widows . 
peak. Be is a nervous pacer, and walks with his head bent forward and 
tilted •lightly to one side. An expression which he frequently used 
waa "O.K." pronounced "OKAH" with the accent on tile first syllable. 
Be told AlfFAUNA-14 that he had been a student in the Commercial School 
ot Havana, that he had worked clandestinely under the Batista regime, 
bad been arreste~ by Col. Esteban VENTURA Novo, had been released due 
to the influence~of his father, and had gotten. out,of the country with 
tbe aid of the Mexican Ambassador to Cuba, coming then to the United 
Stat••• Be drives a 1959 black and white Chevrolet Corvair, wears 
civilian clothe■, and carries a pistol, sometimes a .45 and sometimes 
a .38. AIIPAUNA-14 believes him to be a 1001 Communist. She thinks he 
aay have been somewhat better trained than Francisco ABAD and may have 
been ■oaewhat ■uperior in rank, although this was never clearly e~ident 
Tbere ceemed to be a little professional jealousy between the two •en. 
If &be told one man something which she had been unable to remember· 
tor the other, the second would show signs of jealousy or resentment. 
"Carlo•" •ubaequently told AMPAUNA-14 to phone 61~4319 and ask for 
"8•uel" when &be wanted to reach him. She phoned him at this number 
about ten time• in all~ The phone was always answered by the same 
wnu.n, except foz:1once when a boy answered and then called for his 
aether to come and take the phone. AMFAUNA-14 would aak for "Samuel" 
awl tbe woaan would invariably reply that he was not there. AMWAUNA-
14 would then ask the woman to take a message for him to please call 
"Dolor•••" Tbe woman would always reply "Yes, Comrade." Discussing
