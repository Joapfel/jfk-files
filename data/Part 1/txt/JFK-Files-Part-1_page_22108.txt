. (iii) Microphones in the t,octh Wing. 
According to NOSE!IKO, no microphones or other audio devices· 
were installed in the r.orth wing (a~ distinct from the chancery) 
of the u.s. Embassy prior to its occupancy i.n 1962. (For this 
reason, NOSE?i.CO advised CIA in 1962 to transfer 'its sensitive 
offices gra<l'..lally--to protect NOSENKO' s se-::ur i ty--fron the 
chancery to the north wing at the Embassy.) He has co.nrnented 
several times on this subject, and these remarks are presented 
below. 
11 June 1962: "The Embassy is now located on Chaykovskiy 
Street. When they decided to give the r.orth wing to the Embassy, 
I ...-rote a!"l er:tire report about it. SL(Et:?!N ·,,:as still there 
then [as KGB C'hairmar,. "'. proposed that l equiprr11::nt te in5talled 
in the walls, gave the j'..l.stif 1.cation fer this, etc. ::iP.ELEFIN 
vrote: 'Is it worth it?' At 'the time trere was an improvement 
in mutual rel2tior.s (tetw-=:en the Soviet union ar.d the United· 
States).. SHELE.?IN was a cood lad, but L,-:1red that ... and l:Jfore 
this you found 18 or 20 microphone$ in th~ n~w building in War­
saw.~ SEELEPI!l.wrote: 'Is it worth it? We r.ow have good re­
lations 'With A-nerica. It isn't worth i:. ., ' He didn't want com­
plications. J.nd.th~n ti~e ~as lost. Two or t~ree months passed 
and we again wanted to try it. SHELEPI:{ also ,,;anted to, but it 
was already too late. AEIDIA.~ was going there all the time, the 
Security Officer. It was already· too late because this can be 
done only while the bt•·ild1ng is being built. When the windows 
and doors have been begun it is already too late ... The north 
wing was almost ready. We don't have anything there. So, you 
should rnove the Minister Counsellot' there. Move him to the 
north wi~g from his present offic~ ... Do~•t do it at once. Do 
it slowly. Don't hurry: don't be 1.n a hu:-ry. Have him say that 
he doesn't like this rooc and wan~s to move there ... We hear 
all the military attaches--the Mili:.ary Attache, the Naval 
Attache, and the Air Force Attache--in Moscow. Everything is 
recorded. But again, don't do anything at once. Don't m3ke 
any (sudden) cha~ges. O,~ietly tran3fer one and then another 
there (to the north wing), the attache h1.mself and his assist­
ants ••• You must be very, very clever ar.d very, very foxy ... 
Gradually, gradually move them to the north wing of the build­
ing, to the north wing, 1n which we have absolutely nothing and 
won't have anything." 
31 January 1964: "When the construction of this right 
(north) wing had begun, -nen you started the right wing, the 
new addition to the building, there was a plan to install as 
many (microphones) as possible--thirty, forty--stick them. 
everywhere. It really Wasn't important how.many of ther.i would

was sanething else or whether it was:the.international situa-
. tion, they were afraid that this may be uncovered. But then,
