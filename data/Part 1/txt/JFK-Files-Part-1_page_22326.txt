of 1965 that ho ~ust have reported for duty as Chief of the 
• A~erican Tourist Section on about 3 January 1962.* In tr.is 
job he was responsible for planning anu Sl!?ervising KGB acti­
vities ngainst all tourists of Ar..crican, British, and Canadi~n 
nationalities arriving in the USSR, and his duties also encom­
passed preparations for the co~ing tourist season (Pages 225-
287). 
In July 1962, in conformity with GRILANvV's inten~io~g, 
NOSE~KO was p:o~oted to the positinn of Deputy Chief of the 
entire Tourist Department; it h~d u taulc of organizatio~ or 
close to 100 staff officers, was responsible for handli~~ opera­
tions against all tourists to the Soviet Union, and mair.t~ined 
the facilit:.es used in these operations. A year later N03t::1lKO 
received the title of First D~puty Chief of the Departner.t, a 
•paper" pro~otion as there ~~s no othe~ deputy. During t.~is 
period in the Tourist Depart~ent, in addition to his supervi­
bOry duties :concerning which he has r.ot been questioned in 
detail), NOSE~KO took personal part in aperoaches to several 
tourists, org.inizcd and directed the arrest of an American 
tourist on hu.:osexual charges, and met wich a nur.iber of agents. 
It was his s~~ior supervisory position that invol~ed him in two

During his two years in the Tourist Dep~rtment, NOS~KO 
was availaole to perform his assigned duties o~ly part of the 
time. ·After arriving in the American Tourist Section and after 
the approach to JOHNSON on S January 1~62~ NOSENKO spent sev-
eral weeks •gettin~ the feel" of things by talking to case offi­
cers, reviewicg repGrts of the section's activities during the 
previous t·,.,o years, anJ discussing plans for the up-cooing tour­

ment to Geneva with the Disarmament Delegation. NOSEN!l:O has ---------
1 said that this involved discussions with the Eleventh Depart- . _____ j 
ment of the Second Chief Directorat~, 'responsible for arranging i . 
for securit1 coverage of Soviet delegations going abroad, as i ..J-;. 
well as with the case officers responsible for the investigation --~ 
of suspected American agent SIIAKHOV. ~OSENKO said that he did• 
this on a part-time basis in addition to his regular duties, 
but has 1,0.;ed in another context that these preparations required 
sufficient time to make it impossible for him to take a personal 
part in the recruitl!lent of BIENSTOCK i~ February 1962. On 
15 March 1962, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva, remaining there with 
the delegation until 15 June, when he left Geneva by train to 
return to Moscow to reassume his duties as Chief of Section. 
(He said that he had no deputy chief in this position, and it 
is unclear who performed these functions in his absence.) Thus, 
according to NOSENKO's account, of the six months he was Chief 
* This date was settled upon a:ter he acknowledged that his 
approach to the A~erican tourist W.E. JOHNSON must have 
occurred on S January, as CIA records show.
