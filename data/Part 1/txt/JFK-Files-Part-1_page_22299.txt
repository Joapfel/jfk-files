b. !_ntry into thn Section 
r;oSEl'iKO haR given a detailed account of how ~c came to 
be transferred into the U.S. Embassy Section, but he has 
never given a prcc;ise dato, usually saying ''Januar)· 1960" 
or "at the beginning of 1960." 
As described on Pages 153-154, the shift ~as nade at 
GRIBAXOV's insistence and against NOSt!:XO's own personal 
wishes. GRIBANO\" told SOSE.>.;KO during a personal interview, 
at which J;OSESKO voiced bis obj~ctions, that the transfer 
was part of his (GRIHANOV's) plans and was priaarily to put 
new life into operations against American code clerks, tho 
primary tari;et of the Second Chief Directoratc. GRIBANOV 
did not tell him why he, insteacl <Jf another, had been 
selected for this job, although NOSENKO had the impression 
it was because of his achiev~ments in the Tourist Depart­
ment. (sec Part VII I. n. 5,). NOS~KO 's trani:.fer co:.ild not 
have been a result of his close persoual relationship with 
GRIRANOV or because his father was a friend of GRIDANOV's~ 
SOSEXKO has admitted ttat he ex~ggerated the cl<>f'"cness of 
Ids relationship with the: Chief of the Second Chief Directo­
~ate and ~ost recently (February 1965) said that he had f~w 
p<>rsonal contacts with him outtiit.le of work; XOSE."iKO has also 
said that his father never met GRIBM;ov. 
NOSENKO initially said that he relieved nobody on 
coming into the section. He eventually recalled, however, 
that BAK1IVALOV was hi~ predecessor but left the section 
befor~ he (NOSENKO) arrh·ed. NOSE~1(Q's confusion on this 
point, his description of how he assumed custody of certain 
filP-s from DAKIIVJ\I.UV although the httcr had transferred to 
another department, and the opportunities sosr:~r:o had to 
name BAKHVALOV as his predeces::;or before he eventually did 
so are described on Pages 154-156. 
c. Functions as Deputy Chief 
In NOSE~'KO's view the transfer to become Deputy Chief 
of the section from thc same positl.on in another section 
was definitely an important promotion: He now became 
second-in-charge of the most important operational section \ 
of the entire Second Chief Directorate. As KOVSHtil(•s \ 
deputy, NOSZNKO had the right and obligation to be aware of 
all activities in order to ex~rcise his g~ncral supervisory I 
fun~tions and so as to be prepared to become the Acting 
Chief of the section when necessary. 
·NOSE~'KO said that consequently nothing was hidden from 
him for the two years 1960 and 1961. He claimed to have 
had complete knowledge of the U.S. Embassy S~ction~ activi­
ties durin~ the relatively recent years of 1960 ar.d 1961 
and to know of all significaut operational successes achieved 
in the years before and after this period. He has also-said ha 
has told CIA all he knows of these activities. It was on this 
basis that he lilas able to say in 1965: "Tell !.!r. !.!cCone 
that there were no recruitments. I was there."' 
When NOSENKO reported for duty, he and KOVSUl'K agreed 
on a division of supervisory duties within the section. 
KOVSHUK was, in addition .to his over-all responsibility for
