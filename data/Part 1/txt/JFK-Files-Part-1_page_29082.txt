SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS 
1be one criticism of this Officer•s·work that I and others 
have made in the past still stands. She tries to do.everything 
and somethings in this business just don't ~eserve the attention she gives them. 
I have no personal knowledge of her supervisor abilities, 
but believe she is a natural leader.
