• Question: When did you first have· any personal conversation with 
hi111? 
NOSENKO: I do_n't r~member. He gathered groups of people.-
Maybe I was with him with.KOZLOV and others in Tourist 
Departme:1t (i.e., between 1955 and 1960]. 
Qcestion: When did you develop a personal relation3hip with him? 
NOSENKO: It is difficult to sa~• how it got- star_ted, I was· 
still working in ti",e Seventh Department,_ It was in 
1958, or maybe 1957. i<OZ!..OV suddt:i,1ly called me and 
said I should inur.ediatcly report to GRIBAfiOV. I did, 
and GRIBA:'-:OV said.J should quickly be'. re.:idy to go to 
a receptio:1 with him at the Indian E:nbassy, wi.th him 
and Vera !Ivanovna) A.'IDRJ::YEVA. 
Question: Why you? 
NOSENKO: I don't know ... (pause) Oh, yes, this is the story. 
this is it, this is why he started favoring me. 
Earlier, some time in 1953, I knew sorr.e girls, Nina on 
Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriend, Rina GUDKOVA, 
friends of [Yu.I.] GUK and [V.M.] KOVSl!UK cmc. (V.A.) 
CHURANOV. CHUAANOV was a frier..d of TARABRIN, who was 
a friend of GRIRA!WV. Through TARAERIN he got acquainted 
with these girls, and TARABRIN brought the~ to GRIBANOV's 
dacha :'lne night. The girls were talkative and-told me 
all about it, and said they'd told CHU~_NQV. I told 
CHURANOV who warned me not to mention it. I never did, 
and GRIBANOV learned about this nnd liked it; he re­
marked once: "You are not a gossiper ... " 
Question: ~ow did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any­
one? 
NOSENKO: I don't know, but he did. 
Question: Who wrote your fitness reports? 
NOSENKO: My last one was written by (V.D.) CHELNOKOV. The one 
b_efore that by (V .A.) KLYPIN, in the First Department. 
Before that in the Seventh Department it was written 
by (K.N.) VUBAS, before'him cy [V.A.) KOZLOV, then 
(S.V.) PERFILYEV and before then, in the First Depart­
ment, by (A.M.) GORBATENKO. 
Question: Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you? 
NOSENKO: He may not have actually wr1tten them,. but i:ie signed 
them, -those reports written in connection. w.1.th pro­
motio.ns to higher jobs or for trips abroad,·. or general 
reviews of personnel.
