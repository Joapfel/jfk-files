(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIOUS) 
positions in the KGB. Also, NOSENKO's assertions with 
respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's patronage, the recall 
telegram, and the like, cannot be just a product of his own 
invention, .since these were the subject of comment by other 
sources. 
Because none'of the above explanations is consistent with 
the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we 
are left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by 
the KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the 
anomalies, none of them renders it untenable. 
In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or 
other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that 
the evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was 
dispatched by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires 
that he be regarded as still responsive to KGn control, and 
that his information should be assessed accordingly.
