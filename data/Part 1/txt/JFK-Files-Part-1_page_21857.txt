2. The 1964 TOY 
out measures to check .•• There were many little, 
little thir:gs. YARK maybe tur:>'3d bis head a- . . _ 
certain w11.; when SBAKHOV was talking. [S.!i!~ I:· 
GOLUBE1', formerly ot the Fourteenth [ Countcrin­
te11• ,encc) Department, was in the Soviet Dalo­
gation with SIIAKllOV.• He noticed little details. 
When the officers in the United States decided 
to termi~ate SHAKHOV [as an agent), they wrotu 
a report on hi~ which said he wa~~iking life 
in the U.S.--American products, money. He was 
pictured as not good and, in addition, he was 
11ot wanting to work as c.n agent. 
NOSENKO's 1964 trip to Geneva, co~.mcncing on 19 January, was 
also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis­
armament Delegation. He said he was the only security officer 
for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again 
he was officially listed as an "expert." NOSENKO reported that 
he had three or four agents within the delegation ~nd an equal 
nu~ber of operational contacts. The only person whom he was 
instructed to watch in particular was A.A. TKACIIEV, an inter­
preter, who had travelled to Austria in 1960 a~d 1961 and who, 
___ _tb.c_____KGD had noted, was in thu habit of going about by hi'.:!self. 
Other than this, according to NOSENKO, his responsibilities 
were general in nature. 
NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 interrogations 
how he was sel~ctcd for this TDY. The protocol he s1.gned on 
26 February 1965 states: "GltlBANOV haci absolutely nothing to 
do with my'assignrnent to Geneva in 1964. The fitness report 
on me for this trip was signod by [F.D.] BOBKOV~ For the 1964 
trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of tho 
CPSU wns required for me or for any other members of 'the dele~ 
gation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. It was ay own 
personal wish to maku this trip in 1964 and I had discussed the 
question with [ V.D.] CHELNOKOV e.ven in 1963 and had received 
his agreement. I had also talked about this with [M.V.) 
Klll.ODUS'i'OV",J and [G.) PANCHE:KKO [ both of the Soviet Dele·gations 
Department). After it had been decided that I would go, in 
about the beginning of January 196-1, [N.T. j ZHARIKOV, tt.a Chief 
of the Department, suggested that a case officer might not be 
required with this delegation. KHLOBUSTROV, PAXCHE?iKO, and 
[A.G.) KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO's 
immediate supervisor! supported me for the assignment as a 
·personal favor to me." With regard to GRIDANOV' s knowledge ,~f 
his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSE?\l<O said·that he 
feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TOY he would have said, 
..... -"What, again?" and would uot have permitted him to go. It was 
for this reason that NOSESKO did not discuss the trip with GRI­
BANOV, he said, and he did not believe that GRIBANOV, iD fact, 
knew anything about it. 
---ve sou .. .ce ~OLUBEV was also identified byC a·s a ·,nrst Chief Directo-
rate counterintelligence officer. According· to ff if1he was 
one of several KGB officers forced to leave the Unite tates 
•. in 1964 because he was well known to NOSENKO. There is no re­
cord in CIA files that GOLUBEV has ever been to Switzerland. --
