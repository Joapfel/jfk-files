department has now been organized for the Soviet 
Union and the Peoples' Democracies. And he is 
chief of the department ... He is no longer in 
Moscow, but he was here two and a half or three 
years. ~-1e hope that he will return. Ne are waiting 
for him to come back. Ne know that the company 
wants to send him again, because he knows the Russian 
~r language very well. He is, in fact; an emigre, this 
\PlJRIPPEU. And he also did a good and intelligent job 
of est~blishing relations with Inturist. He had very 
good relationships with ANKUDINOV, the Chairman of 
Inturist, and with other people, both the chiefs and 
the low-level workers ... But, why wasrFRIPPES 06 
recruited? I was interested in knowing-precisely 
by whom, by name, and how approaches were being made 
to our delegations [in t"he United States]. I was 
interested in him from the point of view of counter-
intelligence, not intelligence. Y1hat kinds of • 
approaches are taking place to our people in America

inforrna tion, nothing more. " _ O~ . _ _ :
