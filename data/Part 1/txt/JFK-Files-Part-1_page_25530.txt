the operation against him -- ard in l>oth cases LICALLA did report

a requirement which was quicltly satisfied). Also, LIC:\LLA has been 
asked to report on the arrival and nctivities of TDYcrs such as 
the Al,'KICK security inspectors (he is not, of course; told ~hat 
"security inspectors" arc expected -- he ls told of the expected

8. ' There have boon no chan~es during the reporting- pc.riod o:C 
tho operation of the LILYRIC bnsehousc activity, except that Bruco 
11. FERNAlD took ove1· ·tho handling of the LlLYflIC personnel from 
GEREHDE in early De_cember. F'l:IUlAJD normally meets only I,IE!IPTY-13, 
at pre-arranged sites nnd times (also well away from the i:JlliARSH 
area), onco a week for pick-up of the filr.1s nod reports. He occa­
sionall-y meets LIEJPTY-14 (LIZ:.:PTY-13's wife) when LIE!.IPTY-13 may 
be out 'of town. • The LILYllIC co\'crage is a family enterprise 
)i!!ith .the work cqul\lly divided among LIZ:,fPTi'-13, ~,-26, ar.d~7, 
'.~ho split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted 
,-·coverage Mondays through 1-'ridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and 
0800 to 1500 hours Satu1•days.. (Extra-hour or wce!:-end. coverage may 
be. requested as necessary, and._ tho LILYRIC, pe1·sonilel responded .to· 
the Station request for- such extra- coverage during the A2'11DR.IFF 
and' AF.SEASICK cases.) The family has cont11ii.1cd to p);'.ovide reports 
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the, front 
entrance of the MBHARSH Embassy.· Sucb·coverage included, as in the 
past, daily logs on tho comings and goings of MlllL.\_RSll officials, 
up-to-date recording of mmARSH license .nuobers, special acti_vities 
and visitors (particularly. Americans..., of wbcir.i five were spotted and 
reported on during the reporting period), and SOQe 3,500'.pbotograp~. 
As an example of the value of· LILYRIC·coverage, wi1:hin one w"ecl •. of 
the. change of license plates at the MlliIARSH Embassy (a biannual change 
affecting all of Uexic~, with new numbe~s bearing no relation to 
the old), LILYRIC had. p1·ovided a complete list of the new nul!lb_ers 
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Atlorig • 
other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK'.s 
companions during his last few days in Mexico. Without LILYRI½ . 
identificaticoof the new license plates would have taken_- non1:bs arid· 
.would _have handicapped our.operations. ·LILYRIC bas also provided 
special coverage of the visit of a· Latin American CP representative, 
and is.currently watching for the two AEKICK security technicians, 
201-314616, and the man_· who went to meet· the LNRE..\D agent •. Also, 
41LYRIC has reported on visits of ~!exican. m1dents and the identity 
• of the IDllLi\RSH representatives who deal with the.:i or hand out 
literature. to them. In short, LILYRIC's services,. even though the
