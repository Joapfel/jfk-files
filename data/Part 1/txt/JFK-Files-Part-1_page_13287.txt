l. IT MAY __ BE;.HEfESSARY fOR STATION TO WORK WITH FERNANDEZ IP_ HB , · 
APPOINTED CUEF, DIGEPOL BUT FEEL THAT SENSITIVE ops· SHOULD .CX:>NTINUE BE 
IWCJLED WITH ctWOODS OR UNILATERALLY. IT IS TRUE THAT FERNANDEZ COOPERATED 
Wim STATION DURING HIS PREVIOUS TOUR AND APPEARED NOT BE ANTI-WOFACT BUT 
HIS GmERAL GREEDINESS AND LACK OF SCRUPLES MAKE HIM AN UNSAVORY PARTNER • 
I

*COS, Minit and Erasto Fe:nandez Betancourt, fo~ DC/Digepol met 
to dis~-uss colaboration between Station and Digepol. Not 
clear if Fernandez to be new Chief. ·While F has bad rep not 
clear ~hy. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous 
time no clear indica~ions he enriched himself by accepting 
bribes from left. Station would work slowly until full 
assessment acquired. Asked WAVE to work closely with 
AMCLEVE-15 during Fernendez stay -in Miami to collect info on 
latter.
