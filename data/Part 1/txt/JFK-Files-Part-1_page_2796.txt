Top Secret 
(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION.,.. January 1960-January 1962) 
was generally reduced in order to allow increased coverage 
of British targets in connection with the PENKOVSKIY case. 
As the responsible case officer, NOSENKO directed the 
surveillance of ABIDIAN and evaluated the operational 
possibilities offered by information from surveillance 
reports. 
In line with the emphasis on surveillance, the opera­
tional plan for ABIDIAN written by NOSENKO in October 1960 
called for no direct action but specified that: 
-ABIDIAN's maid Tatyana FEDOROVICH, an "operational 
contact" of- the Embassy Section, was to continue to apply 
metka to ABIDIAN's clothing and "NEPTUNE-80" to his shoes . 
(According to NOSENKO, these are surveillance aids. Metka 
is a "thief powder" applied to clothing pockets, leaving a 
trace on anything with which _it comes into contact. Its 
primary purpose is to-aid in the detection of operational 
letters mailed by suspected foreign intelligence officers 
and agents. NEPTUNE-80, applied to a target 1 s shoes, 
leaves a trace on the ground which the KGB even long after­
wards can follow with a dog.) The only item of information 
received from FEDOROVICH was that ABIDIAN was having an 
affair with an· Embassy female employee. FEDOROVICH was 
• unable to·find personal mail or personal papers in ABIDIAN's 
?tpartment~ • 
-Pietro CECCHI, Embassy employee and KOSOLAPOV's 
agent, was to try to cultivate ABIDIAN and report whatever 
_he learned concerning him. CECCHI never obtained any 
significant information on ABIDIAN' s personal ·1ife. 
"ABIDIAN was developing CECCHI as an informant on American 
personnel at the Embassy", but NOSENKO did not recall any 
specific report CECCHI gave to ABIDIAN that was of interest 
to the _Embassy Section·. 
-Two Embassy chauffeurs were to apply NEPTUNE-80 to 
the floorboards and foot pedals of° ABIDIAN's car if_ 
necessary .
