NOSENKO's sourcing of h1s intocmat1on on electronic opera­
tions against the u. s. Emt-assy in t-loscow ._..as ,mclear and ur,likely. 
His knowledge of the location and prod~ct1on of these microphones, 
as well ns the existence, nature, and purpode of other electronic 
operations directed against the ~~bassy, was not CCX:-.1\ensurate Wlth 
his alleged position in the u.s. Embassy Section a~d his particu­
lar responsibility for audio ~perations. Significar.tly, the 
essential element of the information which ~05~0 did report, 
the exister,cc of the microphone in the M1nistE:r Cour.selor' s 
office, would presumably h,we been cor.sidere<! 1:-'/ the KGB to have 
been comprom~stx r.ond,s earlier, wi~h the defection of GOLl1'­
SYN. Discovery of this microphone, as an outgrovth of action on 
GOLITSYN's inforn,wtion, would have led t::> all the others. Thus 
the Embassy microphones must have b-.?er. ccr.sider':!'d" by the KGB to 
have been compromised l::,cfot·e NOScl\'1<0 first spoi<.e of the:!'1 in 1962. 
/~~eG to this 1s the fact (supported by NCS~KO hL~self) that 
1. 1:,.- cff iciency of the Embassy microphone installation as a whole 
~dJ ~eriously diminishtd by late 1961 or early 1962 due to, first, 
r;onnal deterioration of equip.,-,ent and wiring and, second, the 
installation of secure rocrns and the imole~er.tation of more 
stringent security precautions at t~e Embassy. For these reasons 
and in the abse~ce of any information concerr.ing other forms of 
electronic attack against the u.s. E:.l:>assy in t-'.osc,Y"', it cannot 
be considered that the information provided by 1:ost:::KO in 1962 
and 1964 was harmful to the interE:sts of the KGB nor helpful to 
llm~n aut.horities. NOSENKO's denial of an~ 1n5tallat1onsin 
~ north wi~g, in the light of the later discovery there of 
coaxial cables, the purp;)se of which appears ser.ious and is as 
yet unclarif ied, and in the light of tlO3E?.KO • s specific claim to 
have been responsible fo~ the operational plar.ning for the north 
wing at the time it ._..as being prepdred for AT~rican occupancy, 
would ag.e_ear to be purposeful de~cption.
