audio surveillance appeared to·be technically feasible since I 
had located a possible listening post. However, I admitted 
to him that, even though the Office of Security has the "charter"

equipment to the Office of Security. Mr. Halpern declared that 
the procurement of the necessary equipment should pose no problem 
after he would make a few telephone calls. I then returned to 
my office and made out a list of the equipment which I felt 
would be necessary, and awaited advice from him as to whom to
