ti-adhioi:ial1y liberal and prcs~rous state appears 
-~b stem· ,iri part from the disutisfaction of many 
Socialists a."l.d trade unionis'!:s in the SPD with 
their party's cabinet cooperation with the Christian

of .farmers.a."l.d refugees wit~ t.~e policies of the 
Grand Coalition in Bonn. Co.~=ern over student dis­

not as 0 decisi ve as some ha"·e s-;;.?posed .. Despite -
these gains, the NPD is unlikely to achieve a 
growth comparable to that o: -~~e Nazi Party in the 
early 1930s. 
The outcome in Baden-Wuer.t:temberg confirmed 
the belief o: many Socialists ~~at their coopera­

level is proving to be unprofi~able for the party. 
As a result, they have alrea~· decided at t~e state 
level not to renew cabinet c~~eration with the 
CDU in Baden-Wu~rttemberg, -:..~~s ~aking prospects 
for the Bonn coalition appear less favorable. 
Neve·rtheless, SPD leaders in Eo~n re:r.ain co.-:-..-ni tted

the fe9eral level ~eems unlikely. Over t.~e long

.certain implications national!y, including the 
possibility ~hat Bonn leaders n<iy be encou:-aged· 
to take a more-nationalist li~e.
