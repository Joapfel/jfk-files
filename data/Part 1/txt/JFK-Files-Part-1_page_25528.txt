3. Tho G£HElrDE problc?:1 is unqucstior.:.::.bly a scrim1s one. tie 
are forwarding unticr separate cover copies of several l!cnoranda 
prepared by GE?.l:.1iDB. Ono outlines the history of his marital 
pi-oble;r..s, nnother _describes tbc. current lc~al uituation, ac.d a 
third outlines proposals for a scttler.ient. Til~ro is no hope of 
reconciliation. 'l'hc Station's position with G~mJIDE fron the 
start haa been that be must agree i":~ an anicable &cttle:r.:ont vith 
his \fife in order to insure that sho would not feel forced to take 
steps ~hich would jeopardize the security of Statiou operations. 
-For this reason, the Stntion insisted from tho bceinning that any 
fina~cial sottlemont with his wife would have to take into ac~ount 
the fact that ho was receiving a certain i:;.ala,y fro:a HVi:.OCK, and 
that he could not fairly keep thi~ salary out of tho settlement on 
tho groundo that bis wife could l!:;il;c no lcp;al claim to that 
salary. G£RE."'D~'s wire was inadc a\'laro of our ponitioo· on this, and 
:she vas grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement 
'was ·strictly hlformal. The Station felt that GEHL'HDE could not be 
allowed to uso his HVHOCK salaryas a weapon in the: disDutc lVith his 
·.· ~ifo; because if he did~ she ·.·could hardly be expected t~ refr:ain •• 
\tfro:n expos inr, hia connect ions. Indeed, events hn ve shown that 
')GERE!!DE 1 s, wife is n vindictivo we>:~an, and if lt had not boon clear 
'·-to her that she, ns well ns GEa~mz, \'/OUld lose DlOllCY if he loses 
hls job,· she r:11,tht have blown the \'ihistle lon~ aco. GLRI::HDZ, for 
his pa1•·;;, would have prcicrrccl to keep his P.\1WCK salnry entirely 
out of the picture. t:vcntually, ho;Jever,. be agreed that the Stat:lon 
position was· tail', and he aaid he \70Uld conform. 
4. Tho attached memoranda from GERIJmE arc, in the Station's 
opinion, basically fair accounts. In tho ~ginning, the Station 
was inclined to give GI:.1u-t'DE's wife (LIE!lPTY-19) the benefit of the 
douht,·.:,\largtJly because her description of G~El!DE's character 
·.~cak~csses came as no surpri~o (particularly his tendency to 
:;op_rot:nstJ.nntc, evon when his marringc was at stal.o). Early in the 
}conflict, LIE!JPTY-19 contacted J'UZZUTO and asked point blank vhat 
/'she could tell her lawyer about G.:.3~IDE'.s salary. • She was told 
.. she could not mention the RVROCK port.ion under any circumstances, 
and. that if she told anyone that GI.REHDE bad any connection with 
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GEiUJIDE would. be
