want to be placed in thio position by GRl3A.I\JOV' s o=-der against. the. ·''.,-:. 
wishc!I of FF!l'lS!:YEV, I WE::nt· to GRIBA!;OV and rc!quested that I be 
transfoncd i....acl:t to the ~eventh Dep.:i:rt:r.ent; in ar,y position. I 
had already sp<iken.to CHI:LNCKOV,·"'·ho \:a3 then Chief of t:ie Seventh 
Oepartl'l'ent, about U-,is matter, and .he had sugg~sted th,it I go to 
GP.IBANOV and ask to be returned t.o the Seventh Deoartmer~t. • GRIBANOV 
finally agreed t!lat I should return to tr.e Seventh D•1:>artl!lent as 
Chief of the First Secdon witr, the understanding that I ·would ~ 
appointed Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department '\S soon as this 
position would be vacated by [a.A.) Di\L!)l!J. In July 1962 I was 
appointed Deputy- Chief of the Seventh Depart:nent. ',.'his ,.iecision 
Wi\S Ma'1c by Cl!EL:,OK':,v and GP.IB,\:;eiv in ·accordance . .,,i t:h the intentior, 
stated by GRIBl.?lOV at the end of 1961 that I should be appriinted 
to this position as soon as possible. I had no further perscndl 
di ;cussions with GRieh!WV ab"out this appointrr.ent at this tirn~. In 
1963 CIIJ::LNOKOV [GRIB,\NOV' s Dcpucy, F. D.) BOBKOV, cnrl GRIBA!.O'l 
decided that I should be named first Deputy Chief of the Seventh· 
Department. ~hey ~id not dis=uss this with ma be!or~hand and no 
order was issued about this i\ppcinc;:nent. I was sirr,ply told that 
from that time I would be considered a::; First Dsputy Chi~f of the 
Department. At thi~ ti~•~ I ....-as, in :::1ct, th2 only D~puty Chief of 
the Seventh Department, si:.ce KCflOBOV uid n0t co:r.e tc the ,,:?venth 
Department u:itil about Noverr.be:r or December. 1963. GRIDANOV did 
net tell r.-,e his reasons for appoiating me Ceputy Chief of the 
First Section, First Department in January 1960, for war.ti:ig to 
appoint ffi~ Deputy dii~f of the First Department in late 1961, or 
-for appointing rne Scc-cion Chic f .:,nd later Deputy (.'hief of thl;l 
Seventh Department in 1962. He did• not di.scuss ,,.-itti rr.e my personal 
qualificc1tions for each of thesf! positions. GRIBA!:ov had nothing 
at al!. to do "''ith my assignment to Geneva in 1962. I thir.i< that 
the kharakteristika w1itten a~out.rne for this trip was 3igncd by 
BODKOV, since he was t:1e Deputy Chief of the Secor.d Chief Direc­
torate who supc~viseu the Seventh Uep3rtment. ! did not personally 
discuss this trip with GnIDM!OV before my depart~re from Moscow. 
My candidacy for this assignment was supported oy BANNIKOV, the 
Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the 
work of the Eleventh D~partm~nt which had the investigative file 
on SHAKOV. BA.~NIKOV was concerned with th~ question of who would 
go as case officer on this trip because SH.I\KOV, ~ho was suspe~ted 
-of possibly being a western agent, was to be in the delegation. 
There was no backqround or neighborhood investigation conducted 
on me in connection with my being approved for this trip. My 
assignment was approved by the Eleventh lJepartment, by the Person-
nel Office of the Second-Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel 
Office of the KGB and by the Central Committee of-the CFS!.:. GR.JBANOV 
had absolutely nothing to do withmy assignment to.Geneva in 1964. 
The kharakteristika on me for _this trip was signed by BOBKOV. For 
the l964 trip no decision of approval of the Central Com,"ltittee of 
.the CPSU ~as required for me or for any of the other me:nbers·of 
the delegation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. KHLOBU­
STOV, PAt:CHENKO, and KOVALENKO supported me for the assigrur.en t as 
a personal favor to me. I did not discuss my. 19-6·4 trip to Geneva 
with GRIBANOV prior to my departure .. In fact, I was even afraid 
that GRISA."'OV would find out that. I was going and would object.to 
my making this· second trip." • • •
