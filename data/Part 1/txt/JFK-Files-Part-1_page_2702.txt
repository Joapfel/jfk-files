lJOSENICO' s Information lb 
NOSENKO stated that at the time of\BURG!1's arrival in 
the USSR, his file .contained a copy ot"-hisvisa application 
(anketa), "maybe" an excerpt from a cable sent by the 
Soviet Embassy in the United States saying that a visa had. 
beer:i ~ranted, a routine. note from_ Intu:ist giv~ng _ffi_URGIJ' s {Jb 
anticipated date of arrival and 111.s itinerary insi1le the 
Soviet Union, and the results of file checks of the KGB 
main-Archives and of the First Chief Directorate Archives. 
• NOSENKO himself ran the file checks, which proved to be 
negative; there was no information on record concerning 
~b ~URGI\ and since no other names were mentioned in the 
olmaterial available 'fl)rBuRGI), no other checks were made. 
ob The KGB interest in@_URGj, aerived exclusively frorn the fact 
o~ that he was@_ professor of Slavic studie~ and therefore 
had contact with students who might eventually work for the 
U.S. State Department, American Intelligence, and for other 
target organizations. NOSENKO did not recall who first 
suggested a£ attempt to recruit him. 
Nhen LEURG!] arrived in • the Soviet Union, he came in 
contact with~a number of KGB agents, and their reports were 
placed in an informal file maintained by NOSENKO. NOSENKO 
could not recall how many such agents there may have been, 
their names, or what they might have ~eported concerning 
('.1LE_URGil. l)b@_URGI] had an Inturist interpreter but NOSENKO did 
not Jcnow whether he was a 1,GB agent.) From some source, 
rJ name forgotten by NOSENKO, t~e KGB obt<;1ined indications t~at 
.l,b~URGI\was a homosexual, and it was decided to try to obtain 
grouruls for recruitment by homosexual compromise. NOSENKO 
therefore approached Yu. A. LOPUKHOV, an officer of the 
British Department who handled the homosexual agent Viktor 
BELANOVSKIY, and· ·asked permission to use BELANOVSKIY in 
setting up the compromise.· After permission had been. 
received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV and 
/ NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed hil!l to make 
bt) ~URGi}' s 'acquaintance in a hotel dining ·room. The comprOIJ!.ise 
proceeded according to plan: BELANOVSKIY met@URG~, theU6 
fact of common homosexuality was recognized, and@_URGflwas 66 
invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts 
took place and photographs were made. NOSENI~O was in the 
adjoining room and directed the compro~ise, although he did 
not mee~ (!UR?!J at this time.
