"The first two possibii.itics are easily dismissed. That 
NOSi::NKO i's not ,;ilnply a swindler who .falsc!y claims for personal

the confirmed details of KGB organization, person,nel and operations 
'Yhich he ha,s provided and which could on:ly derive from within the

of a deranged pe·rsonality or unbalanced mind," 
"It is somewhat more ;>lausibie that' NOSENKO is a KGB 
officer who served in at least some of the components for some 
or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-

invented some matters outright, to achic'.\·e greater status with 
American Intelligence. This explan.,,tion, however, fails to 
accommodate the fact that several KGB officers have asserted
