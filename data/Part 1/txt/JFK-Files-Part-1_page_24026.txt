an Amerie&D i;Qbassy inquiry to hi& frienus in lDi.::.i F, and he may even ilave 
mentioned tiie pos~ioility of future "wor;.-." for Oi>YO.i:E, wilicil could have led 
to eventual allegations that he i1ad ueen recruited i>y ~1 . .-~-=tK. T"uis is of 
course speculation. out IDEU A's flcxii>le loyalties a.ad liking for IJDney are 
surely known to hls colleagues, and, if he i1ad already aroused antazonism 
amoug them, tile ~assy visit would serve as a peg for sincere or e.-pedieut 
denunciation.

ODt:iVY Paris, however, IDie:.'i A is lilarried to 1D~i J. OI:L 39251 of SepteCD~ 
1964 reported tnat I.u~i A and ilis wife (W1nameci) llad successfully sued IDr::i B
