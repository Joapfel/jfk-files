because he feels that liodigast•s ne\·er-1'&.iling a;:i_:,earance o:1 the 
precise ::;econd oi: the ceeting iaust ::iean that tr.is is ret7.•lired l.1JBA.?.K 
practice- he has been even ir.ore preci :e. ;l.::>di~st is ,,1~-ra7s read7 
with a su&,'"'8sted :..olution to a :iecurit7 or other prvble:i. which 'Wi.11 be 
faced by Q in carrying out a new a:.signment. 
Cn the :-;ther hnr.d, ~ of Q's satisfaction with Y.'JBA.!1?. might 
derive frm a feeling that i~lJB.~".l': i.;; a "son. touch". Rodi~ast does 
not reco.mend that anything be done to change Q •s opinion (if he reall.7 
does hold it); Rodigast feels th,.t • .. -e are going to pay Ct as much v:iether 
be lllces us or doe::;n1t, and ror the sa::ie ::ione,- ve might as "'ell ::r.a.ke 
l
sure he likes us and will do his u~st ;or the organization rather 
the.n sbply be a tiJ:leserver kee;,ine up appeara.'lces. Ii give!l C<iuse 
i'o,· resentment, his behavior i:i unpredictable, :·or he hasn 1t ::;uch to 
lose- reputation !'or l;yalty, good na=ie, etc. Crie solution would be 
to give him enou;:h so tr.at he would indeed stand to lose i::uch. 
Q ap;:iears to possess a realitsic, sane view of QDY._,r.::., what 
its people are llie, what can a.,d can't be done by it. As already 
indicated, he see::!S to be as lpya.l a !-i3I'.U:~a as other people ·.:ho cto:i•t 
give LJ.Uch thought to the matter, certainly a lot ~ore loyal than his 
background would lead one to expect. In any case, 'tie have no 
recent evidence to contradict his state:nilnt tr.at he considers himsel! 
to be a lor..J. PB?:U!::R; it may just be true. If it isn•t, this von•t 
ma.lte any difference to the project as it is U!'!derstood by Rodigast. 
Q is unlliely to hold sy;-pathetic feel.i.,gs i'or OD.::;.:-,'r, haVlllg 
had what he describP.d as an m1iortunate experi 0,nce or t...,o with tha..i. 
On the other hand, he is sophisticated enou~h to a3sU!lle that his 
re,)Ortin; on ?B?.:2:..lti is o.!." ccric~rn to OD-:.:-,-Y, a.'ld he ::mst 1-=-mr 
that his own suggestion for tdy in PBERil-t;:; to contact target 
institi.tions a."ld old friends there ·,:ould put hi!!! into OD.:.1-NY territory. 
He would probably accept tl--V' necessary collabo! ation without shO'.,'i..-ig 
that he did.'l 1t like it. 
E. Rodigast does not believe Q i3 at present working for c.IlOtter 
service, but it is difficult to know .,;hat would happen if a..'lother 
service approached hi:a. Rodigast a:zsumes he wcruld report this to us, 
I 
just. as he reported in detail the overtures by two persons apparently 
working with the services of the country in which he resides. As part. 
of the present operation involves the possibility that Q -will i..'l fact. 
be a~proached by the opposition, and Q is aware 01 this, one asstl!:les 
be is prepared to remain loyal to r:tJB,\RK; one would al.so as.;;ums be would 
reco,mize the hei,htened value 01 ris services to us should he be 
approached by t.he 'o·,her side and continue to remain loyal to us. 
Q certainly would not agree to work for an opposition service 
for peanuts, but H o.·fered a consideral::le SUD. of money (given that 
he just breaks even in his present arrangeo<c: .. t with us, in the 
thinking o:' Q •s wife), there 13 no telling what he would do. ~.1-.en 
recruited. ~ was told he ~1ould 1;et a raise once he ,;;ot settlec:r-9:n , ce"

money to bee,in til pay debts and buy clothing, a.'ld thus bave more 
concrete eviJ.ence of the cat.erial r.dvanta::es o:: his pre;;em; a:-r-a.ngemcnt.. 
Rodigast would be very sur:irised. i.: Q ag;reed to ~one for an 
opposition service not ~or financial rea~ans but t.hrou:h ideology. 
Q likes to live well. He believi,s in wearin~ good clothes,
