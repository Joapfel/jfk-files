4. Opera!ions with Forci~n Visitors 
NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with 
foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American­
Canadian Section of.the Touri~t Department. Nin~ of these 
operations resulted in recruitments (excluding one who later 
was recruited by another element of the KGB, but including 
another whom NOSENKO classified as a borderline case). Of 
the remaining five operations which did not end with a re­
cruitment, no approach was contemplated by the KGB in one 
case, one target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was 
unable to obtain compromising material for an approach to a 
third, and for political reasons the KGB decided against 
approaching the final two. 
• Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of 
these operations does not always agree with that from other 
sources, these cases can be grouped chronologically as 
follows: 1955 - oue; 1956 - one; 1957 - three; 1958 - two; 
and 1959 - seven. The operations in 1955, 1956 and, with-
one exception, 1959 were homosexual provocations. The re­
cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was based on heterosexual 
compromise. 
These fourteen operations are summarized briefly below 
in the ~pproximate order in which the cases began. For 
each case, NOSENKO's information is followed by a summary of 
the results of CIA investigations. The description of the 
BUR.GI case is more detailed than the others, for reasons in-
dicated in the text.
