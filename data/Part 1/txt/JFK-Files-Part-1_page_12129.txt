reported in Reference B.

Soviet Embassy, a duty for which Subject was.previously responsible. According 
~o LICALLA, KARCHIN has ~lso becn·taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the 
Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties. 
~. In addition, LIENVOY reported -tl¼ftt on 17 AtJgust 1965 that "a new school 
director" had arrived at the Soviet F.mbassy. OBYEDKOVA" had previously been the 
director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced 
indicates that she will. net retu.:-n to Me:{ico. 1'he identity of the n€'w school
