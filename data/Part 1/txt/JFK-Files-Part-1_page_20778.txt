·j."!fsh to make ·special mention of, firs~, the scrupulous~· 
ness with.which·the,Rated Off.icer has consulted me and kept me 
inforined ··about his. activities' and, second, his strict adherence 
to the guidanc~ .i have given him. At no time· have I had any • 
doubts concerning the care ·and fidelity with which he has 
followed my ins truction3. • 
I have developed the highest personal and professional 
regard for the Rated Officer. I have valued greatly his advice 
and his support not only upon matters Within his own special 
field of competence, but also over a considerably broader 
spectrum of U.S. Mission activities. I could not have asked 
for a better Olief of Station than the one whom I have had at 
this post. I very much regret his departure but am comforted 
by the knowl~ge that his successor, as his deputy, has been 
trained by him. 
I earnestly hope that these convnents of mine -- based on 
a very close and continuous working relationship -- will be 
given full consideration and will contribute significantly to 
his career advancement.
