Tourist Dc·partraent 1n 1955, ~USE~KO hi1:isclf hntl helped· to 
d1welop plans for the opcratii.):i and had <1ven c1,rr11.nged :tn 
abortive ,.tt£:::pt to t:.t<:al the l''{tlipmc11t from ::i.n attacho at 
a railroad 1:;tat1on outside ~.!oscow. 'While DE~SON, !,mLE, 
nnd STROUD were oP. n11c of their lripR (afrer ?~OSE~'l~O's t1·:1r.3-
fer) it wns learnutl that they had the equ'irmcnt with them, 
and the KGB d{:cidc<i t() take it from tlwm in Stnlir.grad. 
To carry out th~ ope,·at ion, Lieutenant Ger.era 1 P. \'. n:DOTOV, 
then Chi~f of the KGD Second Chier Directorate, and A,M. 
GOrtBATENKO, Chier of the A!lleric11n Dcpnrttient, flew with 
other personnel from thc- American Department to Stalingrad. 
The hotel roo~s of BENSOK, STrtOUD and MULE were watched 
constnntly fron a visual observation post, and it.was noted 
that thej never ato· in tho hotel restaurant but always in 
their rooms. It was also noted. that_ the apparntus was 
placed under a pillow b~fore they began t0 cat~ ~bile they 
were seated at the table having dinner, therefore, the KGB 
officers suddenly entered the room and seized the equipment. 
In order to partially cover the illegality of this act, it 
was dccicted to mako a show of cxp~lling DENSO~, !-1Ul,E and 
STROUD from the Soviet Union, aud this was done via the 
persona~~ action. 
According to information from other sources, the equip­
ment was seized from DE!'.SON, ~:ULE, and STROUD on 5 llay 1955, 
and the three wure declared perRona uon grata on 7 Mny (a 
month before :;oSENKO ciairicd- to havetransferred to the 
Tourist Department).• Vihcn th'.:? 7 May date was i;iven to 
NOSENY.O during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied 
that tbe operation was handled at a high~r level, that he 
did not directly participate in it, but that he had been 
involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment. • 
It was pointed out to him that he had always said he was in t 
the Tourist Department at the time of this operation, and 
that be had consistently said that he transferred from the • 
American to the Tour,J,st Department in June 1955. NOSENKO 
shrugged, but offered no comment. 
•ThcllfJ!llls~urce Kaarlo R. TUOMI, who served in the United 
States as a GRU Illegal from 1958 to 1963, reported to CIA 
in.1964 that while working as a KGB informant in Kirov in 
the early 1950's, he was targetted against three U.S. Mili­
tary Attaches travelling on a train. TUmn believed that. • 
be might have contributed information leading to the three 
Americans (as he later read in the Soviet press) being de-
~ ' .:. clared persona non grat&. It wOuld appear that TLT()MI 's 
,·~- _ _.:.[._;, , targets were BENSO'N, &OLE, and STROUD.
