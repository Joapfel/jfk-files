'Ilic lollowlng arc the c1:1tlmated <.:01:1ts for Fiscal Year 1961. All figures are 
U.S. doHar1i1 per year ($US 1.00 equals 12. 50 Ml•xlcan pesos), Changes ln 
cc1: I mated costs for p.i rt lcula r ltcmd will be noted. These reflect not only the 
con!L"!!!':"d lnflatlunar\' trend In the Mexican economy, but also the shift In op­
er~tlonal empha1:1ls· from prime coverage of Sovtet/S:itclll,c: acllvilh:tt to &IU)­
port ot Station operations. In thl:; latter c.i1:1c particular line coverage Is of 
shorter duration, cau1:1lng greater expense In Installation and removal of tap 
llncri and cro1e1scs. In the .1gcnt Ha la rr category total expeilsc In contract 
agent salarleti has been reduced somewhat, due primarily to dropping certain 
contract agl'llCB, while cxpcn~cs for field agent category has risen, due to 
the granting during pnsr project year of long overuue sulary raises to all but 
three LIPEAT field agents.
