determined tha~ $33.SOO was advanced to him 
£or travel ana trarisportation of household 
goods to and from Madrid "'ith_one trip to· 
Paris for he.and his facily to r~new their 
Spinish visas~ All of this advance was fully 
account~d foi. Howe~er, in his accounting, 
one i-tem appeared unusual. It was an­
experidiiot~ of 11,600 for a s~nsitive . 
operat_ion which was approved for write-<>££ by Mr. 
Desmond Fi.tz.gera~d on l June 1966 withou,_t 
, -further accounting~.

were est~blished for Mr. Hunt durin~ this period.

•• . 4. At the beginning of his nori--official cover tour, it 
lias necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The 
EUR Di~ision accordingly requested we open an account at the 
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non­
