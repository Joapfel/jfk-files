14-00000 
c.. One courie.:: has made several trips to Mexico to 
receive money from the Soviets. The largest a~ount was 
$200,000 _(u.s.) which he got from LEONOV. in June 1967. The 
smallest ~mount received was $75,000 (U.S.). • 
d. The address and ideutification of the PCC.clandes­
tine printing press. The Colombians raided this installation 
and captured the operator plus false documents and passports, 
forging material, presses, etc. Ile talked and said tuat he had 
received 1 1/2 years of training in the ttSSR in forgery. All 
equipment and false passport blanks were supplied by the Soviets. 
e. All clandestine support and direction to the PCC 
and FARC comes from the Soviet Embnssy jn .Mexico. The regular 
contact is Nikolay s. LEONOV. The chief referent for Communist 
Party matters in Latin America is Boris Aleksandrovich 
KAZANTSEV, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in ~exico City. 
4. This whole affair has been personally very embarrasing 
to Colombian President LLERAS because he had just agreed· to 
diplomatic relations with the USSR. (The new Soviet Ambassador 
to Colombia, Nikolay A. BELOUS, presented his credentials on 
27 May 1968). LLERAS had already beP.n criticized in the press, 
when it was learned after BELOUS had been accepted, that BELOUS 
had been declared Persona Non Grata in Argentina in 1953, for 
direct involvement in fomenting Co~munist inspired strikes. 
(COMMENT: In the otficial curriculum vitae which the Soviet 
Foreign Office sent to Colombia on BELOUS, his ass!g11J11ent in 
Argentina was omitted.) Altbough LLERAS ordered a forceful 
prosecution or this matter, he insisted that the blame be put 
on the Cubans rather than the Soviets in order to avoid personal 
embarrassment. 
s: We have been covering LEONOV thoroughly because he is 
the principal KGB contact in Mexico for Communist Parties in 
other Latin American countries. He has been in Mexico for ten 
(10) years doing very little other than handling Communist 
Party matters. 
6. One of the principal clandestine activities of the 
Soviet Embassy in Mexico is the support, direction and financing 
of Latin American CO'Jl?M,,~ist parties in those Latin American 
countries where th~ Soviets do not have diplomatic represent­
ation. The Soviet<,.have diplomatic relations with only six (6) 
Latin American countries,_ namely, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Uruguay, Argentina and Mexico. Thus, the importance of Mexico 
in this matter.
