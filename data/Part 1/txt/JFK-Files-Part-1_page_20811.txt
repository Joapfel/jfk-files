Dear Dave, 
You have ju$t finished- an· important albeit­
grueling GS·l6 Evaluation Exercise at my direction. 
The recommendations for promction and executive 
developmen-t. you gave me were· a major factor in my 
reccimmendatidns to the Director for the upward 
movement of officers who will be the top management 
cadre of the Directorate in the near future. 
I believe you will find that the last several 
weeks will have sh~rpened four fo~us on one of our 
most important management responsibilities, our 
personnel. Many thanks for a job well done.
