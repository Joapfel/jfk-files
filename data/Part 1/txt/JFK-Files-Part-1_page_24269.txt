20 .July 1972 
Mr. Rod Sweet, Chief CA-3 
Mr. Ken Rosen, Rm 3D18 ATTENTION 
SUBJECT : ORPHONE/1 
1. Attached is the psychological assessment of ORPHONE/1. 
A preliminary verbal read-out was given on 7 July in which it 
was stated that Subject was an emotionally stable individual. 
We still support this statement, but a more in-depth analysis 
revealed there are certain aspects of his personality that are 
susceptible. These are discussed in the report. If any part 
of the report is unclear or requires further discussion, please 
contact us. Meanwhile, we would appreciate receiving follow-
up information on Subject's performance in order to help us refine 
and improve our methods of assessment •
