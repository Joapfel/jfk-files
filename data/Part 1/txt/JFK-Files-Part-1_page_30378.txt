CONCLUSIONS1 
A. It is our opinion that the poseibl.e coraproiuises arising out. of 
this incident Are relatively mlnor in nature and that no 1113.Jor 
co111promises occurred. 
B. That the Soviets "m1oeed" on tho true nature of the fiight. and 
personnel of U1e C-118. 
c. 'n1at tho reasons the crew members wore given an early release 
were as rollows1 
1. Primnrl.ly, the Soviet interrogators !'ailed to use all 
of the lends at their comm.wd, particularly Brannon's 
address book, and tailed to break the crewmen through 
int.erroga+,ion. 
2. The crew did not inadvnrtently disclose through in­
terrogations, the pu.rpooe of their night, its relation 
to tho Agency and that of three of its crew to CIA._ 
). The Soviets app&.rently failed to chdck out tho names 
and other data in Brannon• s address book through their 
tiles prior to release of the crew. 
!i. No incrizniMti.ng .information or material was immediately 
recovered from the bu.med aircraft. 
5. Several of the crew d"stroyed incriminating building 
p.:isses .:ir.d not.ltionll 1n U,ulr wallots while on their 
vay dovn 1n their parachutes, or iJrur.ediately after 
landing 1n the.tr chutes. 
6. There were either no leaks or insu.fficient leaks of 
Licrbu.naling information through· any room conversa­
tions t.t Baku among the crew, which 11111.y have been moni­
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there 
may have beon vere not properly inte11>reted, or intor­
preted soon en.;,ur,h to tip the SoViets that there was 
somethi~ wrusUdl about the flight or t.be crew., .. '
