and spec lal notes and conr:ients. LIE~fl>TY-'9 hag proven himself to 
be a reliable and perceptive reporter of the eventR he obs.erves. 
For th is reason, he has be~n asked to pro,· ide spec lal coverage on 
various indivi,duals of interest, or on particular days when cover­
age is desired. The Station has found the LICALLA reports to be 
consistently useful in determining the presence, activities, and 
rersonal aRsociations of target personnel. In part this is due 
to the location or the I.ICALLA base house,. but it ts also due to 
the interest, effort, and judgement of LIJ::Mr'T\"-9 hir.1sel.i. •,;..,1,,,J,J {--,·:

G. The efficiency of the LIMITED h11Do house has suffered 
a slow decline. LI.EMPTY-ti has been out of action for short 
~ periods because of illness and a physical examination. The 
v physical, however, showed thnt he i~ in BOOd hrnlth and we look

direct cont£\ct wt th LH.::UBIL\C1~-l, leader of the L!I::~lDRACE surveil­
lance team. This arrangement, which began in cid-August 1967, 
has proved to be a very happy one operationally. In addition to 
permittini; more flexible use of LIE:NTRAP for Station requirements 
across the board, it ha~ left GERl:.'NDE more t i:"le to devote to 
other duties (see uelow).
