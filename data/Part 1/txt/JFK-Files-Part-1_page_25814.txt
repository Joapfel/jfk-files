•• That GERElIDE be taken ott Ur!.A.T at once and all 
suspicious audio equipment be reaoved fro:: h.1.s bme or o.t'fieas. 
At present, Lu!.AT is the only illegal activity being engaied 
in by OEREliDE; if he 1s rude merely 1n eonoecti.on with his 
physical surveillance activities he 1s not llkel,r to be hurt 
by the Mexicans. 
t. Conr.ur preparations should be aade to bide oat GERE!iDE 
11' it 1s known he 1s to 'be a.rrested. 
L. Be para. 4 a, GEP.ENDE•s rarticipation 1n LOOTED is o. K. 
I believe no law is being broken. Hovever, LIY.l':'::O 1.8 probably blOVD 
to the Soviets. Hel2-is the more real danger. St.aUon should find out 
who is the registered owner of the phone at Lll!l':.:ll. Prior to leaving 
Mexico I noted to MAHONEY it vas still held in the DUl8 of LD€:TOHE-) 
(now fired and hence a possible threat). 
S. Re para. 4 bi 'lhia is the aanie s1 tuati.on as LDU'IBD but not. 
ao likely bl('IWJl to the Soviets. There 1s no reason vb7 GEP..EtID3 should 
not cont1nue this work. 
6. Re para. 4 c, LICALLA is a very special problem and should 
be taken up at. once with Headquarters elamentll vor~ on LJHE,S;.,/L.1.'"'flET. 
I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out vhen LJX::.Si began to !hape up. 
I condder it a danger to LIM&S.A. Has LICALLA produced anything or 
value? I think. we could vacate-this in 8\lch a wey that the agents in 
LICALIA would have no cause to bo suspicious. (Put an obTious tail on 
the agent, scare hiJD o.t'.t', etc. Th1.8 vould ~ orr th9 Mexican pollc•, 
too, 1n the event the,- are already-Ni.Be to LICAll.A thrQugb LIPSTICK 47. 
Ve could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail am t.he- gane 1s up.) 
RecQ.iilendation: Get rid of LICALLA unless TOJ'Y prQductive. Better 
do this before the Nlllodeling begins. 
7. Re para 4 d, photo truck. LlPSTICX-2 does knair o! the locations 
ot 8C111e ot the basohouaes on LIFF.AT since be vaa a line inspector. 
Recomundationss 
•• Rev comparbnented truck should be set up. Don't use false 
naaea and addresses. It could result 1D great ham. 
b. LIPSTICK-2 be sent oll to same small tmm as •resident 
agent• tor general work and to get hiJR out ot the area.
