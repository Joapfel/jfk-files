According to NOSENKO, the information which was obviously only

The ·previous summary (page 149) also notes that in. 1961 CIA 
acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists 
by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the 
Soviet Union (doc~ent was furnished by GOLITSYN following his de­
fection in December 1961). It was .noted that the summary contained 
references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter­
intelligenc~ identified as American agents and noted that NOSENKO 
claimed he was Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth· 
Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified . 
no .American Intelligence agents during this period of ti.me. What later 
is described as a claim by NOSENKO is neither an accurate reflection 
of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.
