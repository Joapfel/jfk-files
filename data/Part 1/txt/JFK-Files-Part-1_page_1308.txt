Cuban agent as early as July 1963 (which would have been 
when he was screening names for the AMTRUNK Operation), one 
C) ~ . from ~TAMIL-9..!l and the. other from Fernando REY reported by ai . . 
Cf'NSLOUCH-1. As mentioned above, these charges could well 
be true; yet RABEL could have fulfilled his duties for CASTRO 
superficially, for his own purposes, and not necessarily 
have compromised his work with the Agency until he was captured. 
The difficulties he had in exfiltrating his wife could have 
been, partially, punishment by CASTRO for not fulfilling his 
duti·es as an agent; otherwise, had his work in the U.S. been 
valuable, CASTRO could have facilitated the exfiltration of 
RABEL's wife so that RABEL coul~ continue his work as an 
agent.undisturbed.
