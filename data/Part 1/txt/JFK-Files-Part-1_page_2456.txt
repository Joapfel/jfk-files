considered with the detailed information NOSENKO has provided on 
Seventh Department personnel, activities, procedure~, and topics of 
a similar nature is not considered to have any foundation in fact. 
Page 145 of the above swnmary lists eleven operations which 
were Seventh Department cases prio 7 to 1960 and which were included 
in the notes furnished to CIA in 1 964 by NOSENKO. The named operations 
were those against \Bernard FECHTER, Patrick PRESSMAN,. John RUFE~/ 
!,Gerald SEVERN, Sofia SHATTAUER, (fnu) KARLOV,:' Norman FISK~; 
_Ralph MATLAVfi, Marvin KANTOR, \Michael GINSBURG, and Willia~: 
- \TARAS~. The criticism made in regard to the above _eleven cases 
was that NOSENKO could not describe the individual operations other 
than to say that ~e had recorded the name of the target and such details 
as he could acquire when he reviewed the activities of the Seventh Depart­
ment in 1962 following his return from the First Department. 
The 11:~.t~ brought out by NOSENKO are considered in another 
-
section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review 
of all of the notes of NOSENKO currently available indicates that his 
statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes 
are completely plausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished 
by NOSENKO would almost necessitate a separate listing of the approxi­
mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes.
