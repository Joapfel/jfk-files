have b~on known to him upon his return, and he would not 
have for~otten about the trip. (1~ fact, CIA travel records show 
that KOSOLAPOV arrived in Helsinki on 12 Sovc~ber 1960 and ; 
that SOSESKO le ft J.toscow for Anstc-rdam, en ro'!.lte to Cuba, 
on 15 ~ovember.) NOS!::XKO has not changed his posit ion that 
ther~ was no such trip. 
(iv) The MORo:;E Caso 
Like the STORSDERG operation, the MORO~""E ~ase was men­
tioned at NOSE~1{O's first ~eeting with CIA; he cited it as 
an example of a technique whicb SOSENKO introduced for using 
third nationals to obtain access to American code clerl:s who 
were reluctant to establish contacts ~1th Soviet citizens. 
Accordir.g to SOSENKO's most recent version, given in early 
1~65, the KGB learned that YORO:iE and a Marine Guard (BEGGS) 
planned to travel to Warsaw on leave. KOSOLAPOV thereupon 
drew up an operational plan, edited by NOSE~hO and KO\"SHL'l 
and approv~d by GRIDANOV, proposing that a fe~ale agent of 
the Pol if;h UB be introduced to lJCRO~E on the ~'.oi-;cow to War­
saw train for the purpose of obtaining compro;dsir.g materials. 
KOSOLAPOV arranged with Polish liaison officials iu ~oscow 
to ha?e such an agent sent to Moscow, ~ct her ahen she 
ar~ivcd, and briefed her on the operation. She was then 
placed on MORO!.E's train together with a KGB techniciar. 
v.hose task it ~as to obtain tape recordings of the co:11pro­
ml.sc. Events ~ent according to plan: !a!ORO~'"E ··.ct the girl 
and ~as inti~ato with her on the train, but wh9n the tech­
nicia~ reported to NOSENKO the day after the train arrived 
in Warsaw, he said that the tape recordiLgs were of low 
quality and unsuitable for their intended purpose. In a 
further a.ttc:npt to acquire co::11.11·0:~i<-.ing material on J,!QRO~'"E, 
KOSOL,!.N\' later brought the UB agent to Mosco.-, and on this 
occasion photographs were obtained of th~ir intimacies in 
a ~oscow hotel room. Still, the KGB felt, there was not 
r.nough blackmail material to ensure recruitment, and it was 
further planned to have tho America House maid l_\

attempt to lure J.IORO.SE to a room in }toi=;cow -.·here truly 
coapr~aising photographs of intimacies with a Sov;et citi-
zen could be obtained. Possibly because they noticed ~ORO:iE's 
interest in IVASOVA, t.OSE~:KO said, the Americans orde·red 
~ORO~"E out of Moscow before further steps could be taken. 
Although NOSESKO provided a considerable amount of 
detail on MORONE's trip to Warsaw, there were numerous 
vari~tions in bis different accounts. In 1962 he said 
that he had handled the entire operation himself, including 
telephoning Warsaw with the request for the girl; be also 
said that the GB obtained compromising photographs in Warsaw 
and that several months late;· the female agent was brought 
to Moscow expressly for the purpose of introducing MORO~~ to 
a Svviet girlfriend. This, NOSE~KO said, was successful and 
IIORO:SE.was soon having intercourse with a KGB agent. lihile 
still in place in Geneva on 1 February 1964 NOSENKO gave a 
different version: "We,'' he said, arranged for the girl by 
a dispatch pouched to the KGB advisor in Warsaw; moreover,· 
the Poles, who bad obtained compromising photographs in War­
saw, sent the KGB only pictures of the two kissing, keeping 
the best O0£s for themselves, and this is why she bad to be 
brought to Moscow. NOSE~lCO told the FBI l~ter in February 
1964 that compromiHing photogrnp~s had been obtained in War­
saw but oo recruitment was attempted because KHRUSHCHEV bad
