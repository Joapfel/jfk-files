(FOUNDATIONS 6F NOSENKO'S CLAIMS) 
relevant intelligence of any significance. NOSENKO thought 
that "SASHA" served as a department chief in intelligence 
when he was re-assigned to Germany in November 1962 - early 
1963. 
. NOSENKO met SHALYAPIN for the first time in September or 
October 1962 [after NOSENKO's first visit to Geneva and 
initial contact with CIA] through his friend, Yu. I. GUK. 
GUK had known SHALYAPIN when they had served together in 
the First Chief Directorate in Moscow. SHALYAPIN had 
served in the United States, Uruguay, Berlin, and Cuba. In 
1962 he had been assigned to the Latin American .Department 
of the First Chief Directorate, as a case officer. He 
retired from the KGB and through NOSENKO's intervention with 
Second Chief Directorate Seventh Dep~rtment Chief CHELNOKOV, 
SHALYAPIN obtained a position with Inturist. Presumably 
otit of gratitude to NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN felt free to talk, 
and over drinks he expressed his bitterness at his treat­
meni by the -~irst Chief Director~i~ which, without him, 
·woµld not have had the agent "SASHA" in Germany "at that • 
time". [1963]. NOSENKO.heard such det~i-ls as •. he knew- of •
