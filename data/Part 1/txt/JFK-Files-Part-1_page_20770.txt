Mr. Phillips is a notably good su_per-v'isor, esp~cially 
'with- younger officers, for \\hom he is an object of admiration 
and emulation. Mr. Phtllips is a Cast-moving, energetic- per·son 
and he has some of the faults that oCtcn go with this ,·irtue: ht;. is 
impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that ii 
someone dse does not do it for him, his work' is son1etimes 
1narred by inaccuracies and imprecisions. 
Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips 
has had a very trying year personally and it is a proof of his 
strength of .::haracter th.1t he has not only come through it but has 
hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being 
any less than his usual cheerful and charming self. 
His performance has been very Strong. 
I certify that I have seen

I concur in the above rating of Mr. Phillips. Dave Phillips 
is an operator in the solid professional Sf'nse of the word. I have 
great hopes !or the Rio Static:,:1 which he takes over early in 19i0.
