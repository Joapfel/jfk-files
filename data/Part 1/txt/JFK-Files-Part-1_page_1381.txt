B. This ·opei;-ation has .a:very hig~ "fla.;g R8:.tgnti'ff" if any AMTRUNK agents are picked up by. the oppos tion in u a. ot dnly will 
KUBARK stand to suffer, ·but ODACID will be tied. directly in to the 
operation, as· may- also QKFLOWAGE, by whom AMTRUNK/1 ~s employed,

embarrassing and should b fu y recognized as a possibility, if 
not a probabi_li ty, in· the event any of the AMTRUNK team fail into

G. • The secur-ity of ·this operati~n has certain questionable aspects. 
At least six people _were told _about the operation in varying degfees 
prior to the time the team was saf~housed. Two of the a ents 
AMICE/27 and AMICE/14,-did not satisfactori re

tacts. An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between 
AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on 
29 March. This was precipit~ted by AMTRUNK/3 who called. AMICE/14 
the Cuban te_rm for a·. homosex.ual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban. 
This in turn gives rise .to the question whether AMICE/14, with a 
possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made 
such an ·approach. to AMTRUNK/3. • •

D. The commitments made.to AMICE/27 or which AMICE/27 claims were 
·m~de to him are "a matter of concern to the Station. This is an 
area· over which future misunderstanding or aggravation might easily 
develop. ••
