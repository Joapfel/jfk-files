The logs showed that A~Tlnl."iKE'! migh·t have made the first i:,eetin:;, 
but would certainly have bc~n late for It. for the all~~ed second

the suco1~ meet in~). LILYHIC pcrso111wl werc qu.1ck tC' ~pot the 
sub_jl'ct of M,~XICO CITY 3542, 2~ June 19i0, .naking visits to the 
t.llfH,\llSll r:mbass:,•, and r~port~d these visits by phone e\·•Jn before 
tt-.e Station had learned, from Lit.."iVOY, o( thls pe1·son's telepl:one 
call. sc,·e1·al other \·isitors of aj)parvnt Wot.ADY nationslity were 
aJr.o rout1,1cly reported to local LNlRGO, aloug .-ith a rt'Qi:cst for 
lic-e.nse plate r\.'Sl•lution if a WOLADY license plate is spotted. 
Lato in Jun~, LI LYRIC was al.3rterl to 1··eport the possible. visit of 
a person who had made a phone call to 201-087316, offering the 
latte-.· sOflle "interesting informatior.."· LILYRIC spotted aod 
photographed a person •o1ho nay l>,J ider.tica l with the caller, and 
11ttempts are 110w uuder wny to ;.•esolve this. 
6. LIE~IPTY-4 continues to handlti all photo dcvclop'.ng and 
~intin~ (c~cept when certain prints.~~~ c~edc~ QUlckly), anrl in 
spite·, of his leg i1tju-.•y, from which he :l.s ni-,w ·,·eco,·rrcd, he di.rl 
not mJss any dcndlines. The fact that a;.;ni~NDE has been term.•.nated 
JH not expr.ctt"d to nfft>ct his rl'l,,t io1~ship with the St;,t !.on, even 
though hc. ts married to orw of r.:.::1u:~m:~•s sisters. 1''.t:F • .NALD hns

7. The 111.>ovt:'! rec1t:1l·o!' LJLYRIC and LIC.H,L,\·11cti\'lti~s would 
seem to indicate a heavy CI emphasis. Actually, this is not the 
case, While CI is an important by-product, net only for ou~selv~s 
but also in support f'f r;alk-in operations r'Jn by other :>gf'nch?s, 
the dny-ln r.a)•-out bread nnd butter photo and fixed Sl1rveillnnce 
information is of ~rt>at importance to our positive operations. The 
dr,tn base whh·h has bet1~1 huilt 11P .. na maintained by 1.1:-:..,n~TY

with Roferr~nce B, we have the .following cc,mments: 
a. Throu~h a~ oversight, we neglected to repo~t in
