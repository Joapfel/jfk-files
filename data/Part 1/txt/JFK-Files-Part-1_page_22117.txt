In November 1960, after and as a r~~ult of the cancellation 
of his planned trip to the United Sta,:es, NOSD;Ko travelled with 
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. Ee first men­
tioned this trip on 11 Ju~e 1962, during his second meeting with 
"CJ.A. !!is account of his act::.s:ities was given i~ answer to the 
question of whethi:?r. he had ever visited Germany: "I h:ive been 
in Germany. res, y~s. I was in Cuja in '61. Well, as NIKOLAYE~. 
I was thc;re a rr,onth and a half. This was when your Embassy ;.;as 
there and we wanted to prepare* ... Well, I looked it rver to 
see whal kind of people you h,,d \.'ur.ki.ng ther.e. They asked me 
to prepare, so to speak, 2n accounting on tow things were going. 
I arrived tbc,rc a!ld c1~:,cd r:ow they were working against y:,u, just 
on y:.>U. Everyone there is worxinc1 for you. O,:e, two, three, 
five d~ys went by ... I had unlimit~d funds, any a~cunt. I could 
go to any rcs:..:11:i·;,nt, any st.ow. So th,,t's how it was .:ith me. 
The fellows r.::ported: 'Ile [an hrnerican) i.5 there.' r-;y mission 
was to get a gcnerdl picture. Not for one, two, or three days, 
but. for a 1w:1U-, or t\;o, to provide an opinion... I worked pretty 
cleverly on t::em, Ile [the A.11ericanJ would go to a re:stau;:-ant. 
They would say to n:e: 'lie is at such-and-such a restaurant and 
can be observed there.' I would go and observe him ~n the mir­
ror or so:1:eh0..,. I am sitting in the restaurant, drink5.ng, and 
that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc., 
etc. That is, I ~ould begin to feel if he hds the mark of an 
intelligence officer .... BLt this ~as not enough force. I 
would go again and again. I would see th.J.t, yes, he is an in­
telli1cnce officer ... We were asked to share our experiences 
with the:i1 [the CuLnns]. '::.ey didn't know a thing ... They had 
turned all intel.licJe.nce ,._-ork. over to the Communist Party. The 
Communist Party cowplicatcs it." 
In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in 
1962 the subject of his trip to Cuba came up again: NOSENKO re­
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba 
and that his function there was that of security officer. 
Question: When did you travel to Cuba? 
WOSENKO: 1960, November atid December 1960. 
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV? 
NOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO. I will explain 
1l 
how this happened. I was supposed to go to America, 
mometime in Nover.iber, with a group from Gosplan, 
automotive specialists, etc. Data had already been 
aubmitted for coordination and, in particular, my 
name had been given to the American Embassy there 
{Moscow]. But the .l',merican Embassy announced that 
~im delegation could be accepted, but a little 
!~tero And my passport had already ooen issuedo. 
f!lypassport had already been signed authorizing travel 
obroad 0 but it was a service passport, not a diplomaitic 
Ofleo And at thim &ell!2nt a delegation ~as suppo§ed to 
¥he UoSo tiibas$y in Havan~ was officially clo~ed on] Janu~~~
