FILIPE - Filipe has had no previous demolition training but indicated he 
had worked with explosives against Government units, His practical 
work was a little sloppy, not fr<>m lack of care but because he was 
not able to work too well with his hands. The practical work did 
• ,not show any progress from commencement to completion of the 
c·ourse but .his -placements were well made and effective. He seemed 
to understand.all subject matter covered and always answered test 
type ,questions correctly. _Whenever crimping detonators, 'his hands 
were very ·shaky but he did not seem to be nerv_ous at any other time 
during the course. Close supervision was required when he was 
crimping detonatort', He was a cooperative, interested student 
who reacted w.ell to correcdon. He seemed to enjoy the training 
and offered sev.eral new methods of attack based on personal experience. 
·Filipe wa~ rated overall-as proficiP.nt.
