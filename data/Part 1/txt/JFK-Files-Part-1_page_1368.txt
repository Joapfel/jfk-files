j. SZULC persistently sought a continuing contact 
with an Agency representative in Washington shortly after 
he arrived until it was granted in December 1962. The 
first contact was with Albert C. DAVIES (Lt. Col. on 
military detail to CIA - Cuba), and was arranged at the 
behest of Colonel GROGAN, the Assistant to the Director, 
on SZULC's request. 
1 k. In early 1963, at President _!~NNJIDY's urging, 
contact with SZULC was made into a formal relationship and 
was continued until October 1964. The meetings were used 
by SZULC to cross check his information from other sources, 
including various Cuban exiles and the Department of 
State. He became, by virtue of his contacts with the 
exile community-and throughout Washington, one of the most 
knowledgeable people in the area of Cuban affairs, anti­
CASTRO activities, and U.S. Government policy. (see CI 
study on Jorge VOLSKY for more information on th_is period.) 
1. The Agency officer, Alfonso RODRIGUEZ, who main­
tained official contact with SZULC in 1963 and 1964 said 
in July 1964: 
"The special friendship and mutual admiration 
society that has existed between Tad SZULC, Jorge 
VOLSKY, and Manuel RAY and the JURE is not something 
that is transparent or easily explained. This 
all.ianc.e may be something unholy and Machiavellian; 
I· just do not know, but I can find no evidence to 
prove it."
