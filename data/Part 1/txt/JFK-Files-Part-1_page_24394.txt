be bad written to him about the A.N.C. and enclosing 
press cuttings. He has asked SIBEKO fo find out if 
CORONET got those letters, and to warn CORONET that 
MORRISON or someone acting for hil:l has been stealing 
mail from bis (CORONET'S) house. \.'; 
"Elias spec1.1lates that the spy, whotver he is, 
may be working for Black Power or Marxist/Leninists 
or The Telegraph or even M.I.5.,, and wants CORONET 
told of this. 
"Elias has written to IIORRISON telling him to go to 
bell and that he (Elfos) and bis friends will stand 
by SIBEKO. 
"Elias bas said that he held DO brief for CORONET, 
but he notes that CORONET was introduced to the party 
by MORRISON and that in June 1968, MORRISON wrote 
an article in the Zambian Mail describing CORONET as 
a great Afro/American and a great revolutionary. 
"According to Elias, CORONET was then living in 
London and he recalls that there was correspondence 
between CORONET and MORRISON at that time; and that 
CORONET used to supply MORRISON with pocket money. 
SIBEKO wonders when MORRISON began to work for CIA 
and infers that he and his friends should no longer 
be taken in by the 'coloureds.' 
"In view of the delicacy of the source I should 
be grateful if the above information is not passed 
on to CORONET. " 
2. This reply does not of course answer a~l our questions, 
but it does seem to be in accord with what we know of the 
incident from QRPHONE. It seems reasonable to attribute 
Morrison's actions to factional fending with PAC - a crossfire 
in which QRPHONE happened to be caught.
