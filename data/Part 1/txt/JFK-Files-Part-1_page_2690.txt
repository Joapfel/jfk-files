NOSENKO's Soviet Agents 
The Seventh Department Tourist Section, just established 
when NOSENKO was transferred to it in mid-1955., had no agent 
network for operations against Ar.lerican and British tourists. 
Consequently, HOSENIW said, he and the other case officers 
had to "start £rom the beginning". 
As a first step NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow 
officer to.a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist. These 
were not agents, he explained, but "just persons a KGB man 
could approach with questions about somebody or something". 
NOSI:NKO collected information on these and others with the 
aim of formalizing their recruitments. By the end of 1955, 
he estimated, he ha~ a network of about eight agents, all 
of them Inturist interpreters. During the following four 
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied. 
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another, 
some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of cnanging 
all the time, back and forth". In 1956, NOSENIW said·, he 
had about ten agents, in 1957 there were about twelve, in 
1958 about eight, ~nd at the end of 1959 (when he was 
preparing to return to the AI!l.erican Depart~ent) he had 
approximately twelve. The substance of :tlOSF!'~KO' s descrip­
tion of his agents is as follows: 
Larissa SOBOROVA 
An Inturist English-language interpreter, SOBOROVA was 
one of the first agents recruited in·l955 by NOSENKO within 
Inturist. She reported to him on all foreigners with whom 
she worked as an interpreter. She worked with NOSEru~o when 
he served as a guide for British subjects@IRs®and/_!.AN~in 06
