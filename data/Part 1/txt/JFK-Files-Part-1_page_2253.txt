reported to be very cooperative, aware of need for discretion 
and secrecy and proud of his father's relationship with this 
Agency. 
5. The only aspect of this incident, which may be of 
continuing security concern, is that the son recalls that 
in May 1978, while assisting his father in moving some 
personal effects, he remembers seeing.a written plan to 
assassinate Fidel Castro. The son said that it had been 
prepared by his father in the early 1970's when he was 
working in Florida but at a time when he had no Agency 
association. At this time the paper is still missing. 
It may have been recently destroyed by the Subject or, the 
possibility exists, it may have been stolen by someone 
having access to the apartment. According to Subject's 
son, several other items were missing, including a money 
clip containing a $100 bill that his father always kept, 
a Randall knife, a gold pen and pencil set and a microwave 
oven. After notifying the police of the missing personal 
items, Subject's son received the knife from the resident 
manager who claims to have found it in some weeds. Subject's· 
son suspects that· the resident manager may have been responsible 
for. the· theft of the personal items, but he has now resolved 
to drop the·entfre issue. 
6. Foreign.·Resources Division has advised that the 
DCI has been briefed on this case. It is therefore felt 
that no further Office of Security action is required at this 
time other than to monitor the case fo~ 60-90 days to 
determine if any new developments occur.,
