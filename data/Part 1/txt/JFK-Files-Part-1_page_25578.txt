1. During the reportinit period, the project's principal 
agent, Raymond H. ·GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed 
at broadening his uscful'ness to the Station. These til,sks • 
included spotting and. asscss~ent ~s w~ll as the handling of a 
recruited a~ent, ERFAIN-3.~GEJU::SDE did well, and it is believed 
that a new dimension.has been opened for him, and by the sar.ie 
token, the Station bas, in et.feet, ·gained a. new asset. Tho 
LIEMPTY baso houses continued to produce at their usual rate 
and with their usual effective support to Stat.ion REDTOP oper-
a tions. The LIMITED Base House and its opera tor, LIEMPTY-6, __.c-­
were terminated on_ 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon 
partly to save money and partly because advancing age bad measur­
ably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's. 
work. LIEUPTY-26 was rehired, Vhicb pemitted the LILYRIC.Base 
House to give us the samo total hours of coverage as LILYRIC 
and LIMITED had together in tbe past.
