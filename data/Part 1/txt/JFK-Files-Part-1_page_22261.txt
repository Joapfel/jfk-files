that, although this -.1ac not ver.y ~nu!oual. it wos sufficient 
to arouse suspicion in view of the fact th'it this American

for no apparent reason. ".here is no qt.:~sr.ion about the 
fact tr.at ,\311.JIA?I visited tr.e P-.:st.kin Saeet drop site on 
one ccca.:;ion only, and thdt .. as on 30 D:::ce1i\b<:r 1961. The 
ref~rEr.ce to this as a second visit to this address by an 
1-..--r.erican fro~. t:-.e: ~t>assy is a clear ir.dicatic,n that the

The rest of tt,e -- story is c~pletely in_ disagreement 
~1th the facts of the case and does not "arrant discussion here. 
It nust be noted, nonetheless, that this is the only instance 
among all the versions .. hich places the compromise en the A..:er­
ican side of the case, and the only one "hicr. makes a direct 
connection bet .. een the Pushkin Street de~d orop and the KGB 
detection of PENKGVSKIY. (All others attribute t:he compromise 
to sur\'eillance of British Embassy personnel, ar.d NOSENKO claim­
ed that the KGB was ~na.are of J..rnerican Intelligence participa­
tion until the operation was terminated.) It is also in direct 
conflict lllith NOSE!,KO, who had no kno-ledge of ar.y u.s. &nbassy 
official visiting the Pushkin Street site prior to ABIDIAN. In 
this regard, NOSF.:~KO insisted_ that the date of ,\.9IDII\N's visit 
* 1J3IDIN; repo, U:<l tl.at a wor:,an er.t~red the vestibule behind 
him while he was ir. there, and he knelt: do"·n pretending to 
tie his shoelace~ until she proceeded past him and on up the 
stairs. 
**NOSF::-lKO w~s not aware that ~..AHONEY had ~eer. identified to the 
KGB as a CIA officer well before MAEONEY's October 1960 arri­
val in 1:oscow.
