_ • 1 believe it is time for the Station to make an updated 
I
, security review of ~he operation with particular :attention 
to the·k~o•ledgeabiiity of terminated agents and their 
families.· W.e also believe that the Station should now 
address itself to the contingency that the present sites 
• ,r' 
~r persennel will be blown and to investigate alternative 
means of...conCinuing their valuable coverage. 
4. The ADDP iast approved this project in May 1970 
with the condition that te1•mination payments to the 
principal agent and his divorc~d wife be made on a 
monthly basis. This condition has been met. 
5. The budgets requested for the next two ye9rs are 
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional 
bonuse~ for the five paid agents come to about $13,000. 
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to 
SS,600. The small balnnc-e is for operational expenses. 
This proj"ect-nction also requests amendment of the FY 
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of 
termination bonuses'to the principal agent and his di­
vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project. 
The total of the terminati~n bonuses was $12,500. 
6.· This is a vn_luable and productive project which 
helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The 
FI Staff recommends approval.
