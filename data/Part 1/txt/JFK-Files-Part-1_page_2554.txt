To comment specifi~ally on each of the 49] cases would require 
a ve:ry le.igthy pape:r. Cur:rent interviews have developed pertinent 
additional information from NOSENKO in approximately 14-0)of the '.49; 
cases. Of even more significance is the fact that NOSENKO has 
logically sourced his ir...formation in all except perhaps[fol::r_ cases . 
. 
The indicated inability of NOSENKO to completely source all( 49; of 
the cases is not considered significant, pa:::-ticularly since his having 
knowledge of all the cases is quite compatible with his claimed positions • 
in the KGB. In addition, criticism of NOSENKO ior not beL. .. g able to 
source all of his information would be un.easonable since it makes 
no allowance for normal lapses o:f memory or failure to recall some-
thing which was insignificant at the time it occurred. 
' 
Without citing in detail any of the L41) cases, the ways in which 
NOSENKO learned o.f a number of the cases are considered important 
since there is a direct relationship to his claimed positions in the· KGB 
durL. .. g 1960 - January 1964, specifically the position of Deputy Chief, 
First Section, First Department, 1960 - 1961; Chief, First Section, 
Seventh Department, January - July 1962; and as Deputy Chief, Seventh 
Department, July 1962 - January 1964. Ce:rtain examples of the above 
are as follows:
