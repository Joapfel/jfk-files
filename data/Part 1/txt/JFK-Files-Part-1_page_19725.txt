The method' o(leiirni'ng oJ!ers a challenge to all participants regardless of 
level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In 
Grid tea.ma, participants solv~ cfomplcx management problems. Objective solu­
tions are made. :!vailablc. lndiv-idual and team performance is repeatedly • • 
assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evalu<\te cUectivenesa. 
Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might_ change_ 
bis own behavior to incrcaso his problem-solving e!Cectivencas. Thus managers 
are not told the beat way to manage, but they Je:irn by convincing themselves. 
About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights 
gcined are deepened and personaliztd during the intensive SO-hour Seminar.
