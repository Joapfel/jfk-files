O'nlER SECURl1Y AND COVER SlnJATIONS: The past ;allegations of Q/l's 
affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating' his actual recruitment, 
add 3n extra dimension to Q/l's cover situation. We have no 
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof, 
nor have they produced a significant reduction in bis number of· 
contacts. ' • 
ABILl1Y TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
