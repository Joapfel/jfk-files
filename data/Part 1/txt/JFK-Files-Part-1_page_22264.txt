operational plan nor any other of the drafts inclu1ed in 
the OiEREP..:lOV package cited a KG3 cryp~onym for hL~. and 
he is always referred to 1n true narr:e, but th1s is contrary 
to the usage in the other operational plans in the package. 
It is also contrary to KGB p1·act ice, as de!>~-:.-ib-ed by NOS~l­
KO and other sources. 
- The draft cited several technical aids to be used in 
the clandestinu • study of nINl'ERS. • It not only gives th!? KGB 
ccyptonym of !!l.~ill and "Neptun-80;. for two of these techni­
ques, but ir.vnediat~ly thereaft.er explains for what purpose 
each one of them is used. In the other operational plans 
from OiEREPJ.NOV, and in conformance with the established 
KGB practice of inserting cryotonVt!ls for 8Uch devices, 
thP.se preparations are not only ~ot descr1r.ed, but the 
blan~ line typed by the typist has be~n filltd in by hand 
after typing. 
In ad~ition to the above points of fo1-m, this sa~e doc-.unent 
contains statements which run counter to r .tg.id KGB practice and 
which are internally contradictory, es~cially noteworthy in an 
approved draft. One of the objectives ar.nour.ced in the plan is 
to investigate two Sovi~t citizens who were detected in con~act 
with ';.JrnTERs· ln }~:>scow; one of the two is identified parenthetic­
ally as having gone abroad. ni1s docu.~ent, if ganuir.e, would be 
an admission on the part of the case offi=e=, ~nd an approval 
thereof by his supervisor, that a Sovie~ citizen w~o had been 
observed in contact with an identified officer of A~erican Intel­
ligence had been cleared by the KGB for travel abroad before the 
nature of that contac~ had been satisfactorily deter~1nro by the 
KGB. This is in contradiction to all available information con­
cerning KGB travel clearances, which are cie~ied on the basis of 
unauthorized contacts between Soviet citizens ar:d foreiq.1-ers in 
the Soviet Union, not to mention ~esterr. Intelligence officers. 
The draft, .hich cor.sists o: only three paragrap~s. ca~ be sum­
rearized briefly by paragraph to demonstrate the inte=nal contra­
dictions: 
- To establish the nature of iflNTERS' intelligence 
activities in the U~SR, six special tasks will be carried 
out, including round-the-clock surveillance, met~. 
"Neptun-80," hi:iden microphones, o-c.her.audio-devices. 
and investigation of already ide~tified Soviet citizens. 
- Because he already been identified as an ir.telli­
gence operator, and he has a hos-c.1le attitude toward t~e 
USSR, there is no basis for recrui~~ent: therefore the 
actions outlined in the first Faragraph will not be 
carried out because they might alarm him and cause him 
to leave the USSR prematurely. 
- Despite the statement3 of the second paragraph, 
which indicate that recruitment is out of the C{'Jestion 
and which precludes putting into effect the measures 
outlined in the first paragraph. this third paragraph 
sets forth the expectation that just before'.iillTERS'' 
scheduled departure an4 depending on further accwr.uia­
tion of materials on "'1NTC:.Rs: and t~e prevailing pc:'lit­
ical climate a: the time, an opportunity 1.s likely to 
arise which will permit testing the possibility of 
recru1.ting him.
