in the equation that possibly c1>Uld be used to reopen the discussion 
.with a view to ucliorating the situation is the fact that there no~ 
is a different IDEN than when the February 1970 SHOTII explan.ition was 
_Jtffered. Even though JAGUAR bas not specific,llly given that explnna­
.tion,. to JD.ANCE. tho Station, without reference to SMOtll's explana­
