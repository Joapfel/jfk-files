According to NOS Erma in 1965, it wa.3 DM;NIKOV ~ho sup­
ported his cJndidacy for the 1~64 trip to Geneva; as 
far as he knew, NOSEt:Ko said, GRIBANOV was not involved. 
Earlier, howcvRr, NOSENKO st~ted that his 1964 trip had 
been approved by GRIBl\NOV. 
Reportedly GRIBANOV continued an op~rational contact with 
a Western J\mbassaclor in Moscow until as recently as the 
autwnn of 1964. This is a type of activity i~ which 
GRIBANOV was often engag~d while serving as Chief of the 
Second Chief Directorate.

socially and we have often carou5ed together ~c~fficially .••

···- fically whether he haJ ever gone out socially .-ith GRIBANOV 
after working hours. lie replied that he had done so on one 
occasion and that TARABRIN was present at the time. In 
February 1965 NOSENKO was asked the same question and this 
time answered that he had seen GRIBA~OV three times socially, 
most recently in October or,Novernber 1963; TARABRIN, he said,: 
was the only other person present on these three·oc9asions1_ 
all three outings began as drinking,_parties . .in Moscow res­
taurants and the latter two ended at the homes cf girls 
NOSENKO had been asked to procure. Although £$ \I i_ndicated 
that TARABRIN was Chief of the British Department at the 
time he was fired, NOSENKO said he had held this position 
.on:J,.:y. ~til ·1963, when he became Deputy Chief of the newly
