. ,. . ~:~:: ,,_, 
.. a. Th~·:chileati.'PDC:,is the only party with the ·respon-
Sibility of·gove'rnf'.ng; the solid victory of Frei ·in the 1964 
presidential cle.ction ,was followed by an even more impreasive· · 
.-_;;ho1Jir..g in tl;c' Mar.ch 1965. congressional election. However, the 
•• P.'.l::ty's rc'fo#:'.:program is .being implece9ted with lees than 
d~liberate speed, no 'pro~ress has been made in weakening 
Mar:~ist leadcrsh:f:, domination of. the urban labor foi:ce, and 
·:indications are that Frei' s moderation will be increasingly 
ch~llc~.ged by the left wing of. the PDC~ 
b. ·Th'e COPEI Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of 
CU?licat!r~ the victory of the 'Chilean Party. in 1968 and 
.appears to hilv.:: r.arrowcd· the gap between itself (22 percent 
of the clc.ctoratc in 1?63) and the governing Accion Dcmocratica . 
. Pn:."ty (32 percent). COPEI Sccrcetary General Rafael Caldera, 
.• one of ti."-ie f.::w Latin American CD leaders of international 
s thture·~ Js ~--pee ted to b~ the Party '-s s ta.ndard bea::ei: in his 
fourth try for the pre·s:tdency. • 
c. In El Salv.:idor, the PDC garnered 29 p~rccnt of the 
votes in t.'1.a March 1966 legislative election and one of its 
leaders. Jose Napoleon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San 
Salv~dor. In less than six years the PDC has b~come the 
lea.ding opposition party. It l~s li~tle chance of capturing 
the-presi~~ncy iri 1967, but should be a strong.contender by 
1972,. with N<>tre Dame-ed~c~ted Mayor DuartE! tho. lilcely 
c.mdidate~ • 
d. The Peruvi® PDC fonned a co~lition with the Popµlar 
. Actic:i (.\P) Party in 1963; it currently holds two c11binet 
positions~ So.::e would a:rgue that.the Peruvian CD (with only 
4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future.in compe• 
tfticn with the dominan~ AP and the long-established APRA, 
both rcfon:iist p~rties, and thus should not be included in a 
listin~ of si._.,,onificant CD parties. Some weight is added to 
this argu:::cnt by the very recent split off of _a dissident 
faction of the PDC into a .s·cparate party. However, the 
i.l:clusion of the Peruvian p11rty here is base~ primarily on the 
fact that it is the only CD ~roup participating in a coalition 
zovcrr.::cnt and chus contributes an element of. 11 tability to the 
political sce:ie in Peru.
