with [report their contacts in the USSR]. They . 
would probably question@IRS~especially, as one 06 
who used to work in intelligence ... @_IRS~]would 06 
say: 'There was this man from the Ministry of 
Culture, NIKOLAYEV. He was with us all the time, 
even went to Lehingrad with us.' So they would

atten~ion of any@ritish security servic~ (1 
While these tr1ps are corroborated, they

served in the KGB positions he alleges he 
held at the timeo
