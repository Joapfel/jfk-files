for me was the fact that in these countTies it was: • 
\ 
a protest not of individuals or groups, but of the 
entire people who could no longer ·endure a regime 
imposed on them by force. Here it is necessary to 
emphasize that the life of the people in th~se coun­
tries was much better than that of the people in the 
USSR (I s.:iw for myself how people live in Czecho­
slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live 
better than th~ entire people of the Soviet Union). 
"7. The split of the international comrr.unist 
movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed 
my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory 
b~ilt on sand and that it is practiced according to 
the needs of the leadership of the Party at a.given 
stage of life and that in reality full material wel­
fare would never be enjoyed by the people b1.1':. cnly 
by the leadership _and the Party and the goverpment. 
"8. Working in 'the KGB 1· came to understand 
much a~d became conscious of the contradiction between 
the internal and external course of the USSR. Such 
questions as disarmament, the ban on atomic weapons, the 
positic~ of the USSR in the United Nations--all these 
are used only in the interest of propaganda and as 
a screen fur carrying out of the policies needed by 
the co~i:nunist party. (I was myself present at the 
negotiations in Geneva and saw the 'politics' of the 
Soviet delegation.) 
"9. My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the 
true reality. Wit'h my own eyes, I saw how people 
live, he-., much they earn, how they can dress c.nd live 
on their wages, and I paid special attention to the 
life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists, 
engineers, etc. And all the propaganda about the 
enormous armies of unemployed in the countri~s of the 
West, about the 'fieavy exploit~tion', and the 'un­
believably difficult life' fl~w immediately out of 
my head. And that which I met with in my work, the 
uending of Soviet citizens abroad--who gets sent where 
and how, etc.--this finally debunked this propaganda. 
Many of my acquaintances--GUK, CHURAUOV and others-­
think back with gr~at pleasure about life abroad. 
. ._ •10. I entered the KOHSOMOL qompletely without 
·thinking about it. The time came, the right age, and­
I became a Komscmolnik like all the others. It was 
different in regards to the Party: I joined the Party 
in 1956 after the death of STALIN and while I was 
working in the KGB and already at that time there was 
a lack of faith and indecisiveness in me. My father 
continually ins~:;ted on this, saying that without the 
Party I would never move ahead and ·would not.have 
success in life.· But I myself understood and:saw 
that I would not be able to work in the KGB unless I 
was a- member of the P.ar-ty ..... ~- An__d __ .i,.f .I_ ~orked somewhere
