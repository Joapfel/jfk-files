"consejo superior" of LIRISG, of which he said he was a member, 
bad not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed 
by LIRISG-16, who told LIRIXG-4 the san:e day that nothing -

4. There is naturally the possibility that LIRIXG-4's 
visa request was handled by L:RING via classified correspondence 
not seen by LIRISG-16. This channel may have been used because 
LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of 
LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRr~E.~ers. Although 
LIRING-2, LIRl5G-9, and IdeI!.tity appeared sympathetic_toward 
LihIXG-4 and her projected visit to ?BRUMEX (to the point 
where they advised her on core than one occasion not to come 
back to llexico), they, at the same tir:e, sought to clarify 
two things. They first made another atte:npt to throw some 
light on the sources through which LIRIXG-3 had obtained 
information of particular interest to LIRIXG. Secondly they 
brought up the question of "the Gree:..." (ROWTO:S) and tried to 
obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRI5G, as mentioned 
by ootn L!HL\\i-~ and l•,t:iiL.LC)'", .L::, i.v .. i.l::.tai. .... UC.Lue, &"""' .. 
sensitive infornation without at the same time obtaining good 
source description. Specificall:;, how did LIRIXG-3 bear of 
the arrest of the LIRISG member involved in a subversive case 
.•.n 1966, how did be learn of its proposed publication in the 
press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the -
report on Rico G.u.A.l'i' which he passed to, LIRISG, and how could 
he have learned of certain of the activities of ~roises OROZCO 
Leal? To all these questions LIRISG-3 replied by sl.ying that 
be had good sources in ~exico and CeJtral America and that he 
was not about to aivulge tnem to the PBRUYEXers. Both LIRING-2 
and Identity in their conversations ~ith LIRIXG-3 and LIRING-4 
took pains to say that LIRIXG-3's co~duct in his dealings 
with LIRIXG and PBRUMEN was "above reproach .• , They wanted to , 
be sure, however, that he "had not fallen victim to unscrupulous 
elements constantiy surrounding the revulutiou."' Tu (iUute the 
old cliche, LIRISG-3 "got their message." 
5. ROWTOS's introduction to LIRI~G-2 and other LIRING 
members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings 
with LIRING-2 were bound to make th~ latter sooewhat curious 
about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of 
"the revolution .. who seems 1:0 travel extensively and appear.s 
to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts 
of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON' s 
criticiam of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTOS's report dated 
1 January sent as an attachment to reference 8) since be 
finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described 
in ROWTON's l January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made 
the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed, 
and the operator of ROWTOS's answering service answered 
"Mr. ROWTON's (in alias) office." This apparently made 
LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting 
at LIRIXG on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRI~G-4 about her 
relationship with "the Greek." LIRISG-2 'wanted to know where 
and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report qf 
17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIRfNG-2, 
appeared to suspect ROWTOX may have been one of tho sources 
of the information passed LIRING by LIRIXG-3 and warned 
LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek," if not for hcr1sake, at 
least for LIRIXG-J, who "has not alll'ays treaded on firm ground." 
LIRING-4 provided some "information" on h£r Greek acquaintance 
on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in de~a~l on what
