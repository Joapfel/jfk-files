. ·1. According ·to QUTl~l_lD 011 26 February, Miss SUAREZ 
. de Cepeda- ·of\t'lre. :Grql ier- Company. called AMAU'ro-l and spoke 
with bi~ ·se~reti~i to~~xplain that her co~pany is giving 
_their book to a number :of persons in order to obt.ain their 
opinions about the product and AMAUT0-1 was 009 of 'the persons 
• • on Groliei·'s list.· AMAUT0-1 's secretary said that he would • • 
call when he returned. Later, Miss SUAREZ was told that-an 
appointment was niade for 1.0 March.

probably would not merit- further investigatlon, unless we 
can discover someone of hi~her caliber in the Grolier Company 
who could approach AMAUT0-1 as a means of cultivating a mean­
ingful friendship with A.\IAUT0-1.
