6. By summer 1963 deta.ilcd South American immigration data 
had been acquired. Tlfis discfos<:>d,that Subject's langu.i;;e

· • 8. For the. first .. time sirice Subj'ect had arrived in HARVARD's 
custody the way was .. c·lear. for .a final resettlement. Subject's 
Reiseausweis was renewed and he was quitclaimed and advised to 
work and establish bimself in Germany. He was told that nothing 
more could be done for him and that immigration to South America 
at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance. 
9. HARVARD has' done ev_erything to insure Subject a successful 
future ::free from p1:oblems· resulting from his "black" association 
with KUBARK. Therefore, there is good reason to believe that 
KUBARK will not have to become involved with any of Subjt:ct's 
future problems. It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce 
KUBARK with threats to reveal all. With his criminal background 
he is aware that he cari be b~ouiht to the attention of the French 
autho1'·ities. He also believes thatKUBARK's position in the FEDREP 
is such thai we have n6thing to.fear from any action on his•part. 
10. At the time of this writing Subject has a position as 
research and development engineer with a Munich firm. Ile allegedly 
receives .. DM -1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive 
a per~en~age of ~11 profits rcjlized' from the sale of any devices 
he develops. He _expects to move to Munich permanently about the 
end of May or June 1964. 
11. HARVARD has arranged wi.th CSB Data Pr'.:>cessing- .Branch to 
publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's documented name so 
that any attempt to -immigrate to any country will bring him to the 
attention of KUBAFJ( and appropriate action can be taken. 
12. It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise 
HARVARD of any inquiries regarding Subject under his docume;1ted 
name or any of the names listed in Attachment c.
