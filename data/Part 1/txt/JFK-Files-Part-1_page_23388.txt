1. In connection 'Witll a re.:.exai::in~ti"on- of the ~ecurity •• • 
fl!l,ctors or.this Project, a· p·fe.,;arr&nged visit to the home of 
Humanoid was l!Uide by the writer. As previously reported, subject 
has constructed a.secret dark room under the floor of his house, 
and processes the production from the .Humankind Project ii::: t.his 
work room.- . It 1s therefore ne·cessary t.l,iit._ certain co::ipro:iiising. 
material is retained overnir,ht by Humanoid, and, at present, this 
material is kept in a wooden desk ~ith a cheap lock. Although 
Humanoid•s personal security appears good at this time, the possi­
bility of an unexpected house search or a pure case or house- .. 
breakin~ 'With theft as a motive cannot be overlooked, with resultant 
. serious security considerations. • 
• 2. It is therefore requested that heccqU2rters 
consider furnishing a small wall safe with a combination lock for 
installation in the above-mentioned dark ro::>:n~ It would be possible 
to sink the safe .into the concrete wall, and even if complete con­
cealment were not possible, the safety of the material would be 
' greatly entanced. Su.it.able safes are not available locally, but 
; . . it is knovn thnt Rec.ington Rand markets a small strong box with a 
k;_)_ ... : . ., combination lock (price about $20.00) which would be ideal. •.
