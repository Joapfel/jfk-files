oo.i?ocuiu.·da bo built into any Opa Loclm rqi'erral in.011xfor 
that v.to could minimize the posGibi U ties for dupU.cution 
• 9l? ,el?i'ort nnd/or who croooing. Thia concept wn0 rondily 
occoDtOd by t!nj. Wntliuaton. Xt did not, ho\·10ver, atrilte 
n totally roGponoiv€· chord in Lt. Col. Cau000. Thia ,;.,as 
noted but in order to proceed with prelimiuary arrange-
, monto, REl.{'IEiJAN put forth the proposal that flCSI reall.ater 
n, Uot of U:tioht requirements with Opa Locltn and that this 
·list could then be used as a basio upon which refugee 
dcreenings could be conducted. It was Bu(Jgested that Col. 
Kail would be the lo~ical point of reference in Opa Locka 
th1·ough which the referral system could be managed. In 
•this connection it wno pointed out that once Col. Kail 
identified nn individual whom he considered to ~e pri­
marily of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi­
vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. C~uses' covert unit. 
At t;he snme time Col. ~Cail would malte arrangements to pass 
to KUBARK representatives nt Opa Locka and to Station 
Jt.flVAVE n copy of the Opa Loclca debriefing of the individual 
who hnd been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in­
formation ICUBt\lli{ representatives at Opa Locka and at 
Station JUWAVE woulq review the referral. Xf,1 this review 
revealed that the individual was not of operalional 
intereGt to Jl,iWAVE und his primary access was not in fields 
other than OB, no objections ,JOuld be eicpressed relative 
to ACS! retention and full exploitation of the body. Maj. 
Vatlinaton expressed satisfaction with this proposal and 
•- stated that he would be prep<?,1·ed to discuss it further 
once he bad an opportunity to persona!ly review the func~ 
tionina of tho Opa Locl:a center. "
