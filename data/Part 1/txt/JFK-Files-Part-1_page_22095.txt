the spring of 1960 as pa·ct of his preparation for asslg_nment

returned on temporary assignment to Mosoow and again con­
sulted with U.S. E;nba.!'-.sy Section offic€rs in Dteember 1960. 
With re:gard to the, lii.tf:f,r visits, howen,t', GOLl'!'SYN's pass­
port and CIA travel r•?ford::; indicate that he was in ~oscow on 
temporary duty for two .vc·eks in January 1961 and that he is 
therefore a month off in his estirn¼te of when these visits 
took place. On this basis it a~pears that by his statement 
that this incident o~c~rred in 1960 (he has not been more 
specific), he could h~~P bc~n referring to ~ither his visits 
to the American D,.:pa1 tment in the spring of 1960 or his visits 
in January 19610
