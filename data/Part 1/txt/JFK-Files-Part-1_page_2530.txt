KGB purpose in running the operation was to lure American Intelligence 
into meeting BELITSKIY inside the USSR. The previous summary stated 
that NOSENKO did not know when the BELITSKIY operation started 
(Brussels., Belgium., 1958), did not know the nature of the British 
involvement, did not know the operational details and contact arrange­
ments BELITSKIY had with CIA., arid did not know BELITSKIY 1s pattern 
of activity in Moscow or Geneva. 
NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness 
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use 
BELITSKIY against the British.· .. However, he still!has dated the recruit­
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in London and still states that the 
primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in 
contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR. The latter was considered 
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY wa~ recruited in 
Brussels., Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to 
BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY 
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR. 
There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the 
BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis­
crepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY 
case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKOuO<ctl.:2
