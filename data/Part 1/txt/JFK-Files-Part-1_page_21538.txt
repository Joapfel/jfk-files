at this time. On the other hand, it is not reasonable that :;,.;QSENKO 
would lay claim to ~he title of _De?uty Chief oi the First Section, First 
Department, if this were not true when l1e clearly knew of the visits of 
GOLITSYN to the First Section in l 9o0 - 196 l and of his conferences 
with officers closely associated with NOSE:i:';Ko al that time. 
NQS.E:::-;KO has also mentioned a number of o!iicers of the S~D 
or former oi!icers of. the SCD who transferred to the FCD with w'hom 
he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN. 
A number e1f these o!!icers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has 
stated he obtained certa.:.., information or through whom he became awar~ 
of certain activities including Vladislav ~f. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy I. 
GRYAZNOV, Vladimir lvanovich PETROV, Yuriy I. GUK, Vladimir 
A. CHURA:::-;ov, Yevgeniy GRO.:,,1.AKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLA?OV. 
The statement of ~OSEXKO t."-lat altho'l.gh he had heard cf 
GOLITSYN he had never ?ersonally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict. 
with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and 
talked with ~O~E;-.;Ko in the SCD in the late 1950 1s. Toe description 
of GOLITS.Y~ of th is meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halls 
rather than a specific office visit. In light o! this_, th~ absence of any 
reason why :-;oSENKO from his point of view should remember such 
·an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this:
