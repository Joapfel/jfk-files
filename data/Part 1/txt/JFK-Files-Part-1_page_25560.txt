5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as 
a principal agent handlerfc.r a sensitive fixed sur­
veillance project; has carried out_ unilateral recruitment 
-approaches agaJ.nst the Cuban target; has been used in 
special support investigations; and is presently being 
considered for use in sp~cial operations of a sensitive 
nature. A review of the.progress reports i.n_GERENDE's 
operations discloses that the Station has been more than 
satisfied withGERENDE's performance and is anxious to 
take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's: last 
salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted 
in July 1965, and there have been no increases since. 
Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over 
amendment of paragraph 11 ot GERENDE' s contract has ·been 
in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the 
oolfcf -that the- Station wished to ·finalize this amendment 
prior to requesting a salary increase for the ag~nt. It 
is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval 
be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef­
fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended. 
The Field Station will be queried for their approval via 
cable prior to implementation of the contract amendaent.
