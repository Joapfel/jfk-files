C)bThe "militiaman" described what had ha.e_pened to NOSENKO, 
in @:_OHNSO-i:n' s presence. Addressing Gf_OHNSO~/)'"NOSENKO said·: 
"How come? How could you do such a thing? What are we going

that he had reported the approach. NOSENKO did not recall 
what name, if any, he had used during this operation. 
In 1965 NOSENKO dated .the ~ntrapment operation as having 
occurred in summer in either 1962 or 1963. Reminded that his 
·notes paired@.OHNSo@•stbname with the date of 5 January 1962, 
NOSENKO insisted that the date had nothing to do with the .
