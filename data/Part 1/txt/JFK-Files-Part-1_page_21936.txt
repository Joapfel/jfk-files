8 April 1964 :· ,;It was February [19531. KOBu!.CV was in 
February - {n Moscow.·· He was our friend. Ho said:· 'O.K., 
George. I t1l help you if you want, with the KGB.• I remember 
exactly. .Ye-,. It was -in February·. I saw him at the cottage.- .. -
By this time:'::·l had been in Moscow six weeks... KOI.;ULOV was in 
Febru:1ry. He went to see. my father at the Ministry. It was 
the end of the day. It 1,;as late and my father invited him to 
come along to·:the summer home. It h.lppeneci to be a Saturday. 
KOBUL'JV' s wife·· stayed in Germany. He was just here for a short 
TOY.* My father invited him to spend. Saturday night and Sunday 
at the dacha ... On Sunday we ~ere playing billiards and KOBULOV 
asked me what I was doing. I told him 'nothing,' that I was at 
the disposal of the (GRUJ Personnel Department. I said: 'I 
don't want to go back to n~ltiysk, to the Baltic Sea, because I 
don't like the work t!iere. I'm not doing anyt:iing there. I gE:.t 
no satisfaction from the work.' He said: 'Well, yo~ should be 
utilized somehow ... Do you WJnt me to call the KGB Pcrson~el -
them look you over?' I told hi!".1: 'All rig!.t.' Ile called, and 
he must have giver. our numbar to them, ou::- home phone. I ""as 
called subsequently by tl:e Personnel D::.p<trtment of the KGB. In 
February. They told me to come see them at House No. 12. They 
had a pass for me ... So I ~ent. Picked up my pass and we~t-~. 
(NOSENKO next gives a description of his route to the KGB build-
ing, his. receipt of a pass, and his ?isiL to the Central KGa 
.Personnel Office.) They talked to me. This man - I don't know 
who or what he was - ~sked where I ~arked before and all that. 
He said: 'O.K. We'll request your file froM GRU. We will check 
you out and will let you know whether or not we will take you.' 
That's all." NOSE,JKO was .:isked whether he completed any forms 
or questionnaires. "No. Not there. They gave me three copies 
of forms to take home. There were so mar.y questions. About my 
parents, my education, my residencej, addresses. I filled all 
this out ... Finally I completed all three copies and called 
them. I was told that this time· I would not need a pass, .that 
I should j u·st- go to the entrance, and the person [ the personnel 
officer) would .. come down -and take the papers frol!I Me. I went, 
brought the papers, and he took them from me, and also three 
copies of my r.andwritten autobiography ... Then I was called by 
the personnel people once nore. And at that time another 
officertalkt!d to me, and this time I knew who was talking to 
me, because I was told to go to talk to ROZHENKO [first name 
unknown, later identified as a Section Chief in the Personnel 
t;>epartmentJ. This was in March ... Just as soon as STALIN died, 
KOBULOV came back from Germany immediately. He must have been 
summoned by BERIYA or someone. And so, in just a few days -
evidently he did not forget - I got a call. It was Bogdan 
Zakharovich' s assistant. lie told me to go to tt.e central 
entrance, that I dian't need a pass. I remember it as if it 
jµst happened. I went in the uniform of a lieutenant, but with 
a civilian overcoat. This was, maybe, the 10th of March ... I 
sat down (in KOBULOV's office). I thought it would be for five 
minutes. I waited th~re almost two hours. The assistant came 
out a few times and told me that Bogdan Zakharovich.is very, 
very busy, but that he would give me an escort. Some senior 
)" lieutenant came up to me and told me to follow him... We went 
' up to the sj,xth floor of the old building.· I ·remember: it as 
! •· though it just happened. I sat there about five or· seven 
; • __ minutes. Then I was told to go in. I announced myself. He _ 
. t• • said: .'.Yes, I know. Sit down. My nar.ie is SHUBNYAKOV;. Fedor 
U Grigoryevich.' He told me he was the .Deputy Chief of the· 
--.. ~, _ :~';, r·~;./; Second ~ief Direct<;>rate arid that they had talked things o!er 
. • --:· _ :. 1.s! .. _, ... and decided. He said that they wanted to offer me a position
