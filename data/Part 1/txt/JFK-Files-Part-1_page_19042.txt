The Bonn goverhment is gen­
erally reluctant, hoi.-e,·er, _to ban 
the NPD, 'believing that .it ,.-ould 
be imp·rudent -to- drive the ultra­
righ~~l!lt~ ,underground.~.:,,, I( the 
NPD .were·to •sc.ore impressive new. 
succe·sse·s in future electi<Jns, • 
'.however, the restil ting .ccncern 
in the major parties might·prompt 
a reconsideration of this policy; 
Interior Minister ·Lue'cke favors 
banning the party as socn as 
.. • en9ugh evidence can be obtained 
to assur·e successful court action. 
It· is also poss~.ble that new ":•--· 
NPD gains would motivate the 
established parties to ~ake pro~ 
posed ~hanges in the electoral 
. law that would mc.1ke it more dif­
ficult for the NPD to obtain 
Bundestag representat~on. 
Although the NPD program is 
strongly reminiscent of Hitlerian 
National Socialism, the party•s 
electoral supporters in Hesse 
and Bavaria also include persons 
-who have no prior Nazi affiiid­
tions or any particular suscepti­
bility to Nazism per se. It has 
nanaged to attract impulsive 
youngsters, as well as politica! 
malcontents of all ages. Its 
membership includes individuals 
from a broad range of occupations, 
The NPD's spP.cial appeal among 
the lower~middle-class, a~J par­
ticularly among the small business­
men and farmers is reinforced by 
the economic squeeze these groups 
are experiencing as a result of 
c;cvern.rnent economy measures. In 
Hesse and Bavaria, the party did 
especially well in areas noted 
for traditional German nationalism 
.a·nd in areas which are predomi­
nantlr Protestant. Many NPD,ad-
• ~erents are expel-lees from the 
territories lost at. the end of 
World Na; .II. • 
, The makeup of the forma-i 
NPD' ~er.bership is not radically 
different in age or occupatio~ -
group from a.cross section of the 
general public. However, there 
are certain cha~acteristics of 
NPD supporters which set them 
apart from supporters of the 
three major-parties. The NPD 
tends to attract a somewhat larger 
n\Lrnher of older persons as well 
as young adults, and the number 
of lc1-·er middle class members, 
including pensioners, is dis­
proportionately large. Formal 
membership among students, how­
ever, is very small and only 350 
of a total of 244,000 university 
students are on the part}' rolls .. 
There is no evidence ·that 
the NPD receives significant 
finan·cial support from German 
industrialists. It is, however, 
able to operate in the black. 
The sound state of its finances 
is in part a result of its prac­
tice of charging admission to its 
rallies. This serves the double 
function of making the rank and 
file feel that they have a stake 
in the party and of making it 
necessary for its opponents to 
pay for the right to heckle. The 
party also derives considerable 
sums fro~ membership dues, sub­
scriptions to party publications, 
and dc~ations from members and 
sympathizers.
