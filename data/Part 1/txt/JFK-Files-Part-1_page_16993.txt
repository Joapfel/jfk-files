E. Cis ing Rec--po rt on West German Embassy - Du ring June, July and 
August 1958, SCA~'TLL'\G pre pared a detail cd casing rcpo rt on the new 
West German-Embassy. SCANTLING's cngine~ring ability enables him co 
pre pare ace urate dr.iwi ngs and skc tches from a min lm um of data. Also, 
his personality and gre;;ar ious manner permit him to visit the inside of such 
establishments, with :in appropriate cover story, and retain minute details 
whl cl) lat er he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehensive floor 
plan and lmportanc c-..1nstructlon cL-:.ta. 
F. ·LIMERICK Conscructlon - SCANTLL\JG's long association with th is 
target fro·m the ~asing si:andpoint provides the S::m ion with an unpar all e!ed 
sou rec of in formatiL, n about LIMEHICK c onscruc tlon act iv tries, m odific aci ons 
and reasons fo r SJ. n;e. • Ail of the LIMEH IC K cas ing reports on file in Head -
qua rcers are the prn.:!uct of SCANTLL\JG's unusual ability and knowledge.

G. Routine Inn•3tigncions and Surveillances - Although the Station has 
several assets capable of performing investigations :ind surveillances, 
SCANTI..ING is st ill used i.:1 situations requiring the utmost in dtscreclon and 
clandcscinicy. His activities ln th is connection arc too numcrow; to list 
h~rc; suffice it co s~ace that he has contributed m~nerlally to the Stat ion's 
collection of operational infr,rmation through his investigative efforts. 
SCANTLI NG's int en·iew of P.:.ul Fr edcrick Kir schho ff (201-4 36-15) of LCtvtA Y­
FOWL in cerest is a.ri example of SCANTLL\I G's use 011--invescigations ( see 
illvtMA-11749, 17 0-."'Cernbcr 1958). 
H. ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM-15 during 
the latter's ~cember 1958 trip co Mexico City. In th is connection 
SCAN1LI NG is r. sup;x> rt a_sset which is tr uscwo rthy and depcn aable. 
SCANTLING nevl!r displays undue curiosity in operations such as the ES GEM-15 
one; h c accepts the rr.in im um amount_ of information given and per forms his 
dutif;S in a professio~l and sincere manner. 
I. LIEMPTY /3 - SCANTLING handles the administrative mart ers connected 
'i with L/3. Dor is t.t. 1'.1.LLGO provides operation3.l direction to L/ 3. During 
.,,, this reportiQg period, :.1.e Stat ion had hopes of SCANTLING tr.king over the 
; op~ rational super visio:i of L/3's.activities. How ever, after a four-month 
trial period with boLl-i SCANTLL1'.1G and KILLCO 1.:;.:ctinb with Lj 3, it was 
dee ided tha it would be desirable for KlllGO to continue handling L/3. L/ 3's 
unu su:il person ali cy and intellect i11die:---itcJ that he could best be directed by 
a Pi3PRIM E citizen. Th ereforc, SCANTLING no longer ancnds KILLGO's 
ana L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue co handle L/3 's 
administraci ve proble::ns.
