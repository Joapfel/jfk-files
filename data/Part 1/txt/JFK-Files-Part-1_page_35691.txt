and was 11et for a very brief ll'iieetlng the same nlgbt by ONTRICB 
1~ order to arrange a aeetinc for the followinz day. The 
following subjects were discussed at the two 111eetinga on 1 and 
2 Febru~ 1965: 
a. 'l'be prlaary reason for again meeting AltLASH-1 
r 
before his planned return to Cuba was to brief him on tbe 
security tmplicationa involved ia the infiltration and 
possible capture of Modesto Orlando Or~zco Basulto AKA . 
Bebo Orozco, ~~o.infiltrated into Cuba on 21 Dec 1964. oC 
Orozco, accor4ing to his .re, wont to Cuba to rescuoGase 
Vasquez Kerey.)and three others ~~o wer~ hiding in the . 
home of a woun na9t4@.1oria Cnbrera';> 0 iho lived at (fio. 72 oF 
27th Streeto betwei'HQi & O, Apartment 3, Vedado;)Havana. 
Orozco's capture, 11 ho has been captured, presents sn 
indirect threat to tile security of M,iLASH-1 _and a more 
direct threat to the security of AMTRUNK-10 since Orozco 
in Jan 1964 exfiltrated tbroud)the rat line established 
by AYICE-14 (K1guol1to). Upon his return to C\iba, 
AMLASB-1 will check the above witb A.MTRUNK-10; and, if 
Orozco ls under tbe control of the security service, will 
decide and co111111Unicate with Miami wbethor AMI.ASH-I and 
AMTRUN!t-10 believe it necessary to exfilt}"ate ANTRUNK-10. 
AKI.ASH-l was briefed to send a letter t°cfLU!UiNAFU-9 to · 
indicate whether Orozco bas been ,r_re_sted or 'l'hether be is 
still in hiding. If tbe letter to-u,N.BNAFU-9 1111entloas a 
good and pleasant return trtp, this •111 mean that Ortlzco • 
ia not under the control of the soeurity service. I! the 
letter talks abou~ lont, tiring trip, this will indicate 
that Orozco has been arrested. Am.ASH-I waa also reo1Jested 
to send a report on the above and any complications wblch 
have developed or may develop from Orozco'& inflltrntlon.
