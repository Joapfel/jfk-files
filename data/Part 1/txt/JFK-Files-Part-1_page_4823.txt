1. In a meeting with Asshtant Se:cre:ta-rf ·lagers today, 
he told me that he had learned from ForeignM!nhter Facio 
that Bosch, at the time of his arrest in San J~,~ during the 
nssinger visit, had two recently.issued passp~Y't~ from the 
current Chilean government. Facio also said th•t 10 to 12 
persons also had come into Costa Rica with Bo~~h but the • 
.Costa Ricans do not know who they are nor hav@ .th.ey been 
able to locate them. I mentioned to Rogers th.\\t a U.S. Secret Service agent had interviewed Bosch·. 
z. In view of State's interest-in this ~•1e, I suggest· you send a cable to San Jose and try to find @\lt the number 
• of these Chilean passports and to whoa they "'@Y'@ issued~ • 
• Also it might bf1 worthwhile to have a summuy @f ~hat Bosch ,· and the .U.S. Secrf!t Service agent talked .abQ\I\,.· .·. ··
