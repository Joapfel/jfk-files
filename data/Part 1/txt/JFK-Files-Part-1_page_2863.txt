(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
In addition to his general security duties with the 
delegation, NOSENKO said in 1962 that he was given a 
special assignment to check on a senior delegation advisor, 
Pavel Fedorovich SHAKHOV (see below). 
During the 1965 interrogations, NOSENKO provided somewhat 
va~ng accounts of the background of his 1962 trip to Geneva, 
He said that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with his assignment, 
but that [S.G.] BANNIKOV, the Deputy Chief of the Second 
Directorate who supervised the Soviet Delegations Abroad 
Department, made the selection. The.latter department was 
investigating SHAKHOV, and BANNIKOV was concerned with the 
selection of a security officer because SHAKHOV, who was 
suspected of being a Western agent, was to be in the delega­
tion. Because of the seriousness attached to the case, the 
Delegations Department wanted a chief of section as case 
officer, and when a request was made to the Seventh Depart­
ment Chief, CHELNOKOV, the latter agreed to NOSENKO's as­
signment. NOSENKO stated that CHELNOKOV, his superior and 
friend, let him go to Geneva as "a treat", even though he 
had just assumed his duties as Chief of the American-
British Commonwealth Section, he had no deputy,.arid.the trip 
was occurring on -t;he eve of the tourist season. • 
Investigation of _SHAKHOV 
According to NOSENKO, M.G. SITNIKOV, representing the 
Soviet Delegations Department, conducted investigations of 
SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but had been unable to resolve the 
KGB suspicions about him. Because of the failure of these 
early· efforts, the KGB decided to send a "senior guyll to the 
Disarmament talks in 1962, and NOSENKO was chosen "to finish 
things up". Before leaving MOpCOW in March 1962, NOSENKO 
discussed the SHAKHOV case with SITNIKOV and withLYALIN, the 
Soviet Delegations Department case officer in charge of the 
SHAKHOV case. He also read various materials on the case, 
including an investigative plan drawn up py LYALIN~ 
NOSENKO has·said that SHAKHOV was under suspicion in 1962 
because he was working with different delegations at different 
conferences, and there was some evidence that in Geneva ear­
lier he was somehow connected with American diplomat @_avid MAR§,
