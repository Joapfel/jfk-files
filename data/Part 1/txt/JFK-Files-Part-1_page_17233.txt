ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an 
. eyewltness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic lnsplrcd anti-CASTRO 
demU1,Str.1tlons. Not only did SCANTLING obtaln the desired 
Information, and samples of many·of the leaflets used, but he 
prepared his report for the Station ln time for the COS to give 
the ODACID Chief a brleflng at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.

due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

and surn:lllances." SCANTLING has contributed to thli. objective both 
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below: 
a.· SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the 
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a 
Mexican national employed at tht• Cuban Embassy. SCANTLL~G
