12. Central and Motivation: 
' a. Control - All LIEMPl'I agents are local national.a. GERERDE and SCAm.IBO, 
both of vhom spent a great deal of their chil~ood years 1µ PBPRIME,and still 
have relatives living in PBPRlME, are in many respects more pro-PBP.RIME than 
many PBPRIMB citbena. In the:·~t,. bo~ GERE'ffl>E and ICANTLING have evidenced 
_ a h1Sh degree or loyal~y to Matthev S. l:>Iffl:tt.EY, their tormer Station Case Of'r1cer, 
and appear to be devoting t!J&t 881118 loyalty to the present Case Oftlcer. The 
control CNt:r GmERDE· and, SCABTLINO stems_ directly tran their pro-PBPRIMB bell~a 
·-:- • and their personal loyalty ·to their put and preaent Cas@ Officers. The control 
over other LmOi'TY agents is baaed in part on pre-PBPRDIE atti tudea and on the 
financial remuneration anJ. good handling they receivef f'rom GERENDE and 8CAl'fl'LDlQ. 
Reallaticall,y, control over LIEMPl'Y agents is baaed on mutual understandings an4 
conf'idence among individual.a and· should any agent decide to denounce PBPRDm or 
_ KDBARK, as the case may be, there is not much that ~he Station could ao. 
b. Motivation - With the exception of OERENllB and SCA?rrLilfG, vhoae primary 
motivations are_ ideological, finmicl:al eaapenaation seems .to be the basic 
motivation.al factor surround1ZJ6 LllMFTY agents. .
