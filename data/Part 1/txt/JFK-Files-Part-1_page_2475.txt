First Section, First Department. NOSENKO, as the responsible case 
office:.:- for ABIDIAN, was expected to 1·eview these reports and give 
any appropriate guidance or direction to the Seventh Directorate, but 
under the KGB organization he would not pa:::ticipate in the s-u.rveillance 
. . 
·activities of the Seventh Directorate.- . Nos:ENKO stated that had sur-
veillance or agent information disclosed any personal weaknesses of. 
ABIDIAN, the KGB would have attempted to exploit them. No personal 
weaknesses were disclosed, according to NOSENKO, and the pattern 
of coverage to see if ABIDIAN ·would lead the KGB to "another POPOV 11 
remained unchanged. 
Pages 210 - 212 of the previous summary notes that NOSENKO 
was unaware of countries visited by_ ABIDL'\.N during trips outs~de the 
USSR and that no effort was made by NOSENKO through the FCD to .find 
out such information. According to the previous summary, NOSENKO 
stated tliat the FCD "would not accept" such a request for "op.erational 
action against an America..."'l. diplomat coming from Moscow. " Tne 
surveillance which would have been required on the part of the FCD 
to achieve any sort of :.:-easonable coverage of ABIDIAN abroad would 
certainly have placed a severe burden on tl--.e FCD. Further, KOSEN KO 
conte:n.ds that the results which might reasonably be expected wou.ld be 
of little· or no practical value to t}1e SCD.
