Within an hour, BARGIIOORN was in the hospital, acutely- ifl.

Upon bis rctul"n to Moscow by air on 25 Octob_cr, BARG-. 
HOORN checked iuto the \letropol Hotel. The next· si_x days 
~ere occupied by sightseeing ~nd appointments connected with 
his re_search. :yn the late aftel"noon of 31 Octobe_r he called 
on frie~ds at the C~S~ Em&assy for cocktails, and at 1910, 
already_lO minutes late, he left in the Ambassador's car for 
a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) at the Metro­
pol with Theodore ORCHARD, a British diplomat. 
BARGHOORN's account of the subsequent e\·cnts closely 
parallels NOSEXKO's. llaving bec,n handed the incril!linating 
materials, he was arre'stcd, handcuffed, and taken to Militia 
Station No. 58, where he was questioned briefly by a ~ni­
formed Mill tia officer. The KGB was called. Within 30 
minutes a KGB captain (DARGHOOR~ thought his name :night 
have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to questio~ him, 
assisted by an int~rpreter named YEFRE!,!OV. * All quest ion_ 
were asked in Russian, and BARGHOORN answered most of them 
in English. The package of materials was opened and con­
tained, according to BARGHOORN, 13 or 14 photographs of 
rockets. This session lasted until. about midnight and 
centered around BARGHOORN's posscs~ion of the photographs 
and his "intelligence mission." He was then taken to the 
Lyubyanka prison. 
Interrogations were conducted the next mornir.g by the 
original KGB officer together with his "chief," whom BARG­
HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO. The 
questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was 
asked about the compromising c:aterials. The following day 
the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as (fnu) 
PETRENKO, and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB 
officer again. At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN 
was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his 
arrest. BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as ''clever and quick­
witted" and as giving "the impression that he v.-as not _·a 
dedicated careerist, but opportunistic·and adaptive;·he .. 
seemed not to care about what be was,dolng, but doing a good 
job nevertheless." • • • 
*Asked why YEFREIIOV used his true name during the interro­
gations, NOSE.--«{O said this was necessary for legal reasons,. 
that he had to si,gn documents conneq_ted with the interroga­
tions. BARGHOORN confirmed that.: YEFREltOV had participated 
throughout the,-eatire series of. interrogations and bad .. 
-signed interro'gation· reports attesting ·-to. the accuracy of 
translation. •
