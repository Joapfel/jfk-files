tail. conscious. These are a typical. Jiev Yorker's habits. The instructor, 
also a llew Yorker, is cutlty of' the identical actions. We are hif;hly 
kinetic in our 1:10Vements and as tor looking both ways while crossiJ)g a 
one-way street, we follov the old Marine Corps adaee: "There's always 
one S.O.B. that doesn't get the vord". By sheerest coincidence, when 
the instructor was on his way to the sai'esite to deliver the surveillance 
team's report, he violated his own rule of lookin& both ways 1c crossing 
a one-way street and was bowled over by a hip:,ie on a loaded bike -­
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor 
vaa carrYinB kept him from being knocked flat. 
15. Nevertheless, PIIOuE is DOV fully cognizant of' the appearance 
that his actions cren.te and wll1 watch it in the future. 
16. One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: Be 
chose his positions well and he C&l!IOuflaged his actions beautif'ully. 
One example: The instructor cal.led the surveW.ance team for a quick 
feedback on the first exercise and caught the men just as they returned 
to their of'fice. They got on dii'ferent phones for a three va:y conversation. 
1'bey reported one incident as follows: "So ra.pid were P.IONE's •'llOVCments, 
that when be net a friend of his, he bard.J.1 paused to speak Yi.th him, 
just waved him ott". The second surveillant: ":h, it didn't look like 
that at all, to me, To me it looked like this Indian-looking person 
stopped PHOliE and asked him for directions and 1'10:tE CRVe them and Just 
vent about his business". PHO!IE's own report, vhich he wrote up before 
he learned about the two different interpretations of' the incident: 
"--- where I stopped a f'oreign-looidng man, apparently Indian in origin 
and asked bin for the Museum which I knew perfectly veil is on 55th 
Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted 
the same man in the grey suit, nov bol~ his hat in his band". 
17. In the 'second exercise, there vere two items of' note: One, 
the team was surprised to note in PHONE's report that HIONE even had 
the name of' the book that the surveillant picked up when he folloved 
PHmm into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team 
compared notes end decided that PHONE m.e.y have made tvo of' them but 
could not possibly have ciade the third man. The team captain, on reading 
PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PliarE bad indeed made the third 
man also, but good. 
18. PHONE had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop­
mental acquisition series) Yi.th Mr. Harry Uebster, an instructor in the 
llev York of'fice. Af'ter relating the fine job that PHO,iE had done, Mr. 
Webster's report concluded: "A first rate perf'ormence by PHONE, vbo1s 
. obviously been around -- both covervise and f'or reala. 
19. His choice of' meeting places Yi.th his agent could not be 
f'aulted. For one, he chose M East Side restaurant (where dlplamants, 
as )tr. sweet held himself' out to be, would properly be seen dining).
