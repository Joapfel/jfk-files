The document from GOL.ITSYN also sta:.es: "SIMARD, Lionel, 
born in 1939, a college instructor, e>:presse<l an ·abnormal inter-
-est towarJs ~ilitary literature of th~ USSR; he made conta~t 
with Soviet citizens and attempted to slip into the area of ship­
building factories in I~ningrad. L~ter it ~as recorded that this 
'pedagogue', while in Moscow, sent espicnaqe letters containing 
secret writing. The letter contained the coordinates of a dead­
drop for an N!lerican agent." 
SIMARD went to the USSR as a CIA agent in August 1959, and 
he believed that he was under complete KGO co•:erage while there. 
He was in .:i.n,"l out of Moscow four tines during his trip, and each 
time he was assi9n~d hotel rooms kn::)~!1 to contain various KGB 
observation equipmunt. On one occusion S11·!.l\?.D W<.i.S introduced to

to cultivate him.*•* The characteriz3tion of his activities in 
the GOLITSYN clocumE!nt is correct. !!G.SENKO has not mentioned 
SIMARD. 
Another part of the document supplied by GO?,.ITSYN says: 
"An Amer~can, i-:hit:more GRAY, born 1932, an assistant professor 
at Michigan University, ~ent three espionage letters containing 
secret writing, while in Kiev. In Stalingrad he was detained 
while he was photographing a military factory." 
GRAY arrived in Kiev on 3 Nove~ber 1959 after having been 
trained by CIA in countersurveillance and briefed on his letter­
mailing mission and other assignments in the Soviet Union. Be-
tween midnight that night and one o'clock the next morning he mailed 
four operational letters. No surveillance was noted during the

NOSENKO reported on a 1959 trip to the Soviet Union by 
BALLARD, but said he was not aware of earlier ones. 
This is the same ARTEr,:ov identified by NOSENKO as a· fellow 
case officer in the U.S. E:nbassy Section of the American De­
partment and as the man with whom he worked on the BELITSKIY 
case in Geneva in 1962. ARTEMOV appeared again in operations 
against American tourists in 1959 when he was assigned as 
Inturist guide/interpreter for a group of Americans which in­
cluded a CIA officer. On one occasioq, w~en .. ,.this officer re­
turned unexpectedly to. h_is hotel from ·the '·theater-- to "which 
ARTEMOV had escorted him, he caught ARTEMOV searching his 
hotel room. NOSENKO has not mentioned these contacts of ,• 
ARTEMOV, which took place at the time he said· he was Deputy:_· 
Chief of the section dealing with American tourists. In • 
October 1966, in answer to a specific question, NOSENKO stated 
tha~ ARTEMOV never-had any connection.with the American Section 
of the Tourist Department. .. _ ' . , :·: . <t, __ -;}:si,~.: •
