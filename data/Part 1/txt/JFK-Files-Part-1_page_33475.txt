The Chlleao tefllgees in the Netherlands seem .t<f be 
having adjustment ptQbleois •.. These rather prcilonged symptoms• 
seem tei b~ gaused a.111ifng other thlrigs by tlle fact· tMt they 
still fJ11d •. H Jl~rd t~ .~ccep.t that· the socialist drel:i.nt 6.f 
their I•arxlst p:residerit is definitely over ar:id ,that the.ir . 
. · country is now bel9g rul~d by a small group of re~ctionaries 
who are trying to' ~eep t}:le people under control U1i-e>llg'1

Welfare 
What is the sitU:ation? r.fost· of the appro~J111a tely 
2.50 refugees with a high school or university ed(u~a ti9n do 
not work. About half of them have been housed at the • "Huls 
ter Schie" in .Overschie, w~ere. th'ey enjoy the su,ris_hi.11e on 
the terrace . or play volleyball in the yard. .3oard and 
lodging are f_r·ee and at the end, of the week the·y Pt'c~ µp 
ar,other 25 gupders pocket money. In addi tioh they rec_eive 
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and 
co111pensation for each trip they have to take. • 
Do you get thE;: idea that tney are bette:r off than 
many. old people in the t;etherlands? You arE1 prol>ably right, 
because the Chilean exiles do not have to lilie on welfares 
they are being paid from the frozen funds Ythichhad been 
. allocated for developinent aid to their fatherland, Chiie. 
So you can see how well our tax money is ·being sp~rit. •
