• ot steel. .•• In 1960 ··and 1961 the mike in GLEY­
STEEN'e office was working, I remember. Recep­
tion was good, but there was no secret infor2a­
tion. I don't know 'f.a~out reception from this 
mike i_D 1962). 
Question: What about GRYAZNOV's statement [concerning 
dimi~_ishing pr9(1uction of the Embassy microphones]? 
NOSEl\'KO: ----
Question: 
This was only one cor.1111on phrase. He didn't tell 
which rocm. I think he was speaking about the 
group ... 
How was production from the mikes in HORBALY's 
office? 
NOSENKO: Not good, but we did get something which made us 
suspect he was connected with i~telligence. 
HORBALY. 
Question: What about the code room and teletype office? 
NOSEh"lCO: At State, yes. Only always the sounds of machi&es 
in 1960 and 1961. Machines only. Three times 
during these two years maybe som~body said one 
phrase or ono of ttle guys said several numbers. 
Question: What about the military [code! area? 
NOSENKO: The reception was good. He [STORSBERG] seldom 
spoke. Somoti~es he repeated numbers to himself. 
And sometimes a mechanic of code oachices came 
to him, a military guy, a sergeant [William 
BURLEY, an Army Warrant Officer]. T~ey said two 
or three phra.ses. "Did you check this?" '"Yes.·" 
"This side good." Et cetern. 
Question: In all this _time that you read all this material, 
there must have been something that impressed 
HOSE~O: 
you as ex~remcly valuable. 
Extremely valuable--nothlng. A little·was in­
teresting from FREERS' room. It was given to the 
special group of GRIBANOV. Tbef were writing 
special information to the [KGBI Chairman to the 
[CPSU) Central Committee. There were political 
questions, tor example. •.·
