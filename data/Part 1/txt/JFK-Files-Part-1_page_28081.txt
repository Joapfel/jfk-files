NARRATIVE COMMENTS· cont'd 
Mr. Randall has expressed ·to me his concern about what 
_may be viewed as ·a dr.op in his rating from my predecessor's 
"0" .to. my_ "S." I have assured him, and assure the reader,. 
that this change signals no diminution i~ his performance·ot 
efi~ctivcness, but rather~ personal inclination to use • . 
"Outstanding" very rarely. The narrative comments above 
should clearly attest to that fac;:t that I view Mr. Randall's 
pcrforma_nce .a-s very s•trong, t,ordcring on Outs~anding. The 
Agency and the DO have been fortunate to have.a man of thi-s 
caliber in charje of PIAG. 
REVIEWING COMMENTS·- cont'd 
Mr. Randail is one of the key ~o)icy makers in this area. His 
policies have stood the test up to now as our excellent record 
in the courts attests. 
llaving_said this, it should be noted that Mr. Randall's 
numerous accomplishments arc partly because the job was there 
to be created. Within the DO he cut the path which is now 
followed when handling FOIA matters. He has corrected and 
in~roved upon that path several times over. Thus, the time 
is coming for him to be given a change in assignmerii; an 
opportunity to use his managerial and supervisory skill, 
elsewhere. U~ will have be~n i~ his present assignment three 
years in March 1978. One grows stale reviewing, sani~izing 
and making judgment ~alls in 'the FOIA arena day after day. 
Mr .. Randnll isn't stale }'Ct but we should not .wait until he 
reaches thatstage to give him a new area in which to work.
