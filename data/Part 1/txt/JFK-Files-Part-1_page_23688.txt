1. 0.PlrnATIONAL AC'l'IVI'IT 
A. Preparations were uod~rway in early ~ovesber to 
dispatch AIITIWiH<--13 to Madrid in aid-Novelliber to cesent 
the recruitment of AKTEUlfl(-19. 'lbe,st, plans fell 
through ,rben the Madrid Station notified Headquarters 
and WAVE th&.t their workload would not allow sufficient 
case officer time to handle AMTRl.JNK-13 in Madrid at this 
time. WAVE agreed to postpone AllTlitJNK-13's trip to 
Madrid several weeks until Jrladrid Station's workload 
abated soaewhat. 
B. 'lhc, prospects of finalizing the recniitm'3ot of 
AJlTRIDuC,..19 increased hc,wever with the receipt at WAVE 
of another open letter from A.MTiruNl'.-19, this one 
aailed from Mexico City in mid-November. Iii A!ITP.UNK-.l9's 
first letter, mailed frOln Uontreal in mid-October, he 
aug&ested using a friend in l!exico City as a cut-out to 
initiate a channel of c01111Dunications between himself and 
AlITRUNK,..13. In bis second letter, AMTRUJ,K.-19 stated 
- that be had 11ade the necessary arrangements Yith bis 
friend in Mexico. Although WAVE. Headquarters and )!EXI 
traces on AIITRUNY.-19'a friend, IDEN A, were fra:;mentary, 
Mexico Station stated that IDEN A Y11B well-known to one 
of its PBRUIIEN a.~sets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties. 
WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AJITRI.Il\1t-19 in 
Ml'I"R01''1t-13's handwriting to keep the channel with A-19 
alive. AJl'l'JlUNK-19 appears eager to see AlfTitma.-13 again 
and has stated io both letters that he has considerable 
infonaatlon to discuss in detail. It is well realized 
that this open letter channel is far from ideal but.it 
i~ hoped that in early January 1965 µITR'iJNX-13 can re­
contact AJ.rl'B.IDIK-lO.~ provide hi.a_ with. a ayatea of S/W.
