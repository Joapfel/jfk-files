1. As previously reported, we related to JAGUAR the incident 
.in which Lionel Morrison is believed to have searched 
-QRPBOHE's papers while the latter was out of town. 
As you know, there have been some indications-in the past 
which might be taken to suggest that Morrison was a JAGUAR 
contact - be works for the Daily Telegraph and seems to 
be in touch with David Floyd, and on one occasion provided 
QRPHOMB with a report (on QP.PIDNY) which came almost 
simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up 
to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR 
would be involved in the harrassment of QRPHONE. Even if 
there was no JAGUAR contact with .llorrison, however, we felt 
it might be possible that JAGUAR could add to our understanding 
of this peculiar development from sources available to their 
own net. JAGUAR'& reply is as follows (CORONET is the agreed 
crypt for QRPHONE): 
''With reference to your letter of 24th April 1969, 
we have been informed by a secret and delicate source 
that David U. SIBEKO, the newly appointed P.A.C. rep­
resentative in London, bas recently been told by Elias 
NTLOEDIBE, the P.A.C. representative in Nairobi, of the 
incident of MORRISON's search ot OORONET's p~pers. 
According to Elias, MORRISON bad written him a letter 
in an attempt to blackmail him. Elias told SIBEKO that 
what annoyed hi.a was that 1t!ORRISON bad sent pbotostat 
copies of Elias's own correspondence with CORONET.

Elias was surprised that CORONET bad not replied to letters I !
