of his books to print thousands of copies, Vhicb were 
distributed by other assets of the Mexico Station. A 
copy-of the open letter was published in "EXCELSIOR" on 
the day of YEVTUSHENKO's arrival in Mexico for what was 
originally billed as a personal trip. Because of the 
open letter and critical press coverage of YEVTUSBENKO's 
rude behavior towards the press on arriving at Mexico 
City airport, the Russian E~bassy called a special press 
conference the evening of the day of the poet's arrival. 
At the press conference YEVTUSHENKO spoke with outrage 
of the open letter, carefully dodging a number of questions 
asked by the letter, and chided the signers of the letter 
for claiming there was absolute literary f~eedom in Mexico, 
asking bow there can be freedom anywhere in the world as 
long as there is no freedom in Vietnam. YEVTUSBENKO's 
remarks about the open letter left no doubt that be bad
