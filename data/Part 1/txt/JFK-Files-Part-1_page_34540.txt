I 
I . 
Dhl you ever hca._r th,"\t Oswald possihlr h~cl contact with the Soviet 
intelligence during his service in Japan? 
Z. You state~ previously that there was no information that Oswald offered 
to give information on _the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file. 
Then how do you kn~w this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB 
i 
.ind GRU ·made no attempt to debrief Oswald about his service in the 
US Marine Corps·? 
/ 3. Previously. you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the 
Defense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information 
on this. Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGD officer instead 
of. in. the Dcfen~eiMinistry? 
Note: (a) Acco·;.•ding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T. Voloshin was an 
administrator at Patrice Lumumba University and was a KGB 
officer .who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles 
in· 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was ·making 
weekend trips tliere to get his passport and possibly to make other 
. arrangements for:his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oswald 
decided _to return to the United States, he received a letter from 
Patrice Lumumba University ·signed by Voloshin. (page 111) 
(b) -P. I). knew one KGB office~ by the name of Voloshin (first 
a~ci middle name forgotten) who ~sed to work in SMERSH 
(military CI) and later in the late 1940 1 s and beginning of the 
1950's in S & T Department of the KGB. 
VIL Marina. 
I. From where did you pick up the information that Marina was a "simple. 
obyvatel" (a politically unaware person) and ·that she was not anti-Soviet 
if )"OU did not rear! the Oswald file?
