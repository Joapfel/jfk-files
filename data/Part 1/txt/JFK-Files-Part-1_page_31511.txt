of the people in the New York office tnlk about ill the payment ot 
137,500 to fred c. Smith, who worked for 11p~roxb1.1tely one month 
in drawing up a Dimes for Jo'reedo111 CB.lllpaign which, as you recall, 
vaa rejected aa a basis !or _this year's cemp~gn. ' 
5. No acc"1.lnt.1rig of Crusade funds o.xp9fV1cd t.n the field has 
ever been made, and in a fund-raiolng campaign it is perhaps 
imposaible to d.o so~· _·Nevertheless, rocorde involving payments 
for _expenaa mney to private cl tizons onv,af{OO •. for the dura·tion of 
the· campaign are chaotic. You will recall that Zponcer Phenix, 
Treasurer of1lCFE, refu3es to have anything to do with expenditures 
tor the Crusade. 
6. Since _ve are winding up thfJ Cruna.de t.h13 year and will 
attern;it to.place it on a more reliable baeis through the Heritnge 
Foundation, I a~~oat that you assure Admiral MUler that funds 
auI1'1cient to wind up -the C_rusade will .be forthcoming and that- you 
instruct the IO D1v1siOn·to expedi.to a proJect grll!lting these· 
funds. I further suggest that in view or the allagations above, 
which I repeat 1.·or your private background 1nfo1,nation, :•011 keep the 
position ot th-, Agency faultless by re(Juestinv, from Admiral Miller 
a budget in aR much detail as possible for the amount necessary to 
• liquidate the Crusade.
