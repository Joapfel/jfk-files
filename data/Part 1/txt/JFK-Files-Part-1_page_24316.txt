IIEIIORANDUM OF MEETING 
SUBJECI': QRPHONE Operations in Europe 
1. Mr. Leo Horvath, EUR/CA, and myself briefly 
discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 ~ovember. 
During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal 
which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at 
LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was 
that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through 
Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either Rome 
or Paris for an extended period of time. In either of 
these locations he would then attempt to identify and 
to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting ~ontacts 
in the left sector of tl!a student and youth population, 
who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study 
group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so 
inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist 
stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers 
would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con­
text. Rather, be would guide and motivate such contacts 
as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist 
group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger 
such group say, in Britain. He would, of course, imply 
to his followers that he is· attempting to develop a 
similar nucleus in (France) (Italy) or whenever, as 
good Communists should. 
2 •.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature. 
First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists 
would follow along lines of a typical black Communist 
cell, emulating the kind of notional movement which 
Mr. Andy.Ness developed in the Yiddle East some seven or 
eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in 
turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers 
who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and 
perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the 
Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC. 
Presumably their actions would result in some local 
embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE, 
__ //,,. himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials-­
