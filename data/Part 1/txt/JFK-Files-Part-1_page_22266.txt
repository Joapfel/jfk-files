the purposes of casing a drop site u,d puttir.g dovn th'? dea1 
drop, respect.i·,ely. The doc;.iment furtt:.f!r st7-t'!d that the ~cad 
dror had been put do-n for PEPNIKOV, an agent of A::.trica~ lntel­
ligen~e ~ho had recently been arresterl ty th~ !-Iosco- KGB. Two 
errors of fact in this passago belie KGB pra~tice as knmm from 
ml!ny source:ss 
• 
- There is no reason to doubt that the KGB observed 
U,NGELLE on the two occasio~s of his visits to Lenin Hills, 
both ti.mes to case a proposed d~ad d=o~ stt~. !ioth sites 
involved staircases, but they were two different stair­
cases in the same general area of the L~nin Hills park. 
Since it is a fact that I.ANGELLE did not put do-.,n a dead 
drop on either occaoion. KGB surveillance could not have 
seen him do so. I( the KGB had reason to suspect that he 
had don9 so, but could not locate it (since it vas not 
there). the KGB vould feel the necessity--even ~ore than 
in the case of ABIDIAH and the Pushkin Street d~op--to put 
24-'hour surveillance on the area for a reasonable length 
of tirne, in order to apprehend the agent for whom it was 
intended. The dead drop was not actu~lly put down until 
7 June 195B (durinQ twilight), ten day3 after t~e &econd 
casing . .Asswnirag the KGB had not stop,>E:d its coverage 
of the area after only ten days, the CIA agent who did 
put dO'offl the dead drop must have been observE:'l d~ing this. 
OfER!:."PA.'mv• s note thus errP.d by ettrib-.Jt lng to Lk'lGELLE 
an action which the KGB knev he had not taken and which 
the KGB almost certainly kn~~ someor.e else had taken. -~-----'. -. \ 
- At the time the dead drop was put do-.m, it had not ~ 
been designated for any agent, RE:P!HKOV tr.eluded. It 
was a contingency dead drop, to be activated at some 
time in the future as nece~sary: the agent for whom it 
might have been designated could conceivably not even 
be recruited until long after the dead drop was loaded. 
REPNIKOV, identified in the document as the person in­
tended to unload it, was not a recruited a;ent of Ameri­
can Intelligence either at the tim~ of the drop-loading 
or at eny ~ime thereafter: ne1th~r w~s any cead drop 
conte::iplated for him in th~ event that he might be re- ~ 
cruited. Nothing that wes in the drop could ha\/e sug­
gested RE?:HKOV as the intended recipier.t. Again, 
OfEREPA.~OV's note erroneously and gro ..... ~dlessly assigr.ed 
the dead drop to REPNIKOV whereas in fact this dead drop 
was unassigned b-/ CIA._ 
If this document vere or purported to be U·.e official 
version of the activities of LA.~GELLE, in typed or printed 
form, these errors in fact could be interoreted as intentional 
and part of the·sanitization, or part of ~n effort to make the 
ICGB investigative work look better than it o1as. As it is a 
handwritten copy, supposedly in the writing of. the person who 
intended to give t~e document to the U.S. Goverrunen~ and harm 
the KGB, and since CHEREPk~OV supposedly would have had access 
to the true facts, the absence of some connent further indi­
cates that the document was intentionally inaccurate and in­
complete.
