CHAPTER l)( 
OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSE!1KO' S KGB SERVICE 
Most of NOSENKO's assertions can be examined in a chrono­
logical fashion, as has been done in the preceding sections. 
Some can most easily be examined separately, since they 
relate not to any particular period of his KGB service nor 
to any specific position he claimed he occupied, but to his 
entire KGB career. The principal aspects in this category 
of claims are those he made about his relationship with 
Second Chief Directorate General GRIBANOV, his Party status, 
his knowledge of certain KGB forms and procedures, his 
sourcing of KGB operations, awards he earned for KGB service, 
and his KGB rank. 
Relationship with General GRIBANOV 
From his first meeting with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO main­
tained that he had a close personal and professional rela­
tionship with Major General GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second 
Chief Directorate. NOSENKO described recruitment approaches 
in which he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations 
they had on operational matters, the role which GRIBANOV 
played in his promotions, awards and assignments, and their 
after hours carrousing. According to NOSENKO,. GRIRNJOV was 
wholly responsible, against NOSI::NKO's wishes, for his­
appointment to the position of Deputy Chief of the American 
Department EmLassy section in 1960, and when NOSENKO later 
rejected GRIBANOV's offer to make him Chief of the entire 
American Department, it was GRIBANOV who arranged his return 
to the Seventh Department as Chief of the American-British 
Commonwealth Section and who shortly thereafter appointed 
him a Deputy Chief and thereafter First Deputy Chief of the 
Seventh Depa~tment.
