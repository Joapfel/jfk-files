1. At Uie request of 1.'.r. Ga]Mtell, ! r.et with riu,r,a:Y.}id on the 
occa5~_on of his vi~it to \..'ashi:-.~tcn last ,i;ovember a:irl r-ade ceM.ain oral 
col"Jllit.Ments on behalf of the Dividon. ro c0,ir,iment,' hc....-evcr, was very 
specific and all were cleared with the Divisicn in advF.tr.ce •. fy partici­
pation in ~,e ~atter was, of co~rse, c~i.r:?, to the fact that I had 
recruited Htu,,.anoid ori.i-;i.nally and enjoy his confidence. 
2. Hu.'llanoid in the past has pu!"S'Jed his activities on behalf of 
this O!"::;ani2atir,n as somewhat of a ;,~fit.able avocation. P.is ;:,erfo:r;-,,ance, 
nonetteless, has teen outstancE.r.g fr= tr,~ poi?:t. of ·.riew o!' i:-.itiati.v,:, •. 
production a:1d understanding of o::ieratior.al principles. P.e ,,.-culd now 
like to make it~ career but lacks sufficient ir.forrr.ation upon·which to 
base a decision a·:1d, being partially a'liare t)f the t•nceru>.inties involved, 
insists upon maintaining ;;in alterna~ vocation. In pursuit of this latter 
objective, he plans to move to 3ue~?S Aires in June or July of 1953 and 
e~tablish hL~self there on a pe~anent basis. r.is inquiries were to 
asccrtai.n what effect tl-.ese plar.s would have .ur,on his present and future 
relationship with this orgar~zation. 
3. I advised HU!llaooid to cDntinue with his plans as outlir.ed above, 
stipulating only that he re~ain in his present location until 11fter the 
forthconi.r.g elections and as~red !':::..-, frat as a cor.sequence o!' his past 
~atisfactory service he ,._.ould ~e ,,;_eked ;_;o in £;•Jer:os Aires. ;;it•a co"'!:censa-
_.tion at least equ-11 to tr.at .,:: ___ t:i f.e is 2:--c~e!":lli.· r~cel\."lr.g. 
b. I then explained that our participation in his move would 
- . ,,,.::..c.< necess.lrily have to be deter:nir:ed at a later date but requested him to 
keep us !nfor:r.ed or his plans on a continuing basis, assuring hi.Ir. that 
it 1i10uld do no ha?'lll to request such assistaxe as he 111ight need. In this 
connection, ! advised hi.111 to req..:est for.,-.al trainir..g," which he has never 
. bad, i.mplyi.r.g that this -..-ould be granted, and suggested that a formal 
- contract, future compeni;ation, travel exper.se and so forth cocld best be 
• - negotiated here at that ti.me.
