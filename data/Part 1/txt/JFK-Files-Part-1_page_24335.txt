B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful,professional 
organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the 
circumstances of his agent relationship, whicti require 
very professional.handling. Indccd.Q/1 has probably come 
to hold a 1•a ther g I.amorous "story book" image of JKLANCE 
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE 
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be_ 
exaggerated in bis case, but every one of the wild anti­
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to 
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of 
a very impressive outfit._ 
C. In bis political evolution over the years, Q/1 
bas become active in at least two "causes". In both 
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy 
and factional struggles and in both cases be was personally 
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been 
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political 
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called 
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends 
as a detached observer rather than a part_icipant. 
D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact 
that he is an American (and does not consider himself 
disloyal). Given bis citizenship and his disinclination to 
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he 
bas been perfectly willing to accept- employment by JKLANCE 
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication 
~hat he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed· 
the contrary seems to be the case. 
B. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that 
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial 
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity 
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid -
bim reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to 
be independent of bis wife's family's charity. 
F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination 
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1 
·clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international 
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and 
the opportunity to exercise his language capability_. In 
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life.which 
be has been able to live appeals to him. 
G. In assessing the relative importance of these 
several factors which make up-Q/l's motivation, the under­
signed would stress· that C and· E were probably the immediate 
causes of his acceptance o_f recruitment while A and D were more 
underlying. Band F have arisen since recruitment and 
probably play an important role in bis current motivation.
