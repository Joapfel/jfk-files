INFORMATION CONCERliING 
A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable 
information in the past recently advised that during the 
Fall of 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist­
Leninist organization stated that one Richard Gibson was 
suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency. 
According to this individual, Gibson recently had been in 
Milan, Italy, in the company of a female secretary from Paris, 
whose home is in New Rochelle, New York. At that time 
Gibson remarked his travel and activities were possible 
because be had married a wealthy English woman. other things 
were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.· 
According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese 
Marxist-Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning 
Gibson to Rene Raindorf, a member of the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist). 
Raindorf reportedly thereafter met in Brussels, BelgiWll, with -':­
Gibson although he had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese 
communists would look into the charges of the Italian J4arxist­
Leninist.
