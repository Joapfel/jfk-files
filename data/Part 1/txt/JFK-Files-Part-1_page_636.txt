granting his approval, He has reported two persons whom he does not,

too much and &Eta indiscreet, For two other examples, AMBOA--1 and

the names of other contacts for checking. In the case of AMFAUNA-q,(~ 
whom he recruited without prior checking because time did not permit 
it, he put his misgivings in·writing: "Right away AMFAUNA-1 arranged 
for a personal interview~ taking utmost precautions, sin~e we have 
had sad previous experiences with members of CASTRO's armed forces." 
8, Once he has recruited~ sub-agent, AMFAUNA-1 manages to keep 
an independent eye on the former's security. On more than one occasion 
·he ·has reported that one of his s~b-agents is under G-2 surveillance, 
and that for the time being he is staying away from him. • 
·g. In general AMFAUNA-1 seems to trust in the efficiency of his 
security precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity 
'°1.l had b~en caught, but that he was in no danger because he had been 
compartmented from h~.t~•1o.:~l}lisJl.tc9~p~-r.tmentifJ;,!PE.;;-j-lqiachieved by the use of,fi~e cutouts: AMFAuNA"=2, AMtAUNA-3, AMFAON"A-q, AHBOA-1, and 
AMf'-AON~~S, who maintain contact for AMFAUNA-1 with most if not all of 
hie sub-agents. Chart A, which shows AMFAUNA-1 ,in. direct contact with 
AMFAUNAs 7- through 13, may be in error on this point. It would be 
_more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1' s known modus operandi for him to have 
cutouts between himself and these sub-agents., If there is a cutout or 
cutouts here, their identity is •not yet known. There may also be cl'{l 
unreported cutout between AMFAUNA-1 an~ AMFAUNA-4. • • 
10. Except for AMFAUNA~#, all the above-mentioned cutouts are 
woman, Two of his support agents, including his mail drop, are also 
~om7n. AMFAUNA-1 has· not. been e·xplici t on this point, but it is r·· ; ' 
believed that ha shares his favors between them. ~ If so, "fie nas the · •
