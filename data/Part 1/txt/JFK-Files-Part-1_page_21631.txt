in corJ:lict with foe &ta.:~mu.ts of DER YABlN', RASTVOROV and 
.GOLITSYN, all o! whom maintain that BERIYA was responsfole for 
the changes. As for the issi.e of who was responsible for the reversal 
of desigr.ations, it woulc! a?paar that NOSEN'KO is in error. nowever, 
the fact that he waa a new junior officer and that this was a 'period of 
upheaval 'in the KGB (MVD) efiecti~ely eliminates any signiiicance in 
this issue. 
NOSE~~.t<:o is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing 
the location of the C.o.ief Directorate of the Mil,itia or the history of the 
KI (Committee of Ir.formation). NOSENKO has stated that he had no 
contacts with either office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason 
to disbelieve this.statement. He is not aware of when the KI ceased to 
exist (1951 given ia tile summary, but other information indicates the KI 
continued to exist in a ·nomir,al capacity until the mid-1950 1&), but care 
should be used in stating what -'OSENKO should know ii he held a certain 
position. Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their. own 
memory ct>iicerning the location and their knowledge of Agency £acilities at 
any given period of time or when Agency components or related organizations 
were organized or ceased to exiat.
