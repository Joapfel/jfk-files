Transfer to the Tourist Department irlJ~nuarj- 1962 . •• 
In the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached~ on the bash 
of NOS£NKO's own request, to return him to t~e Tourist Depart­
ment. GRIBA.~OV had originally wanted to prcMOte NOSENl<O from •. 
the position of Deputy Chief of the u.s. Emba.ssy Se_ction to the 
post of Deputy·Chief of the American Department; NOSENKO's 
superior and friend KOVSHUK had long had hts eye on· this job, 
ho~&ver, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri-
can Departr.-.ent for it. (In fact; NOSENKO said, KOVSUUK had 
once held the job, lcsir:g it in 1959 because of some misbeh·avior.) 
NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation 
which his o~~ promoticn to this post wculd have ·created. ~OSENKO 
. described his transfer in the February 1965 interr01ations. The 
following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965: 
•The decision for me to return to the Seventh [Tourist) 
De?arti.er:t. in Jnr.uary 1962 -,.·.as actually made in about S,eptem­
ber or Octobar 1%1. GRIB.AliOV planned to e1p·point me Deputy 
Chief of u-:e First [American] Department, but the nelr.' Chief 
of the First Departnent, FECOSEYn:, wanted KOVSHU-.i< to take 
this position. Sinc·e I did :iot wa:it to be placed in this 
position by GRIBA!JOV's order against the wishes of FCDOSEYEV, 
I want to GRIBT\l~OV and requested that I be transferred back 
to the Seventh Department, in any position. I had already 
spoken to [V.D.] CHELNOKOV, who was then Chief of the 
Seventh Department, about this ma;ter and h~ had suggested 
that I go to GRivANOV and ask to be returned to the Sevqnth 
Department .'.is Chief of the First (i\merican-British-Canadian) 
Section with the understanding that I would be appointed· 
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this 
position would be vacated by [B.A.) BJ\LDIN [who was retiring 
in July 1962) .... GRIBANOV did not tell me his reasons .•. 
for wanting to appoint me Deputy Chief cf the First Depart­
ment in late 1961 or for appointing rne Section Chief and 
later Deputy Chief of the Seventh ~epartment in 1962. He 
did not discuss witi1 me my personal qualifications for 
each of these positions.• 
Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity 
during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour­
ist Department. There he talked with Department Chief CHELNOKOV, 
faI:1iliarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist 
Section, ·aud discussed current operations and operational possi­
bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal 
order for the tranRfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24 or 25 De=em- . 
ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case fil~ 
and the U.&. Enib'assy security file to his successor as L>eputy • 
Chief of the American E~.bassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the 
• next few·days.* As ha had when he transferred from the T~urist 
to the American Department in 1960, NOSENKO said, he took his 
active agents and his safehouse on Vorovskiy Street with him when. 
he mturned to the Tourist Department in 1962. •
