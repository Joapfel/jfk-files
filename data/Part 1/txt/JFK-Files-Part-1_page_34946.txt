Your re.r Allotment HM 
• -Dear- -Mr.--.:---
. As per your request, I tried to obtain copy of my marriage 
certificate from Cuba. Despite my efforts I have been 
unable to secure one. 
However, copies of my husband's and my daughter's birth 
certificates, issued some time aeo, were forwirded to 
me. 
Marginal note on my husband's certificate shows entry of 
our marriace and our dauchter's also mentions the fact of 
said marriage. 
•r am cnclosine p~otoeopies of both documents. Should you 
require tho origlnal:s, I wi-11 be happy to forward them_ to 
-you as lone as they are returned to me since these are the 
only copies in my possessioh. 
I will continue to try to secure copy of my marriaee cer-' 
tificate which I will forward to you, should I obtain it. 
Trusting these documents will be of help to you, I am. 
Very truly yours
