f. In 1959, on a trip to Santiago, Chile, SZULC 
claimed to be "cleared" and requested an interview 
with an Agency representative. This ·was the first of 
numerous such requests. In addition, it was in about 
1959 that he. also began making a point of telling Agency 
personnel_the names of other-Agency officers he had 
identified. 
g. An article SZULC wrote on Cuba f.or the NYT in 
December 1959 was hailed as an antidote to the excessively 
favorable reports of his colleague, Herbert MATTHEWS, but 
in fact his article was largely favorable to Fidel CASTRO 
and to CASTRO's plans for Cuba. It is only in comparison that 
wit~_ MAT"I:HEW~ blatantly pro-CASTRO articles -r:·- SZULC 's 
piece/can·~:. be considered balanced. 
h. By September, 1960, SZULC was in the forefront of 
those advocating action against CASTRO. (lt was he who 
finally brought the Leonardo Plan to Washington in 1963 . 
. See AMTRUNK Operational paper). 
i. In April 1961, shortly after John F. KENNEDY was 
innaugurated, SZULC_was transferred to Washington by the 
NYT. Although a reasonable transfer, it is noteworthy 
that in a very short time SZULC claimed that he had a 
standing invitation to go directly to the President, the 
Vice President, the Attorney General, McGeorge BUNDY 
and Robert HURWITCH on Cuban matters.
