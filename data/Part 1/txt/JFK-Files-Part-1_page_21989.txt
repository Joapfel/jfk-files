(iv) OSWALD's Visit to Soviet Embassy in Mexico 
Asked whether he had any information on OSWALD's visit 
to •·:xico in September 1963, NOSENKO_saiJ that he knew on:y 
that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come 
to the Soviet Union. The Mexico £ity Legal Residency of the 
KGB reported his visit to Headquarters by cable, requesting 
inforr~~ion; this was the first that the KGB First Chief 
Directorate had heard of OSWALD. M.I. TURALI~, Deputy Chief 
of Service Number Two (KGB counterintelligence abroad), 
thereupon phoned V.K. ALEKSEYEV, Chief of the Sixth Section 
of the Tourist Department, whom TURALIN knew personally, to 
·1earn whether any information was availaule. ~OSENKO believed 
that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. CHELNOKOV or A,G. KOVALENKO 
. to ask about OSh'ALD, and NOSENKO thought that he himself was 
present at the time. ALEKSEYEV was given the background on 
OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he 
was not considered normal, and was·told t~ advise the Jitst 
Chief .Directorate t.hat OSl\'ALD should not be permitted' to re­
enter the Soviet Union. ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN 
to relay this message. NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD
