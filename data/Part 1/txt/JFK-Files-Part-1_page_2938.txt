( OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENICO' S KGB CAREER) 
In June 1962 NOSEllKO volunteered that he was then a major, 
but that he would soon be promoted to lieutenant colonel. 
In 1964, in Frankfurt awaiting transportation to the 
United States, NOSENKO reviewed and approved a biographic 
statement which included the claim that he had been a senior 
lieutenant in the American Embassy Section from 1952 (sic) 
until 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major 
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963. 
In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO claimed that 
at the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1954 [not in 1952). 
he was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant. When it 
was pointed out to him that that was less than a year after 
he entered.the KGB, he asserted that his Naval RU service· 
was taken into consideration. 
Asked in June 1964. to list his promotions, chronologically, 
NOSENKO asserted that he became a senior lieutenant in 1953, 
in 1956 a captain, in 1959 a major and, in October· [in 
Geneva, just afterwards, he said November] 1963, he was 
advised by Personnel that he had been promoted to lieutenant 
colonel and afterwards was personally congratulated by 
General GRIBANOV. NOSENKO did not recall the month of his 
earlier promoti9ns~ 
Comment: KGB defec.tors have commented that it would be 
unusual for a KGB officer not to recall his 
date of rank, from which he computes his 
seniority and time in grade towards his next 
promotion. 
In January 1965, while discussing his role as case offi~er 
for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN, NOSENKO volun­
teered out of context that he had.never· been a major nor was 
he promoted to captain in 1956, as he had claimed earlier. 
He explained that he became eligible for captain in 1956, • 
but his promotion was withheld as punishment because he had 
obtained treatment for a venereal disease under an alias,
