14 June 1!36'2°": The subject of motivation was not discussed 
during the third.and fourth meetings with NOSENKO. As he was 
about to leave the Geneva safehouse after the fifth and final 
.session, however,. :~GSENKO again to·.1ched on the economic inequi­
ties existing inside the Soviet Union and raised a new reason for 
cooperating with CIA,- his basic sympathy for- the American people. 
- NOSENKO said that he realized that the reason he had given for 
coming to us, his need for money, was "riot good," Before he 
and his case officers parted, :rnsr-:~;Ko said, ha wanted to em­
phasize "without attempting to justify himself" that he had 
aalways felt a certain sympathy toward the American people." He 
explained that it was not th~ technical progress of the United 
States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of 
living of the American people. It was r.ather the openness and 
directness with which tht-- Americans whom h·.:: had 1r,et and seen 
·handled themselves. As examples he cited his American targets 
in Moscow and Secretary of State Dean RUSI<, whom he had seen in 
Ge~~- ' 
Although NOSENl<O did mention the difficult economic situa­
tion in t!'"le USSR on a few other occasions, he did not relate 
these remarks specifically to his motives for volunteering to 
CIA. The above excerpts are representative of his total state­
ment on motivation during the 1962 n:eetings. 
3. Decision to Defect (January 1964) 
On arrival for his first ffieeting with CIA during the second 
Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that after long 
and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting series, he had 
decided to defect. lie once again criticized the Communist regime 
along the same lines as during earlier meetings, but his immedi­
ate motivation seemed to have nothing to do with this. NOSEUKO 
explained that he had recently been promoted to the position of 
First Deputy Chief of the Seventh (Tourist) Department of the KGB 
Second Chief Directorate, and that because of the stature and 
respon3ibilities of his new job, there would be ~~w opportunities, 
·if any, for him to visit the West in the future. Therefore, he 
had decided to seize the opportunity at hand and to flee to the 
United States at once, leaving his family behind.· He· foresaw no 
possibility of his wife and children being per~itted to leave the 
USSR for the "next twen·ty years." NOSENKO told CIA that uthe 
hardest thing is to part with my family.• He had, however, care­
fully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector, 
md he knew ·that, because of his mother's position in Soviet so~:· 
ciety, no harm woultl come to them. 
Whereas. NOSENKO- declared his intent to· 4,efect immedia'tely, 
the CIA case·officers at this·first meeting 'in 1964 persuaded 
him to remain in place for at least two or three weeks on the 
grounds that, first, CIA would benefit much from thisi and 
second, arrangements for his transfer to arid reception in the 
united States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA 
Headquarters. •
