A fllll fitness ·report was prepared by me on this officer 
on 15 Apr-il and therefore this memorandum, being prepared in 
connection vith my transfer, will merely supplement the pr~-
_vious re-port. 
During the past five months 1 have had further evidence 
to ,.substantiate the statements made concern in~•• res • • 
maturity nnd dependability. He has occn my chief counselor 
in a recent reappraisal of standards of behavior from a 
securi tY:· .standpoint. His opinions and advice are always care­
fully thought through, devoid of fcl\l· induced over caution, 
nnd realistic. 
'. 
-~ con.t.i.nue.s. t.o. be a 
people, their capabilities and 
ggod supervisor. He knows hiS 
limitations. ThtfY' respect bim 
for hiS leadership. • 
In liaison ,vlth other security nctivities~has 
established excellent relationships which have frequently 
proven tbeir value. Uc has considerable talent .for liaison 
which should be kept in mincl in selecting his next assignment.
