c. After the l January 1959 Revolution, 
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con­
tent_ of the Revolution and participated di1_·ectly 
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of 
·Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and 
informed Sul::ject of events occurri_ng within the 
Presidential Palace. Subject then consulted with 
Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti­
Communist. 
d. Subject is very intelligent, very com­
petent, and an extraordinarily hard ,1•orker. He 
is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University 
Medical School, and Director of the_ Higher N.ervous 
Activity Research Institute. Duri~g the dc~ade 
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban 
Medical College and was President of the World 
Medical Group; during this decade he made m~ny 
visits to the USA on matters related to·his pro­
fessional activities. 
e. It ~as been commented that Subject performed 
"brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE. 
During the period in 1966 that subsourcc ~as held 
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject; 
subsource has never heard anyone s·ta te that he 
actually saw- Subject at Villa Maris ta. In subsource 's 
opinion, if Subject has e·ver worked for the MININT, 
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes 
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that 
the classes ~ould have been similar to those that 
Subject gave to Cuban artists. 
f. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordina1·il v 
hi:rnutif•Jl mistress tl:at he still coutinur.s to visit 
and support. This mistress, Manolita Canto, was 
divorco:?cl hr her husband, Salup (fnu), :ifteJ' a- pr_iv:-ite 
detective hired by the husband surprisec.l Subject and 
Canto ~n a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequ~ntly, 
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subje_ct from 
entering the U.S.A. Canto had. had one son by her 
liusbancl; ,,·lie_n her liusbano died, the _son i11her-ifecJ. 
the father's wealth, which was considerable~. The 
laws a~~inst private property promul~atcd by the 
-Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position 
to the point that st~ has had.to go to work; she now 
works at the INJT .(National Tourist Industry Institute), 
located at 23 and L Street!5, Vedado, Jl;n•:rna City~
