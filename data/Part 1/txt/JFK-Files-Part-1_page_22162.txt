• NOSE1'1CO : At the end of • 53 or bc 6 ini:Hng of '54. Then I 
got captain in 1956. 
: Question: When in 1956? 
NOSENKO: I rlon't rcce::iber. You see, they are not 5 iven 
eic:actly in February or in ~larch. Sometimes· the 
schedul£,d til'le passes before they give it. So, 
'55--Captain, '59--~ajor, ~nd '63-- ... 
16 Jun~ 1964: Asked to list in chronological order the 
date of his promotions within the KGB from the date of 
entry, NOSENKO stated: "l began .in the GRt; as a junior 
lieutenant. While in t!le GRH I became a lieutenant, and I 
c~ter&d the KGB with this rar:k in 1953. Not long after I 
cr.t.e:red tho KGB, I beca.'l!e a senior lieutE-nant, but I do.n't 
know the month. It was still 1953. In 1956 I was promoted 
to the rank of captain. 1 don't know the month. I became 
a major in 1959. I don't know the7~onth. In October 1963 
1 w:-.-: made" lie:utem:Lnt colonel. •.. Personnel called me on 
the ,.t"lephcne and said l had been promoted, Later I was 
told that ·GRIBM;ov wanted to see rne. 1- went to his office, 
but, of course·, I didn't let h iti know that I already knew 
• that I had been pror.ioted. He gave me his congrat.uiations. 
You never see the attestation. It goes into your official 
f ilP.." 
26 January 1965: While discussing his r.?le as case 
officer for U.S. E~6assy Security Offic~r John ABIDJAN, 
NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi­
cially been a ~ajor. He explained this situation as 
follows: Having been promot~d to the rank of senior 
lieut€'nant in April 1953, he i>PCame eligible for the rank 
of r,aptain in 1956. Wh~n this time came, however, he was 
not promoted because a senior KGB official held against 
him his_ illegal _use ~f _ _KQ_B_ gr,,~-~.11!.e_nt~_~o.v~r_Jr~~!m_~nt for 
gonorrhca---rn-i-g-54. NOSE~KO therefore remained a senior 
lieutenant un-fil 1959, when he would have been eligible 
for promotion to the rank of ~ajor had he received his 
captaincy on schedule. Al though GRIBANOV had promised NO-. 
SENKO that he would be promoted directly from sE-q!or·ueu­
tenant to major, skipping the rank of captain, an adm!hi­
strative error was made by the KGB Personnel Office, and 
NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in~ 
stead been pro~otcd only to captain. Instead of rectifying 
this mistake, GRI~O\" persuaded NOSE~'KO that lt would be 
to his ad,rantage to remain a captain until he became eligible 
for promotion to lieutenant ·colonel in ·u,63. NOSE?.KO ttiere.;. 
fore was a captain from September or October 1959 until 
October 1963 wh~n·; as promised by GRIBA."iOV, be was promoted
