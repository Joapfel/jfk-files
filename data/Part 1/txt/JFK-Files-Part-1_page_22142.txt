they had been observed tail.ing notes. If p.::rI!litt.ed, they 
could be arrested in Rostov before th~y ~ook th~ return

sibilities existed and ir.structed the two reprcsentat.ivos 
of the American Department to writ"? a rc?ort 011 this. He 
also told them to !"cquest permission to arrest and search 
the military attac~~s. • 
GRIBA~OV then ~sked what pertinent infor~atio~ was held 
by the Tourist Department. Ho was told that there were re­
latively few Ar!erican tourists in the Soviet Union at that 
time;• these included BArtGHOOR.~, who was ~entloned to GRI­
BAXOV along with one other (name not- recalled) .. NOSENKO and 
KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KGB had no "strong" 
materials against them. They were ordered to make an im­
mediate study of the situation and to report back to GRI­
BANOV as soon as_possible. 
Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSEXKO and 
KOVALENKO gathered the entire American Tourist Section in 
their office. ln a general discussion, it was decided that 
BARGHOORN was the only American on wh0m the KGB had anything 
worth consideration.·. All the materiiHs or. BARGHOOR.'{ were 
gathered together, and 1-.0SENKO and KO\.ALE!.1CO took them to 
GRIBANOV, exrlaining that he was the only possibility. 
GRIBANOV read all the material~ and was pleased with them; 
he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with American 
Intelligence. He then asked what could be done. NOSE~KO 
and KOVALENKO reported th:.\t BARGHOORN was then in Tbilisi 
and that, in fact, Ye.N. NOSKOV (case officer, A!llerican 
Tourist Section) was in Tbilisi with a wo~an doctor from 
the KGB Operational Technical Directorate for the purpose 
of wol'king against DAP.GUOORN; the doctor had so:ne special 
item which had been usc-d to make BARGI!OOR.~ so violently sick 
to bis stooach that he had to be hospitalized. ll'bile be 
was in the hospital, a careful search had been oade of bis 
belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been 
found. In addition, a KGB agent was placed in DARGIIOORN's 
room as· a patient; he made anti.:'soviet statements and offered 
BARGHOORN "materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the 
bait. At the time of this meeting with GRIBANOV, BARGHOORN 
was scheduled to fly from Tbilisi to Mosc·ow the following 
morning, and the KGB knew from a phone tap that be had no 
appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the Britisb Embassy 
at the Hotel Metropol the follo-.ving evening. 
It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving 
"materials" to BARGHOORN. in.Moscow •. NOSENKO said that this 
would be a provocation, but GRIBA..~OV replied that this made 
DO difference to him. , He instructed NOSENKO and KOVALEIUCO
