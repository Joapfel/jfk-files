that it Is not advisable to have one prtnctpal ngent connected with as 
many operartons as ts GERENDE. However, the present scarcity ot 
both staff and coruract agents of the prlnctpal agent rype neceasl:ate 
such efftclency measures. Every e!fort 1s bctng made to compartment 
the various segments of GERENDE's operattons and to decrease, and

c. Securt~ Problems - The c.ost sertous securtty s1tuatlon 
surround\ng GE ENDE and hla many activtrtcs ts rhe fact that 
LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the L!P~TICK Team members arrested 
tn the jW1e 1958 flap) know GERENDE by true name, end knew that be 
also worked for KUDARl<, In iact, LIPSllCK-30 ts a close personal 
friend of GERENDE'a and was origin.ally recommended for KUBARK 
employment by GERENDE. The operational security hypothesie that 
can be constructed from these existing acquatntanccs are too numerou.a 
to ltst tn thts brtef review; suffice to say that should GERENDE be 
arrested by one of the local police a;;enctes, most of the remalning 
support aaaets would be delitroyed or so seriously compromised that 
the Statton would lndeed be foolish to contlnue ustnsz: them. It ta 
appropriate to state here, however, that nelther GE.RENDE nor the 
Statton believes that GERENDE has yet been named or ocherwtse 
tdemUted as a result of the LIPSflCK flap. It ls granted though that 
any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro­
mised LIPSnCKERS represents a conttnutng type of danger for GER ENDE. 
Based on the duttes which GERENDE ts currently performing, the readers 
of thls revtew can well lmagtne what the consequences to several operat1ons
