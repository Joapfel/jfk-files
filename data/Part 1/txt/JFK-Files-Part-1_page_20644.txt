Commendation 
1. ·The Dominican Republic Station has distinguished itself by 
especially meritorious service.during the past year and has made 
• a• major c_ontribution toward the advancement of the wjective11 of. 
the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago 
the people of the Dominican Republic were !acing a dismal future. 
T1:1d~,Y; while t~e· future remains uncertain, the prospects for even­
tual stability have· been immeasurably increased. Several Depart­
ments and Agencies of the United. States Government engaged in an 
effort to ·bri~g this about. I believe that the role oi the CIA in the 
Dominican ~epublic during the past year was a crucial one, The 
·highly _e!fect_ive performance of the Santo Domingo Station and the, 
Base at _Santiag<> was the r.P.sult of the combined (!!forts of each _offi­
cer and empl.oyee stationed the.re.. These men and women gave un­
sparingly of their time, enc·rgy and.brain power. Their efforts 
were sustaine.d over a long period under strrssful circumstances. 
Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile-
-. , ,atone has been reache·d arid it is most appropriate at this time to 
grant this special recognition for a job well done to·all members 
of the CIA team in the Dominican Republic during the year ending 
June 30, 1966. 
2. I ·should like to commend each member o( the Station who 
contributed to this no~eworthy performance and request that a copy 
of tr.is commendation be placed in indh•idual personnel !iles asap­
propriate.
