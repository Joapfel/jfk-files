this load, but even this was of value to the trainees. One trainee 
"·as required to mako a pretext telephone call, another team of two 
made a noi'ghborhood chock, and tho remainder were di\·iclcd into teams 
to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, tho Social Security 
Institute n1\d tho )letrop~li tan Police. Except for the last team, 
all picked up some information of valUl', and the information and 
its significance in tern-.s of the projected investigation of PEREZ 
was diecussod with them. 
5. Tho performance of tho class as a whole 'l\·as rcmarkahly 
good. Tho three DJo"S mcn, .. •bt•causc of theh· previous training and 
experience, w•re nblo to nbsorb and understand the lectures and 
reading. material much more quickly than tho others. Nono of the 
others had any previous trnining or experience in intelligence or 
security work .. However, .they were keenly interested, actively 
~articipated in cla~srou~discussions and field exercis~s, and all 
prepared their written work in an acceptable manner. The instructor 
reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans fur meetings, 
etc., and this prov~d most helpful. Somewhat unusual for Latins, 
all students wore punctual; there were somo vP.ry sm,\ll and unimpor­
tant dolays, but for the most part these wore due to tho exceedingly 
difficult traffic situ'ation in Mexico City or to other reasons 
apparently beyond their control. No student was absent from clBsses 
during the ontiro·training period, and no student was late !or 
more than 45 minutes 01· nn hour, 
6. In summary; tho instructor and the Station fcol that the 
training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although 
~ot yet experienced operators; have a sufficient enoush understanding 
of the basic traclccrnft 1n·incJples and techniques to permit th3rn to 
begin operations, They are all intelligent and nlort men, and 
except for LOPEZ y LOPEZ all have an Army background. CIIANTRES is 
quite lmaginativo and resourceful, but. also quite c:i.utious and 
concerned about the possibiUty of flnps and co:,promises. He gets 
along well w!th all hls fellow workers, and undoubtedly has real 
leaderf,hlp qualities. TREJO is somewhat talkative, opinionated and 
argumentative, and may have trouble st1pcrvising others, but he, 
too, demonstrated considerable imagination and 1·csourcefulness. 
GARZA, the youn"'cst oJ tho Army group, .lppeared to be the most pro­
American, is very imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and 
energy. On one occasion he had tho instructor out to lunch at his 
home, where he lives with his wife (thoy have no ~hildren). He 
commented on numerous occasioras about Ids many (almost annual) 
shopping trips to ~an Antonio, whe\'C hi!:, wife hns n numbor of close 
relatives, GARZA, it is believed, would probably be the most 
susceptible to development and possiµle recruitment of the group. 
7. Except for the remarks in p:n·agraph 6 above. no individual 
:i.ssessnwnl will ho forwarded herewith. The instructo1· has prepared 
a memorandum on each man, including the DFS group, setting forth 
his observ:i.~ions and opinions, as well as any information he was 
able to obtain cin the trainees. 
8. MYLECHRAINE used the name "Sr. Tomas" with the trainees; 
so far as is known they cl.id not learn his true name, nor were they 
aware where he was living in Mexico City. Likewise, they are not 
aware that he has served previously in Mexico. There were no 
incidents involving security during the training period, and no 
other incidents or events that should be reported.
