(paying off a loan o!.>tained to build their house). The co~plic~ting 
factor is tha unccrtaihly of G:::rn.,mE's future t.rith nvr..uc;~. The 
Station has maintained for so:ne_ ti1.,e. that it is impossible to 
continue to pay GCT.;c.:·mE his full snlary solely torun th') LICALLl'I. 
and LILYRIC basehouscs. Now that Fl-:lL,ALlJ has absorbed this duty 
with only small inconvenience and ao:;ie loss of timelfuc-ss, it !llakcs 
even less sense to put GER:::..I\Dl: to work only to do this. GF.IU:l-IDE 
has long been aware of_ tho Station's thinkint: in this rc~:u·d, and 
prior to tho current peroonal cl'isis he had been told th:! t he 
would ha\'e to work harder :it a o·eater variety of tasJ:s in order 
to retain his position. As Head(Jun.rters is ::n.-a.re, ho h~d Leen 
given n<1ditioni\l tasks, and, an reported in reference, he had begun 
to rospo11cl very well. There bas never been any question of Gi:I?~ffiE's 
ability. As we have previously stated, bo is personable, intelliccnt, 
_bilingual and binationnl, and has had good training ancl experience 
in certain fields. On tbq. other hand, there h:is lone IJec-n doubt 
.,about his seriousness of purp6se, his initiative, and his ambition. 
-Tho,- "reversal of roles" which he describes in ono of the attached 
:i;mcmos, which took place when ho was confined to bis hoi:e ao an 
"LP -keeper, did 1:iorc than cau::.e domestic proble~s -- it 2.pµn1·ently 
·deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-<lesor\·ed 
reputation for boing lnzy was oarncd years aco. 
6. The question which must be answered is whether or 
not to tcrninatc G.1:.,''U-,"NDB. l!e can be useful to. tho Station, but 
the .Jtation has. lea.rued to get along without hir:i. What are the 
security hazards invol\'cd? Tho ccncral ranee of his knc,';l'lcdgc is 
described in paragraph 5 of reference. If all of this tlerc blown, 
the loss to tho Station, particularly in terms of support operations 
against;f the l411HARSH tareet, \iouJ.cl be considerable. The Station 
. _,docs ·not believe that G:c:JtElIDE would deliberately expose any of this, 
.· -:/4J?_ut'. :tt. is impossible to predict what LIE1PTY-19 micht do, particularly 
~~ince she v,ould feel that she had nothing to lose, ha.vi~ nlrea.dy 
_ /lost a possible source of income through the termination. GimD-.'DE's 
tcrinina.tion bonus would probably be 'in tho neighborhood of t~o 
thousand dollars. Prci:;umably LIEill'TY-19. is aware of the fact that 
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has ne,·er discussed 
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus betwce~ the 
two of them has never been aentioned. 
LICALLA 
7. The LICALL.A basehouse continues to fuuction without changes, 
except for the fact that Bruce H. FE?.NALD has been meeting LIE1-1PTY-9 
since 9 December 1969. -Brief meetings with LIE:'.lPTY,;.9 al'E! held once 
. a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away frO:!l the MHR..\RSH 
area). - Occasionally special oeetings are called, by_phone, by 
FERNALD, if special cov~rage .. is dcsire_d (as in the AESL\SICK case, 
for exattple). Thero have been no problems, operational or personal, 
involving the basehruse or"LIE!t!P'l'Y-9 during the reportiri& period. 
LI.E.\IPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporti:!g period, 
and -in addition to his regular repor-ting on observed ac~ivities of-
. .IIHIIARSH pers~nriel, he provid¢d special coverage as requested. This 
"s~cial coverage" consists of his observations of a- selected 
individual _;_ who· does he spend. his time with, how _is he boh:1\'ing, 
when wa.s he present (or absent), etc. i.IE:.IP'n"-9 spends over 40
