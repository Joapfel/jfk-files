We do not conaider it practicable at this tin1e to suggest the 
number or qualificatic::is of supporting staff oHicers for this 
Assistant. We feel, however. that he will need a group 0£ such 
officers and that they should be of particularly high caliber and 
broad experience. The functions we visualize· for this office are 
highly important £or the community and !or CIA. They have not 
been adequately band.led in the past. The Assistant should be given 
whatever stall tho full development of his role may later require. 
Mr. Coyne does not concur in this recommendation. He dis­
agrees with (a) tho proposed organizational placement and title of 
the recommended office, because this would peTpetuate tho present 
ineffective arrangement of the Coordination Office now in existence 
and would not provide the recommended office with the stature required 
to ·assist the DCI in fulfilling his heavy responsibilities throughout 
C 
the Intelligence Community; (b) the limitations in the functional 
concepts of the office, as outlined above. Further, he does not con­
cur in this recommendation because it does not distinguish sufficiently 
the internal CIA operating functions of the DDCI from the community-
wide functions which the recommended office must perform if the 
DCI is to execute effectively his principal mission as aesignad in 
the President's Directive of January 16, 1962. Mr. Coyne believes
