My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our 
hor.,i, ·on 27 November, but the evening was not_ meant to am did 
. . . 
not ·afford an opportWlity to discuss the Soviets any .further. 
Subject did tell ~e, however, that he had not gone to the_ 
7 November Soviet r~c.aption arterail, because, despite b7 • 
• . ·~- . . • 
a:ssl.rances that ther-tFwas no reason tor hiiD not to go, he 
felt it was simply safer to stay aWc;ly fDmL the Soviet Enbasq 
altogether.- At my suggestion, we agreed to get together ror­
lunch_sometime in the near future. 
. 14. For various reasons, including the p•.>or state or 
Subject's health when r called him one day in January,· we did 
. not get together tor the lunch until· 7 March. This time, I 
played it .straight with Subject, told him that __ I- was interested 
in anything he could tell me about GAiIYEV a:id the otherSoviet • 
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details. 
Subject was complet'ely coop~rative, and I am satistted he answered 
my questions to the· best·o1' his ability. It see121ed to me, and 
still does, that there was only one ~ossible reason ldty S11~ject 
had not told me ori ll July what he sub~~que.ntiy told me on 
'l November (l.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home,twice and . . 
on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that 
he felt sou:ewhat guilty about going to G.\ZIYEV' s and meeting 
the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too 
hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt oore comtort.1ble 
ignoring it. The roason he so readily mentionftd the tw visits 
and the other Soviet on l N0vember wao, I think, that he waa 
genuinely eoncernod not to Rgot iuto.ant trouijle" ·with tho U.S.
