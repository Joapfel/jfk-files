aware, as Soviet Bloc counterintelligence guidance demonstrates, 
of the dangers inherent in having disinformation recognized as 
such.) The meetings in Geneva in May 1962 would have made it 
clear to the KGB that CIA had no intentions of meeting BELITSKIY 
inside tl-.e USSR, and, in KGB eyes, the case may have reached the 
point of dilninishing returns. It is perhaps significant that 
NOSENKO did not contact CIA and report on the BELITSKIY case until 
10 days after BELITSKIY's series of meetings with CIA in Geneva 
had been completed, which would have given the KGB time for final 
appraisal of the operation"s potential. 
NOS~KO's account of his own role in this operation appears 
to have be~n false, and nothing in the available evidence would 
preclude .!:o•:ict sacrifice of ~his already tired operation. Since 
NOSENKO pro·✓ 1.ded some inside details of a sensitive KCB operation 
which could have been kno-..rn to only a few, it is difficult t.o 
find any other explanation of NOSENKO's access to.this information 
except that the KGB briefed him about it.
