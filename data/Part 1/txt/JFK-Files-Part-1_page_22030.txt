They didn't tell us.

them: this-is the work of the FCC.

NOSENKO: 
About one week, not more than o~e week counting 
travel time. 
How did KOSOLAPOV travel to Helsinki? 
By train, both ways. 
Was he alone on the way down or did someone go with 
him? 
He was alone. 
How did you arrange for "SOL~STKAq to board the 
right train? 
GRYAZNOV sent "SOLISTKA" alone to, Vyborg and had the 
local KGB, office'rs there meet her and place her on 
the correct train. They knew the date and would 
establish the fact that KOSOLAPOV was on that train 
before placing her aboard ...
