3. Remarks 
NOSE.~KO' s errors concern in~ "A~DREY" !particular?\· his early 
insistence that "A:-;IJREY" had lt>ft ~lo~ccw years before SOSE~i:O en­
tered the KGB) ~ake i~ i~possible th~t ~OSESKO could ha~e learned 
of the case in the "'ay h~ late1 sdid he did. 
~OSESY.O's acccunts of how he learned cf the "Paris agent".·are 
vague and vary with each telli:lg; they also de~end ~ca-.·ily on coin­
cidence. It is note~~rthy too that he clai,ed to have been t~ld of 
this one operation by no less th~n four indiv:dcals, ~hereas the 
Test of ~hat he learned of First Chief Directorate oper3tions in 
eleven years of KG3 service cace fro~ only t~o :::her i:1dividuals. 
FurtJlerll!ore, his k.:.owledse oi "SASHA" stec.::ied £roe: elat.orate a:d 
apparently contrived sourcing ~hich he !1i~self ~as un~ble to recon­
struct ~hen pressed f~r.exact details. ~OS~SKO's in3~ility to 
give any clear and consistent account of hov he heard ~f either the 
'Paris agen-:" or "S,\SliA" :nust be judged i.1 t:-ic li~::t of the fact that 
he first he~rd of bQth cases only just after pro~isi~i :o collect 
such infor~ation for CIA. because these ~ere a~c~g the ~ost i~por­
tant and the cost fortuitous ite~s he eyer pickeJ up, it coul~ 
reasonably be expected that he ~ccld re~e~ber hew he did ~o, espe­
cially since only a little over a year elapsed ~~til his next 
eeeting ~ith CIA. • 
NOSESKO's sourcing for the nd at§¥.JA lea,}s seems 
illogical and fabricated. It also a~pears that :-.u~E\iO has given an 
inaccurate version of th~ ~ay in '-hi~h he would have lear~~d of 
:not an Illegal a~ SOSESKO inJicated, but an agent).
