Moscow and that KOSOLAPOV planned _to strike up an acquaintance 
with the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow. 
The American Embassy code clerk referred to above was 
undoubtedly~Jolm GARLAND) and .the train manifest list_s\fohn GARLAN~i 
and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passe:ngers on the 
same train from Helsinki to Moscow. NOSENKO is aware of the 
identity of \John GARLAND but claims no knowledge of the above trip 
'--- ,- . 
of KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, although being well aware of a previous trip. 
NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of the First Section specifically 
charged with work against code clerks, should have been aware of the 
November 1960 trip of KOSOLAPOV to and from Helsinki. His lack of 
knowle_dge may or may not be explainable in terms of his other activities 
such as his trip to Cuba in November-December 1960 but it_cannot be 
interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB since, if 
he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of 
KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as this was an event the 
KGB knew GOLITSYN was aware of.
