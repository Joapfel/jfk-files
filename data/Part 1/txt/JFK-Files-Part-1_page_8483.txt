have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City. 
Subject agreed_and told CHMYKHOV he'rl call him the next time 
he was in town. Due to Subject's tight schedules on h!s visits 
. ' 
to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called 
_CHMYKHOV.· \~'hen Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told 
CHMYKHOV wasn't in. He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved 
to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and; 
sounded very ?leased to hear from him. He stated that he had 
had·a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August), 
but was now swamped with "'°rk. He added that hA had planned to· 
call· Subj~ct as soon as he got ~hings under control. Subject 
' thereupon said that he was actually calling for CHMYKHOV, because 
he. didn't think LOGIJ{OV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied 
• that Cffir.YKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd bo~ very lDUCh like 
to visit Subject in Cuornavaca. Subject said that he'd like,to
