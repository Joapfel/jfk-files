3. cfu'~'.OJ?,d&1·, :4:.I:>ec~mber 1967, the day o.ftei' bis arrival, 
RUIZ o·rdered · tho Ci.tbail-coi:isu-ls .in Barcelona, Sevilla and 
V°£go. to· Madr_i.<1' for:.'i_5iiieeiing. _Th~. order vas couched in terms 
• 'of '"want-ing 't·o .meet" i_bem, but ·&f.ter .their arrival on 
Wednesci~y ~- • 6)~.f~mber, ii'H. _.pai'Hcs settled down to a detailed 
meeting in .. :w~_ich priiliar1,::a~tenHon· was given to admlnlstraUve 
i:latters·, trad_e • and propaganda·. • The latte1 two subjects will 
be dealt wit'b in separate dis·patches. On the administrative 
side, RUJZ listened sympathetically to· complaints about lo" 
salaries, old but~dlz;igs and iruid_equate vper:iting budgets and 
concluded by askin·g for a mon'thi.y report on rece,ipts and 
exp~nses _and 8 report OD .thEL cooi:iulc' _ current needs, th':'ir 
monthly balances· and their administrative activities. The 
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense 
that kept recurring throughout the discussions. 
4. Dy the end ~f th~ week, RUIZ had prepared a report 
·on tbc situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission 
in.general for forwarding to Havana and which be first 
discussed with his subordinates. He started by assuring 
them that be had ."found great co-o~ra t ion among a 11 the 
comrades in tbis mission" and declilred that the staff was 
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make oo personnel 
changes and Hector .GALLO Portieies, who had previously been 
most·
0
eager to return· PCS ·to Havana, now has gorJe to l~vana 
on vacat:l:on. He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia 
f lig'bt. 
5. The Cuban· mission has 'certain fionncial problems 
since tho pfeserit budget dates ;from previous yer~·s &.nd does 
not cover.current expenses. However, the "new economic 
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist wlth the 
pro!Jlem. Here RUIZ is presumably referring to tbe pressure 
brought to bear in November. 1967 _by Cuban sympathizers in 
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and 
the Immigration.Qffice to forceCuban exiles to register 
with the Cuban consuiate and ·pay the $22.50 fee for a valid 
passport. Enough exiles have respom!ed to this pressure to 
relieve :Jome of the financial problems of the Cuban mission .. 
This source of income will lastlas long as the Cubans' friends 
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist them. 
6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the 
airport and the handlini;. of Embassy pouches poses a 
continuing adcinistrative problem for the Embassy, Joso. 
DIAZ Puga, who i~ in charge of this airport work has to 
devote himself exclusivt11y to takiru~ care of the couriers 
and their pouches· when any corae in, leaving visitors to fend 
fol' themselves.· This situation bas been .lllleviated by 
other Embassy staff mel:!bors jaunting out to the airport at 
will to 15ect the incoi::iing planes. Nou, RUIZ. has declared 
that th·c rest of the sta:ff must' stay in tht, Embassy because 
thoy have a work plan to fulfill. Thus, he has. ieft himseli' 
with an u u-~olved problem he !!lust fllce in the very near
