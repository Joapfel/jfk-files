exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a. 
"bona fide" defector. 
There is. not an accurate standard or scale of measurement 
~gainst which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or • 
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For 
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas 
considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to 
whe~her this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it 
· is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other 
sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader. 
to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers 
appropriate,
