50. Simila~ly, all that io known about AHFAUNA-l'a backs~ound 
comes from AMFAUNA-l'a own otatemanta ombodied in his PRQ Part I. No, 
confirmation of this information has ever beon obtained. From this 
puint of view there is no guarantee that AMFAUNA-1 io what he claims 
to be. For &11 the proof to the contrary available to JMWAVE, h~ 
r~~uld as ea.oily have been alspanishj Communist as a member of the 
~anioh Falange_J ~q q 
51. These points ax"e listed for the "i'al<e of ccmpleteneso • but cl 
li ttlo~limportance is attached to their. Th-, known fact that (g,i.JANTUM-6~ 
and{QUANTUM-52 J:onsider AMFAUNA-1 reliabln suggests that he at least 
was not a (§panishJCommun::lot. And an unusu.i.lly extonsive independont 
view has11 been obtained. of AMFAUNA-1' s oper-otions through th• raportm 
and debriefings of eight of his egonts who have either eocared to or 
are ii, communication wi tlu the United Statft'l',. The defection. gf .. , , .,. 
·, Identi ty-lij, and the escape and debriefini;:::. of Identi ty-19" • ·tdentity-23, 
Iden ti ty-26, and Identi ty-29'," have all cor.~'irmed parts of ftJ'.FAUNA-l' s 
, 1 story. Finallyi AMCOG-3 has reported by :~,·w that AMCOG-2 it. inc~ontaot 
.' with A.HFAUNA-1, and AMFAUNA-2't1 telephone converoations with AMCUTLER-:i) 
provide a continuing check on the safety ,i:1d whereabouts of P,MFAUNA-l.a/ 
52, For the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discnunted 
that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught and doubled by th~ G-2 since his urrivsl 
in Cuba. Additional indications that all ie still well are the fact 
that he n~ver omits the safety signal that was given him for use in hia 
S/W, that his operational activities are consistent with his cha~acter 
and background, and that the reporting of his agents is consiote~t with 
their access to infor·mation. 
53. Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and 
~hether the G-2 could doYble him if they do catch him, are two 
questions remaining to be considered. Taking the second question firE1t, 
it is believed that the chances of the G-2 running a succ~ssful CI 
operation against KUBARK through AMFAUNA-1 are extremely slim. To be 
sure O the G-2 has certP.in weapons tha t-Ji;they could use a·gainst AMFAUNA-1. 
His father is already l!n prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence) and/ 
his mother and two children(are still in Cuba a~ potential hostages.)d5 
It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-l's own interest 
in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK, 
by neglecting to support the insurge11t leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was 
responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference 
to the fate of the Cuban people. This would all take time, however, 
because AMFAUNA-1' s reaction to a1'rest i at .1.east ini tiall4, would o( 
probably be an attempt to~mulate hi~ two h,,roes, AHtUSP-1} a.nd A.'>ftUNG-1.~. 
In the til_:\e that it woul<u take the G-2 to beeak down>lthis resistance, 
AI'~TLER-lJ would almostft!ertainly ha,,e learned, either through his 
phon~lconversations with AMFAUNA-2 oi by the interruption of the same, 
,that something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1. . 
54. The risks that AMFAUNA-1 is now running are believed to be 
~onsiderable. For one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees 
of knowledge of his clandestine operations, have been held temporarily 
or permanently by the G-2, which 1s believed to be increasing in 
competence as a security force. For another, AHFAUNA-1 takes unnecessar• 
chances, as by interrogating a new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in 
the personal automobile of his sister-in-law, or by personally trying 
to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts 
which can be dangerous to him. 
55. AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good. 
It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is aware that this is a potential­
ly serious security weakness, because he'.took the trouble to r~port it 
(see paragraph lSal abovel. T~e AMCOG operation is itself a fairly 
com~lex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch, Th7, asp~cts
