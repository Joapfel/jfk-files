uMVD Leadership, 1953-54: Asked t:> nai,.e the chiefs cf t't,e 
directorates and separate departments of the MVD ur.:ier BERii':.. 
and KRUGLOV, NOSrnKO narned nine out of :a. Hr. was unable to name 
the Chief of the Ir.tollisence Directornte, sayi~q that he re~cm­
bered only SAKHAA0VSKI'i {P,\U\'USHKIN was chief ur.ti:... 1955). ,\.·,keel 
to name KRUGLOV' s deputies, NOSENi<O named only RO:.,~&.SHl<OV a~,.-; 
SEROV, and "'as ignorant of such prominent d<::puties as LUNF.V •:., -~! 
SHATALIN. Told that a Sec1:etary of the Central Committee of :.r:e 
CPSU was one of KRUGLOV' s deputies at this time (SHATALIN), ~:OS­
ENKO flatly denied that this was possible. 
"Organization of KGB: NOSEl~KO did not kr,ow • .. '!-.en the KG!3 was 
organized (March 1954). He said t~at it was in early 1955 or 
late 1954. Told thc:.t he was a ytar off and asked t:o think it 
over, NOSEllKO insisted that he was right. 
"Processing Procedure:s for Employrr,tnt with KGB: t.OSENKO' s 
story about how he was processed fo~ cmplo~men~ w1th the ~GB in 
1953 is ir.consistent with the procedures used at that tiffie. He 
does not kno·• many of the things that he should know about en­
trance proct-dures: he is wrong about many of the things that he 
claims to remember. The disparities are so great that they can­
not be explair.ed (as tlO::iEliKO attempts to do) by the claim that 
KOBULOV's recormiendation resulted iu a simplified entrance pro­
cedure for t:OSEW<O. 
"The most importa."lt docwnent filled out by prospective em­
ployees of Soviet State Security is a detailed personal history 
questionnai~e, called in Russian Ankcta spets:alnoco naznacheniya 
sotrudnika KGB. This exhaustive questionnaire is 16 pag~s long, 
and filling it out is an experience that one is not likely to 
forget. A background investigation is r~~ on the ~sis of this 
questionnaire, which itself becomes a permanent and prominent 
feature of the em;,,loyee' s personnel file. tlOSENKO remembers 
. filling out a questionnaire, but does not know its designation. 
He asserts that it was only 4-6 pages long. He asserts that he 
filled it out at home, and subnitted it in two copies shortly 
before entering on duty. Actually, this questionnaire was re­
quired in or.e copy only, and ~as never permitted to be taken 
home since it was a classified document (ev·en when not filled 
in).* 
"NOSmKO insists that he did not have to take a medical exam­
ination prior to entering the KGB. This is not possible. Such 
an examination was a routine and mandatory part of the processing. 
1 cannot think of any instance in which it would be waived.*• 
• DERYABIN 's views are· based on NOSENKO' s st:!tements in Aug<.Jst 
1965. In his original biographical statement (1962), NOSENKO 
said that no anketa was required. He implied as ~uch in his 
most recent statement in April 1966, after being questioned 
by DERYABIN. • This- statement is given in Part v-. B.
