Captain Jose Ivan Alegrette. ·A-l confirmed that be bad held 
a meeting with Alegrette 16 November. During the course of 
the meeting Alegrette had proposed to purchase th~ ·remaining 
AIIWORLD arms currently located in Nicaragua. A-1 refused 
to discuss the matter with Alegrette and told bimthey were 
not for sale. He assured the undersigned that KUBARK need 
aot worry about the arms falling into Alegrette's or anyone 
elaes bands. Alegrette also ofiered to put A-1 in contact 
with Roberto Alejos Arzu, Guatemalan ~illionaire and a 
coastant plotter against the regime of· Peral ta. A-1 met • 
Alejos the following day and the details of the meeting are 
outlined below. ln any case, A-1 assured the undersigned 
tllat the arms in bis possession are currently hi~ea in the 
basement of two houses located in Managua and '.Bluefielcfs<. •
