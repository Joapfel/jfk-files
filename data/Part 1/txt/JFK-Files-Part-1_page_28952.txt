WHER~ ~TWAS NECESS~RY hE CE IDENTIFIED AS THE REFijESENTATIVE OF THE 
cos. IT WOULD u( 60TH IMPOSSIBLE ANO COUNTER-PRJutlCTIV[ IN 
SCHWICKRATH1 S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HICE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION 
WI TH KU BARK. 
. 6. DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR. SCHWICKRATH HAS ACQUIRED IN• 
CREASING SKILL ANO FAMILIARI.TY IN THE INTRICACIES OF1 K.UBARK STAFF 
WORK, _BOTH AT THE.-INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGA·HISSION LEVEL. 
THIS ·1s A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS HERETOFORE BEEN 
KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER. SCHWICKRATH HAS PER• 
FORMED THESE NEW DUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY 
FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COl'tlANOER OF THE U.S. MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH 
WAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESENTATIVE IN A RECENT CONF-ERENCE CONVOKED 
BY CINCPAC IN ilAWAII TO RECOMMEND PROCEDURES FOR IHPLEMENTATION OF 
A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF 
CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO HACV. SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON• 
FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS 
FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS 
RELATIONSHIPS ~ETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND HACV •. 
7. I "HI\VE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE 
MEMBER O( OUR STAFF WfTH AN INOIS~ENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE ANb 
BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM ANO ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUERRILLA WARFARE. IT IS A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING 
HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATION.
