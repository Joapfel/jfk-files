GOLITSYN ~as in the office, the Chief of the American De~ 
partment ordered ell personnel present to search.for th~se 
papers, and all the KGD officers senrched again thro~~h • 
their files, without success. GOLITSYN no:ed a larg~·num­
ber of reports with red stripes ncross their covers, indi- -
eating that they were the property of the Operational Tech­
nical Directorate, The only office in the U.S. Embassy that 
GOLITSYN recalled being mentioned in connection with this 
search was.that of the Minister Couosell?r.~ 
No technical investigations were undertaken as a result 
~-it 1of GOLITSYN's informat:!.on, and :-;o it was largely 011 the basis 
~~.of NOSENK0°g reports that Americll.n technicians inspected the 
cha~co~y building for the presence of ralcrophones 1n the 
spring of l96·L The: rcsul ts have been de sci· it>cd in the 
dama~e report subm;.tted bv the USIB Secu1•itv Committee on 
7 October 1964: "On 23 ,\pri l 196·1, a low-i~ilpedance dyuamic 
microphone and associated seven-inch probe tube were dis­
covered in the wall behind a radiator in Room 1008 of the 
Chancery of the Ll. S. Embassy in ?tloscow. The chblc to this 
~icrophonc was traced to a maj~r cable run ~hich lay several 
inches under the outside surface of the 0ast face of the 
Chancery. This major cable run consisted of a siugle 
twenty (20) pair and a single thirty (30) pair, lead-sheathed 
audio cable which ran nlong the cast f~ce of the Chancery 
to the roof area of the North Annex of the Embassy. At 
this point, these cables wen:· spliced into 11. one hundred and 
one (101) pair c~ble along with two ten- (10).pair cables, .•. 
A nuober of vertical cables were found to run from the ten, 
twenty, and thirty pair cables to the various microphone 
installations. Fifty (50) microphones h:1'.'l• been i;o::;itively 
identified.«* Two (2) microphones not physically located 
,:,on 28 .January 1965 NOSE~•nm volunteered an account of the 
loss of one of the interce~t reoorts which the U.S. Embassy 
Section bad received from the Second Special Department oi 
the Operational Technical Dirr.~c:torate '' in 1960 or 1961." 
This docu!llent, accordir,g to NOSENKO, was ·•one of the reports 
1.'.li th {-~1inister Counsellor j ffiEERS dictating"; as a result of 
its loss, "the month of December, the whole month, the U.S. 
Embassy Section was in a turmoil" searching for the document. 
The month-long search and investigation was unsuccessful, 
however, and, in the end, the case waa closed with the con­
clusion that tle document had probably been burned inadver­
tently, ~ithout a record of destruction having b~en dra~n up. 
Xn this account NOSENKO appears to date the incident in Decem~ 
ber 1960, which approximat0s GOLITSYN's secund series of 
visits to the U.S. Embassy Section (and duplicated GOLITSDi's 
ex-x-oneous estimate of when these visits took place). NOSE~lrO 
bas never reported that GOLITST-1' was present in the officea 
cf the U.S. Embassy Section during the sesu-ch for this docu­
ment ancl, in fQct, has denied that GOLITSYN visited the section
