ment in June 1955. NOSENKO kn~w nothinq of FEiCHLIN's i • 
background. -~ I • 
Other sourcc5 have reported that FELCifLIN visited the 
USSR as a merchant seaman and a diplomatic courif;!r before 
arriving in July 1953 as Army Attache. He served: in the 
latter capacity for one year, until July 1954, wh~n he was 
asked to lea·.;€! the count.ry. (l!e had previously serv~d in 
Austria and West Gerr.:any anJ h?.d been in official, contact 
with known GRU officer~ at both posts, as well as in the 
Uni.ted States.) Durin9 his entire tour in Moscow lie w:is 
the subject of intensive KGB i~terest. Shortly ~fter his 
arrival, in September 1953, FELCHLIN, with fellow Assistant 
Arny At tac he Martin ,'J. MANHOFF, i.rnd two Air Force at tac hes 
took a train trip to Siberia, the first s~ch trip pernitted 
American attaches in many yeilrs. Six months later, on 
25 March 1954, tha Soviet newspaper Trud carried an article 
saying that FELCl!LlN ci.nd hi::; compani0113hud lost some of 
their "spy docwnents" on the. train. FELCl!LI~J said this 
charge was false. On anothar cc~asion, while travelling 
with a British Military Attv.chc, FELCIILIN retl!rn2d to his 
train compartment to find a scantily clad Soviet female in 
his bunk. (NOSU;i:O r,;cc:lls nei-cher of these incidents.) 
In June 1954, while in the co:llp1.:1y of L.i.euten:.:r.t Colonel F.J. 
YEAGER, an Assistant Army Attache, FELC!iLIN was a.:::.:::ested in 
Kiev by a .Soviet l\rmy officer for photogi-.::phirig a military 
target. (NOSEN!-;0 has never mentioned YEAGER' s na::ie; when 
told the name and asked for an identificati0n, ~OSEN~O 
said that he had heard it and that he thought YEAGC:R was 
the Ai.:: Force Attache.) A large crowd gathered and, after 
some jostling, FELCllLIN and YEAGER were taken to a Militia 
station where t!.ey were ordcr"c:d t0 sign a confession. They 
were held eleven hours, and their arrest caused the :. . ..-nerican 
ambassador to deliver a str.ong prutest note. FELCi!LIN was 
told on 3 July 1954 that he had 48 hours to get out of the 
Soviet Union. No specific charges were mentioned. ~!'ijor 
Walter A. McKINNEY, the U.S. Air Attache and one of FELCHLIN's 
travelling companions at the time the "spy notes" were 
a}.legedly lost, was declared persona ~ grata at the same 
time.* 
Queried concerning SHNYRYEV, RICHAP.DS and FELCHLIN 
immediately recognized his photograph and name as one of the 
general chauffeurs assigned to the Office of the Military 
Attache at the Moscow Embassy; RICHARDS was taken on his 
first trip outside Moscow by SP.NYRYEV. He remarked that the 
• Ambassador BOHLEN successfully insisted, ·against initial 
Soviet refusal, that his personal piane be allpwed into the 
USSR to fly FELCHLIN and McKINNEY out. In February 1965 
NOSENKO was asked to describe the unusual circumstances 
under which FELCHLIN left. NOSENKO said he could not, in­
asmuch as he was no longer in the American Department at 
the time. Told that the expulsion took place in 1954, 
NOSENKO said this was not the correct date.
