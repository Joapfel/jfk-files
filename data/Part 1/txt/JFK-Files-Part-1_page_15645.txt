Subject agr:eed· that this, would. t?e. th~ last Joi>. 'T~e7 c~sed the Jc;;int very 
• ca:t-"efuily and then canaiitted the act. The. other feUow appareritly 'threw

Subject's ·place; found ·a ______ , and he was arrested 1 .in his flight, 
to the Spanish border. ,Subject· .was fleeing to the Pyrenees because he 
had learned that his bank deal •partner had ·been arrested and had talked, 
and that the pollce· were after him. Subject voluntarily admits.that he 
loet control over himself and that he had failed to plan, in case he failed 
and had to flee. He had not foreseen or prepared himself fur such a con­
sequence. If he were·to find himself again ln the same situation, he ~ould. 
prepare an escape· even .if 1t· were only netessary for the satisfactory 
planning oJ ,ttie project. 
39. However:,_ the question which arises in this exami'ner's m1nd is 
why SUbJect panicked in his flight. It could have b_een that he un . 
consciously·wanted to.get caught and to be punished In- order to relieve 
his tu1lt. ..If this is. so,. then :mport,ant constderation should be given 
to this as·pect of Subject's persoruil1 ty ·as regards planning the project.
