3. On 2 G September AM,:LOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 15 00 to 1830 
a~~ A.MCLOCK/1 appeaced to be in good health and rested and in 
high spirits. He was very 9lad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able 
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions 
in PBRUM.EN but does not seem to be affocted by it or by t.h,e fact that 
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed 
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the 
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to rmr.ain in New York until December 
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look 
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks 
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to 
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise 
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second tnoughts 
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy. 
4. AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed 
because he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation 
addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He 
destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN 
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals 
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had 
nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for 
his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press 
l 
the issue. Instead he was given th_§_Q~ational numbers of the Beekman 
site and of the Base in New York {'Iden UJ __ _ci_nd to~9 __ h~~~ld always-~.!_~~­

-~ 1 t.o call Washington at_ a later day if he had not been contacted. 
5. AMCI...OCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and 
has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by 
the A."ITHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see 
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri­
vately thought he would defect rather than return to P~UMEN to live. 
During th1a time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent 
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However, 
by mid 1967 che special privileges and invitations were gradually 
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer 
allo"wed ,to take his private car to a government garage for repairs 
11nd he had to arrange for therra.intenance of his house, which was given 
to him and. k,~pt up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes 
that t.hia 'was due to his being under "observation" while going through 
a reorientat1on period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing 
to indicate that A.MCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again ~-~.;ffi_\)Strong
