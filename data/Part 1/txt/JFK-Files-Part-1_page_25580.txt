G. In line with the abovi: reasonin~, GER.E:?-Dr. was introduced 
to Andre~ R. DOSCHER on 17 February 196R. The idea was that 
GER~:NDE would be trained to assist OOSCHt11 in SOMO of his 
operations against Central A..~erican tarcets. Gi-:RJ:!iDP.'s. principal 
duty thus fa_r has been to ta,e ovnr tho handling of J,;nFAIN-3, 
under D03Ci1ER's close supervision and guidance. GER.r..'NDE has 
perfonicd quite creditably in thiR task. He seems interested 
in·the irork and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an 
apparcbtly in~raincd habit o! procrastin~tiou ha~ rcs~lted in 
dilatory reporting. If GJ::nt!iDE can overcome this (and both caso 
officers arc working hard to teach GJ-:RF.NDE the 11::portance of 
pr~m-pt and complete reportin;) there seems to be ·every reason 
to believe GI-JtENDE will de,·elop into a competent accnt handler. 
7. GERENDE·was also ghen the task of locatincr and developing 
(in alias) a ITirl who, por LI.ENVOY, was being cultivated by 
AERODJ:."h'T. Although Gl-:RENDE had to be continually reminded of the 
assi~cent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and 
gaining her confidence. It is quite lilcely that he cQuld have 
recruited tho girl as an access agent against A£J:ODENT, but as 
this point was reached another operation against _AERODENT was 
launched and it was not felt that atte.mpting to recruit the girl 
would serve any useful purpose, for tho time being at least 
(among other U1ings, there was no indication that she bad had 
l any contact .with AERODENT for some months). The only flaw in 
·1 GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to cet aro·und :to 
.j doing the job. It should be 111entioned, however, that at the 
• same time GER.ENDE had a.number of pressing personal·matters to
