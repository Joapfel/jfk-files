in tho opon lotter was not only n blund~r on the pl\rt of 
Amba$Rndor 1-'Jlf:F.MAN, but also in.,licative of the superiority 
• complex of ·tho Unltcd States. At one point, w,hcn \"a'lontiil 
LOGINOV ·hnd Joined in th~ d.!scussion, the undersig~o:d retorted 
•• ,. that tho mriif who had writ.ten tho article wns· :i fourlh-class •• 
wiitl'r ~ithout a dil'lle -irho somehow h11,<l fo~~d th~: i~o\l_sands. of·,,. 
pesos _noco.s-sn_ry to pince his ~Horial. - When th.:f CzecJl and -
t'1u<Rt1ssinri ln.ughed, the undersign~cl :coritt11ue~ th••t· U the, 
Soviet Unio-11 w:i,nted· to give l!l6ney tCJ th_~. Mexican C.ol'lll1'u·nist 
Party to-oni;rnge in·such shennnignns to amuse the local iaembel'S 
. of socialist c,ountries, it was fine• with the Americiins, as 
this is just ilbout nll it could tiope to nchieve. SVESTKA 
nnd LOGINOV naturally de~ied·t'hat their countries had anything 
to do· with tho Mexican Conu:mnist Party,· not to spenk of thEt 
: . ov.ert let tor on the Ambassad~r. The unde~signed; • tongue in 
· .. - cheek,· thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for 
their information that a·eomm.unist Party did exist in Mexico. 
Pt>i,·haps the most int_~resting reaction of SVESTKA came • towards 
the e1:ui of tho ·,party j.ust befOre the undersigned. left. 
During a dis~ussion Which includ~d SVES'I:KA, LOGINOV, one 'of 
the ~oviet military attaches. (a _:tall colonel wit~ white hair), 
another Russ inn, and a:. youngish, shoi•t, and chu~by member of 
the Mexican Foreign Ministry the \lndersigned expressed a 
thou~ht that the two sy~tems of government, the .:apitalist and • 
the soviot, . were graduaUy inching. closer together. • When • • 
SVESTKA allowed i:li!IISC"lf to :.Joubt it with. a nasty little laugh 
the undersignoa ·naturally could not resist telling him to 
hav~ a look at' what was go'ing ~n in his country. The reaction 
of SVESTKA was both immediate· and noticeable. He sort of 
st.rnightened ou~. Jerked his head. b~ck, opened his mouth, 
d~·opp~d tho ·ashes of his cigar on the floor·, and obviously 
- . - bi~ his tongue as he· sf\id •• nothing.· Fro:n the above· and fro111 
/
the.fact that SVESTKA plans to drive to the next consular 
Association meeting· in Guadalajara with his Sovie·t colleagues, 
. the undersigned feels that_SVESTKA is not only a lackey of the 
ex"".NOVOTNY regime, but very probably in the employ oi the 
So.viet KGB. He 'i:i'eems to be inseparable frcim LOGlNOV and has 
lately" mouthed the same provocati_ons in t.he same tecbiliq'1es, 
showing hJ.mseH more and more aggressive, a .tbing wbic_h be 
was not a year ago. •• • • •
