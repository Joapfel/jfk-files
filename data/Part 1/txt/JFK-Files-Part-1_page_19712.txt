effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties 
broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices. 
He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary 
obligations within his Directorate. 
4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to• 
express himself well i~ both written and oral form. His career 
is marked by. steady advancement and consistently high level per­
formances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a seni_or 
Security executiv.e, However, I feel that he has not as yet applied_ 
all of these qualities to thdr maximum potential in his performance 
as DD/PTOS: Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chic£ who is extra­
ordinarily capable- and effective in producing. results. Conversely, 
however,• he.presents one·•of the most difficult supervisory problems 
in the 0£1ice because of c·ertain personal characteristics. I don't 
feel, and I believe·thai Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that 
he has yet g~tten on top of this individual as well as he should.. I 
am convinced, however, that he is Iully aware of the problem and 
is working hard to achieve· the proper supervisory balance. I rate 
his performp.nce, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features. 
I have ·complete confidence in Mr. 0' Connell's ability, judgment and 
excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the 
Agency, • 
S. • Mi·. O'Connell has seen this Fitnt-ss Report.
