ACTION. REQUIRED: None, FYI only. 
1. During the'.undersigned's most recent meeting with 
AMMUG-1, the agent stated that a Mr. Rex M. Gr 1 ff 1 n, an 
investigator of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
.(INS) had visited him on 13 April 1971. According to AMMUG-1, 
the purpose of Griffin's visit wa·s to inquire into AMMUG-1 's 
present welfare and_ to determine his relationship to 
Mr. R o d i n o. (COMMENT: Mr. Rodino· is the sponsor of 
11;R. #2076 which will expedite AMMUG-l's application for U.S. 
citizenship by waiving the standard waiting period.) When asked 
about his relationship with Mr. fiodino, AMMUG-1 simply explained 
that Mr. Rodino was a friend of hl.s .from Washington. 
_ 2. Griffin explained that the reason that he wanted to 
talk to AMMUG-1 pen:;ona.lly, was the fact that nearly all of the 
information surrounding AMMUG-1 was held :Ln JNSs office in 
Washington. He added that the information that was held by the 
Miami office was closely held and access to the files was 
severely restricted. During his visit, Griffin asked AMMUG-1 if 
he noticed any unusual interest in his comings and goings, to 
which AMMUG-1 replied negatively. 
J. In view of above, believe it reasonable to assume that 
Griffin suspects that JKLANCE is somehow involved with AM.MUG-1. 
This position is conc~rred in by Statton Officer who maintains 
liaison with the Miami office of the INS. ' 
4. AM~ruG-1 characterized Mr. Griffin's visit as being 
very pleasant and commented that he was "muy ar,,abl_e". In sum, 
there does not appear to b~ any need for intervention on 
AMM-;JG-l's behalf or on that of the Station. If the need does 
arise, we will promptly. inform Hea~quarters.
