a. It could be shown that there was a similarity 
between the NPD and· th·e Nationai Socialist German Workers 
Party_ (NSDAP) which has been ou-t'law.ed. 
b~ It.could.be argued that the goals, and parts of 
.•· .. _-~he· party pl'atform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin• 
• :'c iples of a· free democratic state. 
The study concludes that-a su!Uciently strong c·ase could be pre­
sented t·o prevent the .case be.fog thr~n out by the courts without 
a hearing •. 
4. The ~tudy lists the foflowing points which the NPD could 
be expected ·t~·use tn its d~fense: 
a~ The pnrty_could prove·that it bas given firm instru~: 
[t.~ons to its members not to engage in rowdyi~m. ~r '!io_le_ii~~ 
b. It could show that a sizeable number of former 
NSDAP meP1bers have been forced out of the party as part 
of the Selbstreinigung (se.lf-cleaning) ?rocess. 
c. It could point out many features of its program 
which are in. accord with democratic pribciples. 
d. It could show that its elected representatives 
have worked with other p~rties and have not-disrupted the 
Lalid-fage. (state diets) and othar ·elected bodies in which 
they partlclpate. 
e. It could point out that other pblitical par.ties 
hav·e many ex-Nazis and ex-communists as. members and could 
claim.that the maJority of the 28,000 NPD inembers are not 
. opposed to the concept or the Federal Republic. 
f. It would charge that the government's charges were 
one-sided, unfairly presented, and out of date. 
g. It would claim that not all of Professor Ernst 
An rich~ - points were included (n the party plat-
form. ·(Field Comment: Anrich is a formgr university • 
professo~m Darmstadt ~hose proposals were apparently more 
extreme ·than those ·incorporated in the; party platform~) • 
h. It could claim that the increased violence 
(Verrohung) of_ tbe political climate: in W~st Germany is 
the fault of the New Left and not of the NPD.
