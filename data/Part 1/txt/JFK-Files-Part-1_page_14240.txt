this·. dt~s ire to put. Cuba's be·st foot f.orwa-rd is a certain 
har~hnt•ss in_ ·aealing ,_1'1 th the shortcomings of his • · -
collt•:tl{uris and f.ellow Cubans outside the mfssion, calling

3 ... RUIZ's attitude towa1•d n1oney follows logically 
from his desire,that Cub:l's (Jrestige increase and he is 
qtiitc wiliini to ,pend money where it will show. The· 
Embassy's 6 Janqa~y rcc'eption was an expensive affair, 
the Enlbassy .and .Commercial officers take their Spanish 
contacts to the best restaurants, he and his wife pay 
30,000 p~setas (approximately$ 430.00) rent per month 
for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new 
clotlws without hesitation :for the va•rious diplomatic 
functions.· Defore- he. went on home leave on ·a August 1968, 
h~,~as encouraging ~is stafi to rent better apartments 
that would more nearly match their status as diplomats 
and ~is wifo was looking fo~ a different house for them, 
one u·i. th fewer main_tenance headaches and with rooms larg_f:_ ~,,; 
.enough for,ailHt_ll receptions of as many .as 40 people.,, 7 • 
! All uf this is qliite in accord with RUIZ' s own bourgoisa 
~ taslt's,·1•cflcctcd more,thai1 any thing else 1.11 !us great 
. 'Ti1td·est 11_1 clothes an(! in being well dressed. Yet the 
Cuban mission operates on a sliin budget and tl1e salaries 
are not high. Station Madrid has no information on 
whether Cuban mission personnel receive a housing 
allou·:1.nce but assumes they must as otherwise RUIZ, at 
least, could never mgke endi meot. RUIZ earns a gross 
salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses 
including- clothes,· food, medic.:il expenses, education for 
the couple's 5 chil~rcn and perhaps utilities must come 
_from this sum. RUIZ also expects to be able'to invite 
Cuban offici tls transiting Madrid and his S:;Janish and 
foreign contacts· home for lunch or dinner at any time. 
There is no indication that he receives a representation 
allow:rnce yet he will allow his wife to chai·ge nothing 
except the i,ia1 .. 1·ies of two maids to the Embassy and she 
c:111 't economize on food when they arc alone because he 
will ~o ou_t to a restaurant rather than eat rice· anc! ··beans. 
RUIZ is plainly cautious !.11 his dea•Iings w:.th Havana over 
m:>iiey, t:-.ven while wanting to live as well as possible 
in Macfrid.· '!'he difference in the couple's raanncr of 
living between Havana and Madrid must b~ striking s:ince 
RUIZ had ·.- good position in the ~li11istry of Foreign Com·merce 
prior to becoming Charge .d'Affaires and yet his wife told 
Vera, the Embassy secretary and her cl0scst friend, that 
she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like 
to take one back with her if they did not return to Madrid 
after home leave!
