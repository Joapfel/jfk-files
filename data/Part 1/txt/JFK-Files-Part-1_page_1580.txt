for MONCURE, who was apprehensive of Mafia retaliation because 
of his involvement with Itkin. 
6. I have talked to Will Kerbe who is presently the 
case officer in contact for MONCURE. He says that MONCURE 
is in limited law practice and is drawing a pension from 
the Agency as well as a contract for services connected with 
Golitsyn. There is probably nothing in the file which could 
damage MONCURE's security as much of the information 
regarding his association with Itkin has already been exposed. 
The most recent information in the file is a January 1975 
memorandum for the record from Acting Chief, CI, which 
states that John K. Greaney, Assistant General Counsel had . 
learned that Seymour Hersh had learned details of the Itkin-: 
MONCURE relationship.. It would appear that Mr. Greaney is 
the most knowledgeable person in the agency on the legal 
aspects of the Itkin·case and probably maintains his own 
£iles. •
