''NOSEN!<O' s description of the secrecy agree:ner,': thllt he 
signed ·,1hen entering on dut.y wit.h the KGB is c~:T:;>l~tely unlike 
the agreement that was in use at that ticc fer staff r.mployces. 
It may be significant that NOSD,K0's description of tho sec=ecy 
agreesr.er.t he recall3 signing rEs~1lb!es the ~e~rec1 a;r~1.fflents 
that were take~ from a1~nts. 
"NOSD<KO insists that he did not fill c.;t ,,ny other fonr.s, 
questior.naires, or papers when entering the KGa. Actually, there 
were a number of other 1·outine for::,..s that had to be filled out by 
applicants and new employees. 
"Location of ROZ:-iE:NKO's Office: NOS~O says that all his 
entry Frocess1ng was handled by a pe~sonnel officer ~am~d P.OZHE?l­
KO and his staff. He asserts tha~ rt0~1~KO's office, which ~OS­
ENKO visited several times in early 1953, ·,1as 1C1cate<! on the 6th 
floor, 8th entry, auildir.g No. 12. ~zerz~inskiy Street. In fact, 
neither RGZ.~::'.NKO nor anv officers or units of the Personnel De­
partment were located in the 8th er.try.· ':ney vere all (including 
ROZllL.~KO) located on the 6th and 7th floors of the 7th entry of 
Buildir.g No. 12.* 
"Ran~: Asked about hi.s salary vhen he first started to 
work in the KGB, NCSENKO said r.e got a basic salary of 1700 r1ibles 
as a case officer, 500 rubles for his r~nk of lieutenant, plus 
secrecy, langua;e, and lo~gcvity pay. He insisted that this was 
correct, even ..-r.en told that KGB officers ...-ere r.o longer being 
paid for ran~ in March 1953, and said t~at altho;igh he remE::lll.bered 
that there was one year--1954--when they vere not paid for rank, 
he was sure that when he first en~ered on duty he received this 
pay. Salary for rank was taken a.ay from State Security officers 
in Septe~ber 1952 ar.d was not restored until April 1954. 
wpromotion to Senior Lieutena.~t: In giving the chronology 
of his promotion to various military ra~ks, NOS~.KO claimed to 
have been promoted to senior lie;itenant in April.1953, shortly 
after joinir.g the. J<GB. Told that this v~s impossible, and that 
n~ one in the KGB was promoted a~ t~is time, NOS~KO replied that 
he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re­
ceived his promotion at that time. In fact, this is impossible: 
all promotions in the KGB ~ere frozen frcm the tiree B~IYA took 
over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953. 
•visitor's Pass Procedures: In talking about his first visit 
to the K86 to process f~r emplo~~er.t, NOSENKO was unable.to re­
call the proced·.u-es employed by the J<GS Pass Office in issuing 
visitor's passes. Specifically, he ~aintained that the name of 
the interviewer was not indicat~ on the pass. In fact,. the 
name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter­
viewer had full responsibility for ·the visitor while he illas on 
KGB premises. While it is understar.dable that NOSENKO might 
have forgotten the det:ails in•;olved if he had only visited there 
•• a few--times more- than ten years ago, if he vorked. at KGB- Head-

that his staten:ents to DERYABIN were untrue. See Part v.e.
