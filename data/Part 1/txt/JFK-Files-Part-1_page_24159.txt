1. 1D early June of thla year IWWOLF developaantal agnt QUBONY/1 
(formerly STEBONY/1) vu trained by JCUWOLF Career AgeDt Rufus F. iODIGAST ill 
the uae of the S/W 11y11tm preacrlbed by HKTOPAZ per Reference c. QREBONY/1 
took one carl>oo sheet of tbe system vith him 01l a brief trip to North Africa 
ad used 1t for four massages ln the latter part of JUIMI. Concurratly, 
Parle Statln TECHS, on LCPIPIT'a behalf, requested ln OFPT 10348 that 
l&TOPAZ prepare for QRRBOHY/1'• use an S/W carbon pad vblch would alleviate the 
carbon concealment problem for the agent. The pad vaa received subsequently 
ad paaaed to QREBONY/1 on 18 July 19651 at vblch ti11111 bia original slagle 
carl>on sheet vaa vithdrav. 
2. QREBONY/1 first used his nev S/W pad for & •aaage dated 22-· 
JIily 19651 coaaaents on vblch vere trannitted to interested KUB.ARK Headquarters 
ad Field components in Reference B. QREBONY/1 underwent a corrective briefing 
on the ase of bla pad on 4 August 19651 carbon No. 1 (reaniost of three in the 
laack of bis pad) vae withdrawn a1nce it bore an imprint of the 22 July meaaage1 
and QREBONY/1 vaa authorised to use carbon No. 2 (middle of three) but only for 
• .. aential" meauges. (a 24 July S/Y maHage vae also critiqued at tbe 4 August 
aeetiq-becauae the carbon impression va1 relatively weak.) 
3. OD the baaia of LCPIPIT'a ln1truction to refrain from ming bis 
S/V pad ucopt for "essential" meuages, QREBO:.'Y/1 did not employ it again 
aDtil 11 October 1965. The nature of the me1asge indeed met the criteria for 
aae of the pad, but aa in the 22 JulJ letter the message vu clearly legible 
vlthout development. To quote Paris Station TECHSs 
"SV blpressiona were clearly visible under Ultraviolet Light 
(abort wave and long wave) and alao under a plain de•k light.• 
OD the baala of this report, QllEBONY/1 'a previous performauce in uae of the 
pad, and the fact that the next point from vhlch he vaa to uae ~he pad vould
