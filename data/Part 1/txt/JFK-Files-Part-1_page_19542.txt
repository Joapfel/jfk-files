I 111:ould like to call at ttintlon to t.he out.st.anding 
cooperation ~iven our nctivities in Vallee by J. Walton 1>:oore, 
ro3idont. rcfr03ontetive in Dallas, Texas. 
►;·r. Moon, has not only extended thti nor:nal hospitality of 
hi;; ofri~ee, but h~,a:,rone· out. cf hie w9y t.o no::i.1nate and talk -
with e~ceptional p~cple whc come to his at.tention as potential 
aa:ploye:1 for the Arency. )i.r. Moore has conluct.c.d me from time 
to _time with nallle1i' end CO::.l.llllt.S on indi vi-dual a, and in every way 
at.t,i:nptcd to serve aa an il.;tive f&rsor.nel ocout in his area. I· 
f~ol his affo~ts and tlllle cor:su%ed in int.ervievinf people have 
ror:e a rood deal boyond the no~l expectations of our agency, 
ar:a that this attitude best repre&enta the unified type of 
t.eo.mvork which our organi:.:at'ion subscribes to in this work. 
~hile my experiences with the resident offic~e in my area 
have been uni!'ormly a pleasant.· eicperience, it is a matt.or of 
real eaus·faction to find a ?Dan vho is thinking in terms of the 
Aier:cy- as a whole and not of one sharpl:; defined activity. I 
believe the spirit l~ot_k.r. V.oora shove should be broufht. to the 
atl~ntl~n of his sur-eriors as a pri~e e~ample of teamwork in the 
t'ield.' It is not only a ;:ersonal 9&tl9fsc:tion to do business 
with ~r. Moore, bu~ it rreatly contributes to the morale of our, 
ef'!'c:-ts by knowin,: that othar of!lces are as concerned as vo 
are in prcducinc reeulta.
