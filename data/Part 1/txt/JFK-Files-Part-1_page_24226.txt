1. A nlmber of lengthly and fruitful discussions have 
been held with JAGtl-lR officers regarding our continued 
running of QR:lEO!l'Y in the U.K. T.:ieir COlll!IICDtS OD the 
quality of ~ ,.,OZ{Y' s reporting hat:! been reported from time 
to time. Similarly, we will not dwell here on the aechanical 
arrangements we have evolved (with Sl:OTR's agreement) to 
expedite the passage of in.forr:iation to JAGm.R, on the one 
hand, and avoid duplicate reporti?lg (prinicpally by passing 
the s;u:ie materials as CS disse::is to SJ.!OTH) on the other 
hand. Suffice it here to say th~t achieving both of these 
goals, without cocproaising (a~c~-Y as a source throughout 
both JAGUAR and S~Tcl (due largely to the wide range of 
areas he reports on), is a cocplex problem. l:e th.ink we 
have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement for ·· 
achieving both aiJ:is. 
2. What we are concerned with here, then, is JAGt:AR's 
permission for us to run Ci~ONY fro~ here, for the tiae 
being at least. The exact phrasing from J~Ga:.R's letter, agreeing to our request is: "i:ith regard to the continued 
use of QR~ONY by your service on a temporary basis while 
he remains in this country we have no objection to this 
provided we are kept fully informed of as much detail as. 
possible." 
3. JAGUAR pointed out that ~R?:BONY operates in the 
same areas as some of JAGUAB's own agents, and this necessitates 
a fair amount of frankness re~ardiug his activities in the 
11.E. lie have made every effort to date to display to them 
that frankness. In return, JAGU.lil has been cooperative, if 
not doliiDright helpful. In one of our discussions, SllILL 
confidentially stated that one of their sources had quoted 
a sub-source as saying that ~O~-Y had admitted tohim that 
he is a KliBARK agent. r.e assured J..lGUAR that ~:n· is 
under instructions not to reveal his KUBARK relationship, 
of course; that Q.1.ZBONY is not supposed to be recruiting any 
sub-agents and has not done so; that the remark could well 
have been made in jest, in reference to the charges levelled 
against ~REEOH three yeus ago (or longer). ~e told JAGOAll 
th~t it would obviously be advantageous for us to kzlov to 
whom ~EBONY is alleged to have made the statement, and we 
would be grlateful if JAG~ could tell us. lfe have re!)eated 
this request in ~-riting, but with no reply to date. Sm'.LL 
stated at the time that he had doubts about whether they 
could identify to us the person w:ho had made the statement; he 
was sure that they could not go back to their agent for 
elaboration without showing an undue interest in Ot3BONY. Ve 
may yet hear who the person n.s. All this i's rapeated here 
merely to indicate how far JAGUAR will_ go to be helpful, and 
bow far, to date, they will ,!!2! go.
