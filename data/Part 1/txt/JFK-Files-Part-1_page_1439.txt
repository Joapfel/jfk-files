Page 15: The "Phoenix Program" originated before William Colby 
became DEPCORDS, COMUSMACV. Ambassador Komer started the program and 
asked that Colby replace him as DEPCORDS so that there would ·be some 
continuity in the effort to deal with criminal -elements of the Viet 
Cong infrastructure. It is unfair to subjectively state that the 
"Operation Phoenix" was Colby's own albatross. Certainly Colby doesn't 
believe this though he is receiving considerable flack from those who 
would like others to believe that the whole program was one of assassina­
tion of which Colby, as head of the CIA, was in charge. 
Page 39: We're still putting audio devices in coke bottles -- all 
these techniques and methods should not be discussed since we may very 
well want to use them again in the future.
