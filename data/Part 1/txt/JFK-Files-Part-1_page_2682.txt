electronic equipment which American Intelligence officers 
were known to be using during their travels inside the 
Soviet Union. As early as the beginning of 1954, the 
American Department had been given authorization from the 
Central Committee.of the Communist Party to steal this 
equipment from the Americans,· provided that the success of 
such an operation was assured. Before his transfer to the 
Seventh Department in 1955, NOSENKO himself had helped to 
develop plans for the operation and had even arranged an 
abortive attempt to seize the equipment f~m an Attache at· 
. ~- railroad station outside Moscow. ~·1hile ~E!JSmj:l ~ULFJ and 06 Ob ~6 l§_TROUD\were on one of their trips (after NOSENKO s transfer} I
