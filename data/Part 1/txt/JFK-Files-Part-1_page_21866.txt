,. The Le.tter of July i964 ..... _ V' -'. :-/-11 or 
The most con;?lete ex;?lanation givenb1 HOSE~KO of his 
motives for first contacting CIA and~later defecting to the· 
United States is contained in a letter to his CIA case officer 
in July 1964. He described this letter as "an exposition of 
all those reasons ~nd roct causes which led to the decision 
to lea?e the Soviet Union" and further explain~n that 0 every­
thing put down here is lacking in a whole jeries of lesser 
details which to a greater or lesser deg~ee played their 
role.u Nevertheless, he said, he had tried in this letter 
"to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the 
decision was born, grew, and hardened within me to coopletely 
altar the course of my life." This letter is presented below 
in its entirety. Most of the biosraphical and operational 
details mentloned in the letter are covered separately in other 
parts of this paper. 
"1. My life, ny childhood and youth passed in 
very comfortable circumstances since the positicn of 
my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking 
i<>c anything. And the only difficult periods of my 
life (before the death of my father) were: stuG7 in 
the naval schools i~ Kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad; 
and the beginning of my working life, the period in 
the Far East (1950-1952). The opportunity to be 
always well-dressed, to h3ve a sufficient amount 
of money, to have my own car, to be able to use the 
car given me by,my family and also my father's car, 
the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca­
tion in the best sanitariums, dachas, and so forth1 
all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be­
came so~athing of a habit. After the death of rey 
father., my successful progress in my work gave 1:1e a 
higher salary, and although I did not have all that 
which I had while my father was ali\•e, still I did not 
experience any serious difficulties. But already I 
wanted to live still better. 
•2. Up to 1953, over the course of my entire 
life--at school, in the Institute, at work, at home 
in the family--it was always poun@d into my head 
that STALIN was a great genius, th·at he was good, keen, 
etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question 
his words or his deeds because everything that he 
said, and everything he did,were completely axiomatic. 
The arrestsand trials only involved traitors and it 
was considered and. explained that the people who 
suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938, 
suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937, 
1938, was the betrayer of the people YEZHOV. Not 
even the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN. 
Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain 
document given me by my father. This. was a secret 
letter of the Central Committee of the ·cPSU on the 
'case of the doctors;' it was not addressed to :all 
conununists but only to memb~rs and candidate members 
of the Central Committee. I was deeply shaken by this 
lett~r which described in detail how these people,
