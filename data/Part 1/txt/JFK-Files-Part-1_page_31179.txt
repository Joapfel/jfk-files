I endorse Mr. Hood's Section D evaluatiol). I have found 1-:r. Wigren to be a 
•t1:r.y dependable and resourceful individual in undertaking the extensive research 
~1mnitments that the staff has undertaken in meeting very heavy obligations of 
·9:;nsitive liaison exchanges over the past year. Mr. Wigren is above all a gentle­
:m.!fl! in his attitude toward and treatment of others. I ~,ould say in the long run 
.t1.i:s. ,~orks to his di,;advantage because h1s contribution and his modesty tend to 
b:: overridden by the pretentions and bluster of others. Mr. Wigren has what has 
rn::w.- become a .. n:iost precious corrrr~dity to the 000 in counterintelligence and that is 
ll grasp on many of the aspects of the collegial rr:er.ory. He is therefore in a
