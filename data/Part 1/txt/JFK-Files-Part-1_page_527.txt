. . c. Ramearts' Tours - New York Med~a Workshop's 
Womens' Tour: Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Jason 
Horn, CI/SO, the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's 
Tour which is schedtiled to visit London, Paris (where they 
will meet the DRV ~~ce delegation) and Rome from 27 May ·-
25 June 1972 with lM_::.,V and inst~ucted her to attempt to determine-
the interest in, and likely composition of, the New York . 
group _and explore tltc possibility of joining such a group -· 
and explore the possibility of joining such a group. 007's 
first reaction to the tour was .that the .cost ($699, which 
price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high. 
It was explained to her that the cost factor should p..Q,t 
deter her jrom ~ollowing through. It was then that~7 
voiced some concern that the timing of the tour-may interfere 
with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms ~f 
mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear 
to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for 
her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well 
prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV 
delegation and ·continuing the staging process prior to her 
actual departure. (!!97 said that she understood and· would 
look into the matter. She did not believe she would have 
any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself 
included on the tour.
