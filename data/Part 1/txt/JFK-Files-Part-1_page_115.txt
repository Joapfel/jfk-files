to carry out certain oporatlonal support tasks. In such instnnces,

. • b;•: 'Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the lfRR Splinter Group. 
In UFGW-2555, dated·IS September 1963, Headquarters suggested that 
JlffiAVE might be-~ble to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611) 
o~ the JdRR spl_inter ·group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims 
relative to.his faction invading Cuba. Headquarters• interest in 
discredi_ting .BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's 
irresponsible p~bl~city stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1. 
As 1.a result of ·Headquarters' interest in this matter, REUTEMAN had 
a luncheon sessioq v,ith AlrlCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at wh:l.ch 
.AMCARBON-1 was· advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR wns,less 
than accurate in.its '.claims relative to its activities in Cuba. 
In view of this, ·REUTEMAN suggested that the Id~ntity 3 migllt wnnt 
to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN facti.on 
might release .. AMCARBON-1 stated that, in view of BEUTEMAN's 
comments, the Identity 3 would not only s~ft peddle, but would 
ignore the BANDIN faction in the future. Once BANDIN was discredit~d 
with AMCARBON-1, the word was· soon leaked by AYCARBON-1 to other 
newspapermen· that BANDIN was not a reliable.source. As a result 
-of this action, • .. the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage 
in South Florida.since ~eptember 1963.

to February 19641 :AMCAROON-I has furnished ·JHWAVE with operational 
intell~g~_nce_· a~_ .?u~l~ne~ below: 
•. -~./<:i~ wA#.,4836, datecf 2i-February 1963,· AHCARBON-1 
reported that AMBEN~~l was back in Miami and was the object of 
a great deal of press •interest in view of AMBEND-l's release from 
a Havana prison. '·AMCARBON-1 also indicated. that MIBEND-1 would 
probably be a knowledgeabl~ source on the current activities of the 
UR tn Cuba.· This.operational intelligence was most helpful in 
terms of keeping· Jlrffi'AVE informed on AltBEND-1 's movements. Subsequent 
developments revealed that AMCAIUJ9N~l could not contact AMDEND-1, 
and thus AlmEND-l's return to the United States did not cause the 
publicity stir.tlln.t wns in:l.tia.lly anticipated. 
. . b • . In WAVE 6176, dated 22 Karch 1963, A'MCARBON-1 
reported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full 
:feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion. The intent of this
