On 23 April 1964 llOS!:r;Ko was questionee on the various 
apartments he occupied .in Moscow. lie sc::. id that, from the 
time of his marr,age to TELEGINA until his departure for 
his first GRU post in the Far East, he lived in an apart­
ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. lie gave up this apartment, 
he said, in 1950, when, his Navy orders camo through. 
Having made this statement, NOSCNKO ft·as then asked why 
the 1951 Moscow telephone directory still listed him at 
the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. lie replied that he could 
not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the 
house in 1950. (He later said he moved to the Far East in 
1951 - see Section IV.B.) NOSENKO then said that the 
previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita 
ISHCHENKO. Although the phone then in the apartment was 
switched to NOSENKO's name for billing purposes, NOSENKO 
never bothered to have the change entered in the Moscow 
phone book; he said that this would have required a visit 
to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms, 
etc.; besides he added, he did not use the telephone any­
way. Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec­
tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed 
under the name of ISHCHENKO. He has repeated this story 
during s_ubsequent questionings. The 1961 Moscow phone 
directory carries no listing for t-.OSE~lKO; it does list 
ISHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya 
Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa. 
·The GKKNIR of the RSFSR is now the GNTK. PENKOVSKIY worked 
.·· under cover in the GKKNIR of the USSR. 
NOSENKO has als~ given his second daughter's year of birth
