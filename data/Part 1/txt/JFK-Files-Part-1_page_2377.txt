F. • Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in 
information furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant a conclusion 
that NOSENKO was dispatched· by the KGB? The conclusion in this 
• summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGB. In 
,. reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above question has . 
. been both a necessary and integral part. 
It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by 
NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration 
, in arriving at a conclusion that NOSENKO was or was· not dispatched by 
the KGB. If NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have 
surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB 
in order to support the bona £ides of NOSENKO. However, if NOSENKO 
was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB 
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be 
unknown. 
An examination of the circwnstances under which NOSENKO first 
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is 
particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would 
have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any i:mplications 
of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.
