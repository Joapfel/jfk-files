(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
NOSENKO thought he himself was present at the time. ALEKSEYEV 
was given OSWALD'S background, including his suicide attempt 
and the fact that he was not considered normal, and was 
told to advise the First Chief Directorate that OSWALD should 
_not be permitted to return to the Soviet Union. ALEKSEYEV 
relayed this information to the First Chief Directorate. 
NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD had spoken at the 
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew of no contacts 
between OST•7ALD and Cubans or representatives of the Cuban 
Government there or elsewhere. 
Comment: Independent sources, however, reported on 
visits ·by OSWALD to the Cuban. as well as 
Soyiet Empassies in.Mexico City between 29 
S~ptember and 3 October 1963 and on his 
(~pparently overt) contact with a KGB officer 
under Consular cover .at . the Soviet Embassy 
there. NOSENKO originally said he knew 
nothing of: _·az:iy_ such _contact ... In October 1966 
. he ·revised this to say that OS~'7ALD did not 
have contact with the·I<GB in Mexico City . 
. . _. NOSE,NKO explained that he. had been sitting in 
the office of Seventh Department Chief, K.N. 
DUBAS, wheri· a cable arrived at Moscow Head­
q1,1arters from the KGB Legal Residency in 
Mexico. The cable, which NOSENKO said he did 
not persona'ily see, reported that OSWALD had 
visited ·the -Soviet Embassy in Mexico City 
requesting permission to return __ to the USSR 
. and that· the cable specified that OStfALD had
