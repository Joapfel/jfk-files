Top Secret 
(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962} 
On 18 June 1964 NOSENKO was asked to list the names of 
all officers who had either joined or departed the American 
Embassy Section from the time NOSENKO was transferred to 
the Seventh Department in 1955 to his return to the American 
Embassy Section in 1960. NOSENKO listed fourteen officers • 
as having joined the section 1 and five who had been trans­
ferred out. In neither list did NOSENKO mention BAKHVALOV. 
A week·later, however, on 24 June 1964 NOSENKO stated 
that "in 1959 and possibly in 1958 Mikhail Fedorovich 
BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the American Embassy 
Section. I replaced him in his position in 1960 and he 
went to the Fifth Department as Deputy Chief". _In September 
1964 NOSENKO asserted that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief, [not 
the others he had identified earlier] had been LANGELLE's 
case officer. In 1965 NOSENKO first mentioned that 
BAKHVALOV, not KOVSHUK, had been·responsible for maintaining 
the Embassy security file and stated that BAKHVALOV had • 
shared with KOVSHUK responsibility for supervising code 
clerk operations. • • •

Comment: Interrogation has never resolved contradictions 
-between NOSENKO's earlier accounts of what 
functions he assumed from whom when he entered 
. the Section, and his belated assertions that 
BAKHVALOV was his predecessor as Deputy Chief. 
Responsibilities 
Shortly after· reporting for duty in the American Embassy 
Section and· following his short discussion with GRIBANOV, 
NOSENI<O said he met with American Department Chief KLYPIN 
and Embassy Section Chief KOVSHUK to discuss his responsi­
bilities and functions in the section. Repeating what 
GRIBANOV had said, KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most 
important single responsibility in the section would be 
supervision of all KGB operational activity against American 
military and State Department code clerks stationed in 
Moscow. As for the other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN
