but cie-rely indicate& lack of in.:."luence. ;ie ;;"'ys that the most p:-pul.ar 
persons are tl-.ose w:-.o can dispenr.e coney, alcohol, a."ld women. . hi., may 
well be true. !lt is certainly tr.1e t.hat -uch a role wo1..ll.d please Q 
immensely (that is, having a plu:.h apa.rt::ent in which he could e:iterto.in 
tuget r.rsonal.ities, satisfying KUB . .?.:"!K•s require.::::r.ents and his personal 
desires. 
F. Q D11St be dealt vi.th fir.nly, with continued serd"l.g of' re(?uireJ1P-:1ts 
and planned itineraries l°or tri;:,s. At the se.::ie ti.':!e, it 13 obvious that 
he ir.,provises weU when left without. instructions; he is versatile, 
and can cr-eate situations which wi:i.l reault in a:1 btelligence product. 
Rodigast•s r..ethod is to su~est reasonable plans and to be ready to 
show that they ca.n 'to i.i:-iplf::ll!unted, anci ho-,r they ca!t, anticipating 
objectior.:s. 
While'-there is no evidence that ii left alone Q would dr;ift, 
dragging out an a.jsi~ent to :·ill ti.Cle, it is po;;sible tr.at he would. 
He has not written as uEJ'.Y i'ree-iance articlea as :-o:iigast wcrild have 
liked him to, becau;;c each requires thinking out a subject, gather:L,g 
material, selecting a point o;.· view and t.hi."'lking o.r.' the public to which 
it would be addressed-- a lot of work for articles Ill';lant to :;er,, ,1 mainly 
as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaps merely to be 
used to convince editors that he ·,ras active. Or. the other hand, he produced 
the lirst issue of the mn-:sletter i.'1 record tine. follo;.i.ng instructions 
to the letter (indeed, acce;,ting what must at times s~P.!!l like ~tt7 
editorial changes made by !iodigast). PerbP..:s he ;-roduced the latter 
so efficiently beca•.!se he saw in it added prestiee, an opportunitj to 
get his na.1:1e back ber"ore the public in a respectacle cootext.. 
Ideological ~otivation ~ould not seem to be a level of control 
in his case. :-,-he.t is !JOSt ir.port.ant is his content1:1ent with being (he 
hopes) a percanent p!!.rt o!· a le:~ organization, l.i.th a steady stlacy 
{he has neve::- said this, ol' cow-se); ·,he pcr.;e::- of ODY.rG is less 
ici.porta."'lt than its kno;,n reputa t.ion :·or keeping its p~mise to pay, 
scmetb.::.ng one doesn't fir.d anong the o;-:;,osition gro:ips known to Q, 
and he i'inds nev exa::.ples of this daily. 
Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here- Q 
is DOW 1n a position where he can thumb his n;;ise at sme of his ene:ni.es. 
Rodigast reels that considerate dt=aling with Q, let.ting 
him lcncr,r where he is going, what he can expect., not chP.nging the ri.il.es 
abniptlr or pullin$ a rug l'rcm under his feet, lP.tting him"see the 
possibility oi' soall but certtj,n increases in ::.aterial. benefits in the 
coarse of his career, co-...pose the ideai.. ~·orc:ua for handling· him. 
In the course or time, the ideological factor. ·,thich is perhaps marg:inal. 
at this tice, would probably be reinforced, could one 1>:ay be a major 
factor. Q• meanv.hil.e, oust feel tl'li1t the f'l!!"Sons vr~ deal with him
