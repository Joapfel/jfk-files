Correspondent of La Voz de V.exico, an official arga.nl of the 
Mexican Communist Party (see IDL\IA-27727, 24 Xovember: 1965). 
ZEPEDA apparently also visite~ COC!.."UD1Ht China. He appears 
to be well acquainted with LIRIXG-9. In view of the' above, 
the Station instructed ROWTOS to ask LIRISG-3 to refrain from 
attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg" copy of the 
LIRISG letter to the Mexican Comr.iunist Party. tile Station 
feels a copy of this letter would add little to the knO'i'n fact 
that LIRI~G-3 is a person that LIRISG continues to v'.iew as 
"suspect." LIO~llEART has been asked for up-to-date ~1aorma­
tion on ZEPEDA's Party po&ition. A:ly information passed by 
LIONHEART will be forwarded to Head~uuters.
