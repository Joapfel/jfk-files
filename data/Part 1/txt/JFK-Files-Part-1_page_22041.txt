.Yes, I understand. And KOSOLl\FO'/ must tell him abo·Jt· 
the code clerk, t.ut we found ·out thut Paul JEN!~ER i3

This is not Paul JENNER. This is a different ti~

(interrupts) When he began to work in Embassy. 
Question: This is not March 1960. This is 1;overnter 1960. A 
different time. It's the same year, but a diffP.rent 
time. • 
NOSENKO: I k~ow only about his t~ip when he was returning with 
Paul JENNER. 
Q'..lcsti.on: Well, how do you explain th<1t this man, who's supposed 
to be under your supervi s io11 in the E1r.bassy Sectio:i, 
NOSENKO:

KOSOLl\POV to the train station to see him off. 
NOSEtlKO: He must. He was working as a case officer of counter­
intelligence, of th~ Fourteenth Department. Of course 
he must, of course he must. And KOSOLAPOV must speak 
with him.

train back to Moscow. 9ut GOLITSYN was not in Hel­
sinki when JENNER WdS there, It wasn't JENNER.

else.~. You are giving me such a big bluff. I don't 
know, I don't know, I don't know.
