1. Elsie L SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADfiR, Chief of 
the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts 
; · .. 
t 
with access to the Cuban target in the o:ympics. In these ,.gjscussions it may 
well be that Agee was t?~<!,tbout LIARM-1,@ member of t~Iexican rifle teamJ 
who was a contact@ the Statio0~d w~ ~re trying to get invited to Cuba. • _ 0 ·2, 
(LIARM-1 is no longer a contact l§J the 'statioii}even though he is still witn[he 
rifle team.] 
• 2. SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that 
Agee could pruvi.dc liu lca.d.s ui" a.ssista11cc tv this section in its c.ffv1't t0 ta.rgct 
against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the 
Section; no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with 
C/Cuba not more than half a dozen timto. .. 
3. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about 
the operations being run against the Cuban targitthan that which he might have 
picked up at Headquarters or known about@ie Statioij)operations in general -­
such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc. 
4. SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dL'rmer; there were 
no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura J. -UTSTJNE o !.. 
(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was alway£!_·· .... "Zc-f/1'~ 
light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his 
discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United states, 
bringing it to Mexico and setting up a.drycleaning plant. This was brought 
up as something for the future and just an idea Phil was toying with. •

5. SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy 
one day after the arrival ~ohn A. PROBERT. Agee said he understood 
PROBERT had arrived §,;<COSJ and he would like to say hello. I sugges-ted 
he call PROBERT. I immediately informed PROBERT of my chance encounter 
with Agee, and informed PROBERT that Agee had resigned under somewhat 
of a cloud and suggested he get briefed Mms:eli on Agee's assignment in Mexico.
