1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 6 7 
PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy 
~d a mobile photographic basehouse which is used primarily 
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders. 
_- PROGRESS: Three. basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-. 
vide coverag~ of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy. 
Throughout the past renewal period each operational component 
contributed-actively and concretely to the ful!illment of the 
operational tasks levied on the Station, In the first nine-month 
period approximately 17, 000 inrlividual frames of operational 
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These 
served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and 
their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement 
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The 
mobile Wiit (LIENTRAP) provided over I, 000 individual photo-· 
graphs. Of particular value were photographs of local and 
exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued 
in the role ;.s principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall 
operational assignment involved at least lZ clandestine meetings 
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project 
case officer. 
PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 !,ICO"N L/ 1, who owns a small store near the 
Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached 
hiin and asked him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the 
Soviet named LIEMPTY /6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name 
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC. 
However, in view of LICOW L's previoua history of lying, it is 
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just 
what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking 
into this development.
