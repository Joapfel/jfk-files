• CIA records indicate that ABIDIA.~ studied in Paris in 1949-50 
and then secured em?.i.oyrr,e:-:t w1 th t~e Department of State as 
a clerk/typist. He cerr.ai:-:ed in Paris until 1954. After spe­
cial training at the CIC school at Fort Holabird and the 
Secret Service .Scho:Jl, ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving 
for Moscow in 1960 as a spec.ial agent in the State Depart-
, merit's Office of Security. A iarge part of his work-'in· this· 
period was arranging the security of and accompanying foreign 
dignitaries visiting the Vnited States. These included the 
visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956, 
MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of 
1959. These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIA.~ into contact 
with a large number of KGB officers stationed in New York and 
Washington .. One of the members of the KHRUSHCliEV entourage 
was KOSOLAPOV who, according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S. 
Embassy Section in late 1959 and, as of January 1960, became 
HOSENKO's subordinate in operations against American code 
clerks.,.; .-..
