Mr •. Randall cont[nues to view hl~ reaponslbllltles with enthusiasm and serious con­
,cern. Oh•en the complexitiea of dealing wit~ every area dlvtefon and stall within 
DDP o·n cover matters, academic apprc,vals, tar getting against foreign nationals, 
recruitment of !IIUpport asse~•. seC!Ue operational approaches, etc. --I would 
characterize' his overall performance as evlnclng exceptional proflclency. Thls ·wa• 
accomplished in a period whlch a&w both Bases increase thelr striking power nwneri­
cally rather elgnl!lcantly. In the ultimate, the real test of perfoJ"mance ls lD re• 
cruitment of foreign nationals. While recruitment le no_t part of·Mr. Randall'• duties 
there i@ iio doubt that hie support-of the two· Bases contributed to the highest record 
of recruitment that these Bases had ae compared to any other year. At the same tinu ~ 
he consciously maintained an excellent balance in:the outgo. of fu.nd!II for oper.atlonal 
purposes. He is held in high regard by -both Base Chie!e. Since much of 'ttie routine 
desk wo~k le done by his Intel Assistant, it ls a tribute to hle supervisory capability 
that this service maintains a high rate of ef!lclency despite the slgnlllcant increase in 
work, and the fact that during thls ~rvd there were "three different intel assistants. 
Sinc'e the supervisor began phasing out of .tile.Job for several months prior to 31 Marci I• 
~-rather conscious declf!lon was made to have Mr. Randall in fact assume some of 
the responsibility of the Branch ·chid. Not only has .lie taken these ;idded taake 
willingly-and with.the confidence of DO's management, but he has p~rformP.d 
superbly. ' ·.. ":. - • • • •
