Top Secret 
(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960) 
Comment: CIA records refer only to one Alexander ROGOV 
who in 1960 was a senior official at the main 
Inturist office in the Hotel National in Moscow. 
Nataliya SHULGINA 
SHULGINA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO 
in 1955. NOSENKO knew that double agent Boris BELITSKIY 
[see p.282] "reported to the KGB that CIA had warned BELITSKIY 
against SHULGINA". 
Comment: KGB-controlled CIA source BELITSKIY reported 
to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent: CIA did 
not warn hi~. SHULGINA was for two years the 
secretary-interpreter of NBC correspondent 
Irving R. LEVINE after his arrival in Moscow 
in July 1955. She served as a guide for an 
American musical troupe's visit in the USSR 
in 1956 and in 1956 and 1957 she served as a 
guide for American tourists in Moscow. According 
to BELITSKJY, she was involved in the sexual , 
·entrapment and I<G:S recruitment of [!ritish MP 00 
Tom DRIBER~ NOSENKO' s apparent ignorance of 
SHULGINA's involvement with LEVINE and other , 
Americans, as well as with fil_RIBERm, and of her Ob 
foreign travel, belies his claim That she was 
his agent during the 1955-1958 period. Shown 
her photograph in 1964, NOSEUKO failed to 
recognize it. Nhen· he was then given her name, 
he identified her not as his former- agent but 
just as a .Second Chief Directorate agent o_nce 
involved with BELITSKIY.
