Top Secret 
(.AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
Comment: (Continued) 
and examined the site itself on 21 January 
1961. Seep. 219.) Throughout his tourffiAHONE~ ()} 
was subjected to intense KGB surveillanceo On-
25' October 1960 ABIDIAN commented that "I frlmd 
this type of coverage (five surveillants on·a 
recent trip to a barber shop) completely out 
of character with that which_is usually given 
a new arrival of similar rank. My only 
7 inference is that the KGB has at least strong 
O..Ssuspicions of(HAHONE~'s primary role as a CIA 
officer." (ABIDIAN's own surveillance at the 
7 time was occasional and extremely discreet.) • 
tb ~HONE0 lived throughout his tour in Moscow in 
Arneric~House, for which NOSENKO's supordinate 
DEMKIN was case officer and which NOSENKO had 
described as thoroughly penetrated by KGB agents 
among the local employees .(JS~HONE'Y\ spoke 
Russian, and his administrative tasks exposed 
him more· than most Americans to KGB agents and 
informants among Embassy local employees.· 
!>aul GARBLER 
GARBLER ~as a naval officer in the office of the Naval 
Attache and the target of BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO knew the 
names of no agents working against GARBLER. The KGB obtained 
no interesting information concerning GARBLER from microphones, 
telephone taps, or surveillance. NOSENKO "did not know" 
whether or not he had read GARBLER' s file. • (It will be 
recalled that in other contexts NOSENKO said that all Service 
Attaches we.i:e-considered by the KGB to be intelligence officers.)
