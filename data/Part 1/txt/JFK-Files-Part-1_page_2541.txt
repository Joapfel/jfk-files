(c) A second copy of a summary on a KGB agent. 
NOSENKO stated that there were two _copies· in the file 
kept by the Chief which he reviewed and that he kept one. 
Of interest is the fact that the copy was not a registered 
document and did not contain the usual information as to 
number of copies typed.
