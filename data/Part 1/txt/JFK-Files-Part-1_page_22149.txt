b. Information froc BARGHOORN 
BARGHOORN, who had 1imde five·carliar trips to tho 
Soviet Union since 195~, arrived there on 2 October 1963. 
The purpoae-oi his visit, as stated in his visi ~pplicatiou, 
was to gather information for a book on how effectively the 
Soviet Vnion was operating as a result of its political ed­
ucation and political system. His itinerary took him to 
Leningrad frol'l 2 to 7 October, to Moscow from 7 to 10 Octo­
ber, Tbilisi from 10 to 17 October, and short visits to 
Tashkent, Bukhara, !:amarkand, and Alm2-.. \ta froin 17 to 25 
October. He flew fror:i .r\lma-Ata to Mos::ow on 25 October and 
_was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October. On the 
latter date he was arrested and held by tne KGB until 
16 November when, a~ President Kennedy's intervention, he 
was released and left_ the Soviet Union. B,\RGHOORN had no 
intelligence mission_. 
Upon his return to the United States, BARGIIOORN was 
debriefed by the U.S. Department of State and by CIA. His 
information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in~· 
terest in him throughout the trip, including-encounters with 
at least fiv~ probable KGD agents during his first week 
there: an attractive waitress who invited him to "do the 
town,•• a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac-
tive unattached girl who sat next to him on the flight from 
Moscow to Tbilisi, and two young Armenians whom he met his 
first day in Tbilisi.* The two Armenians were instrumental 
in the drugging described by NOSE:SKO. At dinncr·in his 
hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met a_ 
young man clai.J'ling to -be a student at the Leningrad Music 
Conservatory. They left the hotel for a walk and ran into 
a friend of the student, a second young Armenian., and the 
three of them went to a.cafe for coffee. None was available,· 
•Questioned.about this in February 1965, NOSENKO said that 
BARGBOORN, as a suspected American Intelligence agent, was 
of operational interest throughout the trip. He vaguely re­
called the.girl on the plane but either _didn"t know or had
