NOSE~1{0 said on 26 October 1966 that he never re­
ceived any KGB award or decoration for his.operational 
work. The only a11i·ards he received during his KGB career,

tioning concerni~g the tor.-year service medal. NOSENKO said 
on 15 April 1964: "In 1962 I had ten years. of service in 
the KGB and got a medal for unblemished service. It is
