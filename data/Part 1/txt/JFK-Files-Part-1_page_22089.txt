g. Electronic Operations Against ·the ti. S. '~bassy 
(i) Introduction 
NOSENKO had.three basic pieces of infor:nation on KGB 
audio and other electronic opeiations against t~~ U.S. Em­
ba~sy in M6scow: The pres~~ce of ~lcro~hones in the 
chancery building, the absenc6 of audio-technical devices 
in the n~rth wing of the Embassy, and the exiitence of a 
bea:n which monitors and j a:ns transmissions·· from the Embassy. 
Th~#~ are discusced separately below. ~~c~pt for knowing 
that a resonant cavity (wireless) microphone ,had been found 
in the American Ambassador's rP.sid~nce in 1953, NOSE~1CO 
said he was unaware of audio surveillance devices and tech­
niques (other than the chancery nicrophones) in use against 
the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by 
such measures. NOSE?,"JCO told CIA on 14 May 1964 _that, to_ 
- - thf! best of his knowledge:·-·t}lere we1·e· no wireless micro-. 
phories (i.e.~ cirrier transmitters and radio transmitters) 
in the Embassy.• His information on KGB electronic opera­
tions agai~st this target dated miinly from the period wheo 
he was Deputy Chief of tl.e U.S. E."?1ba3sy Sect iori·, A'llerican 
Department, KGB Second Chief Dircctor~te, in 1960-1961 and 
derives_from his special responsibilities in this period; 
from his 1953-1955 service in the American Department, NO­
SESKO said, he learned only that audio installations 
existed. 
(ii) Microphones in the Chancery 
Frequently described by NOSENKO as his most important 
information, the microphones in the chancery building were 
first mentioned by him during the 1962 meetings in Geneva. 
In these and subsequent debriefings NOSENKO reported in de­
tail on the ways in which he acquired this information, on 
the number and locations· of t_he microphones, the quality of 
reception, and the value of production. He has not given 
the dato when the mic.rophoDes became operative, but pre­
sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector C-OLITSYN) that 
they ltere installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc­
cupied by U.S. Govern~ent representatives.•• Of the 16 
microphones listed by ~OSENKO, he ·has. stressed the impor­
tance of the one in the office of the ~inister Counsell~r, 
the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and 
subsequently confirmed by technical investigations. In 
1962 NOSENKO said that the audibility of the nine-year-old
