A. Security :- 'I)le acrtvltles of _the LICALLA base were suspended ln 
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KUIUOT 
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known 
to.have knowledge of the four LL\1UST units (UCALLA is loaned in one . 
of these units) and the Sq1tion considered lt appropriate to suspend photo..: 
graphic operat_ions~pendii1g resolution of the situati_on. At thls time, 
.· there ls no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed .. The 
LICALLA bas_e operator has reported that th.ere have been no unusual 
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might Indicate that LlCALLA 
has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a 
possibility will exist untU. the release of the three technicians. No 
other seci.lrlty problems have occurred during the past year.
