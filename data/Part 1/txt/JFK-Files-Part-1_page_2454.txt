NOSENKO has furnished information on the travel of certain 
United States Government officials, including Congre~sional represent­
atives to the USSR in 1955 - 1956; and the trip of Supreme Court Justice 
William O. DOUGLAS in 1955 which, when considered wJ.th the previously 
mentioned specifics, adequately substantiate his claimed service in the 
. . 
. Seventh Department and work against American-British Commonwealth 
tourists during the late May 1955 - December 1959 period .

NOSENKO has stressed that when he transferred to the Seventh 
Department,· the Tour-ist Section had just been establi,shed and an agent 
network was not available for operations against American and British 
tourists. This seems quite logical since the influx of tourists into the 
USSR was ju; t in.,a formative stage. 
NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he de­
veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted. of Intourist personnel 
and two homosexual agents, "SH:MELEV" and "GRIGORIY 11 (KG.B code 
names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by 
interviews with individuals who were the subject of homosexual com-
promise operations.
