MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division 
·SUBJECT: Recommendation for Pronotion Newton Scott Miler 
l. It is rl:co.-:.mendcd that Nc-.1,tc::. S;:ott M!.lcr be promoted 
from his prcsl'nt ~rnde of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned 
to tho Africa Division on 9 J,uly 1961 and assumed his present 
position of Chief of Station, Addis Ababa, in s~ptember 1961. 
He has been in ~rndc since 24 March 1957, In accepting his 
present nssi~nmcnt Miler assumed responsibility for a very com­
plicated operntionnl progrnm requiring considerable reorientation 
and modification.. In a short time he has been able to give 
purpose nnd direction to o~crntions which previously had been 
the subject of considerable controve1.·sy within DD/P, It is 
worthy of note that Miler hns accomplisht>d this with an almost 
entirely new temn, few of w.hom had any pr"'viouH experience in 
African operations. 
2. Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be 
inclined to delay n promotion recommendation pending further 
opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the 
individual. It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception 
to this rule. Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division, 
Miler had been rec0111mendect for promotion by hi8 former Supervisor 
who is presently Deputy Chfof, CI-CF. St:lff. This man had 
apparently felt so <;t~.·cui;ly about Miler's performance that he 
had s:1r.:g~~ted that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who 
should be i;ivcn n ju::ip prornoticn to .supcr~rndc. If necessary a 
memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained. 
3. In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been 
us~ocinted with Miler in a professional rcl~tionsh!p since 1946. 
nw only t{ap in continuity was from the ~riod 195G to 1959. It 
is folt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's 
knowledge, ability, experience, nnd potentinl bears weight.
