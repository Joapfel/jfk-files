D. Ex:11aination of !;OSESKO's Intelligence Career 
1. lntroductjon 
What follows is an examination of SOSl~l<O's accounts of his 
Soviet Intelligence career, b~ginning with the years 1951 and 
1952, in the naval GRU and continuing with his 11 years in tbe 
U.S. Embassy Section and the Tourist Depart~cnt of the KGB Sec­
ond Chief Directorate. ~OSEhl<O's naval servic.e opens the dis­
cussion primarily because, according to his story, it provided 
a SJ)ringboard for bis entrance into the KGB in 1953 with the 
rank of lieutenant. 
The discuss ion of r.ach period in his care~r has two cen­
tral topics: First, SOSENKO's own d,·scripticn of his positions, 
responsibilities, and access: and second, ac assessment of this 
description from the point of view of internal consistency, 
accuracy, and the commensura~ility of his kuowlcdge, ~perational 
activities, and performance ~ith his claimed senior and respon­
sible posts -1th the KGB and his rise to these posts. This 
assessment is bas~d on a co~parison o! the ioforcation suppli~d 
by >-iOS~KO with collatu·al information from a variety of overt, 
official, defector, and clandestine sources. 
~OSENKO's accounts of the various periods in his career are, 
of course, cumulative in that his claimed positior.s and activi­
ties during one stage n~cessuily aff~ct those of succeeding 
periods. Insofar as possible, each period is ev~luatcd wit~io 
itself and ind~pendeotly of cor.clusions earlier reached.
