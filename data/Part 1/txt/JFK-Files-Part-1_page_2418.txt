cannot be established with certainty, it is evident that truth and 
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test, virtually 
'I 
any of NOSENK0 1s above claims are impugned by fact or probability,· 
or contradicted or retracted in his own statements. NC6ENKO is 
not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide _defector. 11 
11 Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide 
defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine hi's true motives 
for contacting American Intelligence and for providing the information 
he has given. Here, it must be recognized that the evidence, largely 
consisting of NOSENK0 1s own assertions, does not permit unequivocal 
conclusions. Neverl:eless, the question cannot be ignored. , The 
character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that 
some oi his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials, 
and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENK0 1s future all 
require that at least a provisional judgment be made. 11 
11 0f the reasonable explanations advanced for NOSENK0 1s 
misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing 
as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he 
suffers from a deranged ?ersonality or unbalanced mind; that he has 
greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for 
simply personal reasons; or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB
