NOSENKO identi ficd Fillmore K. 11EARNS as MICKELSON'' s 
replacement and said that he w~s the responsible case of­
ficer. There were two agents and one operational contact 
working against '.lEA!lNS. Of these, ~OSENKO could recall the 
name only of NOVIKOVA, the same maid who reported earlier on 
MICKELSON. Besides being told to attempt to overhear MICKEL­
SON's conversations NOVIKOVA was instructed to search his 
clothing and tu copy any notes she night find, but she 
never overheard or found anything of interest to the KGB. 
NOSENKO recalled that MEARNS' persor.al effects were searched 
by the KGD while they were being shipped to ~oscow from the 
United States, and that all his service records had been 
discovered and photographed.~ ~OSENKO described ~!EARNS 
as being er.ore "active" in :,toscow than ~lICKELSO~ had been and 
said that informa:ion from concealed microphones showed 
him td have a strong character. Nothing of interest con­
cerning him was received from these microphones or from tele­
phone taps. 
CIA has no derogatory or otherwise significant informe­
tion on MEARNS, who replaced ~,IICKELSON.
