STORSBERG rejected the recrui':.me~t approach, and when int~r­
viewed on the basis of the ~OSENKO lead, STORSBERG conC1nucd 
this. Both ~gree the appro~ch was ~ade in the latter part 
of 1961. v~ 
- GOLITSYN•s reports cover six oth~r opera~ipns (Pages 
595-598) which NOS~lKO has r:ot mentioned: TI-.e K§9's recruit­
me:it of a female employee 3t ~he E.-nbassy in 1957, the pre­
sence of a code clerk in the ~~:.:,assy in 1960 who was a KG9 
agent, an unsuccessful rccru1t~~nt aµproach to a female sec­
retary at the E:nbassy prior to July 1960, the KGa plan to 
complete the recr_uitment of a:, /..-ner i~c?r. diplomat following 
his r~assignr:1ent from Mosco.1 in 1959, the KGB's recruitmer.t 
of or planned recruitmer.t afp~oach to a U.S. Embassy ~mploye~ 
(possibly a code clerk) prior co April/l-:ay 1960, a:id a KGB 
officer's trip t-:, Helsinki to a::company a:: Embassy

code cler-k • 
tra\•ell ing by ti:-ain to Moscow. (':'here is documentary evi­
dence to S'.lpport tb~ accuracy of GOLI'!SYN • s &tate;;ients ~bout 
the last of these ca~es: see below.) 
On the basis of available information, NOS~KO cannot be 
faulted on the completeness of hi~ reporting about American tour­
ists recruited, approached, and un1er developraent by the KGB, but 
he could cite only one instance of KGB investig3tions uncovering 
tourists dispatched to the USSR by American Intelligence (Pages 
145-150). * He kne•,.; nothing concerr:ing two docur:1ents of CIA origin 
which described "legal travel" opE:rations, one discussing forth­
coming tasks of American agents in the tourist season of 1959, a 
year in which NOSrnKO was Deputy Chief of the 1,mer~~an Tourist 
Section. These documents were placed in the hands of the KGB by 
George BLAKE of :-U-6 in July 1959 (before the end of the tourist 
season) and in 1960; NOSENKO was not familiar with any aspects of 
the KGB operation with SLAKE. That the Tourist De;,art.ment was 
aware of u.s. Intellige~ce sending agents under_tou.rist cover to 
the Soviet Union in the years when ?,OS~KO was Deputy Chief of 
the 1,merican Tourist Section is demonstrable by four cases of 
1958 and 1959 cited in. a KGB docu.~ent supplied by GOLITSYN. NOS­
EUKO, although h3ving no information on KGB countermeasures 
against k~erican tourists in 1958 and 1959, knew that the docu­
ment had been passed to CIA by C-OLITSYN and that it had been 
written in the Tourist ~partrnent. tlhere SOSE.i.~KO's reporting 
on American tourist cases is checkable, therefore, it has been 
found to be incomplete. 
• NOSENKO reported that of nine other toarists investigated by 
the KGB, eight were suspected of having current connectior.s 
with American Intelligence. The KGB was correct vi~h regard 
to Thanas B..:.Rn-lELEMY ar:d Ro'!)ert OiRISTNER, who were on CIA 
missions, and Alfred SLESINGER, an FBI informant who neverthe­
less had no .lir:lerican Intelligence mission when he visited the 
---USSR -in 1961' arid -1962; - Frederick BARGHOORl,, arrested in the •• 
USSR in i963~ had been affiliated with U.S. milit~ry intelli­
gence many years before, and Ray GART"rlOFF had severed his 
association vith CIA as an overt employee before he went to 
Moscow in 1963. Concerning the rest reportedly suspected by 
the KGB--Donald ALBINGER, Bernard KOTEN, and Gabriel REINER-­
none was associated with American Intelligence in any way.
