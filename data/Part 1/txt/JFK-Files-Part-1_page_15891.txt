~:-· :f~ Subject arrived in Frankfurt/Main from the Congo on 22 May 
.. ''.' .. 1962. -~·.J.{UBARK':i·j•easons:.for establishing contact were dictated by 
the need_ 'to reliev~ Subject of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian 
.passport, the n~ed to institute or suggest a course of action 
which would encourage him to establish himself as a contributing 
member of socie~y and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo. 
3. Subject appeared to be primarily a resettlement problem, 
therefore, Orme K. DARON'NAT was assigned the Case Officer 
responsibility. 
4. Since adequate documentation was a primary consideration for 
i'._. ,_ .. successful rescttleme_nt,- Subject wa·s briefed on the relative merits 
of the types of. FEDREP(document;ation available. 1\1 though Headquarters 
had reconunerided a -backs'topped F-remden·pass, subsequent discussions 
• between DARONNAT" Zand MKTOPAZ FR,iN representatives indicated a 
• Reiseausweis to be the proper document for permanent resettlement, 
.. With the cooperation ··of ODIOEX Camp King representatives, Subject 
was ibterview~d ahd_granted political recognition on the basis of 
._ a fabricated story'·--fri. which he claimed to be a Georgian who defected 
from.East Berlin while with a tourist group.

_ .. 5. The WI ROGUE case suffe.red a temporary setback when in December 
1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV) 1 the West German organization 
responsible for the internal security of the FEDHEP became interested 
in Subject and requested all available information. HARVARD briefed 
OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly _a HARVARD agent rese ttl<mo.nt case 
whose name, recogn-i tion interview story, etc were complete 
fabrications to insure his receiving political recognition and a 
Reiseausweis. OCA advised the BFV that Subject was of continuing AIS 
interest and Ju\RVARD res.urned its resettlement efforts '.'7t-/- _?. 3 ·-:; ,., ? 7
