of the building where ~£'iDEZ and other FAR ~embers 
have an apartment they use for clar:;dest1.ne meeti.ngs 
with LIRP:G-3. Despite !he fact that the team 
knows LIRI~G-3 from previous s:urveillance and that 
a CO-;!Y ~! !.!&l~G-3' s sketch of ?!~;!.'!2 was also 
provided, the LID!BBACE.s spotted neit~er lll.a.D. The 
c..st-ation naturally plans :o cover another m~eting i 
and is also exploring the possibility of determining; 
who rented tr.e arart~e~t and frOD ~ho~. It is of 
some interest to note that llDl)EZ, although he gave 
LIRIXG-3 the ~<YX"eed upon recognition signtl, may 
still not be the "Pa\·el" LIRl:O.G-3 'ifas t'>ld he would

KnOTing that PmZABA.L' s father-in-law is a close • 
friend o! G'lief, LIRI~;G, Lil!e,G-3 sourced ::he rumors, 
to the LIRISG headman. He first took up the matter I 
of the accusations made against bin with LIRISG-9. • 
The latter said there vas nothing to this, but, and 
_- there was a but, LIE!SC-9 rc-:i::dr;d LIRI~;G-3 t~at 
\ 
in the past he had been connected ''with a person of 
mysterious a:id suspicious affiliatious," a clear

LIRI:SG-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the natter

Chief, LIRIXG, LIRI5G-9 pro!l..ised to nake an appoint-:

materialized. That Chief, LIRl:SG cay have spread 
the allegations made.against LIRIXG-3 by PERZABAL 
was confi.rced by'°Rolando*st'AREZ (see RO\rl'O~' s 
report dated 31 Decenber) • LIRIXG-3 also took up ! 
the natter of the PERZABAL denunciations vitb YK'U>EZ·, 
who told him that the FAP. had paid no attention to ! 
them and even accompaniad LIRI:SG-3 to PERZABAL's ! 
house. LIRI.SG-3, however, nade the mistake of I 
giving bis name when asked vbo vas call in~. The 
result, as couid be expected, was that PIRZAB.\L was 
"not in." ME.\1)f2 agreed to acconpany LIBI~G-3 to .

not to make accusations without proof. YE.'ill!Z,
