":o Ezeiza airpo1·t; and,iz.~urprisingly enough_, a Sunday 
afternoon tour with 201:.'873887 and his wife to take 
pictures along tho river front and drink beer in a Costanera 
cafe. (During thia la1:1t tixcursion, • the known KGD officer drove 
the GRU chauffeur and his wife.) The first trip to the airport 
was made in the company of several other high-ranking· Embassy 
off:,.cials to greot an important transiting delegation. (See 
HABA4"22399.) On the seco111l trip AEBOOR 1U)ft accompanied by

AEBOOR might have been checking for surveillance. Otherwise 
there were no incidents of note. Not once were the BIBAFl'LBs 
approached by local autboritie3 with a request that they 
identify themselves. 
&. In sum, we remain as much in the dark as before about 
AEBOOR. With every opportunity and reason in the world to 
lead a hectic pace, he spent the majority of his waking hours 
within the Embassy. During the days in question he.received 
only one phone call even worth noting, one in connection with 
the Fischer..Petroayan chess match scheduled for late September.
