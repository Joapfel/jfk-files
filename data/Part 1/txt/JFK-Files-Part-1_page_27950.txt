s. rn ad,litio11 to the PIAG crowJ,·Paul llacfncr's people 
hnv~ had the cnJless 3nd r~petitive Joh of ~c~~ching th~ 
CHAOS files and helping me deal with that most sensitive 
aspect of past history. Please express my t~anks to the~ 
a·nd, most part1':ularly, to Paul--himsclf. 
6. Finally, let m, make s~ecial note of the contributions 
from Joe Gigliotti and the retired officers handling the OSS 
rcco~ds requests. Their particular expertise was a welcome 
addition to•the staff support received. 
7. I •_m sure al-1 ~ill give Bob Owen, in his new role, 
the sue big~ quality support thnt they gave to me. To state 
tho obvious, although th_e w-in record is quite good, the race 
is still on.
