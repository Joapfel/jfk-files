DISPATCH NO. HKH-A-2577 
DATE 17 April 1956 
P.egarding reference (a) the Station co!lcurs fully with the proposed proootion 
of Artpur G. Vaivada. and desires also at this time to bring to the at.r.ention 
of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada stcff status either 
concurrently wi. th the f,romotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible. 
· i 2. ,.,The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status, 
l.
. f'or a n.unber of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not. been 
entitled to the st-..andard step increases that accrue to regular GS e:-,ployees • 
I. l{oreover he has not r..:.d the benefi., of recent. legish.tive increases in basic 
~- salary rates, such tba .. his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 ~-t the t.hen 
f GS-9 level, is still $5()...C:0.CO per anrr.llll. Perhaps of more importance than 
~- the foregoing considera .. ions is the fact that this agent has been and is 
;;· losing out in terms of the retirement, health insur.s.nce, and other iaore long- , 
term advantages avail.:.tle to staff personnel. The agent has several tlJlleS ._;i-',
