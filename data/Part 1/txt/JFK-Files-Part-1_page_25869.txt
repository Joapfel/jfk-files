oratory, Computer Centre, Academy of Sciences, Moscow, was a 
visiting professor in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada, for fo\!%' 
ll!Qnths - November 1974 to.February 1975. 
_ A number; of sources were impressed by TORGOV's frank-
ness and his willingness to speak out, at social gatherings, 
on current proble: areas in the Soviet systc~. For exa::ple 
he discussed dissidents in Soviet society ar.d commented on one 
oecasion that. present. day Soviet society- allo-..,ed for far. greater­
freedom of expression than had been allowed previously. He 
said that things were being said in Moscow that one would never 
have heard in Stalin's era. Nevertheless, TCRGOV argued that 
a.return to "terror tactics• under Soviet rule was always poss­
ible. He considered that such tactics were unlikely at this 
time because of the personal philosophy of Premier Leonid BRESH!lEV. 
TORGOV is reported to be the son of a scientist and party 
member and he hi21Sclf is an admitted party member.· He is married 
with three children. He is considered to. be one of the top ex­
perts on h_is field (computers) in the Soviet Union. He mentioned 
- having :i,~rave_lled to other Western countries two or three times. 
Bis Eng:lish is good. Ha was very friendly towards Canadians dur.­
ing his:visit but it was observed that· he did not assoc~atc with 
three other Soviet research students at the same institution. On 
or,:;, occasion in Ottawa he was berated quite severely by a Soviet 
£mbassy official for his failure to report per~odicall_y, ·as re­
quired; to the E:bassy. TORGOV later told a source that this Em­
bassy- official. •could be a dangerous .. man to your .countr.y" •-
