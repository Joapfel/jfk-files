The previous summary also stated that despite his claimed 
active commissioned service in the Navy, NOSENKO knew nothing ·of 
Soviet Navy tradition, doctrines, or organization of procedures. It 
should be noted that there is a considerable difference between being 
a member of the Naval RU and being an actual member of the Soviet 
Navy. The situation could be compared to a career civilian employee 
of the Office of Naval, Intelligence and a line officer in the United States 
Navy.
