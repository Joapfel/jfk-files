2. The nature of the QUDOZE Report does not permit 
further ampliiicatidn of the above information which, even 
~hough fragmentary and obscure, is being forwarded for 
whatever use Headquarters may wish to make of it. Should 
any clarifying i:-iformation appear in future QUDOZE reports, 
it will be forwarded. It is interesting to note that, 
although Station traces do not show the information, a 
previo~1s QUDOZE Report quoted RUIZ as saying he had once been 
in Nort~ Vietnam as a ~ember of a trade mission.
