was there. Ile saic to ml'!: 'Yura, it lool:s to :ic li.'.~c you 
are going to bed with that girl.' I ans~ered: 'What do 
you mcc>.n, !-:ikhail Sr.ci: . .:.inovich? Sha just .i1fre:-~sts r.,e.' 
I haJ already dcciceJ to try t(J get iler in ; ci ... But, 
listen further. ,\!:to.:!.:: this f:he used to ~p to t;;f} IJisarma­
rnent Conferences. Wel. i, to r,ak':! it .:1hort, I asked this 
girl for a date. She is S~uttish, S2ottish, net Snglish, 
and works in an office.her~. We agracd to ree~ at a 
re5taurc11t. I .;is;,.e:i rny friends ...,!,ich re!-;;ta·.1ra:--.t here is 
the best, where there isn't a crowd. We wcnc t~ the restau­
rant and sat there ~l! cv~ning--all alone. ~!1~re were j~st 
~he two of us. The restau::ant is u~der the ground and is 
called 'Day and Night' in Russian, • .:iour et r;ui t.' We 
sat there uncl then she asked me ~,.-here _•,:e GO\\ l.d r.eet a~ain. 
A day later we met again. Again in the rc3ta~rant an~ then 
we took a walk. S~e got me bothered and then gave me the 
brush-off. I called her once. She w3sn't at home. I 
called again. Again she was out. I call~d a third time. 
She wasn't there. She thought that I was an intelligence 
officer a~d that I was interested in her for this reason. 
This, hollestly, wasn't so. I had only o:-,c thi!':g in rr.ind. 
She was quite a woman ... But the English yirl felt that 
she was being developed. I met three times ~ith her. 
Three times we were at the restaurant and she told them 
lher superiors) this. She knew that I an Russian. She 
told them this and they (NOSENKO whistled, apparently sig­
nifying that they terminated the r~lationship) at once. 
She knew from the very beginning that I am Russian, from 
the very beginning. In short, I tolrl her a lo~ of things-­
well, you know--so to get her into bed. Well, we were 
walking on the quay and I said to har: 'How about ge>ing 
up to your place?' she answered: 'I can't.' 'Why?' I 
~aid, 'I'll take off my shoes.and.come on tiptoe.' She 
answered: 'Is it·possible for me to come to you?' I 
said: 'You can't come to my place. There would be a 
knock on the door at once. The Swiss would tell the 
Americal's and that would be the end. I can't do this.' 
So all I could do was have her next.to the parapet. But 
the English fclt--and nothing was heard about this, but
