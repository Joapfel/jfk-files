would not even show •1p. At one point IDEN· J askeci fl)EN A to· we h.e.:. 
paper on the capability of cx-BKHER,\I.D assets 1oho were drug traf_fickcrs, 
11nd 'who had b_.?en trained in infiltration and ecxfiltration, to penetrate 
WODUAL coastal tlefen:;es with drugs, ICEN A sh01o·.:d how the assets could 
circum\',•nt any g<>vernment effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper 
"1«:ared Li'\C-OLLAR to death," according to FlEN A. At the eni:1 of· June 1974, 
IDCN J asi-ed. IDEN ,\ to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLlAtt 
officials on his conclusions.· It was to be an all e~;,.:r.,se paid tdp, and 
IDf.N A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration rec-civt:-d for the 
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with 
IDEN G anrl !-tis c·eputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. lDEN G 
ind:l,cated at that til'le he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access 
in Key West. 
8. Later, IDEN A told IDEN G he had sent lots of reports, but there 
hdd been r:o ar_rests, and. therefore no· bonuse:=i. IDEN A said he would no 
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to 
make IDEN A a LNCOLLAR.consu!tant to protect his retired status. He also 
promised IDf.N A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in 
LNCOLLAR -raids), and an add-it-ionnl US$500/nionth to mPet expenses and • 
agent payoffs. IDEN ::; also spoke of using IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities 
in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever i.as forthcom:.ng on any of 
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided· LNCOLLAR (at its 
request) with thP. n.lllles of potenti:il source!l of infoi:-mation in the Miami 
area. Several person!l were app:::oachcd by LNCOLL<\R using Ii>EN A's name, 
and a number of fonner BKHERALD assets ~ere picked up in this manner. 
Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q. 
9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party an~, while drunk, 
said .he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLL\R activities. 
In· June he made similar coDJDents ,~hile at another social gathering. IDEN A 
ro~de no comment (other than requesting that IDE.1 F shut up). When IDEN A 
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J ,- they had mace quite a point of saying 
only they would be aware of IDEN A's· LijCOLLAR ties. Later _in June 1974, 
• IDEN F said he l~ew IDEN A was work1ng with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974, 
'jbEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDE.'-1 A's handling 
officer in Miami, dealing w~th him since IDEN L was known to be an 
LNCOLLAR officer. JDEN G wanted to hav~ IDEN A deal directly with him 
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too 
cumbersome. In late· July, IDEN G introduced IDE.~ A to his new contact• 
IDEN I. 
10. In November 1974, it becmne apparent the drug ring in Key West
