FYI. 
1. The Warren Commission's Report on the assassination of 
President Kennedy focused attention on the magnitude of the problem. 
involved in the protection of the Chief Executive. As you know, it is 
our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every 
support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory 
responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President 
travels abroad. 
2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission 
produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem 
of Presidential protection and on interagency operational c.:>operation, 
which normally do not find their way into the public domain. These 
include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation, 
coordination, and operational interchanges. I believe you will be 
interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren 
Commission by U.S. intelligence and security officials. Pertinent 
F:lrtions have been side lined,. I commend these materials for reading 
by all officers in positions of senior responsibility in headquarters and 
over seas.
