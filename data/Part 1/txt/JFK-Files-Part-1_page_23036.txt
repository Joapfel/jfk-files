does not appear to be ''willing to die ior lhe 
regime". Alignagaray was proposed as -'an aspirant 
tu the PCC _cell at the Hospital, in an assembly 
held in 1969, but stated that he .had ri ~~feet 
consisting in the fact that he was in love. Subsource 
did not know whether he was ac~epted as an aspirant. 
In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabe] lo, emplo:.-ed 
as a psychiatrist at Havana psychiatric Hospital, 
told subsource that Mignagaray had told hi111 that he 
(Cabello) would have to take over Mign:rgaray's ward 
becaµse he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric 
congress; subsource could .give no further information 
on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departu~~­
Mignagaray is described as a light-skinned mulatto, 
·about 5'9" tall, weight about 160 pounds, 60-65 
years old, brown .eyes, greying hair, married; subsource 
thought he had three children,

Havana University, when both were membe1·s of the

t~e latter joined the anti-Castro co1111terrevolutionaric~, 
and never saw him again. When subsotirce visited his 
brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso, held first on the 
Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the 
Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of 
Dr. Fernandez; the information he received made him 
~elieve'that Fernandez is one bf the mo~t respected 
prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium. 
Fernandez was mentioned as ·an examplo of integrity. 
Other prisoners such as Ur. Andres CAO , Juan 
B U S T A M A N T E , and Antonio G A R C I A. told 
subsource that Fernandez' attitude bad not varied. 
Fernandez' wife, Emilia L U Z A R R A G A , who
