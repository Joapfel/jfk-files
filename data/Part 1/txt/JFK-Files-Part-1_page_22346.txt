e. Willina~ess to ~eet CIA 
Although in 1962 ~OSE~KO Llaimcd that ~e ~dnted to 
sell only two s~ecific items for the noncy he had lost, and 
then disappear, there were indications from the outset that 
he eY.pected and planned to cor..c b3ck for further reeetings 
with CIA. At this first rr.cetin~ he called attention to 
certain information in his possession about POPOV, hinting 
that he would tell it later; even as he protested his unwilling­
ness to continue meetir.g with CIA, he was giving ample 
details abo~t himself ~~ich would inevitably have com?ro-
mised him to CI~ and forced his fut~rc ccllaboration. Befor~ 
he finally agreed to·return for C\Ore meetings, he said: 
•Hayte I'll ~eet you ~gain Mon1ay

(two days after the firs~ 
C\eeting). NOSESKO refusej, despite repeated induce~ents, 
to ~et on the intervening Sur,day. ln fact, \;hen he did 
return on Monday, ~e said th~t h~ hnd spc~t s~~day with 
friends, drinking and •discussing recc11t CSSR foreign policy

Remarks 
I 
The operational circumstances so.far reviewed point 
out the facts that: • 
- NOSENKO was inconsistent if not contradictory in 
sta~ing his reasons for being in Geneva in 1962 and 
1964; 
He had unusual access to the l~Gn Legal Residency 
and an availabilily for ~eting CIA that seemed to 
i.Jcpinge upon his security; 
- He was willing to return to meetings with CIA al­
tho~gh having at !irst said that there were but two 
ite~s of information for s3le; 
- He was •in place• as a Cl~ source for the last 
&ix of his 100 or so rlays in Geneva in 1962, L~us 
re&tricting the a~ount of time he could provide continu­
ing reporting on the local Legal Residency; and 
- After 12 da~·s in the sa:nc status in 1964, he 
forced the defection by the KGD recall telegram, which 
appears to have been a fabrication.
