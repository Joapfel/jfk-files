a. Atterript to Obtain Assiqnment in Ethicpia (1960) 
During the first half of 1960; _NOSENKO said, he applied for 
a permanent overseas assignment-to Ethiopia because doctors had 
prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oksana's asthma. 
O.H. GRI9A!,QV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved 
his re~est. but then the -KGif Personnel Df!partment turned it 
down ~hen a filo review revealed potentially dangerous character 
weaknesses. 
HOSENY.O <lescriberl this matter on· H April 1964 as follows: 
•cennadiy GRYAZNOV cam2 to the hnerican Cepartment of the Second 
Chief Dircictorate in 1958.- Defore 1956 he was stueying in the 
Higher Schoel of the KGU and when he finished the school in 1956 
he was assignej to the KGB. Personnel Department, and then he came 
to t:1eArnerican Department in 1958, So GRYAZNOV had very good 
cor.n~ctions :.r. the Personnel Der-ar-.:ment. So in 1960, when I 
wanted· to leave, to yo abroad on permanent assignment: I said to 
GIUBANOV: 'Let me go for two years to Ethiopia.' l·lhen the Par­
sonn~l Department refused to let me go, I decid~d I'd just have 
to know what was there in my personal file, I had to learr. what 
it was that was causing all this. By that t:irne GRYAZNOV was in 
the Arr,erican Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap­
pened to be th= head of th~ Party Organization of the entire 
directorate, and he at cne tirn~ hatl worked in the Personnel Office, 
himself, lie s:·.id: 'Give me this thing and I'll see what I can 
find out about it.' So he went to the Personnel Department and 
through his friend there got my personal file. Then he gave me 
a call ·and said to come over. I went to his office and he locked 
the door. Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't 
let me hold it in my hands so to speak. So he read this case 
to me, this 1954 case to me, about the woman and so forth,* and 
then said that at that tirae they r:1ade an investigation of my 
previous residence. And they found out that while I was study­
ing at the Ir.stitute [cf International Affairs) and was living 
on Pervaya ~eschanskaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me; 
different girls, a new girl would visit me almos~ every week. 
This was in my file. Then this case that took place in 1954. 
And then in 1960--and, incidentally, GP~BANOV mentioned this to 
me also--the file said that I .·as drinking quite a bit, and for 
this reason I ha'd many fights with my wife. And that was all 
that appeared in my file. Nothing else, whatsoever, besides 
these things that I just mentioned.• 
b. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

1960 request to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for mecbers
