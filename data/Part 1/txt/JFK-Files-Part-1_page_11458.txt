clear that he was in touch with a t,'OLAOY or:;anization. N':methe­
less, no specific ex;>laration was gi'(en LIRltiG-3 of his s:,oosor 
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told t:-:at TO~KET "'~u.ld be 
seeing him for some months, since RO~'TON ... ,as leaving the country 
for an indefinite period. 
4. LIRHiG-3 was told that although TO~HET was trusted by 
ROWTON and collaborated ~Jith him, he represe:-:ted a differ~nt 
organization. LIRING-3 1r1a5 also told that altr:.ough he had in U·.e 
past been receiving bet..E:en 3,000.00 and 3,SC.Cl.00 Mexican! pesos 
per month on an infor:-,al basis, TORHET's ors;anization fei't that 
1,500 ~~xican pesos per month ($120.00) woulo t~ a fair salary at 
this stage of the operatior.. TOR~~T explained that he was ~ware 
of llrt1,;G-3's past activities directed against t,.e Cubans, and the 
# resultant problems which had arisen. It ... 1as ex?lained that 
11{ TORi~O::T1 5 interest ,~as in Central A-:-.erica'l revoiutionary acti·dties. 
In ,)~·ccr to deal with LliUNG-3 1 :; virtua! "burn.:0 11 status with the 
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central hrrerican contacts that 
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that 1-ie tnerefore .. ·as no 
longer directly involveo with any revolutionary groups or acti'lities. 
Nonet~less, LIRING-3 ... ,as di~ected to offer any assista~c.e which

leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had ~~de with FAR 
members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter 
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-3 .. ~s complete;,,, 
blacklisted in. all revolutionary circles beca 1;se of his pro~lems 
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information ~f value. 
S. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seer.ied in good s'pirits 
and he seei-:-ed to accep~ the turnover without any qualms •. Jndeed. 
he pointed out that the C1..bans had lost trust in him only after 
he had been given various tasks to co by ROw&ON which r.e .had known 
and warned in advance would cau~e suspicion. It was agre:ea that 
LIRING-3 1 s trc-ubles were not of his own making, but that :at this 
stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent 1 the 
existing problems. : 
' 6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone 
number and false name to ask for (Identity} to set up meeti,,gs 
w:th TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and 
a prearranged ?ickup ;x,int was decided upon. It should~ noted 
that tORHET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting ,"'ith 
LIRING-3, which means it ~as of course exposed to LIRING-,3. 
I 
7. Subsequent to this meetin~, LIRING-3 never inittated 
contact "'ith the Station. Although he ~ight have lost tHe ne~ 
telephone number he was given to use with TOR.MET, t'here i's no 
Indication he ever again trieJ to cal I ROWTON, '--ho was in Hexico 
for at least three weeks after the I July turnover to TORMEY.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, UIRING-3 
has In effect terminated himself. Given the nature of t~is case-­
the fact that LIRING-.3 was denounced in Cuban official ci;rcles as 
a RVROCK agent, the fa~t that LIRING-3 in over two ye.ar-s fwas never 
very productive and·now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break 
off contact--it has been ~e~lded to make n~ effort to reestablish 
contact w;th h;m. •1
