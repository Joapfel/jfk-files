REVISED MEMORA!t"DUM OF' ORAL COK'-!ITMENT 
1. ORPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who 
provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has 
receh•cd a Prc·:izicnal C:-....sr:.tional Approval, dated 2.3 1r1Alf b6-• 
Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project 
ORPHONE. 
2. ORPHONE/l's emplo}-ment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965, 
was originally formalized b-~ a Letter of Agreement for a period 
of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Cornmitment dated' 
1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as 
amended) since that date, ORPBOHE/l's employment continues on a 
month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a 
30-day notice. 
3. ORPHONE/1 receives the following financial entitlements: 
a. Compensation so computed as to give ORPHONE/1 a 
•tax-free• inc-om~ of $800 per month (this figure 
effective 1 July 1967). 
NOTE: The actual breakdown of ORPHONE/l's finances 
as carried on WOFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary 
and $70 per mont.li tax supplement withheld at Head-· 
quarters to discharge QRPHON'E/l's WOLADY tax 
obligation. These ~axes are remitted through the 
Covert Tax Com:rittee. This procedure was devised 
to honor the original •tax free• commitment made 
at the time of his recruitment and at the same 
time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY 
citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNF'ORT. 
b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel 
unless these are paid by other sources in which 
case WOFIR.~ will offset such outside reimbursement 
against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1. 
Since security considerations preclude processing ., 
of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera­
tional expenses, and as an added inducement to 
QRPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain 
confidential info•rmation of interest to WOFIRM, a 
small operational payment, as authorized by Chief, 
LCPIPIT will be made to ORPHONE/1 for each day 
during which he is required to be absent from his 
home on confidential business. 
NOTE: Write-off of the funds passed to ORPHONE/1 
is to be effected on the basis of the procedure 
, approved by Chief. LCPIPIT and COS/London. a copy 
• .• _:.-;;•-·of which is attached. This procedure is authorized 
••• in view of the security considerations applicable 
to QRPHONE/1 a.cd the need to limit the knowledge 
(. 
t 
.-, -
of this opei;ation within WOMACE. 
c. QRPHONE/1 is authorized to recei•,1e a non-accountable 
office allowance of $100.per month.
