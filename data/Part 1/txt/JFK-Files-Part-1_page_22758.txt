development of specific student Com.,aun1st and Ycut~ targets the Stat~on has 
already 11ned up. Both these sources have passed through an 1 n1.t:lal per-I od ot 
tra1 nin,- and have fully de111onstrated their rel 1ab111 ty and aMHty to ccxit1.nue 
to pertorm effectively via a cut-out. In handllnl a half-dozen sources; as 
VAIVADk has been do!ng, he reached the Hidts of reasonable span of cc:ntrol and 
has not had the t 1 me to give to suc:J new develo?mental work vn1.cb is his forte 
and upon vhicll 1. t .would be IIIO&t desirable to have h'Ul concentrate rather tiian'" 
upon the mere routine bandl1.ng of relatively tested sources,

whether or not 1 t is deci.ded that be return to Habana or sent to a· new oost. Io 
this eciunection the St.aUon wishes pa~nthet!cally to PQint out its defin1 te . 
interest in having VAlV:.DA reass1 gned to Habana tor at least one add1.ttonal year 
it possible, and to note that VAIVADA bas expressed a personal desire to that 
effect. 
S. Regardless of the decision a.a to t1m.lng of his travel, VAlVADA is 
proceeding to change his residence. He vi 11 try to obtain a sui ta':Jle house 
possessing a telephone, something he has lacked heretofore, thereby carry1.ng 
through plans previously reported to Headquarters in para:-:rapll 6 or HK!I-A-3144,

travel to Headquarters pr1or to about July 1957, it is recommended tnat hla 
trip be postponed untU that time.
