·Mexico City• in Dcce mbcr 1958 and January 1959, lt was con sidcrt.'1 appropriate 
for SCANTLL'!G to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Although this 
procedure defeats _some comrartmentatlo n principles, It was the only manner 
in which the Station coulJ mal main cff ici ency with the three operations Ii sted 
above. SCAi.'lTLrnG has known.the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA 
and LIE.VTRAP for scvcra 1 y cars. In fact, he w:is at one time the agent in 
charge of these three operations. 
5. Op eratioaal Methods Evolved During the Period• The VIDALES operation 
(s ~e parqg raph -1 (C) above) Indicated to th c Stat ion th c nccess lty for thorough 
briefings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target. Th is can 
hardly be dl.!scri.bcd as a new operational met hod, but It does serve to illustrate 
the minimum efforts thnt should be followed. The [onhcoming LL'lL\lE.i'lT IV 
.operation wherein SCANTLING must recru It the landlo:-d of the ta rgct's building 
is of fer ing SCANTLL'l G and rh e Stat ion th c opponuu ity to prcpa r ~ thoroughly for 
SCANTLlN G's recruitment pit ch. 111e excellent d ocum~ntation prt'p,,r ,xi by 
KU RIOT and .:.he story being created by SSA NTL! NG and the Station should increase 
che batting average onSCANTLING's cold approaches. (Sec Hlvl..MA-11366, 22 
October 1958, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on 
th is Subject). 
In a gen"ral sense, one other conclusion can te made about any Statior.•s 
support apparatus - where technical and photographic operations are possible, 
the utility of the information obtained is enhanced considerably by accurate, 
comprchen siw and t in!ely casing rep on.s. SCANTLING, as previously mentl oned, 
ls an excellent asset for this type of support. 
6. Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 Feuruary 1959. 
As of that~c SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3,600. 00 U. s. 
for two years. The Stat ion plans to raise his annual compensation to S-l,000.00 
U.S. No other significant administrative problems exist. 
7. Ou tlo ok for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued 
ut iliz::ition of SCANTLING in the s<1me manner as he is presently being used. 
The Sration will keep SCANTLING as .m independent asset and, It is hoped, resist 
the temptation to mrrke him a principal agent in charr;c of numerous sub-agents. It 
is believed th.'.!t SCANTLING is the t ypc of suppon asset t.hat can be wo rthwh ile 
to the Stat ion for many yea rs to come and that every cffor:· should I.le made to protect 
his security and ,·;tlue to KUBA RK.

8. Agent lntorm:uion - Aside from the agent intor,mation given in Ht\l.1.\•lA-11366 
22 October 1958, the only significant development was GERENDE's December 1958 
marriage to a U. s .. cducated girl of Dutch citizt.!nship. The$ ~,00.00 U. S. for the 
purchase of two ph•ne ~ickets .JS a wedding gift to GERENDE was designc:"d co 
impress GERE:\TIE wit.Ii. the fact that KUl.lARK thinks highly of him as an individual 
and that KUilARK has a great int1::res t in his i nte.lligen cc c.1ree r. GERfu~DE is at 
th c age and stage in life whc re he ls beginning to wonder just what the f murc holds 
for him. ln. the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE
