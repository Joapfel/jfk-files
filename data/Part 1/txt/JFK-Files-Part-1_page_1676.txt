a denied area.· His exemplary conduct and personal courage 
during the resulting two and one-half years incarceration 
permitted the maintenance of a very difficult cover situation 
and successful extraction of all three men. 
Upon his return, Mr. C4rist joined the Office of Research 
and Development soon after its inception, assisting in the 
definition and establishment of the various divisions. Under 
his early guidance, the over-the-horizon radar program developed 
finally into an operational system. His sensitivity to the 
needs of Agency operational elements based upon his experience, 
his technical expertise and his dedicated desire to broaden 
the technological capabilities of the Agency precipitated . 
his development of a major coordinated program of accelerated 
R&D to provide the clandestine services with a number of new 
audio surveillance techniques o~ which the laser probe is an. 
example, and his conception and direction of the Microtechnology 
R&D program. Within this program, the success of the micro­
power transistor led to the award of Medals of Merit to two 
scientists under his supervision. Other progeny of the micro­
technology concept are three novel intelligence gathering 
systems to function in the air, in space, and in the sea 
environments, one of which is approaching operational status. 
Mr. Christ has also been responsible for pioneering efforts 
in the area of Audio Surveillance Countermeasures, first pro­
posing the application of computers to the problem. 
Mr. Christ's imaginative leadership and inspiration to 
those working with him, his broad scbpe of interest, his resource­
fulness, and philosophical devotion to the cause of the Agency 
and the United States have provided this Agency with an _individuaJ 
whose unique efforts and accomplishments over his 20 years 
service are worthy of this recognition.
