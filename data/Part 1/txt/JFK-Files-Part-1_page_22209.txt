c. It ;,,as physically in:poi;sible at the time. for UOS~KO . 
to be reco:rrr.ended for a.,d accepted into State Security, as he 
has told ~s, all in one rn~nth, March 1953. (If one accepts 
his earlier version that he had ~is talk •1th KOBU-...OV in Jan­
uary or F:!bruary, ~is a::cou.,t is similarly impossi?le beca•Jse 
J(OBtrLOV ,,;as not then in State i,ecurity.) It wpuld normally 
have take."'l a n:•Jch longer ti.Jr.e, bJt in addition ·t~ 'this it vas 
a pericd of reorga~ization and the personnel staff was r.o~ 
actively condu~ting tt:eir _.ork at that time, and per,nanent 
staff officers were r.~t sure that they would retain their 
positions. 
·d. In March 1953 !-:OSE:a:o 'o'as already twent~•-fivE: ar,d a 
half years old ar.d or:ly a merr.~r of t:1e Ko:r.so:r.ol. He had no 
reco~~ndation for Party :..~.bership anci could not become a 
me::tber for a full year because of his tra:1sfer from one ser­
vice (GRU) to anotner. It is impossible that State Security 
110·.1ld a::::cept hirn kr.o.ing in ad\•ance that. or, his birthday he 
would be t.enty-six years old ar.d ...,itho·Jt either Komsomol or 
Party membership. Even !or tl:e son of a Hir.ister, the Secre­
tary of the i<omsomol Cornmito;ee of the KG9 would have to talk 
With the Pe1·sonnel Cffice and uould not givt.: a r"2con1mendation 
for his acceptance, especially for the Int~rnal Counterintel­
ligence (Second ::hief) Directorate. In the case of a son of 
a Minister and one ~ho is r~comm~nded bv KOB~LOV, the secre­
tary ~ould request from NOSEriKO a recor.rner.dation for Party 
membership from the members of the Corrmunist Party where 
NOSU.-XO usE;d to work, i~ this case the GR~. In this way the 
secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOS~'XO 
would become a candidate ~r of the Communist Party during 
the next year. • 
"HOW'ev,r, even acceptir.g that despite these obstacles and 
•.contradictions the KGB ~ould have accepted him, or.e'must aiso 
reme::iber (according to ?,OSENXO' s own statement.s) that :msE?-.-XO' s 
file contained the follo-ir.g negative points.* They are serious 
factors and certain of them alo:1e ~ould be enough to cause the 
rejection: thP. totality makes it difficult to believe that at a 
time of crisis in the State Security orga.,s anyone would take the 
respor.sibility of accepting him: 
a. Subject ~as already ~arried and divorced before entry 
into State Security. 
b. He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter 
a.,d TEL::GIN had been arrested by State Security and ..-as in 
Jail the day that Subject entered State Security. 
c. NOSENKO said that there was a file on ~?OSE:-Jl<O's 
father in which compromising material was coll~c~ed on_ 
Subject's far.iUy. NOSENKO agreed that one piece ~f infor­
mation that would-have-been in· this fi-le ·_.a·s·the·ract-that° 
his maternal grandfather died ir. a Soviet prison while under 
sentence as a counter-rev~l~tion~~ 
d. The social status bclckground in the life of Subject's 
mother was nobility .
