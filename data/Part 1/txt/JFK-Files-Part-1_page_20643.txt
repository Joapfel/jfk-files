• 3. Wi.• belirve that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System arc superior to the 
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, 'there are a few situations In which 
nn employee.at the itme of .. etireme11t may .have so many years of service (alm·ost 37) that he 
would receh·c a higher annuity under the civil Servke System. Because of this, the pollcy 
decision has bem made thata pnrtlr.lpant In the .QrganlzaUon System who would receive a 
higher annuity ui1.:!er the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retlre­
mml. apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus, 
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor In deciding whether you rrgard your 
designntlon as a participant adverse to your best interests.
