tary i~tor~ation frG~ his sub-Fourccs, and h~ WJS never able to

he named as sub-sources. 
Io describing his acquisition of iuforr:.atbn on the- r.inth 
case, "SASHA," SO~lS!CO has c~ntradictcd !11'.:\sclf: He first sa!d he 
had learned flbo:;t ·•sASIIA" tro:i SI!:\! i'APIS, providing lcr.gthy and 
involved expla~ations of how he bccao~ ~cquainted ~ith !HALYAPIS 
at the tlir.e c,f the- latter's rctire111c-1:t fro'.:\ the: KGB in 1962. Later, 
~nder interrogation, S03E~KO did not recall his statc-rac~ts that 
~IV,LYAPI.S was the original so~rce ot the ''S.~SHA'' st·:,rr, first 
attrit~ting it to ot~ers and later saying that hr. could not r@~es­
bc·r wher. and frog •ho.a he first heard it, but S11.-\LY.~PIX and others 
bad talkc-d about it. This was despite thC' fact that by the time 
be heard of "SASHA" he had already met and agrc-ed to cooperlte 
with CIA; furthC'reore, .,..ht'n as1wd if "S.~511.-\" was an in:portant h:ad, 
~1e .. breed tl:at it was a serio~s mattC'r. Except for this one 
occasion he l:ad consistently failed to arprcciatc the significance 
of such a le:ad, ir.dic-3t ing th;st it was nut considered icportant in 
the. KGB. 
·.Also castlr,g doubt on his sourcing of ''.S,\SH,\" ls t~c fact 
that,· -in his first rr!ference to "S,\SllA" and the Cutian ::issile crisis 
of ('lctcber 1962, !;osrsKO said he had l,:,arncd of this item fr::,m 
SHALYAPI~. whereas later ho said it was r.ot from Sli.\LYAPIS (but ·te 
could cot ident if)• a1-othcr source fro:s w~o:n • he had hcar-d this de­
tail).

~hen he was supposedly ~orking in t~e First Chief Di1ectora:~•s 
American Depart~ent against Anerican tar~et3, SOSESKO retracted 
his initial stat~~~;1t and said that GUY. somehow got ir. contact 
with hi2, not as a KGB officer but sinply as an acquai~tance.
