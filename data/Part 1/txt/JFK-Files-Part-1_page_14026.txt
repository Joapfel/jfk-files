3, VIERA Linarr.s s~rves as Chari:e· d'Affoires in the absence of_ _ 
Ambassador ALARCON Quesada, Up to this point, ·neither the Base nor LNERGO 
have been able to state -e\·identially as to whether VIERA or JIMENEZ Escobar 
is the sucessor to Chafik Hc:>mero SAKER Zcnni (left PCS October 1967) as the 
DGI Station Chief. We both, however, t<'n<l to regard JI}.•!ENE:Z as carrying the 
most weight in terms of opt>rational actidty and in terms of effectiveness. Now, 
with _the arrival of BOZA Hidalgo-Gato (who ·rcpoi-tecily has been .the deputy to 
Ramon OROZA Nai:er;in, head of U.S. oper;\tions for the DCiI, per our last 
.informati9n), it remains to be seen if BOZA figures higher in the local hierardt/ 
than VIERA or JIMENEZ. With JIMENEZ, VIERA, BOZA, _and PRENDES 
'-·Gutierrez., the local_ DGI station has more r:\nkin·g talent than has b.-:cn the_ norm, 
The Cubans do not necessarily slot their intc-lligcnce· officers in }.fission titles 
equiv_alen~ to their true 1·anks and rcspO!lSib_ilitics~-
