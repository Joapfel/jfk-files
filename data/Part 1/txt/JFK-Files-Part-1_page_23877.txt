CONTINUATION Of

his naterial; to-the Lon~on Station, however, it aprears to be not only 
rather massive but d&tailed as well. P~ do not ~oubt that he vlll be 
ca~tght out from tice to time on facts, and perhaps interpretations as w9ll. 
But the totality ot his information - and the whole performance was without 
notes - is astonishing. 
5. Several poin~s should be not4d. First of all, a conaoious effort 
vaa •~e to show GDISON that his ooillllents on the American scene were not 
beint; mad& a matter of record. (I took notes durine our talk, l!lnd always 
stopped making notes when ~~oh a topic oame up.) This ia, as !(ULPA not9d in 
O~V ~-1903 of 12 Febr\J.ary 1965, an area of aenei tivi ty vi th G~SON. The only 
• tiaee that OIBSOI' really bec!U!le emotional vere vben he talked about the 
American scene, hie involvement, an4 the involve:Ant of hie oloee aaeooi,tAs. 
An4 he kept reverting to the topic, and hie involv~~ent in it, thro,~gbout 
our ooavereRtiona. We did not share r~1.PA1 e impression that GIBSON1 e 
clieeatiafaotion with the state of racial relations in America m&lcee him 
generalJ.y anti-American. !ie ~ B!l.,Y that he would. not like to be living 
in America for the coming year; but in the oontext of one vho does not nab 
to be caught up in a period. of growing violence, whioh ornsoH appears not to 
believe to be the solution to the proble~. Re states, "! osn understand 
how they feel that vay, ! can recognize the problems, but I sure don't know 
vhat the eolution to th~ prcble~ is." His judg;i;ente on Negroes in the fr~nt 
of the raoial struggle (WFtl.ter Bove, ~alcolm X, etc.) reflect not only ar. 
intimacy vith the problem and a genuine concern, but also a generally 
reasonable and real understanding ot Mny of the forces at wol'lc. G!3SON' 
tends to condemn individuals - he a::,aree no sympathy for the !BI, uniier­
atandably - but he does not appear to condemn the l'nited States as a w~ole, 
nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the aame time, he 
ID&kea no phoney protestations, either. 
6. Regarding Cuba, G!llSO~ showed a si~ilar eaoti~nal involvement (be 
aoknovledtes "aiy pro-Castro bias") but, Yi thal, manneea to ei ve a more 
balances portrayal c.f the situation 't?lan s:ian,y rabidly anti-Castro 
commentators. (~ubat and Cuban matters, were aleo similarly low-keyed by 
me during our talks. J 
7. Vbere ll!BSOW really oomea into bis own, and really astonishes vi.th 
the-'breadth of bis. personal information and understanding, (and largely, it 
appears, without the s!Ufte rersonal involvement and bias) ie in Afric&n 
affairs (especially in left-wing fields), European Trotekyiste and 
COIDJIIW11ets and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international 
f:ont organizations. Similarly he apreara to be informed on oertain CbiCom 
efforts at subversion and prop&£anda in Latin America. 
8. Rather as if reading our thoughts, G!llSO?f offered to recruit hi­
self. He didn I t get too specific, and neither did ve. But be did make it 
quite olear that he would be rilling to collect information for us, knowing 
only that ve were ODYC~,. probably euapeoting that ve vere IC!m.ARK, and 
probably equ&.lly doubtin~ (because ne knows the difference( that we were 
ODKNVY. Hie motivations can be compiled fr0111 hie own words. He has for 
BOll!e time been unable to find a suitable job here in London9 He baa economic 
preaaurea working on him - nov exacerbated by the fact that hie vt.fe has 
caused her brother to withdraw eOl!le of the support that he l.a4 been 
providhlg. Venal? Opportunistic? Or someone who has a wife and two kids 
to support, and no job for the past eif!bt mcntha? GIBSON aaknovledgee that 
he has become aoMewnat bored with the •n,ro-biology" of chasing petty 
ideologioal differences, the kind that l'l&Ce factions of au me~bers or less. 
At the aame time, be acknowledges that be has to have a job, and that his 
• aooess to and knowledge of these persona and. groups 'U'C: 111&rketable 
oommodi tiea. His prefel'f!nce, he ea.ya, would be to he.VA a Dice quiet 
joUl'T!alietic or publio rel!'-tione jc.b here, b1.1t hia efforts to find such a

or an ODYC,Y.~ ~~ncy, but ~e is certain t~e.t he could never e9t the requisite 
security ol-.erance. Still, obviously, he suspects that an "irregular" arm 
of Ol>l'tln, such as we, mi&ht be able to work aomethi~ out.
