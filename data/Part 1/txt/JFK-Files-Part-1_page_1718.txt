Foster Wood was a relatively close high school friend off}_trattoii)-
. during mutual attendance at Geor~e1Mason High School, Falls Church, 
Virginia, during 1957 to 1959. ~trattoi£}described Wood as an 
average high school student who had no particular ·problems with 
the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the 
father and mother of Wood. 
@tiatton]became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made 
occasional visits to their home during the above period of time. 
The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living 
in Falls Church. Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood 
split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on 
Columbia Road, Washington, D.C.

Wood expressed extreme opposition to military schools. . 3 • • ]

for approximately a year, during 1959 to 196 , he did not actually 
see Wood but advised that after this period~in-which he did not 
see Wood he has had a number of contacts with Wood, many of which

"father at the invitation of Wood, and on this occasion came into 
contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom fstra t to0 J

that time Wood l~ded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was
