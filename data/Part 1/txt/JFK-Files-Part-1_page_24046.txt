1. At their meeting on 4 September QRPHONE/1 submitted a 
report to RODIGAST on his hospitalization for hepatitis. Attached 
to his report is a copy of this medical record with results of 
blood and urine analyses written in Serbo-Croatian. We are 
forwarding a copy of the report under separate cover for evaluation 
by the Medical Staff. We are interested in having as thorough as 
possible an evaluation made of ORPHONE/l's illness in order that 
we may assure ourselves of his condition and the degree to which 
he ought to be active in the forthcoming months. We will appre­
ciate it if Headquarters will pursue this matter with the Medical 
Staff and advise us of its findings and recommendations. 
2. Also forwarded under separate cover is a memorandum 
prepared from RODIGAST's notes which elaborates upon QRPHONE/l's 
symptoms.
