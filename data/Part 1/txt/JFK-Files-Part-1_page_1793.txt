The DD/P ha.a advised us of hia desire to mcri;e the Covert 
.Action .StaU with the International Crganh:atio:is Division. While 
this is contrary to the trend of divesting staffs of operational duties, 
we nevertheless do not observe any major reasons against 9uch & 
merger and believe that it should be tried out ln accordance with 
the DD/P's wishes.· 
Central Su:pport Stall 
We recomm_.!~d that the DD/P draw together into a Central. 
Support Stafi control of pe~sonnel and other support matters cur-
' rently decentralized to the divisions and etaU:t in o::-dcr to locate 
these function& directly under him. 
Special Task Force Operation9 
• 
We recom.mend the creation of an organizational entity to 
be kno ...... n as "Special Task ~"orce Operations" reporting directly . 
to the DD/P, which shall be activated a.Ad deactivated upon need. 
and which shall be the command 1n~chani:nn for handling such 
projects as the Cuban operatio:i which demands the ~reation of an 
organization from Agency-wide assets.
