other wires he had observed in the Embassy as well as on the 
· security measures on th.e top floors. Like V.OR'OliYEV, "DMlTRI­
YEV" had no direct connection with t~e ltilitary .. Attaches.

In September 1964 NOSENKO wa!i· sho~n·a series· of 260 bio­
graphk c.ards on Soviet ci tizuns e:nplO:,yJ?d. by the American Em;_ 
bassy in Moscow. Each card contained· a· phot·ograph .of the per-
son involved and short biographic notes, including his pame 
and Job in. the Embassy. ThA first tiine>he went through these.•· 
cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see onl_y._ the photographs; NO-· 
SENKO did not identify the pbotog·raphs of SW.--"YRYEV and KUKOJ.EV 
but said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that 
he thought his name was VOROBYEV • When shown Uie biographic 
information on SHNYRYEV and KUY.OLEY, he identified each of them 
as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in th~ American De­
partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously. 
In thf' case of SH~YRYEV, wh"n i;.hown the bic 6raphic information, 
which listed SIINYRYEV as "chauffeur for the Military At tac he," 
NOSENKO exclaimed: "Oh :ny God, this is my own agent," Ho 
later said it was a good photograph of SH~-YRYB\'.

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible 
• for operations against American Military (Ar~y) Attaches sta­
tioned in Moscow,.;, his maiu task was not to recruit them but 
rather was to prevent the attaches from collecting intelligence. 
He has used this statement abouc his main task (identical with 
that of other U.S. Embassy Section officers working against 
the Army and Navy Attaches) to BUpport his claim that no U.S. 
Armed Forces Attaches ~ere recruited by the KGB from 1953 un­
til his defection in 1964. He has also said that this is one 
reason he knows relatively little about the personal back­
grounds of his various targets during this period--tho empha­
sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment­
purposes. Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache per­
sonnel for whom he was directly responsible during .1954 and 
1955, NOSENKO gave the following names: "MICKELSON, MEARNS, 
RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BE~SON, MULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA."** His 
knowledge. of the activities of these targets and of KGB action 
against them, coupled with information from other sources, is 
discussed in the following paragraphs. 
4Naval Attaches ~ere handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO­
SENKO said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA­
NOV. When CHUlL"..'l'OV left the section in early 1954, he turned 
over the Air At tac he files to PANKRATOV, v.·ho turned them over 
later in the year to KHRENOV. 
••This is the order given by NOSENKO. The list comprises two 
generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and ~s neither in al­
phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow. 
It is, however, in descending order of rank from Colonel !dlCKEL­
_SON through Captain MULE·to'Chief Warrant Off.leer CARDELLA. 
Questioned about these officers· in a different·context, NOSENKO 
indicated knowledge of their ranks. Not mentioned by NOSENKO 
was George VAN LAETHEM, Assistant Army Attache in Moscow from 
August 1951 to August-1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said. 
he was responsible for work against the miiitary attache office).
