L,· I. Didn't. you know or r~m~mber how-Oswald's vl11a ·w~11 proceuc_d and 
fro~ what country Os~•3ident~~cd the US.SR? Is It po,.sible that ho· .. · 
entered the USSR on a ''podvisnaya" visa? 
V z. You previously said th;tt )"OU saw Oswald's visa application, but you could 
not say from what country Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, Is 
it po•uible that Oswald rc-ceived his visa.llpplica.tion in ~oine other European 
" 
country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without 
contacting the Soviet cO:.--:sul_ate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the 
possibility that is d('S(':ribed above?· U so, when did you hear it and from 
whom? 
V 3. On 3 July 196 4 you su:ot-d that you have set-n Oswald's anketa (visa 
application). Do rou· r,miember what was in that ankcta? Did you read 
the anketa? W11at did )'\.'tl mean that. you s.1.w the anketa? Was it in the 
name Lee Harv"y o~w.\l:!. or was there ,Jnother name? Did you see the 
name of the person w'hi:' signed the anketa?
