S B C R P. T HVCA • 18070 
• CIPRNCR-4 continued to be a nHahle, steady Station 
asset who enjoys the confidence oE and has a very close 
vorUn,t relatlonf.hip v_lth CIFCNCR•l. rturtnr most of the 
reporting· period, he was in charRe or the· su"eillance of_ .. 
the newly arrtyed Soviet dtpJmaats and was quick to pass 
to the Station any lnfonation co•in~ into his possession 
:-.which he felt would be or value to Jl:LANCB. Because most 
of his tl111e was devoted .to c.,verage o·r the Soviets, he was 
unable to Jfve the ·station the large variety and number of 
reports·which in the past ·hss been hts custom. The Statton 
continues to thlnt very hithly of CIPENCE-4 and looks 
forward to a contlnuln1 procluctiTe relationship with him.
