SECTION D CERTffIC:\ TIO:"-: A'.'JD COMMENTS 
3. Comments of Reviewing Official 
l concur thoroughly with Mr. Winters' evaluation of Mr. McCord's 
vigor :.a::d enthusiasm, skill and jud,:nn•nt. I would add to this
1 
that he 
has derr.<mstratccl extraordinary in~t.':a:ity and h•adership in ,;u,pervising 
the -de·/t,joprr..t\nl of several new and \"aluable techniques in the._• ·counter-
' mce13'..ll'l:'l! field. However, I would rat._• him ortly "Profici<'nt" :in 
Speci!i_c Duty Number 6, for I b<'li<'\.;. that ht\ has not been as c'ffe..:tive 
a.'I he :night be in liaison and coordination with other compont•nts of 
the Ir.t•dligem:c Community rcp.-escr:l<'d on the Technical Comnjitt<'e. 
This ill Dnfortunatc, for it detracts ·irom his outstanding performance 
in al! ,,t.b,!r ckmcnts of his assignt'd rt·sponsibilitfrs. He must work 
on irr.pr<.wing thei;c rdationships and he has been cou11s<'led to this 
effect by ~is current B,.'.pervisor.
