1. The subject or the recruitment of a phydcal suneillance team in 
the United Stat1;-s tor use in tle:tlco as well as ..,ther areas within WU 1-.as 
lo~ ooen a topic ot discussion at Headquarters. While it is palpably ri­
.diculoua to corusider the use of a surveillance tea111 recruit.~d and trained 
ln the United State:, and based in ~:exico. operationally in other areas in 
Latin Aiiier1ca. there is som~ merit, at least in theory, to the proposal in 
2a ot re!ez~nce. Although one of the basic !sctors in the 1:i.11.ke-up ol &l'\Y 
surveillance tr:11.111 111 tr.at ite mer.:be1·s must be indigenous to the area ot op­
eration. it would he possible to recruit such a te8JII as e~ested in 2a and 
use thls tca111 in Mexico. However. I believe this would be tir.,e-con.eu.,dng and 
very e.xpensive for the !ollowfog reasonsa 
a. Machine runs have already been made to spot -,andldates within 
the Agency ot the Mexican/American type for th11 .I..ll!ESA/Ll:-:US1' project. with 
negative results. 
b. In order to ll!Elke it attractive to young men of the caliber 
desired, ve would have to offer &01118 kind of a career with a starting salary 
ot s0111BWhere between tho GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances. 
i-.'ithout attempting t,:, even estlmate this cost one can see that tha tigures tor 
Q team ot fifteen would run into six digits. 
c. It would take a lllinu:um ot three 1t0nths 
into tha eoutbwest are~ and spot, contact. develop and 
fifteen.

d. Oncn a teBJ!l ef suitable candidates was recruite4' it would 
then take a mini.Jin.un of another three months to train these cand.1dates in 
ba~ic trade craft and surveillance techniques. 
e. Upon co!llpletion of the training period, the candid.ates would 
have to be moved individu;,.l]J' into the area o~ operc:~ion to becowi 1"8.lllili!lr 
with thiu area. the language, people,, and atlllospbere in general. etc. This 
would take another three montbe min.iJIIUIII. 
t. Arter completion of the area !arniliarization period, the te&Dl 
would have to be asse~bled and put tnrough variou.s surveillance exercises as 
a unit to cheek the~ out prior to actual operatloll,d,_
