' 1. This is an Anm\al Fitn<'ss Report on th<' above employee 
for the period ending 31 Mar~h 19&6. _Mr. O'Conn,·11 is· currently 
assigned a$ Assistant O..•puty Dir,~ctor of Security (!OS), a position_ 
he .issumcd in Scplcmb .. ·r 1965. H,• was promot<'<I- t,) GS-16 at the 
time he assumed th<.•S<' responsibilitie!I on the basis of a long per­
iod of distinguished s,•rvict• that was culminated in his assignment 
as Regional Security Oifict"r for the Far East. 
2. As iny Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re­
sponsibilitr for the dire.-tion of the invcstigath·e and operational 
support pr;J~rams of the Office of Security. He brings to this posi­
tion a wealth of expcri,•nce, sound management conc~pts, and the 
ability to mi'et and soh-,• c01nplex administrative problems. I have 
implicit c,:miidcnce in· his _iudginent, and he enjoys thc full respect 
of all or his associat,~s. :Mr. O'Connell has mad,• an outstanding 
_contribution to the mana):en1t>nt and direction oi IOS at a time when 
our work load is the high'L"st in history. He is susc-eptible to inno­
vation and has a keen ap?r'~dation of cost factors in meeting his 
manager.ial.responsibil_itics. He has a unique ability to put work 
problen1s in the proper foe-us, .:lo,•s his job without fanfare, and 
mai~tains extremely hi!,":h standards of work .iccomplishment. 
3. ~Ir. O'Conn,•ll's pcrformancc fully justiiies his promotion 
to the Sll!)<'r~rade level and, in the relatively short time he has_ been 
in his currcnt ast1ignment, his on~rall iwrforn1;u1cc is con;;idcrcd· • 
unusually strong with many outstanding aspects.
