to the U.S. Embassy i:1 Moscm,; in connection with this visa request, 
NOSENKO added, it was henceforth necessary for him to use his 
true narne far all travel abroad. 
c. The Cuba TOY (1960) 
In November 1960, after and as a r~!:1Jlt of the cancelfation 
of his planned trip tot.he United Sta:cs, NOSE~KO travelled with 
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. Ee first men­
tioned this trip on 11 Ju~e 1962, during his second meeting with 
·c1A. His account of his activities was given in answer to the 
question c,f whcth<:!r he had ever visited Germany: "I have been 
in Germany. Yes, y~s. I was in Cuba in '61. Well, as NIKOLAYEV. 
I was the:re a month and a half. Thi;; was when your Embansy 1,,as 
there and we wanted to prepare* ... Well, I looked it ever to 
see what kind of people you hdd ~orking there. They asked me 
to prepare, so to speak, 2n accounting on how things were going. 
I arrived th"'rc a:1d il~;,cd how they were war.king against y.:Ju, just 
on ye,,u. Everyone there is .,._.on~ing for you. O,,e, two, three, 
five d~ys went by ... I had unli~it~d funds, any a~cunt. I could 
go to any res:.:1•ii·.c,r1t, an~• s!-.ow. So tht:t's how it was v:ith me. 
The fellows r.:::ported: 'lie {an h:nerican] is there.' t-;y mission 
was to 9et a general pie tt)r.e. Nc,t for one, two, or three days, 
but for a mo:1t!-, or t\;o, to provide rin opin.i.cn... I worked pretty 
cleverly on t::em. Ile [the i"11erican] would c;o to a restau:-ant. 
T;iey wc.uld say to n:e: 'lie is at such-and-such a restaurallt and 
can be observed there.' I would go and observe him ~n the mir­
ror or soffiehc,~. I am sitting in the restaurant, d~inking, and 
that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc., 
etc. That is, I would begin to feel if he has the mark of an 
intelligence officer. . .. Bt.:t this ·.-,as not enough £or rc.e. I 
would go again and again. I would see that, yes, he is an in­
telligence officer ... We were asked to share our experiences 
with therii [the CuLans]. r:.ey didn't k!low a thing... They had 
turned all intel.licJE.nce ,,.-ork over to the Communist Party. The 
Communist Party cowplicatcs it." 
In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in 
1962 the subject of his trip to Cuba came up again: NOSENKO re­
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba 
and that his function there was th~t of security officer. 
Question: When did you travel to Cuba? 
NOSENKO: 1960, November arid December 1960. 
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV? 
NOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO. I will explain 
how this happened. I was supposed to go to America, 
sometime in Nover.iber, with a group from Gosplan, 
automotive specialists, etc. Data had already been 
submitted for coordination and, in particular, my 
name had been given to the American Ern=iassy there 
(Moscow]. But the American Embassy announced that 
this delegation could be accepted, but a little 
I 
, -.,.t, later. And my passport had already been issued. 
Mypassport had already been signed authorizing travel 
abroad, but it was a service passport, not a diplomatic 
one. And at this moment a delegation was supposed to 
The U.S. Embassy in Havana was officially closed on J January 
19:61.
