Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV contacts; SOSENKO 
told CIA on 26 January 1964: ~You have sh~w~ cori~iderahl~ 
interest in him [ BOLSlL\KOVI, even after, his retut"n to the 
Soviet L:'nion ... be~ause all this was done by by-passing .CIA." 
Ho said on 1 i'ebruary 196-l: "It was pretty obviou·s,-·th·a·t • 
this relationship between OOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had 
nothing to do with CIA, and CIA was not witting of it. • It 
was at the perscnal desire of Bob Kenr.,edy. 1' The KGB 
determined that CI A was uta-..·are ·of the exchange between 
KE:nncdy and BOLSHAKOV, ~OSE~KO reported, because when BOL­
SHAKOV was substq~cntly invited to a rcceptio~ at the U.S • 
. . Embassy_ in Moscow, two CIA officcrs--Kenneth A. KERST &nd 
Malcolm A. TOON•-tried to elicit infor~ation from him 
about his relationship with President Kennedy. "The most. 
important thing" they had tried to find m:t, according to 
NOSENKO, was whett.er the Presid.:-n? and •• BOLSIL-\KOV had met 
per!'1onally. Altho:.1gh BOLSlL\KOV did ·r.ot ad.:iit the fact to 
them, he did have one meeting with President Ke:rnedy--"he 
was brought in a car ... and was taken through a back door 
into the iVhite House," NOSE~'XO said. 
NOSENKO reported that Will :nm lfiALTO~ visited llosc<>w ·,tn Decem­
ber 1963 and at that ti~e w~nt to BOLSHAKOV, whom'he had 
·previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy. Part of 
their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy's 
future political plans: ''WALTON said that Bobby ••• did not 
expect at present to become a candidate for the vice presi-
depcy. He was, perhaps, according to WALTOS, thinking of 
running for Governor of ~lassachusctts ..• " ~OSENKO said he 
felt that there -.ere "some feelers sent out on the part of 
WALTON--not exactly questions, but just A passing of opinion. 
WALTON was trying to sou~d them out, but I think that evP.ry-
tbing was left d thout an an;.wer ••.. My personal opinion, was 
that these things were told to WALTON so that he could pass 
them ·on as, so to speak, Booby's plans for the futllre." 
·Another topic covered in th~ WALTO~-B01.SHAKOV discussions, 
HOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy.•• 
"As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion--and ·bis opinion re­
flected the opinion. of the Kennedy family-~tbat there was 
no--Russta11-tnvolvement --10~ the murder-'-of-·the-PJ'esident.-· No· 
suspicion at all."

NOSENXO proposed two plans whereby the KGB could take 
over the GRU's channel to President, Kennedy. .Under the 
first of these plans, the Soviet fdi.nister of Justice would 
personally invite the Attorney General to come7 ·tci 'the Soviet· 
Union. There the KGB would "set him up. in private. living, 
quarters,. give bi11 ev~i-ythiag be wants .•• so that be would be
