1. As usual the first month of 1969-featured a large number of rumors 
uking the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community. While we normally tend 
to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they 
relate to GPVALlANT. 
2. The first of these rumors deals with a~r . .:'.!!P _ which has pre­
suubly been formed for the pur-pose of t!)'ins to deal through GPVALIANT, 
Aang those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos, 
Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly meets every Thurs­
day at different houses. The last meeting in January was held at the home 
of Lincoln Rodon. At this mef'~ini Prio presumably stated that Butari was 
a better contact·to G.,VALIANT than is Emilio Nunez _Portuando. The genenl 
consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business 
partner of Bebe Roboso and everypne knows Reboso's influence with GPVALlANI'. 
The I\DIIOr mill has it that the.group intends to pretend that it -~'lvors 
political and democratic: solutions to the PBRUMENproblem but that they 
really seek armed intervention. • ln this same conn,ction Father O'Farril 
has recently told AMPALM-~ that AM_BlDDY-1 is once more connected with tiOFlRM 
and that AMCORE-2 has joined him. - The rumor mill says further that AMBlDDY-1 
and AMCORE-2 are planning· to open training camps once again with the tacit 
encouragement of the·-above group. According to AI4PALM-4 O'Fani.l himself .. 
does not agree with the version of AMBlDDY-1 and Aft1CORE-2 wanting to estab­
lish training camps. O'fanil feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking 
for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union. 
s. WIBALDA has picil:ed up information quite similar ta that learned 
thTOUgh AMPAUl-4. He also has reported the existence of this 1Toup and 
said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms 
and equipment to ovr.:.::..:~row AMfflUG-1. According tc WIBALDA important mem­
bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor., and Ortacloxos are in­
volved even thoi~gh these organizations themselves an not participating
