A collapse o·f the grand 
·coali_tion in ,Donn either before 
-or after 1969 and a return by' 
the SPD to ·opposition positions 
would signify more than a passing 
cabinet eris i~. In· the past, 
parties 'tended to harden into 
intrdnsigence, committed to par­
ticul.ar ideol_ogical and material 
interests;· and unable to reach 
pragmatic compromises-with each 
other. I1& recent years, West 
German politicians have tried 'to 
break with this 'tradition and 
to work 0.1 the cons_ensus p_rin-. 
ciple. A failure of these _ef- _ 
forts would have s·erious ·1mpli-' • 
cations. If-.:as docs not '·seem-
• likely at p!"esent-.-the three·· 
major parties were unable to 
form a majorit"y go·✓crnment, this 
might lead to severe "instability 
and the discrediting of par­
liamencary government. 
Bonn and Weimar 
Many misleading analogies 
have been drawn.between the Donn 
and Weimar republics. One Weimar 
precedent ~ay help, however, to 
expl~in why some _o~servers view . 
the coalition ·prob'lem seriously. 
In· March 19 30, another grand 
coalition with SPD participation 
colfapsed ov;,:r ·the ·citi,est1on of 
.. ·cuts in unemployment insurance, 
leading to '.the formation·· 'of a 
conservative majority government 
1:1n<.1er Heinr'ich ·Bruening •. Bruening 
was later replaced by the reac-,· 
tionary Franz von Papen, who in 
turn was f~llowed first by a wire-,., 
pulling general., Kurt von Schlei­
.:her, and ·then by Adolf Hitler. 
The worst aspect of the SPD with­
drawal was that it made the par­
liament ineffective and power-
less. 
Once minority _government was 
embarked on, supported by presi­
dential prerogatives, there was 
no effective test for legitimacy 
·except the will of Hindenburg by 
then susceptible and old. The 
Nazis ultimately came t.:, power, 
not by a majority vote, but through 
the paralysis and impotence of the 
constitutional system and through 
intrigues in the presidential 
palace on the part of those, espe­
cially Papen and Schleicher, who 
thought they _could "use" Nazi 
mass supporL 
In contrast to the 30s, 
the presidential powers now are 
far weaker,• and aside from all 
the other factors inhibiting a 
recurrence, the Weimar precedent 
itself must influence SPD leaders 
\n Bonn. They are 7omµlete_ly 
committed personally to the pres­
ent coalition. A decision to 
go into opposition is unlikely 
under Brandt and Wehner.
