NOSEMKO reported, and on this basis the KGB suspected that •• :.,. ,i: 
-~ SRA.:OIOV might be an Am~r lean ager.t. NOSE~KO descrihe~··the 
various ways he had tested these suspicions in Genev11 •• He 
first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications 
that he passed it on to American contacts. Next, SHAKHOV_ was 
; !~· 
told to perforci countcrsurvcillancc tasks during & meeting _by· 
NOSE.NKO with an i:na~inary agent, v.-hile other KGD officers 
checked for signs that SIIAKHOV had forewarned the Ar:iericnns 
ab:>ut the oeeting. Finally, KOSE!\KO reveal eel to SHAK!lOV tho 
location of a KGB "de:id drop" and checked bnck five dnys later 
to see whether the s~ecially prepared ~aterial~ which hnd been 
placed in it had been di~turbcd in any way. NOSE~KO's con-
clusion froo all this, he told CIA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-
solutely free of suspicion, and it was his int~ntion to report 
this finding when he returned to KGD Headquarters. 
On later occasions NOSESKO reported that SHAY.HOV had 
previously served with the Ministry. of Foreign Affairs in the 
United States and that durin~ this period he acted a8 an agent­
l'ecruiter for the KGB. In 1966 ~OSENKO named one person who'.'1 
SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in th<.? United States, -
~ SHA KHOV, according to NOSENKO, was not and never 
haa been a KGn officer. Asked why ~IIAKHOV wns p~rmitted to 
travel abroad when he was suspected of being an Acericnn agent, 
NOSENKO expl:i.ined that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affa'irs, the _KGB could do nothing about his trips 
abroad·. "Thc1·e was no proof, only suspicions," and furthcrc::orc, 
SHA~IOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the 
.Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN. 
NOSENKO was questioned ngain about his 1962 assignment to 
Geneva during the February 1965 interrogations. His answers 
were incorporated in a "protocol" whh:h NOSENKO certified as 
being correct on 26 February 1965. The protocol states: 
"GRIBANOV had nothing at all t,:> do with my assignment to Geneva 
in 1962. I think that the fitness report written about mo for 
this trip was signed by[F.D.j llODKOV, since he was the Deputy 
Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the 
Seventh [Tourist! Department. I did not personally discuss 
this trip with GRIDAXOV before t1y departure from Moscow. ~ty 
candidacy for this assignment was supported by [S.G.] BA~'NIKCV, 
the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, whri super­
vised the work of the Eleventh (Soviet Delegations! Department 
which had the investigative file on SHAKHOV. BA!'IXIKOV was 
concerned with the question of who sho~ld go as case officer on

Francisco, the 1955 Paris Summit Conference, and many disarmament

sions of the UN General Assembly. Most recently SHAKHOV arrived 
in New York as a member of the Soviet Mission to the UN in 196J. 
The Soviet defectors PETROV and DERYABIN have reported that.
