CONTINUATION OF 
DISPATCH SECRET 
a possible access a,ent to LIRISG. This evenlu~lly culmi~ated 
in an attempted re~·ruit::wnt of th<' prospect _IJy GJ:;Rl•:?-lm;. ~~!though 
the attempr was \10:SUC<:essful, GJ::rJ:.'-DE «exhibited COl'Siderablt' 
resourcefulness aod operational sltill tn dt•veloping the t~et 
to a ~oint where the recruitment attempt ~as possible. We plan 
to use_ Gl::RE?iDE in si::11:a.r roles in ~he futuTo as c,pportunitie:t 
,-·tu•ise, and for tnis reason we plan to document him with a set 
oJ false Yexic11.n docua:euta.tion as well ns a set of false A;!:erican 
documentation. Gl-:RS~DE is coilecting exon1plars and getti~ tb~ 
background information needod, and once the necessary data are 
aRaembl~d, Headquarters (WOACR~) support will be requested. 
10. G~RENDE has continued to provide support for the JUROD 
operation as needed. 
11. • In September and~OctobP.r 1967 G't::RENDE was employed by 
the Moxican mIRAVEL conu:iittee. He was able to get assignN as 
aide to the DIZTAG delegation. In this capacity he was able to 
supplement very nicely the lnt'ormation and support being provided 
by Jeremy s. HODAPI'. Tbis foot-in-the-<loor ~ame in very handy, 
and ls expected to be even more valuable in 1968, if G~R~"'Di. can 
get the position again. While the job was rather time-consuming 
we believe that it was well worth it. 
12. In connection with his dutieEi with MHRAVEL, as 'll't'll as 
in connection with the fact that his WOFIRM activities ar~ nesrly 
100% af{ainst the FJST&\L target, Gl:JU;NUE was i;iven n very geutH'lll 
briefing on the Station's l~DTOP prog!'am. It is our hope that, 
in having a better ictea or what the Station is trying to do in 
this field, GEIU::NDE v,ill be nble to make an even greater contri­
bution to that program than he has in the pnst.
