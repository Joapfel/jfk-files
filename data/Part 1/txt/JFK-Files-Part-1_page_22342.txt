Appraisals of NOSENKO the aan and or his 110tivationa 
must bE" founded, as wita any source, on factors which are 
often immeaaureable, but fewer re_ser\'ations oeed be attached 
to an appraisal of the other circumstances affecting the 
course of events in Geneva in 1962 and 1964. These opera- : • 
tional circumstances can be analyzed.and evaluated in_ lllUCh 
the same manner as were NOSE~KO's production, sourcing, and 
biography for they are tangible pieces of- evidence. In the 
next portions ot this paper are presented these appraisals, 
which draw chiefly upon Pages 603-641 (for NOSENKO the man), 
Pages 20-29 (for bis aotivations), and Pa~es 11-19 and 30-
43 (for the operational circu:stances). 
2. NOSENKO 
The CIA specialists who assessed NOSENKO found him to 
be of above-average intelligence, cne ot them &~ying that 
''his effective intclligencE: is more clevernE"ss than intel­
lectuality, more shrewdness than efficiency.•• ~.le 
of good memory and, as illust;:ll~_Ux......l>.1~ r9eat in~ certa_!,p 
~~tq in tliu1im~;3.ue~ce, cJJ2.•J>J.o_qLwh,L appea~s to be 
goq<L;ae1r.ori~atioµ 01 actails. On the other hand, there were 
nUll"aeroue internal-co·ntradfchons in NOSEh'KO Is recountinge 
of various events, he himself claimed an odd or poor aemory, 
and be was the oxceptior.al defector by having been totally 
debriefed within a relatively short period. 
Parts vm.D, and YIII.E. discuss NOSENKO's truthfulness 
with reference to bis Soviet Intelligence and personal 
backgrounds. Here may be added other observations by the 
CIA specialists: NOSENKO can exercise deception cleverly, 
he improvised and was e\'asive under interrogation, and be 
has a "remarkable'' disregard fo::- 1he truth where it serves 
bis purposes. The results of the polygraph·exa.mination were 
that NOSENKO "attempted deliberate deception." 
The gapti and errors in.NOSENKO's testiaony therefore 
do not seem attributable to low intelligence or to consis­
tently poor memory, but to a conscious attempt to mislead 
Aaerican Intelligence. Independently, then, this conclusion 
raises the questions of whether NOSE~-XO was dispatcbeJ by 
the KGB and !f so, wby he was chosen. Regarding ~he latter 
point, it is noted that a CIA rsychiatrist observed: "This 
<..__ man is capable of playing a. role and playing it effectively," 
( 1 and that a CIA psychologist stated: ''From a distance NO-
\
• SENKO looks very good [to bis KGB superiors) as a possible 
pE:netration agent, but close up he leaves much to be desir_ed." 
It was "close up," in the CIA debriefing~ and interrogations, 
that ~OSESKO displayed an inability to explain the gape and 
errors in his reporting. _
