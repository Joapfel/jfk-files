- NOSENJ<O id~ntified George VA..~ LAETiiE.'4 as an Assistant 
Air Attache 1n 1953 or 1954: he was a target of another U.S. 
UT1bassy Section officer, and an unsuccessful KGB developnent 
operation was carried out against ~:im. NOS~KO did not kr.ow 
that v;..~ LA-.<-n!E."t was ~ctually an Assistant Army Attache, vho 
left Moscow in March 1953.and was succeed~d bv NOSENKO's OYTl 
target Walter M:JLE ( see above). What t.C.5::Nl<O. additionc1lly 
did not kn:,w is that 1n Moscow VA.~ LJ..Ent~"I was the Attache 
cryptographic security offic('r, tt:e s•Jpenor of Dayle SMln-I 
(the subject of 1'0SE";1<0' s "A.'J:::>REY'' leaci--see below) and a 
frier.d ot the motor pool sergear.t Roy RHCDES, a KGB agent. 
NOSENKO furtherr:1ore did not lmo·o1 chat on 19 Marc'!i 1955, 
again as~=- krmy Attache, and only two years after being 
transferred from Moscow, VAN LAETHE.M:was again sent to Mos­
co·,1, osttensibly on a PCS assignmer.t but actually on tempor­
ary duty. ::>uring this latter assign."rtent, when NOSENKO by 
his o~T. account should have been respo~sible for him, VAN 
L/..Enll-'.H was in Mos::ow to review th,:: entire electronics 
program cit the Em't:i:.sy. (VAN LhETIE."l's second tour in 
Mosco·« im·clved the planned u;;e of the ele::::tronic equipment. 
which was seized 1n Stalingrad while VAN LAETiiEM was still 
in Moscow.) 
Additional Reoorti129 
His 1nformat1on or. two other operatio~s 1nvolv1ng A"rtericans 
was said by ~OSENKO co stem from his 1953-1955 service 1n the U.S. 
Enbassy Section. One wa:; the recr~itment of the military cipher 
n:achirie mechanic havir.g the KGB cryptonym ''A."'IDREY" (Dayle S~UIB, 
see Pages 413-426 and further comm~nts 1n Part VIII.B.3. and 
VIII.C.). NOSE~KO in 1962 -..·as Stire not only thct this recruit­
ment took place before he joined the KGB but that "A.~DREY·' had 
left the USSR by then as well: he repeat~dly estimated "A.~DREY's" 
recruit:r.ent: date as "1949-1950. ' At all times he has claimed 
certainty t"hat ''ANDREY" was the last KGB n,cruit:ment in the 
Embassy \!ntil the time of r;oSE?.KO 's defection 1n Jar.uary 1964. 
ln 1964, however, NOSE,,KO changed his st.ory and said "ANDREY" 
was active while NOSENKO was in the u.s. Embassy Seccion i;•_ 1954-
1955. The other operation ·..-as an unsu::cessful recruitment; approach 
to the U.S. Embassy Secucicy Officer Edward Ellis SMI':li (see 
Pages 468-469 and further cor.-ments in Part v1:1.B.3. and VIII.C. 
above) at a meeting wit.ht.he KGB a::-ranged through letters which 
had been sent to SMITii. This occurred 1n -1954 or 1955j NOSENKO 
said, and in .support of the recruitment approach; he handled 
the surveillance phone-watch. SMI'rn admitted co u.s. authorities 
having received four letters from the KGB between 2 and 5 June 
1956 (a year after NOSENKO dated his departure from the u.s. 
Embassy Section), but he denied having had any personal meetings 
with KGB officers. 
e. • Remarks 
NOSENKO's accounts of the 1953-1955 period are confused, 
contradictory, and, when compared with collateral information, 
incomplete and inaccurate. He has been inconsistent in dating 
his shift of responsibilities withir. the U.S. Embassy S<;ctfon, 
in dati_og his_ departure from the Section (viz .• the timing of 
the Stalingrad incident and the approach t.o SMI'nl), and in dating 
his first knowledge of the microphones 1n the Embassy~ -Having -
