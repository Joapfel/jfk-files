NOSENKO has furnished information concer:r,ing this case, stating it was 
originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter 
by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the 
First Department. There is adequate reason to believe Aa TEMOV only 
became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department,

officer who was under Department of State cover in Helsinki, Finlan~ 
and visited the USSR on a tourist visa. Such an indiviciua::. would under 
no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of 
the Seventh Departn-ient, particularly since ap;iarently the individual was 
even traveling under a diplomatic· passport. ~t is, assumed the indiviciual 
was oi interest to the First Chief Directorate and if the Fi1 st Chief 
Directorate required or desired support .from tne SCD, it would normally 
request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely ur.­
likely that tile FCD would request the Seventh Department for assistance 
in a case involvin~ an American diplomat.
