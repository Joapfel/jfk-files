of obtaining t;. S. Citiz~nship for !-:is rd.fe, I'.r. Emke inforl',ed him t:"lat 
under the circumstances under .~ich his wife ent~rec:. t:-,e l. S., namely as 
a tourist, it w;:,uld not be possible to plausibly apply for l. S. Citizen­
ship. H.1nke also informed that tl thourh possible to n.;sh the Ci tizensh.ip 
through, it w;;_s felt inadvisable at this tir.:e since the proceedure rnieht 
jeop.:rdi7.e the r-resent existinc cover arr;;neement. • .~ent see□t>d to 
understDnd t~e difficulties involvec and raised no particular objection. 
4. Aeent informed ~everal neifhbors had inqtired as to tht nature 
or his.business. He has infor::-.ed ~~em that he is a student and is 
studying at Ceori;-e llashington University in the !ield of t£onomics~ 
·This story had been decided upon before t.~e m-iter c2-i::e· upon the· scene.

he commence taking a course 0r t-;m :is soon as pcssible. He inforced he 
vould do this as soon as he -leti'ns of the detaiis as to his hours to be 
devoted to Covert Training. 
S. Althollf,h there is no a::surance subject will be n-anted pen:dssion 
to enter Argentina, subject previously indic~ted he could forsee no proble..i 
in this regard. • He did mr.ke iJ",.~w.ry, however, as to mat his status r.ould 
be show.d he not be allo1n:d entr .. r,ce to Argentina • 
6. It is unfortunate that Jfent is residing in the ,iashington n. c. 
area inasmuch as that in itscll is undoubtedly considered as a Goveriment 
Stigma. The possibilit:, exists that the v.ronc; perscn or persons mll· learn 
. of his and his vd.fe 1 s presence in this m·ee .• 
7 • The file fails to reflect iThat provision, if cny:, has h"''" m,,rl. tc
