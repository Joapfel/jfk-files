&!gr.al is very helpf\1L So if he. goes on a Soviet plene, !:hey 
will star.t watching him .from the time t·he fhght s-tarts. Now, 
as soon as he crosses the 'torder, he will_ _be ._.atched by the 
border guards; he will be wat.ched the entire route of his travel. 
This is a v.ery important busiress, because _the rnain task in re­
gard to tourists is to uncover within t:he gP.r.~r·a1 flow of tourists 
those persons w~o are of in~erest from the opeiatior.al point of 
view... Let's just say that this person is process inc; a_ gro'.lp 
of .American tourists who are going to t'he So•:iet Union, and, 
-vit.cn the processing is almost finisr.E:d, an0tr.1::r person is added 
to the group. ?!obody knows this per.:on in th'! gr-o.ip ••• but he 
was added at the last rni~ute. So this is a~ 1~1ication. This is 
what he Lthe agen_!;/ was tat.ght to pay attenticn to when he was 
being trained in Moscow •.. Now, if some official qovernment 
ag~ncy makes a request that a man te sent to ~he Sovi~t Union as 
,a touris~, this immediately arouses suspicio~, of course ... In 
• such thinag he has bE:en trai~ed ... He comes to Moscow on~e or 
twice a year. You kr.ow, such a little Jewish fellow - an ernigre 
• from Russia - in the past, you know, scared of everything. 'I'he 
last time he ca:ne he told us: 'Yo,l know, ! ':n thinking about it 
ell the tirr,e,' r.e says. So t:-iey ?.::sked him: 'Are you afraid? 
n'hy are you shak1.ngl' Hr.: says, 'Well, !'m not afraid: I'm not 
shakir.g. But why should I be caught like a~ idict ..• ' His 
pseurlonym is 'A?lUD' and his last name is svc.::CHANSKIY. Well, 
I'll give you all this later." 
NOSE.~1<0 told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVEHCH.:.NSKIY was 
recruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, NOS!::?,~O, had taken over 
the handling of this agent from Tourist Depart~ent case officer 
Ye. N. NOSKOV. * SVENOiANSKIY had sent the l<G3 ma."'ly open code 
messages such as those described above, and a nwnber of these 
messages have been cousidered to have been of definite op~ra­
tional interest. t,OSENKC identified SVENCHA!:SKIY as the oresi­
dent of "Afton Tours" in New York City and the owner of a­
.Russian-language bookstore in C'nicago. 
There was sanE: concern on the part of the KGB at the time 
of thE: recruitment ir. 1960 o~ 1961, ?:OSENKO reported on 1 March· 
1965, because SV~CHANSKIY had had cor.tacts -with A."ITORG in New 
York City. TI1e KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con­
tacting SVENCHANSKlY in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this 
was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de­
termined that SVENQJANSKIY was not an FBI agent, NOSD."KO re­
plied: "NOSKOV felt it:" he had no further explanation.) The 
recruitment was based mainly on ar. agreemen~ that Inturist 
would send more business to svmCH;..~SKIY if he cooperated. 
ROSENKO also said SVENCHA.~SKIY had been arrested.for black­
marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this ~taternent.· 
NOSENKO took over the case from NCSKOV in September 1963, and 
his name was entered 'in the single-volume file of SVD:CHANSXIY 
aa the handling officer as of that date. Together with NOSKOV, 
IJOSENKO subsequently had two meetings with s•n:NCHANSKIY when
