NOSENKO said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini­
strative officer in the Embassy by the name of James CA~DELLA. 
The KGB nad no interesting or unusual information cc,nc~rning 
CARDELLA from any source, ar.d ?IOSENKO could say nothing more 
about hio. 
CIA files show that Chief ~arrant Officer CARDELLA served 
in Mosco~ from Sept~mber 1953 until June 1955. Other than the 
fact that a microphone was discovered in CARDELLA's Moscow Em­
bassy office in 1964, no significant collateral information 
concerning him is available.

tempted in 1953 or 1954. Ile said tha:: durir.g this period a. 
Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going 
from Berlin to Mosco~ wifh the mission of striking up an acquain­
tance with ·vAN L.'\ETHE:-t ·.,•hi.::h could ~e follo·.-.•E::i up in Moscow.

him, he ~ever did call he~ in Moscow. NOStNKO said t~at he had 
heard al:out this fron P .F. P,\:,.a:Kl'\TC'l, the case officer handling 
LARIONO'lA. He added that CHUH.At~OV • ..,3S the case officer respon­
sible for VAN LAETH;::~·1, as he was for all members of the Air At­
tache' s office at that time. t,0.3ENKO knew of no other interest 
or activity concerning VAN L:\E'l'Hlli. 
C!h records show that V,\N LAI.:TED! was not an Assistant Air 
Attachc but an .l\ssist.:rnt ;\rmy At taciH~, serving 1n Moscow from 
March 1951 to March 1953.* As cryptographic security officer 
and officer in charg~ of the Embassy c~de room, he had super­
visory responsibility for the m1.litar::,• code clerks and mechanics, 
including Dayle SMITH, and h= was on fuirly close personal terms 
with Sergeant Roy RHODES until tr.e latter's departure from Mos­
cow in January 1953; VAN LAETHEM's duties also carried respon­
sibility for sensitive electronic activities in the Embassy.** 
He was ag21in in Moscow from 19 March to 19 l-i.:iy 1955 (at a time 
when NOSE~~KO claims to have been the KGB case officer for U.S. 
Army Attaches). Although this trip *as always intended to be 
only a TOY, it was represented to the Soviets as a PCS Assistant 
Army Attache assignment bec21use of the extrecely sensitive na­
ture of his•business there. He was project officer for. the· en­
tire electronics program at the Embassy, and went to Moscow to 
review the operations including the planned use of the new 
. electronic equipment which was seized from BENSON, MULE, and 
STROUD in Stalingrad in May· 1955 (see above). 
' · * Although VAN LAETHEM completed his two-year.· to.ur in Moscow in
