37. RUIZ :1lmos.t never discusses women with his_-collcagues, 
. ·except for one off moment_ when he mentioned a girl he knew 
in the United St:Hcs··_bcfore ttie Revolution. Pcrh:ips RUIZ wisely

-from mentio1iinr= wom~n on her account.· In any case, he is not 
known .to be iu\·olvcd in any extr:unarital affair. ·est.ill, o_ne 
wonders about the custom of ahsenting himself by nutomobile

38, His habits seem to be simple: he likris movies; he 
has read Top3z (but made no .comaent thereon); and he receives 
people atnis home for cocktails. 
·POLITICAL AX!l. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS 
39. Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much 
more the appearance of a man with 1,:odfrate political vie,vs 
struggling to justify to himself the actions of hi~ government, 
especially in view of the political and economic realities of 
his country. It is possible th:it his fee] ings might lie 
cl"oser to the theory of the "betrayed revolution" ---but not 
for'strictly .ideological reasons. The incompetence of the 
Cuban govcrn;:,.ental ·bureaucracy, for ·ex:imple, has sabotaged the 
revolution. 
40. In the first place, RUIZ defiilitely docs not seem 
to be a Mar~ist and consequently he cannot accept the role of 
"robot" (his tero1) required by Party discipl inc and vertical 
structure. 
a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telcsforo 
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX cffici~l: "Revolutionaries 
should not be coerced by forms of political control." 
b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visitini; 
Agropecuario official from H:wan:-i that: " ... if I 
disagree with orders, I qu~stion them because I am 
not a rot-ot nor do I hrn;e the. mentality of one. A-s 
a human bei~g i express opinions no matter what the 
risk that I m:iy have to acr.ept_ pc-rsonal ly."
