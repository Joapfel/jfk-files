Coordination:

Futurt- Plans: 
I 
The Station is constantly examining the possibility of 
an audio installation at thf.' main gate of the Cuban Embassy. 
A successful audio devfce would serve, in most cases, to 
identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGflAN-1 
since they normally identify themselves to the gate h~use : 
attendant. There arc a few Station assets who have occasional 
access to the_ gate house, and it is conceivable that one of 
them could place a quick plai1t device, provided secui-ity 
conditions are favorabl~. The Station currently has u~der 
consideration a recruitment ~ffort against a lower level i 
employee of th~ Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous 
help in such ~n ope~ation.
