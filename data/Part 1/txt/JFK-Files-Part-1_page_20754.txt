in which he is held. by his superiors in the Agency. 
During this rating pe1·iod Mr. Phillips tranaferred 
the station from Rio de J:ineiro to Brasilia. This move, 
hoievoc>r, dh'orces the Chic( of Station from the main area 
of operations, Rio de Janeiro. In spite of this Mr. Phillips, 
through much e-xtra effort and time on his part, has been 
able to maintain a high operation.ii tempo in the station. 
Station relations with key people in the Brazilian 
government, especially t~e security agencies, have been 
highly producti'le but through recent c-CCorts, these relations 
have been placed on a much higher plane with the decision 
or Gent•ral Fontoura, chief of the SNI, to give the station 
copies of the briefings especially prepared for President 
Medici.
