1. Al thouc?l this report might norm::.:lly be suumitted one l'I0nth 
from now, the vsc of -Oliver G, SCAXTLU:G l::is E.hiftcd suffici~:ltly 
to wal'l·ant a ·spaci:.l report at this time. Our next progress 1·oport 
will be submitt~d fo1· the period 1 Octob£>r throut:h 31 Dcccmb~r un­
less exceptional circum.c;tances justify another chanr,o, 
2, Tha fundamental chance in the use of SC!l'N'fLING (who has 
su,;fercd tho p::st six wceJ,.s from p:i.ratyphoid) is tliat he has b~en 
divorced from routine cut-out operations and wJ.11 henceforth bn 
U!::ed for p1·iority tasks and ta1·gets wMcb .rill better utilize Lis 
proven talents. First, in 1::-.tcSeptcmber ZARHOCK took over LICASA-1 
.for direct handling, Ths LICASA op~ration offcrc-?d no particul:tr 
challenge to SCA~TLING allll it is doubtful that his intormcdi:u·y role 
offered any particular additional security in this ca6e, In fact, 
H a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would Just add 
one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the 
G011. Seconcl, it has been decided that SCA.\TLING will very soon turn 
LIAKVIL-1 over to Raymond GF:RENDE. The details arc presently baing 
__ worked out, --
3, PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-
. c1·uitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent h~ndling)

. he is presen_tl:,' preparing fo1· a.recruitment· attempt against Subject •oi 
x- MEXICO C_ITY-1502. When that oper:?'t;ion is completc<l be will be tar-
- geted against the M!!lIARSH target both through a commercial outlet of 
the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where be may 
have access to lr.IllARSll types .. Aside frolll these responsibilities, he 
will be used as needed in other r~cruitment situations especially in 
support of a new surveillance team. .
