KOSOLAPOV was the oniy KGB officer in contact with the Polish agent. 
NOSENKO previously stated -::hat a KGB tech~ician who was on the train 
from Moscow to Warsaw reported back to NOSENKO the day after the 
train arrived in Warsaw. Later NOSEXKO said that ins-::ead of talking 
,, 
to the technician personally. he may. have read the report of the tec:q.nician 
after he returned from Cuba. 
The activities described by NOSENKO with regard to this matter 
are atcordingiy possible within the known time frame. It is not con~ 
sidered that the retractions NCS ENKO has made from 'his original 
statements on this operation are of sufficient significance to materially 
discredit him. 
Page 198 of the previous summary contains the statement that 
fMORONE; when interviewed, denied having been intimate with Svetlana 
IVANOVA, a KGB agent employed at the American House. NOSENKO 
had stated that IVANOVA was instructed to report everything she saw 
or heard concerning(MORONE:,(page 194). The summary, however, 
cited· a number 0£ reports that;MORONE1had been intimate with IVANOVA 
and with Ella UMANETS, also a KGB agent employed at the America:;:i 
House, and commented that NOSENKO t:-1erefore was apparently t..nawa:re 
of the sexual involvement ol,MORONEJ with "IVANOVA's friends. 11
