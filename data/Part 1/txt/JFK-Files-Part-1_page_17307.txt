order to cover three Yu~oslav linct1. Two of the lines which were disconne..:tcd. 
were Cuban Embassy lines, both were n0t in ueo by the C\\bans. One w.is in 
the apartmcnt which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobat1 and not occ11?ied bf

As soon aa these lines are working again, coverage 0£ two of the Yu~osl.n• 
Embasoy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which 
are presumed to have a much higher priority.
