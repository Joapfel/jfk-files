r-J _ NOSENKO continued to act as~IPPE'fjs case officer after 
VQIFRIPPEL_Jleft the Soviet Union and a~t~r NOSENKO had been 
• ~ransferred and promoted to the position of D~uty Chief 
of the Seventh Department. He met twice withLE:RIPPEL]duringD6 
this latter period when CT'RIPPE9_ visited the Soviet Union as Db 
. a guide with groups of foreign visitors. Both of these 
meetings -were handled by NOSENKO alone, without CHELNOKOV. 
• The first meet) .. ng took place in the summer of _1962, after 
NOSENKO returned to Moscow froI!l Geneva. ~RIPPEY arrived i)(., 
in the Soviet Union as a guide for some American journalists. 
(NOSENKO was unable to give the composition of the journa­
list group or to recall where they stayed in Moscow and 
where else they travelled in the Soviet Union.) NOSENKO 
contacted him in Moscow to. learn what questions the newsmen 
_ intended to ask Khrushchev during a scheduled interview; 
• __ [subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged that standard practice 
required visiting journalists·to submit their intended 
questions for Khrushchev in writing to Soviet authorities 
1 prior to interviews]. After the interview, he recontacted 
• C)b· ~IPPEL1to learn the reaction of the journalists to .their 
talk wiih the Soviet leader. NOSENKO could not recall their 
specific· reaction to the Khrushchev interview but did 
remember t~t they were "satisfied" .. Another reason for 
-. Q0contacting l!RIPPEL), NOSENKO added in a later discussion, 
was to learn whetn'er any of the jouri:ialists might have 
• joined the group at the last moment in the United States, 
which might suggest intelligence connections on their part·.-. - D(:, • · · · · -. 
• NOSENKO met {!RIPPEJ2 alone for the second and last time . 
during March 1963. Since tfRIPI>EL/ was a guide for tourists /J( 
aboard the ship "Olympia", which-stopped for a day in Yalta 
r./ and Odessa,_ NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Moscow and accosted 
lP\FRIPPEMin the lobby of the hotel where the tourists were 
~aving dinner. Finally able to get away from his group, 
Db(ERIPPE]Jcalled on NOSENKO in the latter's hotel room, and 
the_ two_ drank_ and talked. NOSENKO had given{!:RIPPEL] a O{ 1 bottle of vodka.as a gift, and(!_RIPPEL\ said he wanted too~ 
give NOSENKO some whisky in return. They drove in NOSENKO's 
car to the port, where NOSF.NIW waited in the car while 
{jb fFRIPPEY. went aboard for the whisky. (He had invited NOSENKO 
'to vi~it the ship but could not obtain a pass for him.)
