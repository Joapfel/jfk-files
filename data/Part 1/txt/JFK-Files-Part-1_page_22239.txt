total KGB dCtivity against fo,bassy personnel with the ex­
ception of tr.c techr.1cal pE;netrati0r.s (s~~ Part VIII.D.4.). 
' - Seven· American correspondents in 1-:cscow had been re-

years 1953-1954 when he was ...,orkin.:; again:;t U.S. newspaper­

- The J..T.crican Express Company r';?prcsentative in :~osco..,, 
i~sene FRIFPEL, had become a KGo agent in 1959; NOSU:Ko was 
the case officer. 
- The r1umber of Ame1·ican visito:-s recruited by the KG!l 
in 1962-1963 was 14, and if there had be"?n others, NCSEUKO 
would r.ave k.--iown about th-:-.rr. in light of his senior posjtion 
in the '!'ot:rist Ce~rtment curing that p,:>rjod. Moreover, for 
the years tefore 1962, NOSF.::KO provided lc~ds to 19 othPr 
J.r.er ican tcurj st s whom the KGD recrl! i tL->Ci. plus or.e who was

scribed 18 develop~P.nt cases ar.d ni~e i~~ectigations in 
vhich tt,e targets were American tourists. 
As for KGB o,;>erations outside t~e Soviet Union, NOS~KO gave leads 
to four recruited l>.-neric,!:-:S abo.!t -..h-:>m ht! learned through cor.ver­
sations with KGD associat:.e3: a U.S. intclliger.ce officer having 
the KGB cryptony:n ".31'.SP.A" ( ::;ti.11 •.mident i f::.ed), a pcn'.!tration of 
Orly Courier lransfer S~~t1on (1.der.tified as Se:-geant Robert Lee 
JCHNSCN), ar.d two agents in Gcr:eva (nair,es :-.ot given and as yet ~ct 
positi-.,ely identi~ied). N0SENKO lea.r,c·d of the K-::3 agent status 
,_of-@o~ce G. Ltr.-lT~ an h-;-,erican professur, because he tock nart in 
~T's recruitment while 0:-1 T:J'.i i~ 2ofia, and of the 
Legal esid~ agent because of the cor.nection 
between~and cerr.ar~ KOT.::;, an Ar.-lerican tourist with whose 
case NOSC,KO was personally involved. In addition, NOSE:lKO de­
scribed two development cases.with U,S. citizens. From his know­
ledge of tl-,e "SASHA" operation, 1-WS~KO also knew that the KGB 
had no ageLt sources able to supply ir.formation concerning the 
Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. 
(i) Completeness, Accuracy, Detail and Consistency of Reporti~g 
If he occupied the various KGB positions as claimed, if his 
access were as broad as he said it was, ~tJS~KO t.as pr_ovided a 
cc;nprehensivc review of KGB- operations -involving Americans in 
the USSR. 
Other information, r.a~ever, ccntradicts NOSENKO's assurances 
t~at he reported on all major cases involving Americans working 
at th~ u.s. En.bassy in Moscow: 
. GOLITSYN•s reports indicate that a u.s. military code 
.clerk was r~cruited in 1960, a~d other factors point to~ard 
this person 'tx:,ing 3a~~s S10RSBERG or possibly Willia~ HURLEY
