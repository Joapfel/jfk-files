2. Access and LiJld.tatioDS OD AcceBB. There apparatly has been 
c1rculated a charge that GibSOD is a CIA q-ent. (Thia is reflected in 
bis 201. as dating f'rall hie days vi th the PPCC. ) In deallng vi th this 
1119st1oD., howner., KA1'ZDBACB cites GibS011'a ow belier that be is still 
able to operate in the c1rcles which voul4 be ot interest to us. It la., 
of c:ourae., dil'ficult. to tell :t?'0l:l his debriefing the extent and serious­
Deas ot this charge against Gi0110D., insofar as it attecta his bona tides. 
It does aem. that in GibllOll'e mlleu, go_p, personal attacks, mudc1lecl 
lo1&,l.tiea and. an aura ot CODSPiratorial conf'uaion are e~ tacts of 
lif'e and that personal. COZltact and ettectiveneBB in hQ.1]cUng npport 
·vould tar outveigh such critical personal charges .:. vh1ch 1 indeed, pro­
.babl,y c1rculate about 1110st people. At the present time, tor reasons not 
entirely cle&r., Gibson feel.a tllat he vould be unwelcome and restricted 
vere he to visit Ghana, 81141 in tact., voul4 not like to make such a 
trip. Be baa 1.Ddicated, OD the other hand., that he baa friends in Al• 
geri.a and believes be could probably' get 8Glll9 kind ot job there or at 
least find a receptive and generally friendly reception. He also appeare 
to bave 808e contact and standing vith the Indonesian government, since 
be elaina their London »iibaasy ottered him employment. It is not kno\lD 
to what extent he might be able to parley such a contact into employment 
in Djakarta or acae tom ot offieial association in Europe., although 
these qaestiona could be explored further. Tl:.e term.1nation or his asso­
ciation vith Revolution and Verges voul.d not., according to his a.ccount ot 
it, discredit him in the eyes ot those vho might have been partisans ot 
the ideological l1n.e which this mga::ine purveyed. According to his_ 
account., Verges is not 1n good standing vith the pro-Chinese l1lte Grippa 
or nen the ChiJlese., and that his (Gibson's) quarrel vith Verges over 
uapaid salary is veil known. Vh1le this ma:,- not be unbiased., it is 
epparentl,y true tbat he has loc!gecl a clA1a tor payment against Verges., 
and thus 1a not in the poaition ot having been expelled :trcm Revolution 
ror ideological. denaticn. As Gibson seCOUDts it., it 1a Verges., not be., 
1dlo 1~ diac:redited. 
3. lbtivatiOD end Readinesa to Cooperate. The debrieting reflects 
lletveen the lines what rnZEHBACH Judges in his COYering dispatch to be 
a rea41Deea to col.lect intol"IIBtioD tor us knov1Dg that ve are an official 
ageney and pro'bab.q suspecting that ve are IIJBARK. Kia ~eased 1110ti• 
fttloD is moetary., aD4 ~ ao., although a certain degree ot tatigaa 
with bis put ~eesioD ot ideol.ogical punditry is discernable. There 
ue also a DUllber of indicatioDS that GibSOll voul4 like to rehabilitate 
ldml1.t lest be be forced to make his living ror en indetini.te period of 
u.. 1D u eirri.roJment that he finds both unpl,eaaant and materiall,y un­
rewarc1.1ng. It is not l)Osaible., ot course., to make an intelligent Judge­
