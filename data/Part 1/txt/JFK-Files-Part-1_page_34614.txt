conf[c~d under ~trict and relatively austere conditions.,

1967, he was ~ivcn increasing amounts of freedom until he 
was allowed u.:al frc:e<lom in 1969. He subsequently married

The strict conditions of NOSENKO's confinc1:ient were 
intended to convcy·to him the seriousness of his position 
as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to:him that 
hi~ f~ec sct~lccvnt in the U.S. was precluded as long ns 
this issue wa~ unresolved. It was understood, how~vcr, 
that at any time he could have elected to end his ccnfine• 
mcnt and return to the Soviet Union. OS files do not· documen°L 
that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to ·, 
NOSf:NKO, ho·,.-<::ver, it is the recollection of senior staff 
officers (ADD/O and D/0S) that such was the case, and further 
th:it it i.as a condition routinely applied to other defectors 
whose bona fidcs were in doubt.
