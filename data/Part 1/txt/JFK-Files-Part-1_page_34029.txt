Another phenomenon appeared during 1962. The Soviets, who had been careful -not 
to press Cuba during 1%0 with regards to thelr trade balance (which w~s fawo~able:to 
·euba by S 31,000,000), were shrewd enough to close the qap during 1961. The balance 
was favorable to Cuba by S 11,200,000. j

~) ~wo interesting developments occured in 1963._ First of _all, total trade with 
the Cemmunist countries maintained

the 1962 level($ 19031,000,000 in 1962 and 
S 11054,900,000 in 1963). ;But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its 
exports :to Cuba to $ 68P,900,000 (in 1962 they represented $ 6299000,000), while Cuban 
exports to.the C011111unist Bloc decreased to$ 3669 000,000 (in 1962 they represented 
$ 402,0oo,ooo).- Thus; the imbalance for Cuba increased to S 322,900,000 (in 1962 it 
was S 221,000,000).

At the same time, Cuba attempted an approach to the Free World markets by tak'ing 
advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged 
' 8.48 ets! per pound during this period). Cuba's total trade with the Free World i'n -
creased to S 354,300,000 (in 1962 it had been$ 226,000,000). • , ... i-- '
