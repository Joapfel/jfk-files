,1, Jf"IEI\TTTY-J is a line- of lioui,! fertili:c-r in 1:liich 
Hll'\TITY-6 is also interested. li0we\:er, since t?1c local fcrtili:er 
industry cn_ioys Protection in the forn o( inr.<'rt lice:1si11:· restrictions, 
it will t:ikc fron one to t~o vc~rs of nc~oti:ition to Jc-tcr~ine ~hcthrr 
the GOV 1.-ill permit the iriport:1ti0n of this line. Pi Cervcno would, in 
conjunction with ll'E':TJTY-6, represent l!lE\TITY-1 in the ne~:otiations 
to ort:iin such r,_.rnissi011. ,\gain, this rdc i.·ould provi.Je a degree of 
sponsorship hy l[)[:;ilTY-6 anu h'ould enahlc Pi l~cr\"cno to at least r.iect 
si~nificant .govern~cnt officials. ~hilc his orcraticnal ohjcctives • 
do not involve the- G0V as a target, he could provide assessment and 
other operational J:it:i useful a~ainst this target. 
S. InE\TITY-~ produces a line of concrete hlock ~anufacturing 
l":tchincry and :iccessories. There little <loubt that as capital 
equipnent, these can he imported into Venezuela--but the number of 
prospective buyers is limited. Such a line would not of itself support 
lli Gervcno's cover, but would be a satisfactory supplel'!ent there to 
which would be useful in explaining the fact that he Kill not devote 
his full time to anv one activitv--:rnd to account for at least that 
~ortion of his inco~e which coul~ not be justified en the hasis of 
his work on behalf of IDE~TITY-2 and -3. 
6. IOENTITY-5 produces wrought iron for the utility industry. 
Jn[~TITY-1 is considering accepting representation for IJ[XTITY-S on 
a hemisphere wid~ hasis.· If this line is :H.:Ce!1ted, anJ L•i Gervcno 
represents it locally, it will also help to enhance ~is status and to 
account for \\'hat irnul<l normally he an unusual work pattern. 
7. We do not wish at this point to 2et into a detailed 
discussion of financial arrnnge~ents. If, as we hope, Pi Gerveno 
docs make some sales, coMnissions will be payahle tn hi~. If under 
existing rC"gulations he could keep at least a rropnrtion of these, 
we would favor it as an incentive to work at his ccvcr. If not, we 
have confidence that he is a well enough disciplined professional, 
to work at it in any event. 
8. '.ve woulu expect that the operational duties '-"!' !'lave planned 
for f1i r.erveno will take about 20 hours a week. This ...-oulJ involve 
meetings with the inside case officc>r; meetin~s with the ap.cnts; 
preparation of contact reports, drafts of cables, intei reports and 
dispatches, plus sol"'!e tirie to think about his operatioris. 
9. We would expC"Ct ni ~erveno to spend the balance of his work 
week actually perforning cover duties. !'is p.1ttcrn car.ncit !Je ncatlr· 
defined as four hours for cover :ind f0ur hours d:iilv for onl'r:ttions. 
llis ~:tily pattern will vary widely anJ he ~ust reta~n !lexirility in 
oruer to be ;ivailable when needed for ooi;>ration:il d11ties. \cvcrtheless, 
to reiterate, he will have ti~e for cover w0rk :ind will lie expected to 
<lo it . 
lfl. Unlicr these circw:1st:rnces, 1,e desire t 1i:tt !-.c '-:c thorou~:hly 
trained in his cover duties and that hC' ha\·e a thorou:::c J..r.01dedge of the
