9. Accordingly, RUSSO described a personal friend in the 
Division of Communications and Records of the Departr.:ent who had had 
considerable experience in censorship_ work and offered to make in­
quiries of this individual for any· availaUe. material. It ·was also 
indicated that this person would be.asked, to·cornment on the probable 
reaction of the Department.to an official_confic:iential request from 
the Costa Rican Government· for assistance. It .was sug!".ested:to subject . 
. that he not discuss this matter with any other individuals pending 
a reply to our inquiries,~to which he agreed. He -lso a~reed ~hat 
the best approach to this whole project would be to proceed only with 
training and planning activities at this time and not attempt to 
initiate actual censorship until an emergency arises,·such as a 
! Communist armed uprising or & -third worla war. However, on this-
-latter point it ia believed probable that s~bjectwould prefer to 
begin the activity regardless of whether ari emergency arises, in order 
to obtain coverage of current Communist; activities. • •. • • · i. 
10. As is obvious from the above conversations, a number 
of operational possibilities (and hazards) are presented to us and 
headquarters comments and guidance are respectfully requested. 
Depending on headquarters desires and policies, we could possibly 
gradually dis·courage subject from ever initiating his project prior 
! to an emergency while at the same tiine assisting him with pertinent 
1 :. written material provided by headquarters for hf s planning_ and train-
I :ing purposes. This would have the advantage of facilitating the 
i organization of a competent crew on a stand-by basis who could be put 
i to work if a world war were to break· out~. We could· tap this govern-
. 1.· ment censorship activity. However, in view of our presently only 
, limited post offic€ coverage, a more attractive opportunity might be 
;- sincerely to assist. subject,· insure· his development of a secure project, 
I 
. i. 
. f' and ·substitute our present coverage· by an all-Costa Rican operation. 
ji'J,:_.~:-. It appears that w~ could control such an operation either by working ,i ·- ._:: ;_;,\ .. _/_ 
('; ·,·:·- through subject or by_ dealing directly with Colonel SEGARES. In . • . : 
l:i"~:'-· _ this latter situation, ~e could pro~ably_expand the activity to provide ·j . . .
