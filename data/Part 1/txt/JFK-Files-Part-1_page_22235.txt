e. Evaluation of Production 
1. Introduction 
l'fhat a Soviet source reports is one f~~tor in assessing his 
good faith. Rarely, ~oJever, can it be co~=lusive: Even a genuine 
and cori3cientious source may be poorly ir.fo:T.1a' or misinformed: he 
fftl!Y be hampert:d by for~ctf~lness, mental shortcomings, or lack of 
education; his reporting may be incomplete because he is not avail­
able long enough to pennit ~~plification a~d clarification of his 
information. On the other hand, a Soviet-ccntrolled agent who is 
planted on the opposition may be supplied with useful, voluminous, 
and accurate inforcation. 
'111ere are sever&l standards which may be applied to the assess­
ment of a sourc~•3 production. Each of them is qualified: none is 
likely to be conclusive by itself:; arid ali of tr1cl.CI tug.:::Un:::r IMY not 
permit a defi~ite conclusion, although they do contribute to a 
broader assessa\er.t cf~~- The standards are: 
First, how does the information equate, in te,rrns of c~~plete­
ness, accuracy, ar.d detail, with the source's claimed or proven 
position and access to information? (In this, one ju~ges the in­
ternal consist~ncy of the source's reporting and also compores it 
with information frCY.n other sour=es and frOt:l investigations.) 
Second, does the information harm the opposition? (This point 
is risky to jud;e, for a ger.uine source may simply not know any­
thing harmful to his cour.try. Also, information which seems harm­
ful to the USSR may not actually be such in Soviet eyes1 for ex­
ample, the loss of an apparently valuable agent could be mitigated 
by the KGB's possession of better or comparable assets still un-
exposed.) • • 
'111ird, is the information important or useful to us? (This 
point may in some cases be irrelevant, for information useful to 
us may not harm the opposition, ar.d the apparent usefulness of in­
formation may not balance against the ti~e and effort required to 
process and investigate it.) 
These standa~ds have been applied in evaluating the production 
of NOSENKO on the topics discussed belo..,._ 
~OSENKO's production is exclusively in the field of counter­
intelligence information. As described in Part VI.A., he did not 
.bave any useful positive intelligence. This does not necessarily 
affect the question of his~ fides, ho~ever, for NCSmKO claims 
to have been a KGB internal counterintelligence officer. From a 
comparative standFoint, not one of the previous KGB officers who 
defected to Western s~rvices has pro:" 11ced significant military, 
economic, or scientific information on the USSR, and ~~ly a f~w 
• 
bave supplied political intormation (usually concerned with the 
personalities and relations~ips in the ruling group of the Commu-
nist Party). Therefore, nothing _of positive intellic;ence_conse-- _______ ---
----- -- --------- --- ijuence is expected of NOS~KO, alt't.ough some question might be 
raised about his inability to report on the leadership of the 
Soviet regime in viev of his father's position-- and NOSE!n<O' s 
continuing contacts with the leadership after his father's death. 
The failure of NOSESKO to respond to questionnnaires along posi­
tive intelligence lines is not considered unusual.
