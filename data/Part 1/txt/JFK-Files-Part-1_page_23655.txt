3: ; .BACKGROUND 
i 
(pperation Al!TRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was 
1-uccessful in that the two principals of the team, AKICE-27 
and AMICE-14, were ablo to co~tact awl t0Tecru1t two princt-
·pal agents and several other action agents to lay tho ground­
work fo~ the l!RAPROS objectives of the Al1TR1Th'K operation. One 
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUh1C•9, was oxfiltrated with the 
► ~pur-man Al"TRUl\1' infiltration !ea.m tor training and o~er~t1c::a.l 
4iscuss1ons 1n the .nra'AVE area. In early September, AllTRUNJC.-9 
ris re-infiltrated into PBRUlilEN in Operation AllTRWlC V, the 
~~e operation which exfiltrated AlG'AUNAs -1, -3, -13 and -34. 
Ip late October AMICE-27 was s,epan.ted frou the c1an4ostine 
put of the AHTR1Th1C operation. The original objectives of 
Operation AMTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January 
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two 
internal P/A's toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re­
cruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the 
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this llission waa 
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegraa 1D open code 
from AMTRIDi1C-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished 
to b9 exfiltrated. The twin objectives of Operation Al.'TRUN1' VI 
then becaz:e: first, to exfiltrate Al!TRUNJC-9 a.nd, this accom-
·plished, for ..UUCE-14 to proceed to Ha.vana for his ta.sk of re­
channelling Al!TRUNK-lO's responsibilities. The 8ld1ltrat1on of 
AHTBUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting ot 
wife, brother-in-law, and three small children, was accomplished 
on 9 .January 1964. The unexpected presence of AllTBJmX-9's 
fudly, coupl~ with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
• tration area, forced AllICE-14 to exiiltrate the same night wit~ 
:out attempting to accomplish the second part of his llission.
