CHANOE3 MID PLANNING 
a) One major operational change la planned ror tl:e eMu!ni:; period, 
Upon co;npletion of tht> new LD:ousnra structure (se-, m-,IA-25352, dated 10 
Fe~ruary 1965), the Station will r.iove the present LI!'.YRIC baeeh:>use 
personnel (LIFl!?'.!'Y!l 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edi fico r1tther than the 
LIMrI'ED (Lifl-!PTYs 6 and 'i') personnel as origintlly pll\."lned, 1\ncillariJ 
modifications arei 1) To increase the hours of l:l0th the photo,,raphlc lllld 
physie,u surveillnnc~ ~oversee provided b.'/ the LILYRIC oper11tors (davn to 
dusk) durinz the week d~·s end 2) have LD-lITED pro\-ide photocrnphlc and 
physical surveillenc" coveN'.i;e on week-nn::ls only, while rernnining on :tally 
stand-by for ra1io-dlsp11.tc:.ing nssic;nments, '.i'i1ese chat16ell were dictated by 
the foll.owing considerations t 
1) The new Lill.OUSil!E build!~ will orfer a much better vantRge point 
for both photo;;raphic and physical ~urveillance than does the present 
complex which houses the LILYnIC and LIMITED bases, Therefore, the 
Station feels that the personnel oeeupyinz; this new base should he 
those possessln..-; the hif;hest technlce.1 skills ...n:l also those 1thle to 
provide the most tl-.orouih and complete covers..::;~. Sinc"' thl" I,Il-trrED base 
nov haa only one train"!-l 0p~r!'tN' while the LILYRIC basehouBt! has three, 
the LILYRIC group is indicated, 
2) Becc.use it app~ars that the co\'erage of the L:C-~ICK install11tlon 
will lie a lon;:;-rane;e and continuin 6 requlre:t1e:1t, the Station J.l!sirea 
to staff the nev h11.se with persoPnel of lor..:;-n-.r,t:e potentiel. Slnce 
Liu!!'"rY-G is now aln:ost 60 :,,ears old, it la obvious that he ,loes not 
possess this potentiftl; however, the T,ILYRIC a.se:it complex happily 
combines exp~rienced personnel vi.th youthful Qi;ents, 
3) Finally, the social and financial status of the Lil.YTUC perRnnnP.1 ls 
much more compatible Nici consistent vlth the en•"ironmt!nt o!" the nev 
building than is tr.at of the Ll:!-!ITED f81!111y, 
111:ile it is a:1ticlpated that these ll!OJifieationa and cha.n,-:;es will initially 
cause varicus c.clmlnletrRtive and operational probleos, it is believed that 
nll such adJustttents can ?:e hAndled locally, 
b) The requisite copies of t,1e ?!t?, Part II pert!;ient to LIE:-2".rY-26

to the LILYIUC basehouse. LI~.f?T':"-27 was granted a Provisional C;perational 
Approval on 26 Jimtlllry 1966 for use as a psrt-tit'le 1:11.sehouse keeper/operator
