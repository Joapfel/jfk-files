MEMORANUUM FOR: Director of.Personnel 
Fred: 
1. The facts behind the question raised with the­
Director by Mr. Maksymcc on Saturduy, 26 April, arc, 
according to him, as follows. 
. . . 
2. After.NPIC had done its fine work during the 
Cuhdn missil~ trisis it appears that two 1liffcrcnt types 
of recognition were given. Ucferminations were made 
first ·on certain in<l.ividuals whose contrihut ions were 
:;uch that they ~hould receive an i\g<.'ncy medal awar:d. A 
~ccon<l group of some 200 were then illentified for their 
level of-contribution and recci~ed some kind of certifi­
cate from the?_ White !louse signed by the Pr~sidcnt. Mr. 
Maksymcc was in the latter group and cspotises the cause 
that a "special me<lullion" should h:ivc been given along 
with the l\'hite House certificate. Mr. Rob Gnrnor also 
spoke to me' _on th is matter on Saturday, un<l has 11 good 
recollection on·thc whole matter. 
3. Will you do ~hat you can on the matter and pre­
pare me a letter to be sent to Mt. MuksyMcc?
