After being told by CJA
0 
ori.'31 Januar)·: 196.5. that a lead 
cable had been found in the north wing, XOSE?iKO said:. "I 
personally can assure-you that nothtng was done in that 
right wing. Nothing, absolutely nothing: Th-,re was ·nothing 
done there, so it· must: have been·something else." 
No extensive counter-audio chacks have yet been ct.rried 
out· in the north wing of the U. s. E:nba.ssy, and no wired 
microphones havo been found· there .. lo\•estigation of the 
microphones in the main secti-on of the Embassy led, however, 
to the discovery of •>ther Soviet t·echnical equipr.ient installed 
in the north wing. Tt:E- USIB d..nage report.stated: "Three­
coa::'Cial cables 11ere· discovered running parallel· to the on-e- -
hundred-and-one pair audio cable f~om the North Annex roof 
area to the basement of the North Annex ... [All three cables 
were severed by American technicians in 1964.) The cable 
runs were as follows: 
"l. The first coaxial cable ... terminated under s,ix 
inches o~ reinforced coneret~ in thd ~orth Annex attic. 
The ce£ter conductor was connected to t~e lead sheath 
of the 20-pair and of the 30 pair cable which in turn 
come fro~ the east face of the chancery. The shield of 
the coaxial cable was unconnected. 
"2. The second coaxial c2ble ... followed the same path 
as the first coa:-tial cable. The shield 11r·as i.nterminated. 
The center conductor was terminated io an ins~lated 
metal grill. The grill is located in the upper crust 
of the North Anne::t attic floor with the long dimension 
in ju~taposition to the old common wall between the 
Chancery and the North Annex. The long dimension is 
normal to the street in front of the Embassy. The 
grill is made of one centi~etcr steel reinforcing rods 
spot welded into a mesh of 15 cm. (5.9 inches). The 
overall dimensions of the grill are 14'4" by 4'7". 
The coaxial cable was conr.ected to one corner of the 
grill .... The grill is 1 oc::i.ted as close as possible to 
the old common wall and is about thirty feet below the 
State Department code roo~. Toe grill 'points' in the 
general direction of the code room as the plane of the 
grill is parallel to the plane of the ground. 
"3. The third coaxial cable ran along the approxi1:1ate 
path of the uther coaxial cables to the block cf rein­
forced concrete that contains the grill mentio::ied above. 
This coaxial cable terminated in a four-inch piece of 
fine Lits wire. The shUld of the coaxial, .:cable was 
unterminated ••• '': , ·
