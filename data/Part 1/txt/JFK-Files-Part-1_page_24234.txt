Q gives t.h'l i:npre., ion o,· not bein.=; easily J!IO"l:;d. He has 
already su..""Vived violent attacks, questi nin 5 by legislative coT.1ittees 
~nd y,:,li~ (ir.cludin 6 .,l.;.·u;,d), public ..:en:uic~11t..i.un; .::io:-: I.hat. h,. ha~ 
KUB.\RK as a friend he sho-.ili.l re:;1.st at least as well as before. One 
negative trait is his need. to take revenge for injury, and this 
tendency :mst be co:itrol.led; his instinct to be npiteful to an en~ 
could coni"lict 'l>ith a longer-rani;e plan. 
It is to be hoped that t.h"l present situation re~a:rding his wife 
(who believes hilll to be workin~ for th-, arch fN1 of : B:-iUl-~) will be 
possible to z:iaintain. 5he does:i 1t lilce th"l situ11.tion mch, but accept.s 
it, and apparently basn 1t betra:,·ed his 11 coniide:1ce". Ir he is .::oved 
to another city which both Q and his 'ld.fe would CCllSider agreeab.ie 
(Rane) :.he would-probatlj be even happier ar.d less likely to revolt, 
especiall7 if a quarters allowance helped them get out of th".:ir present 
.financial straits ( they can pa7 rent a."ld buy ::ood but not save or 
repa7 debts- so his vile sa:-s he is doing &.."l un?leasant thing without 
even being able to say they are better oif than they were in !'aris). 
If he t:ere sent to a less agreeable place for six months or a year 
(say Dar) he woulc wt!.nt, t.o settle his wife in a desirable place (London 
but preferably i-.a:ie) for the child.-en•s schooling; here too her attitude 
would depend on their ;:Ateri,d ~ositian and on the possibility or • 
bis being able to visit on occasion (il he ·were in Dar, eay, and she 
in Heme, he would return for visits- which would also be cover 
for his meetings with his case oificer). n.od:..gast. recommends that once 
in plAce, Q•s basic t.-a.ge be raised (as prCX!l.ised in June 1965) 1ra:n 
$6oo to $800, l-iut that be al.so receive quarters and if pos;;ib1,.e 
an educational. allowence. 
D. Q says he is a local PBPRD!L..!l. He now does act like one. 
nodigast feels the evidence for ·his loyalt·: is at least as ~ocrl as 
it is for most ot.her PBRrtil{:;:6 he knows. f.arly in their relationship 
(probably mid-June 1965 in Paris) ~ had said he had turned away irom 
the revolutionary ll!OVe.:.ent and to-..rard his ~ country; even thoueh there 
were 09portunistic reasons for him to have ci.one so, he is see,,cingly 
not anti-?B?Iul-S. His views on ilegro problems in Pan?JK:: probably have 
not ch!l.."lged, but he never ,ras a black nationalist, anJ has many friends, 
besides his wife, ;;ho are white). He might not agree with ODY:.?::; policy 
in Vietnam, Cuba, or elsewhere-- he obviously has not. been questioned 
on his personal belief~- but his dissent, if dissent there be, is 
not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent hi.Ia fr01ll executing 
KllijARK poliCJ' to the let.ter. Undo:ibt.edly be bas a leftist. econcx:iic • 
orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodox l-Ia.rxist 
one (or that it ever was). ,. 
Be seems to like aodigast; in any event thq work well together. 
He bas made no effort to develop a warm ~lationship with Rodigast, 
bo...-ever, appErent.ly feeling t.hat this is not necessary, might not 
be:ap;,recia;:.ed, an-.i would con1lict with the cocpart.centalization so 
obviou;;l7 kept. in force b,- ri.odigast (who hasn•t told~ bis true name, 
address, marital status, or any other personal. fact which might lead 
to identifyi:-:g bi::I). 5eea.ingly ~ does not believe the na:ne which P..odiga.st 
used at·tbeir intro::!:.iction was a true name, for he didn't bother to 
re.mecber it (the last nu.e), and all this wcw.d tend to discourage the 
'btdJding up oi a person.al. friendship. .~.
