· 5. Daniel M. O'Connell, a member of the American youth group which 
toured Communist·China after attending the Moscow Youth_ Festival, arrived 
in Hc>ng Kong on 6 Oct~ber 1957. O'Connell provided the': Consulate General, 
Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group. 
O'Connell said he saw Father Wagner in prison in Shanghai; he did not pro­
vide the Consulate General with more inf~rrnation a.bout Father Wagner. than 
• appeared in the press. He was quite cooperative with the Consulate General 
(he turned over his passport) and was most anti-Communist in public a.nd 
private statements. He described the greater part of the American group 
which attended the October 1 celebrations in Peiping as being politically and 
morally corrupt, and stated that only three members of the group, including 
himself, made any effort to defend the U.S. against Chinese Communist· 
critics. The shortness of O'Connell's stay in Hong Kong prevented spending 
much t:bne with him, but he stated that he would be happy to answer further 
questions after he returns to Chicago. (Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong, 
. number 289, 14 October 1957.) • •
