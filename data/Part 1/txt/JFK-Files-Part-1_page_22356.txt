4. Third Alter=at1ve 
The only other postulate ls that NOSt~KO 15 not what 
he claims to be, in which case his ~isr~preseotation was 
done either on bis own or as part of a KGB operation. 
pr 
If be is aisr<'pfcsentlng hlEs~lf on his own, there are 
(even in theory) ocly two p~ssibill!ies: He ls ccrcly exag­
gerating (discussC:d abovL", under th<' "First Alternative") or 
he is a fabricator. He cannot be a fabricator, however, since 
the Soviets have CC'rtiflcd him in run)' wars; includlcg his -
dlploaatlc status at the G1.•neva Con ferc:ice, Soviet o:.'ficial 
protests and So~l('t Emhassy confrontation in Wash}ngton, 
Soviet officials' r<-n:trk::. in ,·arious areas of the world, and 
reports frc,1:1 +-;t.it!B, other sourcPs or. his KGB status and
