CHAPTER II 
EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES 
What NOSENKO has said about himself, the information 
about the KGB which he has provided, and the apparently 
corroborative statements which Soviet officials have made 
since his defection represent prima facie evidence that 
NOSENKO is a former senior KGB officer. To permit a 
conclusive judgment that he is a bona fide defector, the 
information NOSENKO provides about his life and related 1, 
persons and events must be coherent, and his accounts of 
important events must be consistent. Allowing for personal 
vagaries such as lapses of memory and so forth, as well 
as for factdrs of ic~ident and coincid~nce, the information 
he relates must conform within reasonable limits with that 
which is kn-0wn from independent and r~liable sources to 
the United States Government about Soviet realities and 
about the events, topics and individuals NOSENKO describes. 
Lastly, the ihformation NOSENKO pro~ides must plausibly 
ielaie piimarily to the KGB p6siti6ns he held, and his 
~ccount of how he functioned in these positions must be 
substantiated by verisimilar detail. 
The following portions of this paper, organized in 
chronological fashion insofar as possible, summarize this 
examination of the significant aspects of NOSENKO's claims. 
Notes for ihe Reader 
In order to follow the examination as presented the 
reader should note the following: 
The examination tests the validity of the p~esumptive 
evidence favoring NOSENKO in terms of coherence, consistency, 
and compatibility with fact and plausibility.
