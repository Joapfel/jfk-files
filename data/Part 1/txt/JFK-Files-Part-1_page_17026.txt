·i. All a&ent terminations w~re accomplished in an 
. aJni_cable rtanrier .• No visible securitr· risks were apparent 
at the time·o; t~e tcrminati-on.s-although :rnr one, or all 
o! the terminationed agents rnay at some future date decide 
to divulge to an interested party the details o! the 
KOFACTOR Project pperatioµs. KUFACTOR·2 and KDFACTOR•S 
have worked in photo surveillance operations for the 
Station ~ince 1957 and, therefore, obviously ha~e consider• 
able knowled&e of tnrgets, former safesitcs, personnel, and 
modus operandi of the Station. However, since the KDFACTOR 
Project was not concerned with inco~patible operations or 
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station relations 
with the ~:cxic,..n Government in the event of exposorc of the 
KDFACTOR Projc~t operdtions by a terminated agent arc within 
acceptable licits. 
.. 6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project be amended 
· to provide the sma of $7,246 for FY-72 to cover the costs of 
·ter~inating five agents nnd two baschousc surveillance 
sites covered by this project. 
• 7, It is also requested that the termination o( the 
KDFACTOR Project be approved effective 30 June 1972.
