(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960) 
SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - 1955-1960: Summary and Conclusion 
NOSENKO's description of the activities of the Second 
Chief Directorate Seventh Department in this period is 
almost solely restricted to his account of these fifteen 
KGB opera_tions. Other than to allege that certain KGB 
officers he named were ·his subordinates, he provided no 
information to substantiate his claim that he had any 
supervisory or administrative responsibilities. The common· 
feature of the operations do not relate to NOSENKO's own 
description of the function of the Seventh Department's 
Tourist Section or later, to the American-British Common-
wealth Section. Most were sexual or other entrapment . 
operations, .and he acknowledges· tha:t several were operations 
conducted by KGB elements other than his own section. In 
short, NOSENKO need nqt have been in the Seventh Dep:artment 
-sections, as he claims, to.have learned_of or participated. 
_ in the activ~ti~s he describes. Although NOSENKO gives a 
.graphic.account of the-Second Chief Directorate's (apd his 
own) counterintelligence mission, his knowledge is not of 
counterintelligence operations among tourists; in the only 
three such operations he describes, the counterintelligence 
aspects were incidental. Contrary to his claims, NOSENKO 
is aware neither of all important KGB operations conducted 
against American -tourists during the period, nor what was 
known to the KGB about American Intelligence and British 
. tourist oper.ations. 
Conclusion 
While NOSENKO was associated 
operations against American and 
·auring the per1od 1955-1960, he 
officer nor Deputy Chief of the
