D, Remarks 
For no single responsibility h&e NOSENKO substantiated 
hie alleged ee:-vice as Deputy Chiof of the t.S. Embassy 
Section in the :ears 1960-1961. His statements about the 
appointoent to and transfer from this position have been 
inconsistent: bl& comparatively narrow experience and hie 
acknowledged falsehoods about a personal relationship with 
the Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, GRIBASOV, 
dispel the llkelih~.>d that those personnel aseigoments were 
made in the way be claims. Repeatedly he has been contra­
dictory about his activities during this two-year period, 
shifting his story to suit the occasion and ignoring bow 
each succeeding version nade all of his clai=s increasingly 
incredible. The limited extent of NOSENKO's information 
betrays a lack of familiarity with details on the duties, 
targets, and most of the o;,erations which he has 11!:;Cribed 
to hir.selt; in a certair. !~~ instances, however, s~ch as 
his description of'ABIDIAN's route to the Pushkin Street dead 
drop, he has recounted events juat as they are known from 
other sources to have occurred. Nevertheless, where col­
lateral information has covered the few subjects on ~hich 
h~ provided details, it has almost invariably.contradicted 
him and showed hia to be ignorant o! significant facts.
