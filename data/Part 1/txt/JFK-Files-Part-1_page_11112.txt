3. FRADYER is very much aware of Headquarter> intere t in 
L-9. Althou7ih he ple1ns to meet L-9 regularly he do·nts (a 
previously mentioned to Clyde K. SHRYOCK when' the latter r cently 
visited Mexico) that L-9 will live up to Headquarter> expe cations. 
,ts IMl'O:tii8P',&8 . ..,_~.i,,;lllie.Jf: 
A. He is actio~ as the general manager of the co fee 
grounds to ediblc9plant in Toluca in which he ,a;-,d his 
: brother cwn shares. Not only is tr.is a new firm, but the 
raw material and process used to make the oi I what 
~ of a no.,.elty. The plant is deeply in the red 
- to receive a salary and cor.r.~tes to Toluca by 
- close and time consuming attention. \.iith the 
_ it is and will be difficult for L-9 to get away 
- is needed by this Station. 
B. As pointed out by L-9 himself, L-9 ha~ r.ow be 
_Mexico for some six months and has succeeded in obtai 
~ f,rom Gobernacion his reinstatement as a resident al ie 
- must be fncreasin3ly evident to the Cubans (des~ite L 
- request for extended leave from his job in C1.,t.a) that 
yet 
requ f res 
wi 11, 
er ne 
-· latter wi 11 probab I y not go i,ack to Cuba. In other \o, 
_ the Cubans probably view him ~Qre and more as an exil . 
C. Because he spends ~ost of nis tirne aw~y from xico 
City and because his Cuban friends are bec1Yning 1DOce: eserved 
with him, L-9 has less and less contacts with visitin 
_ In fact, only one, the Subject of Mexico City 0733, t; 
_ phoned him when visiting Mexico since L-9's return to 
_ country. L-9, \o1ho senses ti;at he is now an exile in 
_ ·eyes of many of his friends in Cuba, is even reiuctan to 
_ write to them. He feels, for examole, that little wot Id ce 
- accomplished by writing to Ei.sebio tAZCUE lo;>ez, as thL latter 
would orobablv not leave Cuba because of his ·rnuna wi e and 
child even though he is fed-up with the Castro regime. On 
_ the c~ntrary, l-9 feels that he mi5ht not be coing AZ UE 
any favor by writing to him as the latter who is not nown 
_ for being an enthusiastic supporter of the re;i,:-;e may be 
_ under :iOO-e observation frow the Cut.an authorities . 
-, 4. Information,. obtained by L-9 from CARPEtnlER, Llzandro 
TERO and Nicolas \GUILLEN indicates 
A. Togethe~.with information from other sources tat 
~ the Cubans _proba.~ ! y prea~ranged to take over tr.e Congr s~ of 
¥ Latin American \ir1ters with the help of the other C un1sts 
and use it for pol~i ical purposes. 
B. T~at Cinti ITIER is obviously not trusted by the 
Castro regime and ma be in trouble. 
c. That the Cubans are making a major effort, in line 
with their pro-French policy to show themselves in Paris 
under the best light possible. 
o. That CARPENTIER obviously enjoys the coofidenc of 
the regime. His trip to Hanoi had certainly nothing t do 
with cultural affairs. It Is regretted that L-9 Jlo n t 
elicit further information from CARPENTIER on his visit to 
North Vietnam.
