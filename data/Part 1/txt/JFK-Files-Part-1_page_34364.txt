aro used in other nowspapor and magazine n1·ticlos, radio programs and 
tho like, there is no wny of making n good ostimnto of tho nmount of

8~ AMSCROLL radio programs, 15 mi,mtos daily OVOl' both WMIE and 
AMTllIGH, carried much tho same themes as tho AMSCROLL pross.r~leases, 
but with adjustments as •necessary fo1· tho Cuban audience, e.g., while 
AMSCROLL press 1·oloa~es !!light complain nbout continuod fro<1-world 
trade with and shipping to Cuba, the radio program would emphasize any 
decreases in the number of ships.

but at a slow pace. Tho 24 letters received during the past period 
contained 7 newspapel' clippings and threo pag'3s torn from telephone 
books, as requostod in AMSCROLL radio proi:ti·ams~ Nine of tho letters 
mentioned the AMTHIGH broadca5ts, ono noted receipt of the pony-sized 
bulletin and two 1·omi tted tho small ncknowled~ement forms which nccompnn 'I 
all AMSCROLL propaganda mnilod·into Cuba. Detailed statistics on these
