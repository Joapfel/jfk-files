NOS~NK01 I was speaking with GRI3l~JOV and KLYPIN. 
Question I Wnat dici KL"iPl!t say? 
NOSENK01 That •you are Doputy Chief of Section, but l 
consider that you ~ust also pay special atten­
tion to code clerka. We must study them iand 
make an approach to one of then. It's nece3sary 
to work on ti-.i.s. • KO\"SHUK was in KLYPI?: • s 
office and I remember also that he raised the 
question, •o.K. He wili supervi~e this kind 
of work, but maybe he can also take the military. 
All three attaches.• Well, K:..YPIN did not aay 
yes and die not say no. I coul.in't say anything 
because I had not begun, I didn't know how .imch 
work this would involva. I couldn't say. And, 
you see, KLYPIN saids •Let's try it a short 
period of ti!:18.• It vas that way. It was 
• decided that r. will supervise the code clerks 
and then the three attaches. 1-.nd KOVSH'OK took 
the diplomats and a whole pile of work. But, 
~---- ., of course, in the absence of. KO"..,SllUK I z:n:.st 
take everything an~ in rey abse."1ce, KOVSBUK 
lllUSt take everything. But later, 1,2,3 -- I 
don't remember dates -- later I was not super­
vising the military attaches but concentrated • 
only on code clerks.
