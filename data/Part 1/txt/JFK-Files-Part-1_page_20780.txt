The Ratipg OC!i~er 1s: las~ Htness ~4i-p8ot,pn Mr. Phillips de~l~ 
with his terminating ah outstandingly successful and very complicated 
assignm.;nt as Chlef of Station, Don}.ini_can Republic~ This re'port deals 
with. a complett)].y different situation, i.e. coming into Headquarters as 
. Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic• reduction had 
• jus·t become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and 
zeal which has characterized Mr. Phillips over the years has 
·charactcr~zed his performance in this difficult task since his 
assW11ption of the new t"<'sponsibility. He has been a prime mover in 
reducing the Headquarte.rs WHiCOG component to realistic and 
managable proportions. By the san1e token he has been a prime mover, 
guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to Jl\-1\VAVE management 
in i~s massive job of bringing Jf..lWAVE down from its ponderous 
proportions to a viable Clandestine Se.rvices "instrwnent" compatible 
and consistent with the present day needs oi Cuban operations. In this 
endea.vor Mr. Phil4ps' accomplislurtents have been of the !irst order.

f, Y REVIEWING OFFICIAL 
This is a very line officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. I 
believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views. Mr. Phillips' 
career advancement has been closely observed in this Division anrt I do not 
believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely 
expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time 
frame,) if his current excellent pe.-formance continues.
