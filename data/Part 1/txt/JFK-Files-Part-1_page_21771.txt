NuSENKO's Inforn:1tion 
SLI:SINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First 
Chief Directorate because of his busin~ss transactio~s 
with a nu:nber cf ·s::>viets ·,:ho -visited his store a:.d i:i 
whom be seerneci. to show r:v.Jre ::.h.:-1n casual interes::. The 
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that 
SLESINGER 0as tryi~g to become closely acquainted with 
somr.! Soviets, to study them. SLESI!:GER had visited the 
Soviet Union several times~ Learning SLESI~GER planned 
·another trip to' tha USSR, the KGB suspected that "he 
might make some contacts or do something interesting~ 
while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to 
resolve its suspicions· that SLESI~GER was possib!y an 
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KGB had 
a file on SLESINGER, .:nd a senior case officer in the 
American Section of the> Seventh Department, Yu. !-1. 
DVORKI!l, was the responsible case officer. An agent 
of the Seventh Deoartment who was director of a o:1oto­
graphic shop in M;scow was instructed to beccrnc 1ricndly 
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting t:1e So·Jl.et 
Union, and t~e two men later exchanged correspondenc..:? .. 
SLESI?JGER went to Odessa- to vi.sit relatives, and DVORKIN. 
directed· the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with ,agents. ·.,·ho. 
could watch his behavior. If there had been any indic3tion 
of intelligence activities, the KGE ~ould hav~ attc~?tCd-
to recruit SLESI~GER, but since no evidence was developed, 
no approach was nacle. SLESINGER had travelled to th.! 
Soviet Union before, several times. 
Cormnent: 
A sensitive source 
had reported to the 
FlH that the· 1-;c:3 SUSf;:Cted SLESI?:GER to 
be an_~lant" and that KGB officer 
~iiii.\lN "might be trying to develop 
SLESINGER to act as a courier or in some 
other agent capacity.• 
NOSENKO's information was substantially 
correct. Alfred Lazarevich SLESINGER, 
•. reported to the FBI in July 1962 of his 
June 1962 visit to Moscow and Odessa.
