I. In compliance wUh the KlffiARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60, 
Annex A, concerning comact arrangments under emergency conditions, the 
following information, Including recognition signals and bona tides, is 
forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the Lnformation, 
it was believed more appropriate to for.vard It separately rather than to 
include it with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LlEMPTY). 
2. Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could 
probably be contacted at one of the following places: 
a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A 
b. Mother's Residence: , IDENTITY B 
c. C.OVer Employment Address: IDENTITY C 
3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language, 
are to be used as indicated: 
CX>NfACT: "Mr. (GERENDE-true name), I bring the most 
sincere wishes and greetings from your Aunt 
and Uncle." 
GERENDE: "Then you are referrL"lg to the IDENTITY D. •· 
CX>NTACT: "No, 1 am referring to your other relatlves in 
South Carolina, the IDENT[TY E • " 
GERENDE: "Yes, Amule ls my Mother's slater." 
4. For use as physical bona tides, the Station ls forwarding a one peso 
note with the serial number T348510 for Headquaners files. GERENDE bas 
been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number. T348511, to 
keep in a safe place pendin:~ hls having to show it to some future ICUBARIC contact. 
It has been explained to GE-RENDE that he is to show his half of the physical 
bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and 
accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see hls physical bona 
fldes. GERE.i'\1OE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contaa:'s 
bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510). 
5. Assuming that adequate tlme will be available at the beginning of an 
emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret 
Writing·so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY Dor E 
addresses. -
