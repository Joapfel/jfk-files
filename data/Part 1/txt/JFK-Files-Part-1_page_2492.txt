\ 
these two women, agents of the Berlin KGB Residentura, to visit Moscow 
under false docume:itation, one as a West Ge:::-man and the other as an 
Austrian. NOSENKO further identified the "West German" agent, 
"HANNA, 11 as having the cover of a journalist, and stated he believed 
"HANNA" had met (MORONE]at A.."'nerican Ho..:.se. In a recent ir~te:cview, 
(MQRONEJ confirmed th~t in early 1961 he had met a "Nest German girl 
at American House who claimed to 'be a journalist. The statements of 
'-
. MORONE) therefore appear to substantiate the report of NOSENKO. 
Concerning the agent documented as an Austria:n, NOSENKO re-
ported that she was queried about her passport at American House and 
as a result the KGB returned her to East Germany wifaout further 
attempts to use her at American House. NOSENKO places this incident 
in the sanie time period as the ''HANNA" case; i.e., 1960 - 1961. He
