The KGB defector Nikoray· JqiOKLOV had earlier ic!entified the 
Polish-born wife of WHI1NEY<c1s a .KGB agent, an allega~ion which 
she denied, and it had been Jong· assumed that \·f.-iIT.tEY too had 
reached some sort of acco:nmodation·with the KGB because of this 
fact and because of the long duration of his tour as a correspond-
ent in Moscow. • • 
GILMORE also had been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in­
formation was received. He served in Mo~cow for 12 years, from 
1941 to 1953, ar.d 1s married to a Soviet national. 
SALISBURY served two ~hort tours, of about one year each, 
in Moscow during the 1950's. During the second of these, he 
became enamored ~ith the Pole who was to becom~ h'HI'INEY's wife 
(see above) and was during this period a subject of criticism by 
other A~erican correspondents in Moscow for his pro-Soviet arti­
cles. When rau~~EY married the Pole sl.ortly after STAI-IN' s 
death, SAL·ISBIJRY returned to the United States and his ·articles 
took on an anti.-Soviet tone. 
NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two A~erican 
correspondents who:n he identified as KGB agents, STEVZNS and 
S.TEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory 
information in CIA files. They are discussed in Part VI.D.2. 
under the heading of NOSENKO's A'llerican leads. 
3. Operations Against Military Attache Personnel 
Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of 
his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then 
until his transfer from the A'llerican Departrr,ent he handled KGB 
Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person­
nel of the u.s. Military Attache's office. NOSENKO's account of 
the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of 
the acceptance of the attache files is presented below. 
- 8 April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases 
from Nikolay KHRE!mv... When I was leaving in 1955, I turned 
the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN." 
- 10 April 1964: "I made a mistake ... I said I accepted 
the cases from KHRENOV when I was taking on the Military Attache 
work. 'Illis is not right. KHRE?JOV wns not working in the First 
(U.S. Qnbassy) Section; he was working in the Fi:::st. (A-nerican) 
Department. I took over the cases from--let's see, there was 
ZHUKOV and Vladimir Aleksandrovich CHURANOV, and here was my 
table (desk), and I accepte<i the cases from Pavel Fedorovich 
• PANKRATOV. 'Illis was in the beginning of 1954. ''

- 15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned 
over the correspondent files to. F. V. KISLITSYN ( who returned, • . 
to the USSR from Australia in May 1954). NOSENKO asked when 
the PETROV's defected in Australia: he explained that he was
