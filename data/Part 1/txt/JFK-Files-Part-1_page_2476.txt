Pages 216 - 221 o:f the previous su.."n1nary contain a summary 
on fu.e matter of the Pushkin Street deaddrop site which John ABIDIAN 
visited on 30 December 1961. It should be noted that a current review 
of the 1964 - .1966 interr9gations of NOSENKO on this ma.tter indicates 
they were 'lli"1.able to clarify the matter and di<i much to confuse the issue. 
Current interviews, as indicated above, have not fully resolved 
the problems, but have assisted in at least .minimizi.."1.g the areas of 
conflict or confusion. · It is apparent that NOSENKO was not in the First 
Section, Fir st Department, for any material period of time after 
8 30 December 1961. It is also clear that he eitner read the surveilla:nce. 
report on the visit of ABIDIAN to the Pushkin Street deaddrop site or 
was :fully briefed on the details of the visit. NOSENKO insists that he 
read the surveillance report at the time or s!-1ortly after the event. 
There is no reason.to question his assertion that he read the report 
- sin;;e his accurate knowledge of the route of ABIDIAN and his actions 
in connection with the visit support this clai..--n. However, his consistent 
inability on his own to approximate the date o:f the visit or rela:teit to 
his change of assignmer...ts raises a question regarding when he actually 
:read the report.
