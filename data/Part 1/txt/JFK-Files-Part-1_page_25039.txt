c . L IRCCK.l:."1'-1 : 
1) LIROCKET-1 is met LlOathly, tine and place arr.anicd , 
·at the previous meeting. Durln;; thct;e LieC:ti:nis he is <lcbricfed 
on his twice-\·1eelcly tenchinz r;_c,ssions at the J.IIU.IAil.SH Et1bassy. 
His rc~ulnr ctudcnt has been the Su!Jject of 201-028!>75, nnd he 
has had occasional dcalin~s Pith othor ig~ARSficrs, particulnrly 
AESEASICJC. The· lllCCtill!;S with 201-02~063 l!?..VC not been, of 
particulnr intcrc•t:il:, and ~10 had been waiting i.l:ipaticntly for 
the lattcr•a replncc1;1cnt to nrrivc, so th:i.t LIP.OCY.1:.'T-1 \·:ould 
have a better tar.:ct to \'1ork on. It was LIP.OCKET-1 uho . 
came up with the firnt local confirmation of the idcnti ty of 
this rcplacr:uent (l,!EXJCO CI'l'Y 1105, 2 Aur;1i~t 19GD). Dcalin~s 
with AESI:ASICK bi.\VC been concerned with attempts by tho 
director of the school where LrnOCY..b"f-1 teaches to borrow 
sociolo~ical film:J from the J.llilL\liSII Ulm offico. 
2) It now appears, howcve1·, that LIROCKET-1 has 
roached the end of the line. For somo ti.L-c he has ·been involved 
in a rather oeEsy divorce action, and in August LIROCY.ET-1 
reported that his wife had denounced hi.In to Uexican authorities 
as an r.VRoc1: agent (a few months previously,· she had denounced 
him as an MIIIIARSH a.cent). LI!:OCKET.:.1 was not inclined. to tnl:.tJ 
his wife I so-ravines· too se1•iously sinco he considered 
0
hor slightly 
nuts. Howover, Llli1iVOY reported that on 16 September 1969 
LIROCKET-1 's wife called 201-028975 nnd told him ·she had to sec h .rJ 
urgently on soir.ethine of extrer..:i· interes·t • aoout her husband .• 
201~028075 told her to come to tho tz,1bassy, which she did, and 
she presumably repeated her accu::mtion. Since that t·i1:ie, 
LIROCK:cT-1 has received a polite brush-off. Ile has been told 
that tbe' J.lllllAP.Sll Dnbassy lute run out of· :funds for J::nglish 
• 1nnguaee trainine, and that .there .would. ·bc ... no' .. more ·lessons .. • . 
unless. 2'01-028975 1 s replacer.ient, or the neu Ambassador (when 
and if. one arrives).wantecl to rehiro him. He was told, . 
however, to check in 1•egularly, and he ,ms glvan, •• as .usllal, 
an invitatiou to the annual J,lliH:\RSll national clay reception (ho 
did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 bas not spoken 
with 201-028975 since his wife's visit--all dealin:;s have been 
throui;h AEPOLYP, • who has for· so::e time been the paymaster for 
LIROCKET-1. 
3) LIR~KET-1 was not auare of his wife's vtsit, a~d 
even after the case officer, without tellicb him that we knew 
or the visit, brou~ht LIROCirnT-1 around to .the conclusion that • 
she might have done this, he still does not think that she 
spilled the bean~ to 201-028975. (It is apparent that the • 
IDIHARSHers, whether or not they believe ltrs. LIROCKET~l's 
story, ha.ve concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a.secu1~1ty. 
hazard, and they are sinply goicg to drop him. LIROCKET-1 
\ 
wi 11 continue to press . the ?.IHHARSJiers for an answer regarding 
his future y,ith t.hem, and if, as suspected, they keep putting 
him·off, he will·be instructed to break contact and.he v:ill be 
terminated by the Station.) . . 
4) Other·than the blowine of LIROCKET-1 himself, 
little damage hns been done. The wife bas never seen the curren·t 
case of:ficer nnd knows none of the· meet in~ ,arrangements, or· .. other -
