Summary: The Berlin NPD has been plagued by n split between the 
Berlin City lendership, ·which it; loya·1 to the Party's national leaders, 
and the "Loya lists'.' hen_ded by the Berl in district· leaders, who opposed 
the dis.solution of the Berlin NPD._orderea by Notional Party Chairman 
Adolf von Thadden in October '196ti;. ·co,1rt -action led to the thwarting 
of the plan. for dissolution. In ,an effort to keep the Berlin Party 
alive·, in mid-March von Thadden ordered a cessa·tion of open Porty· ac­

will obtain ?5 to 35 &1ndestag seats in September, which, they feel, 
will make the party more acceptable to right-wing voters in Berlin 
and enhance NPD ch;inc-es· during ,,the 1971 Berlin communal electi'ons.
