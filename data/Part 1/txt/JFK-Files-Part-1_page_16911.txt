1. Durinr:; the reporting period, the project's principal 
n(:ent, Raymond H. GJ•:RF.NDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed 
at broadeninr; his usc-fulness to tho Stl\tion. These tasks 
included spotting and assessment ns woll ns the handling of a 
recruited a~ent, lillFJ\IN-J.t- GERENDI-: did well, and it is believed 
that a new dimension has bee~ opened fo~ him, and by tho same 
token, the Stl\tion has, in effect, gained a new asset. The 
LIEm'TY base houses continued to produce nt their usunl rate 
and with their usual effective support to Station HEDTOP oper­
ations. The LIMITJ-:0 Base House nnd its operator, LilmPTY-6 1 -
were terminated on 31 May 19tj8. Te1·mination was decided upon 
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur­
ably decreased the reliability and d'fectivoness of LIEMPTY-6;s 
work. LI.EMPTY-26 was rehired, which pormitted the l,ILYRIC Base 
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC 
and LIMITED had together in the past.
