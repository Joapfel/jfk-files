N:,·: apa:rtment 68: in• Brooklyn·,· NY ·_H230. He· ls· unemployed. 
_ _ -11. •P-ERSONAL cEVALUATioN: UZ~OV is ·a sma'rt, witty; outgoing,· 
aggressive person_, acc1/stoined to fiving by his w_Hs. He is • • 
wiH.irig to t·ake c'hances ·and pla'y _roles, but, at·the same time, 
he is il9t afraid· o·f hard work, as long a_s·it pays well.-. He is 
somewhat_ g_iveri to romanticb:ing, for example, by·seekin!J a job 
·1n•·intelligence a,rid not fully realizlng _that it is a·steady 
and, often, d~llcjob. He is not per:sistent~_not able to. stick 
tti hi~ ·stu~ies 6r hold a job; ·instea~. h~"Jrefers to wo~~ hafd 
for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nottiing. 
UZLOV seemed to be completely won ove~ by the Unite~ 
States; sayirig that he is willing to d~ anything 'that would be 
asked of him. such as.his voluntarily .bringing in photographs 
of some of the per~onalities he described, and suggestin~ that 
-he would try to use.the lopse c6de system that he had established 
~ith his ftiends .batk in Minsk to·obtafri iriformation for us, 
if- ~e so ~~ijuire. At the l_ast possible moment, _he admitted • 
that he was 1n£arierat~d in ~he USSR for partfcfpatiori in a 
fight, but ~as later found i~nocent by_a higher coort~ 
PhysJcally, UZLOV i_s good-looking, trim, athletic, 
and is a former boxer~ ~ho trys to keep himself in gotid shape. 
He likes to dress well and, seemingly, -no longer drinks to 
excess,· as he tised· to do iri the Soviet Union.·
