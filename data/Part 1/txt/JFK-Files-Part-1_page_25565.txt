system of "ghost payrclling" is quite comrion in Mexico, as everybody 
gains: the company becatisc its declared profit is lower than it • 
really is and, therefore, subj•ct to lesR t~x, and the individual 
because he is ordinarily given a kickback for allowing his name to 
be used (or in Gi:.'RLNDE's case, because it. provided cover). 
3. All this ended on 31 Dec-~mber HHi'i, when LISTl.'RINE sold 
IDEN B to IDt:N A. For a while therc:tftcr, GF;RUIDJ:: paid taxes o:>ly 
on the money he actually earned with 1D1::N A, which was, as stated, 
about 500 pesos per month. As of l July 1968, however, LISTERiliE 
arranged, at GE:RENDE's request, to have his accountant (who continued 
to handle GER~DE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to· lurnp together 
all of G.t::RENDE's earnings (froin teachtnc as well as ID.EN A) as 
"professional earnin~s" and to file returns for GEHtlWE which included 
the total amount. This is not quite n~ satjsfactori as the old 
arrangement (among other things GJ:.'ItJ::NDJ-: must now pay his own taxes) 
but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE 
and the accountant, no one knows that GERJ:llD!::'s ostensible earnings 
have dropped; and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person 
who is aware of GERJ::ND!::'s tie with WOl-'IRM.
