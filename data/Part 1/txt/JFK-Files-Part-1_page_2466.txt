Embassy Section nor a senior officer or su?ervisor in the Section 
during the period of 1961 - 1962 (sic). (Previous conclusion) 
It is fue conclusion o:f this su.--nmary that NOSENKO held the 
. . . 
position of Deputy Chief, ]first Section (American Embassy Section), 
SCD, from January 1960 - December 1961. 
The claim of NOSENKO that he held the abov~_ position ir.. 1960 
- 1961 has qeen the most diiiicult clai_~sition of NOSENKO to 
satisfactorily resolve and accept. Acceptance or nonacceptanca of 
- -----------~---------------------~----·-
, 
his claim to have held this particular position is a cl.'.'itical factor in 
a decision as to whether the remainder of his claimed KGB career 
is valid. It is believed reasonable to presume that if NOSENKO was 
Deputy Chief of the Ame;l"ican-British Commonwealth Section, Seven.Ji 
Department, prior to December 1959 i..'l the absence of any indication 
that he was ciem_oted, he should have been at least a Deputy Chief oi 
Section during 1960 - 1961. 
Position in tl:.e SCD, KG3, and throughout the l{GB is im.po:.:tar ... t 
from a monetary point oi view as well as a p:::estige point of view. .i.r
