Acting Chief gave NOSENKO access· to, and req•Jired hi~ to 
kn011, the extent of the u.s. E~a&11y Soction•a knowledge. 
of its target. He haa therefore beun questioned at length 
by CIA about the locations and cccu.pents o: tho Ei:ibascy 
offices as .,.ell as about the E::-.bassy personnel whom the lCGB 
had identified as CIA officers. '!'ho information froi:'. 
NOSE.'iltO on these two topics is presentud below. • 
(ii) Physical Premises 
NOSENKO has said that t .!.6 k,.owledgo of the physical 
layout of the Embassy cerives bctii. from his general super­
visory fun·ction during 1960 and·l~6land f·rot.1· :nts rcsIJon­
sibilitios as the officially registerod ~ustodian of the 
KG!l's file en the security o!: tha E.rrbassy. According to 
NO~i::::TKO, he received the latter !'rom his chief, KO'.'SHIJK, 
~hen he arriveJ in the section in January 1960: shortly 
thereafter ha arranged by a phor.~ ~all tot.he s~cretariat 
of the Second Chief Directorate to have custody transferred -
o!fi::::ially to his name from that. of ~.F. 13.~HVALOV ,_ his 
predecessor as De?uty Chief of Soction. NOS£NKO explained 
t.'lat aAKHVALO\' had already left tho aoction by· t:-iis time 
but that, under KGB prccE•.l\;rcs, it .., .... s per~issi:,le for an 
officer to re~in official custodian of a file belonging 
to the u.s. Einbassy Section, even after loav~ng the American 
Department, so long as he remained in the ·Seccnd Chief 
Directorate. Until he turned this file over to GRYAZNOV 
approximately durin~ the pariod 25 to 28 December 1961, no 
one else had access to it other than KOVSHCK, Chief of the 
section, anu GRYAZSOV and KCSOLAPO'.', who shared the office 
and safe where this file was kept. 
NOSENKO stated in February 196S th11t he had never 
studied the contents, nor had he paid any special attention 
• to this file •. Since he would necessarily ha~e been in a 
position to know, NOSENKO also &aid he is certain that no 
operational analysis or pla.'U\ing. by" himself er others was 
• done on the basis of this file during his two l"ears in the 
section.. The file consisted of two volumes, one for the old 
building on Mokhovaya Street and the second--about one inch 
t:hick-•concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy 
S~et, which was occupied in 1953. It was used only for 
reference purposes, for the KGB, had concluded that it was 
i:llpoeeible for a Soviet citizen to penetrater·the secure 
areas. of the Embassy because.of the security precautions in 
effect. Apart from these file-custodial duties, NCSENKO waa 
generally interested in the floor plans of, the· Embassy. by 
.virtue of his position as Deputy- Chief of the section •
