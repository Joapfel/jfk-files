FITNESS REPORT Daniel Flores 
SECTION D (COSTl~UED)_ 
activities in Latin America, due largclr to 1-lr. Flores' 
professionalism. 
Mr. Flores' current assignment is a combination of 
operational and Headquarters desk responsibilities, the 
latter calling for the support of field stations in their 
efforts to develop individual Cuban recruitment programs, 
His extended TDYs have understandably prevented Mr. Flores 
(from devoting much time to his desk responsibilities and it 
is somewhat difficult to judge his performance as a desk 
officer. He has a good grasp of what needs to be done, and 
his handling of specific tasks indicates good managerial 
potential, Nevertheless, he does need additional desk 
experience, especially in areas which will allow him to use 
his operational ability to support and guide _field stations 
that are developing Cuban operational programs, 
COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL (CONTINUED) 
this aspect of his performance was less noteworthy, and it 
is believed more attention and research could have been given 
to this activity. Mr. Flores writes concisely and well, and 
his CI/CE instincts are sh:.irp and fruc, lie can be expected 
to turn in a solid desk performance in the future.
