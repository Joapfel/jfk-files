CON"'f.\CTS IN !.IADHI D 
34. Little is k11own about RUIZ' contacts.in Madrid. Aside­
ffom the Algerian Ambassador (sec above), we know about: 
a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friehd who goes to RUIZ' 
home frequently~ Accbrding to ~UI~, Pedro is quite 
influ~ntial and is a friend of MASSO(?). 
b. Carlos_ CARRASCO. Another person who calls 
RUIZ frequcutly.· In late October or early November 1969 
CARRASCO went to !fow York." 
. c. Rosendo CANTO (201-749310}. CANTO lives at Goya 
54., Madrid. ilis fric?ndshi.p .\':i th RUIZ is interesting, given / 
CANTO's background, because their being together could be v 
very dangerous for nUIZ :tnless he \\'ere using CAiffO for 
some reason with the app1·oval of Havana. CANTO wants to go 
to l~vana for a year, live ther~ for a yeat, ancl then join. the 
Cuban Foreign Service. R·cferrinc to CANTO' s desire, RUIZ 
said on S January· Hl70: "Uc is,a fool~' 
CIL\Rr\CTER 
35. Superficially, RUIZ seems to be an casr-going ancl rath_er 
sir.iple man who no doubt enjoys the pr.c~tige and pvsition • he has 
and the succ<:s!'?cs he h:i.s had profc"ssional ly in Spain. He· ap1x ars 
to h:i.vc n stron;; ch:i.ractcr and probah1y_plays the predominant
