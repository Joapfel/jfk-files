In tho period of this report, Subject ristablished himself and his 
famili at this post and undertook the direction of tho Station's 
operati-ons against the subversive left which had formerly been handled 
by ari officer 'two grades senia.·to ~ubject. He has proved equal to the 
task. He learned his new assignrnent rapidly and adapted well to the 
handling of his cases through outside principal agents, a security 
requirement of'the local scene which can be frustrating for an 
.aggressive officer--wtth-~luent Spanish such as Subject. However, he has 
shown maturity:and superior handlin~ ability in directing his assets 
against the subversive left and particularly the Communist labor union. 
His intimate knowledge of the extreme left enabled him to plan secure 
contact with a "walk-in" to the Embassy who at first appeared genuine. 
After thoroughly debriefing this individual, drawing upon his knowledge 
of the extreme left, Subject wa£ able to recommend no continuing contact 
with him due to specific fabrications·on the part of tho walk-in. 
He is careful in managem~nt of funds entrusted to hi~ for his 
operations a~d provides required administrative and opcrati~ial reports 
in a tim_ely manner•- There have been past comments on Subject's weakness 
in writing. He has-·worked hard on.--this, and the rating officer feels 
that he is now competently producing the reports required. Subject 
understands that this is an area that requires cont.inuing attention fo1• 
a growing professional. /CONTINUED/
