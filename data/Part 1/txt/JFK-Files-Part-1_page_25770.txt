HMMW-5626, 3 December 1957 
1. Raymond H. GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March 
1955 un<.kr provisions of an oral agre.:!ment. Effect iv~ 1 October 1955 GERENDE 
was placed und~r a wrinen contract, prepared by H~adquaners, with an annual 
salary of $3,600.00. On l S-:!ptemb~r 1957 his contract was amended to incre!as~ 
his salary to $-l,080.00 p-;:r annum, which is the salary he is prcscmly receiving. 
It ls requeswd that a new rwo year c::.;n~ract be prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959, 
providing an increase in s.llary to $4,560.00 per annum and including a termination 
clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary, 
calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for 
each full year of his KUBARK employment. All ocher pro\•isiuns of GERE.'1DE's 
initial contract should r.::tT,ain in force. (The increase in salary co $4, 560. oj 
per annum is already covered by the LIE.\.f.PTY Project.) 
2. As pointed our in the attachment to HMMA-i1368, 22 October 1958, 
paragraph three of MEXI-2336, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Field 
Project Outline, GERENDE is a highl~• valued full-time Station a~sct who carries 
a signlflcant work load and who has a great deal of responsil>ilit);. He is :he 
LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LIL YRIC and UC.ALLA has,~ 
houses, the Llfu\ffRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans­
lation service and all the ag;:?nts panicipating in these activities. H~ performs 
his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent 
abilities are showing continu~d Improvement. 
3. Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indic,tted that the 
S~ation wa3 consid~ring ailicnding GEnE.\lDE's contract to providi.: ior sorne type 
of retirement benefits. Although it is recognized that indigenous a~ents are not 
usually granted such contract provlsions, the Station believes that GERENDE should 
have monetary incentive, in addition to his ld~logy, to make a long career with 
KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station reco:nmends thac GERENDE's new contract 
provide for a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year th,u 
lie has worked for KUBARK. In other words, should GERENDE's career with 
KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this ~riod is $3,000. ( 0, . 
then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum paymen_t of $16,000.00. .After 
.considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow accmmt and .several 
other ideas, the Station considers the aix>ve proposal to come closest to meeting 
the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make 
KUBARK acare~r. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date 
for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits.
