t:{r .. _Phill~ps 1 performance during the four months covered by this 
evaluation has been h:ighly satisfactory. For some years previous to 
my arrival here, in June 1970, I had been .acquainted with him, and 
from- this I already had ·a favorable impression of his qualities. This 
impression has continued and has impr~ved further, He has worked 
quietly and discreetJ_y, has icept me informed of a l_l ~p_or tant deve-

lopments/ and has c·oordinated as nec,fss_ary with other offices ·1n 
tml>assy. His interest in his work, and his dedication to the job, 
have been outstanding. His relations with others are very good, 
Because of wide previous experience in this hemisphere, he.frequently 
is helpful ·tp unbassy officers in areas outside•his own specialization. 
He appears to manage .hls personnel well. In functions outside the 
111- Embassy, both he and his wife conduct themselves in a quiet, friendly, 
and wholly creditable manner .
