(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
Visits to Legal Residency 
As in 19,62, NOSENIW said he visited the Legal Resi­
dency daily. According to strict rules, he explained, an 
officer in his status [temporary duty assignment which was 
independent of Residency] should not do so,· but his case 
was exceptional because he w~s a Deputy Chief of Department 
and because of the relationship he established in 1962 
through the intervention of M.S. TSYMBAL. Illegals Direct­
orate Chief TSYMBAL, NOSENI<O related in 1964, was an old 
friend; they had become acquainted in Moscow before meeting 
again in Geneva in 1962, when they dihed together frequently. 
TSYMBAL's wife once had taught NOSENKO in school, and 
TSYMBAL had once offered NOSENKO a job in the Illegals 
Directorate. NOSENKO asserted.that TSYMBAL's introduction 
of NOSENKO to Rezident GAVRICHEV in 1962 permitted NOSENKO 
to frequent t_he Legal Residency in 1964. 
Comment: In 1962 NOSENKO attributed his access to the 
Res.idency to his "old friend Yurjy GUK", not 
TSYMBAL. He . mentioned TS"¥".MBAL.' s presence in 
Geneva but clairned no close acquaintance. 
• Avail.ability for i-1eetings with ~ 
In 1964 NOSENKO behaved as if he had no official 
responsibilities or any demqnds_ on his time, and he was 
willing to spend all of· his ·time in meetings with CIA .. He 
·said that his absence from the Disarmament Delegation could 
be explained as· "security duties" since everyone on the 
Delegation knew or suspected that he was a KGB officer. 
From the first meeting on 24 January until 4 February, 
NSOENKO met CIA officers thirteen times for meetings usually 
lasting for five or six hours. By mutual agreement, most 
of the meetings started in the afternoon. On two occasions 
NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours and several meetings 
continued until past midnight.
