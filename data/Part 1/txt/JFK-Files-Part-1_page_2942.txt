Top Secret 
(PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT) 
Psychiatric Examination 
Since April ,l.964 NOSENKO has been under the observation 
of the CIA psychiatrist. Besides monitoring many of the 
interrogation sessions, the psychiatrist has visited NOSENKO 
weekly for the first year, monthly until 1967, and at some­
what less frequent intervals since. 
Findings 
NOSE~KO is neither psychotic nor neurotic. Of above 
average intelligence, he is shrewd, perceptive, and. highly 
adaptable. His memory is riot defective·. Besides suffering 
from ordinary lapses of memory, however, he sometimes 
falsely claims lack of re~all. • NOSENKO'·s thought processes 
are unimpaired; he.is rational and fully capable of distin­
guishing fact from fiction. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: Conciusion 
The findings·of the psychologist and psychiatrist dispel 
the notion that NOSENKO's behavior and his statements are 
other than willful.
