discussion belcw. This subject, to~, must be cor.siuered neutral 
evidence in the bona ficies assessment. 
NOSF.NKO has shown himself to be both uninformed and inaccurate 
in his answers to questicns on KGB Headquarters staff procedcres 
(Page 360 and Pages 619-624). He has b~cn una~le to contrioute 
any new inf.;rmation, although there ht>.s been no <!£tailed repcrting 
on the st:bject since 1954. (GOLITSYN in 1962 provided so:ne nev 
material en procedures but wa5 never comprehensively cebricfed on 
the topic.) Thus, information on thr more up-to-date forms, co­
ordinaticn requir~mcnts, mechanizatio~ of records and tracing 
mechanisms, etc., could have been a singular contribution to our 
know~edge: NOSE~KO could not describe anything of this sort. When 
he replied to questions about such matters for the period covering 
his entry into the KGB, on which oreviou~ repo=ting is available 
in det'l.i 1, he answere,j incorrectly en nW!1c=ous points. NOSENKO' s 
tendency to improvise w~cn he did not know the co=rect answer or 
when he had forgotten hos been characterized by a CIA psychologist 
as the behavior of a i;.lt.hological liar sa·1iny face -in a tight 
l pEychological situation. ~h~n te could not produce a correct 
I 
answer in this area of reporting, NOSE~KO ~ay have improvised 
because he is a liar or bec~use he is concealing an ignorance 
\based on not having been a KGB Headquarters officer. 
3. Cpcrational Leads 
a. Introduction 
Consideration of NOSE~,:i:o• s operational leads must take into 
account the KGB positions and personal associaticns (with attendant 
access t() information) wl1ir:h rmsr.1;;,:o has clc11.mcd for himself. He

tions and develop~ent cases increased as he rose from case officer 
in the U.S. Embassy Section in 1953-1955 dnJ in ti:le AII:erican 'l'ourist 
Section in 1955-1958 to beco~e Deputy Chief of the latter section 
in 1958-1959, Deputy Chief of the U.S. E:nbassy Secticn in 1960-1961, 
and finally Deputy Chief of tt.e 'Tourist Departr:1e:-:.t from 1962 until 
his defection. Simultaneously he established lasting contacts with 
his KGB colleagues so that, for examp~e, even after leaving the 
U.S. Embassy Section for the second ti~e, in Dece::iber 1961, NOSENKO 
kept abreast of its rr.ost ir.iportant activities. 0:1 these grounds 
NOSEt:KO present:ed himself as an authoritative source, one who 
could detail the successes and failures of the KGB in recruiting 
Westerners--especially America:1s--in the USSR over the years from 
1953 through 1963. Repeatedly NOSENKO asserted.that his leads to 
KGB agents constituted proof of his bona~-
