We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1 
by Jacques Verges• lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer 
on behalf of his client. QREBOh"Y/1 will probably accept this, 
after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and· 
effective ammunition for use in his continuing battle to counter 
Verges• allegation that he was a WOFACT agent. It is our reading 
at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this 
effort and that this settlement from Verges will be the final 
triumph in his campaign.
