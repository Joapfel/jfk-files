by the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance

.was set up across the street. In addition, the radiator 
was checked daily to see if ~nything, such as a mac;netic 
container, had. been conceale~ behind it. This stationary 
post was maintained around the clock for 30 days, after 
which it was maintained from 0800 until midnight for another 
two monthn. If a package or magnetic container had been 
found behind the radiator, ~~ich was checked every morning, 
it was planned to actach to it very thin wires to trigqer 
a signal should someone remove the package. At the saine 
time a member of the surveillance team would oo st~tioned 
on the landing of the staircfse in this building, out of: 
sight from the hallway below. During the three months 
that the post was maintained, nothing was found concealed 
behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persons seen 
entering or leaving the building. The post was then dis-
continued, but the addre~s w~s placea on a list of sus-
