CIA while at the same time the CIA has penetrated~ 
KGB. From this moment, I do not conceal this fact, 
I began to feel afraid that the KGB would somehow 
learn of my contact with you. This article deeply 
'interested' the KGB. 
During 'the cl_osed trial of PENKOVSKIY I got a 
pass from the Second Department and went, in order 
to look at him my~elf. For sometimes it is enough 
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself 
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort 
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked 
how PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked 
his appearance and I understood that everything 
which had been said in the KGB about him and the 
sort of person they were trying to make him out to 
be (that he was morally degraded, that he had 
descended and sunk into a swamp) that all this was 
nonsense, bluff, and chatter. And PENKOVSKI¥, the 
·same as GOLITSYN, gave me a feeling of great~r 
confidence in the correctness of the decision taken 
bj me to leav~ the Soviet Union .
