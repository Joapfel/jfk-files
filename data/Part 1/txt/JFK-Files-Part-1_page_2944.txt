(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIOilS) 
This examination had led to the following findings, 
arrived at independently: 
-NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the 
capacities or at the places and times he claimed. 
-NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at 
the time .he cl•aimed. 
-NOSENKO did not serve in the A.'Tlerican Embassy Section 
throughout the 1953-1955 period as he clai~ed. 
-During the period 1955-1960, he was neither a senior 
case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Depart­
ment American-British Commonwealth Section. 
-NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American 
Embassy Section nor a senior officer or supervisor in 
the Section during the period 1961-1962. 
-NOSENKO's-claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the 
American-British.Commonwealth Section and was thereafter 
a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible. 
-NOSENKO has no. valid.claim to certainty that the KGB 
recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and 
his defection in 1964. 
These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of 
probability or certicude, but they reflect the preponderance 
of available evidence in each instance. 
The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive 
evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in 
NOSENKO 's a·ccounts of his life and KGB service are so 
extensive as to make his claims as a whole unacceptable. 
While truth and fact in this case frequently cannot be 
· established with certainty, it is evident that truth and 
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test, 
virtually any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by 
fact or prooability, or contradicted or retracted in his own 
statements. NOSENKO is not what he claims to be, and thus 
he is not a bona fide defector.
