that W IBAl..DA understood tho s 1tun tion, and that I was sure 1 t 
would all. co well. AMC.1lALK-5_ assured irie that ho has no inten-
• tion of·lottinK h1lllfle1f K0t into u physically dnn~orous situation 
<luring the contact. • • 
5. If tho contact is m.nde next w_cek, AMCHALK-5 will be 
.back before 'Cff&- PACUAUKIS is. I said we would want to debrief 
him _in Uiami nud- that oither I would see him or PACHANKI8 would, 
I said _'thnt if PACtlANKIS. talks to him, he can toll PACHANKIS tho 
comploto c10ta1ls of tho oporntion unleoe I phoned him otherwise. 
6. Wo urrnnge<.I to mcot a~l\in at l9'i0 hours wheri AldCHALK-5 
wol)ld bavo bis itinerary, nnd I could paea bim the money ho noeded. 
AMCHAL.K-5 doesn't want to ba pnid tor this job, but I insisted 
&Kain that wu would pay all his e~pe11Bee, and I told him to eave 
his hotel b1H -and other rccoipts. We met at 1900 hou1·s at the 
Vizcl'.ya bar and thon drove around in AMCUALK-5 's. car. I passed 
-him $1,500 for which ho aignod a receipt. AMCIIALK-6 had gotten 
·reservations and will lenvo YiQmi for Hew York on 7 October nnd 
thep fly to Lisbon that same nii;ht. He will spend 8 an<l D Octobor 
• in Lisbon •hero he will rent n car and drive to Madrid, arrivin~ 
1n the even1nK on ·9 October. Ho has reserva tionB in tho Agumnr 
Hotel for 9 October, aod. ·ho will 11111l<e the first contact at 09J0 
hours on 10 October. 
7. I wished AMCHALK-~ good luck. He is much more optemietlc 
about his chances with AMWOLF-1 than I a.m, but it is good to work 
with a man with onthueia&lll. Just in ca.so AMCUALK-5 should be 
successful, wo 8hould be prepared to support him. I su~goet that 
we cable Madrid tolling them vhat and hov much we are willing to 
offer should AUWOLF-1 be interested in defecting. I told AtdCllALK-6 
that he could prom!Be asylum, but I did not tell llim how much money 
he could offer as an inducement for o1tber recruitment in place or 
defection.
