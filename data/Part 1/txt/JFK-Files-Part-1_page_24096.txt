1. uRE.BOHY/1 vae rec:%\lited by WOFACT OD 3 J11ne 1965. flus 
recruib:lent vas perfonied by an officer froa WOMUSE/lCG since 
C;REBONY/1 (then ~ as STEBONY/1) was vieued as a •double agent• 
penetration of pro-Chinese con•xuoist groups. C.REBOHY/1 has per­
fon:ied well in a difficult and da.'lgeroua environi.ient. Be ia a 
clandestine agent operating against targets violently anti-\-iOIJ\DY 
and of priority interest. The acbu.niGu11u.on of \.l~l/1 r~iraa 
apecial care siDce, by th-, very nature of his role, he is not 
typical of the average LCPlPl'l' asset. 
2. CREBONY/l's initial employment ·was by Letter of Agreement 
for a period of three uonths. '1'hi& Letter of Agreement expired 
1 September 1965 and was replc'ced by a Memorandum of Oral Con..i-u.tment , 
dated the salil9 day. This oral employment agreement recaius in. 
effect at this clat:e--saae t\iJO years later-, bo.1t has been amended 
to adj11at cocpensation. Certain inaccuracies in the original 
HOC have also bseA corrected subsequent to its preparation. Given 
the sensitive nature of C;REBOW/l's relationship with t.OPACT it 
is sometimes difficult to adapt the o:;;,erational realities of lue 
situation to the administrative requirements of WOFACT. However, 
with great understanding at home and in the field, we have re&ehed 
a very manageable aituatioo. 
3. In order to codify the entitlements and procedures a?Plicahle_, 
to QaEBONY/1 'a employment the llDdersigned bas prepared the attached .·, • 
revision o£ t.he ~ ~r---nich C!?DK>!iY/1 is employed. It is reques~ • l . 
that BQS approve this revised KOC and noti.£y LCPlPl'l' of approval by 1' ·
