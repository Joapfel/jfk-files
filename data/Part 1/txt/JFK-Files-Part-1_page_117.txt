, • United States terr11:e>rial waters. REUTEMAN a:~. ised .AIICARDON-1 
t,hat KUBARK had played no ,role in mounting a provocation operation 
against the GOC. At the same time REU'l'E1r1AN pointed out that 
it was highly unlikely that GUinoil was a GOC agent. As a result 
of1his conversation, arrangements were made for JlIWAVE to check 
out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story. At the same time, 
AllCARDON-1 was prevailed upon not to writ~ a story which might 
lead the public to speculate on whether GUIRoLA·was an agent o~ a 
pl~t in a propaganda play desig~ed to embarrass the Goe. 
7 •. PROPAGANDA OUTLET. AltCARBON-1 bas been used successfully, 
during the period oovered 6y this report, as a propaganda outlet . 
· through which items of, interest to KUDARIC could be surfaced in 
the free world press. Examples of how AMCARBON-1 bas been harnessed 
in this fiel:d are outlined below: b 
.. - .. 
.'a·.·.' AMCRAB-1 •. The AltCnAB-1 defection story originally 
surfaced in._the ltiami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de 
las Americas, which_played up an API release from Montevideo. 
The API ·_Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-l's informn.tion . 
relative·t~ ~OC activities in Uruguay. The story in the Diario . 
, de las Americas·· bad an extremely limited impact on Spanish readers 
in .the Min.mi area.· .As a result,· it was decided to do a series 
of feature stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AJ.tCMB-1 
was typical' ~f the veterans of the Gra.nma expedition, who felt 
they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been ~elegated to positions 
of obscurity'-:on~~-- the. ·revolution had put CASTRO . in power. AliCARBON-J 
was briefed in .:detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an 
.opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 under controlled conditions 1n· a 
~AVE safehou•e.·.:· ~fter co~pleting bis debriefing, AlJCARDON-1 
wrote a series of . .-·feature articles on AltCRAB-1. The first article 
in the _serie~ re~e•ived front page headline play. The aerie~ of· 
articles on AiiCRAB~l were well written, and they provided an 
excellent·. peg .for· .nnvAVE to mount a repln.y operation via other 
propaganda assets •.. A1tCARBON-1 's story· on AMCRAB-1 was picked up 
by UPI, API_and others, &nd it was played throughout Latin America. 
The details of."this surfacing can be found in WAVE 5826, dated 
14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174, 
dated 21 October 1963. • 
• . b . . · Cbafies GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Stog. On 26 February 1964 
JMWAVE learnea that when Mr. Charles Glt1F.i
1
1Ns sons went to Cuba 
to reclaim-the· hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that 
. select items were-missing from the boat when it was turned over 
to them.· ·it.was believed that this information would snake a good 
human interest story which JMlVAVE assets could use to counter GOC 
propaganda claims·that United States officials had. stolen-items 
from the Cuban.fishing boats which had violated United States 
territorial waters·. In view of this opinion, a steering tip was 
given to AMCARDON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in 
Key West interview Mr. GRIF!'IN. This i~terv.iew was carried out, 
and an article outlining the points which were of interest to 
.nnfAVE was publisbed in the 27 February 1964 edition of the 
Identity 3. 
c. LAYC Story. ·The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santingo, 
Chile, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida 
newspapers; as a result, REUTE!IIAN contacted AJ,tCARBON-1 on 5 Mnrch 
1964 and suggested that the LAYC meeting was a story which tile 
Identity 3 should pursue. AMCARBON-1 was grateful for this steering 
tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC 
to one of the members of his staff. A story on the LAYC was • 
subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 3
