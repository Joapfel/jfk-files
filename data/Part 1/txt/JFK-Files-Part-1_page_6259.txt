A. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
,AMSPELL -has so far survived tho internal crisis brought nbout 
by the collapse .of its mili._tary activity noted ~n tile previous progress 
report. Howevor,· AMSPELL is still faced with a severe financinl 
problem resulting from the -te1•mination of the military activ.ity. 
AMHINT-2 states that AMSPELL hns $12,000·.oo in short-term loans which 
must b9 met shortly, and $20 1000.00 in loans being paid off at the 
rate of $1,300.00 per month. A1'UIINT-2 is trying to i;;ell the AMSPELL 
boats iri ord~r to liquidate tl~se debts. So far he has had little. 
success~ AMHINT-2 has. said that ho does not intend to give up the . 
idt,;a of active participation in, the liberation of Cuba_bu..t ... tha.t.:AM$.PELL,- ---•--.---- , 
will not conduct new military operations in the future· without ODYOKE. 
assistance and concurrence. Acco1•ding to AAfHINT-2 lack of .fuilds and 
intelligence information together with pressure by ODYOKE on Dominican 
authorities frustrated the AM~WELL military operation, and he' has no 
intention of going through _a similar disastrous experience again. 
2. Propaganda.
