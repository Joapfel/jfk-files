little material value for the SCD. Tne FCD had advised the SCD prior 
to the arrival of ABIDIAN in the USSR ~1-.at ABIDIA.N was cor.siciered to 
be 11A...--nericar .. Intelligence, 11 and in _addition ABIDL<\N assu:med the 
Security Officer position formerly held by Russell A. LANGELLE, 
who was known by the KGB to be CIA. No i.."1.vestigatfon by the SCD 
was necessary to determine if ABIDIAN was "American Intelligence 11 
or not. 
The previous summary, pages 213 - 216, contains so:::nequite 
specific statements relative to ABIDIAN and a Soviet maid, a KGB 
operational contact according to NOSENKO, which are erroneous. 
This invalidates one of the bases for the previous conclusion tl1.at 
NOSENKO was not the responsible case officer for ABIDIAN. 
NOSENKO had previously stated that in circa October 1960 he 
prepared an operational plan on ABIDIAN which included continuation 
of the placing of Metka on the clothing and e£focts of ABIDIA~ by his 
maid who is mentioned above, Tatyana FEDOROVICH. The statement 
is made in the summary that this could not be true because FEDOROVICH 
did not work part time for ABIDIAN until at least July 1961. ABIDIAN 
na.s recently been reinterviewed conceT:;:1.ing fr.e above and the resi..:.lts 
invalidate the previous conclusion '.:l1at FEDOROVICH could ~c:~ !· .. 2..ve
