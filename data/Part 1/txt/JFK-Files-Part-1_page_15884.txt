6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations 
. A. AF/5 representative has requested co~ment from Under~igned 
on WIROGUE's apparent reluctance at ~e~ettlement attempts in Frankfurt 
a/M which are underweigh at the present time, I believe. It is 
undersigned's understanding that tSuQj·e,T-::~d. has threated to 1,ork for 
the Fr~nch Scfvice if resettlement negotiations do not proceed to 
Subje~t•~ liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain­
ing tactic tb gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his 
resettlement claim. Undersigned consid6rs this a quite valid 
assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject. Subject probably 
views this threat as pir~icularly critical iri view of the seemirig 
political/economic conflfct with the French, and app~eciatcs by now 
one of the differences between the AIS and the rs of a fascist and/or 
totalitarian state.
