j. SZULC persistently sought a continuing contact 
with an Agency representative in Washington shortly after 
he arrived until it was granted in December 1962. The 
first contact was with Albert C. DAVIES (Lt. Col. on 
military detail to CIA - Cuba), and was arranged at the 
behest of Colonel GROGAN, the Assistant to the Director, 
on SZULC's request. 
k. In early 1963, at President Ig;mtEDY's urging, 
__ .,,.,..,.,. .. ---·-"" ~ 
contact with SZULC w~s made into a formal relationship and 
was continued until October 1964. The meetings were used 
by SZULC to cross check his information from other sour.ces, 
including v:arious Cuban exiles and the Department of 
State. He became, by virtue _of his contacts ~ith the 
exile community an_d throughout· Washington, one of the most 
knowledgeable people in the area of Cuban affairs, anti­
CASTRO activities, and U.S. Government policy .. (see CI 
study on Jorge VOLSKY for more information on this period.) 
1. The Agency officer, Alfonso RODRIGUEZ, who main­
tained official _contact with SZULC in 1963 and 1964 said 
in July 1964: 
"The.special friendship and mutual admiration 
society that has existed between Tad SZULC, Jorge 
VOLSKY, and ManU'el RAY and the JURE is not something 
that is transparent or easily explained. This 
alliance ·may be something unholy and Machiavellian; 
I just· do not know, but I can find no evidence to 
prove it."
