presRure on him, but to make him understand that what

not be able to enjoy. 
"Another thing I want to bring to your attention is 
in regard to our Consulate, its activities and relations 
with the Visa Section. A letter has come from VERA 
addressed to FRANCO pointing to FRANCO's incorrect wording 
of.a cable to that Section. I agree that it was incorrect, 
btit I find it strange_ that that Section should J8Y so 1J1uch 
attention to correct.!"onns and-analyze the contents so 
little. The contents· ·of things are not being studied,

for us, and even personal problems, for we must consider that 
often people ·arrive with tho ~xact amount of money and a 
week's delay could hurt J;hem so that at times they don•t 
even have enough money for lodging or food.
