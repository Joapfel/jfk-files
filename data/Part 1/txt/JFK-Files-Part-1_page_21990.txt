(v) _NOSESKO's Comments on: Possible KGB Involve~e.n:t in t?ie 
Assass1r.at10:i 
When first disc~ssing the OSWALD case with ~OSENKO on 23 
January 1964, a CIA case officer comr.iented:. l'lt is a very un­
f~rtunate thing that these prior events occurred in the Soviet 
Union." (};OSEN.KO apparently misunderstood the case officer's 
intent, which was not to imply that.the KGB \>as behind tho

immCldiate response- to this remark -,.,as: "That is not correct. 
This is putting a false color to it, I am your friend, I am 
co~pletely with you, and I will continue to work with you and 
ag~inst the Soviet Union in all respects. nut the truth 
should always remain the truth. No matter how I may hate· 
anyone, I cannot speak against my convictions, and.since I 
know this case I could unhcsitantly sign off to the fact that 
the Soviet Union cannot be tied into this in any way. I say 
this because I know they wore frightened of this 1:ian {OSWALD] 
and that everything should havec;;.;cn said to him or that he 
should have been in any way worked ~n, in any was. [by the KGBJ

trusting official papers. Even without specific orders I had 
to make a complete investigation on my end of things because

at many things in the eye boldly ••• In the history of any 
intelligence service there have been assassinations of one 
kind or another. 1 can say this: That in our organization, 
not even speaking of myself, many persons were shocked by 
the assassination-•to think that this should happen in the 
twentieth century and in, of all places, the most powerful 
government in the world."
