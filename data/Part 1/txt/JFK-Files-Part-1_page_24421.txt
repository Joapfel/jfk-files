1. On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on bis 
British visa valid until 15 February 1970. 
2. Since QRPHONE/l's file at the Home Office indicates an 
interest on the part of JAOUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted 
prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in 
the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily 
imply an "agent" status. Of course WOFIRM is not mentioned at all 
in this file.) Xn coordination with London Station it was decided 
that a re-newal of QRPHONE/l's one-year visa was preferable to the 
granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have 
been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum froc JAGUAR 
to London Station on this matter: 
"The choice was between:-
a) an extension of two months 
b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of 'lo/hat 
was granted to him last year 
c) that his temporary residence should be made 
•unconditional" which would be the nor.nal 
procedure if there were no special considerations. 
Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/l's cover p.irposes (c) 
would be undesirable: if his friends got to know of it 
they might think he was being treated over-generously in 
view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such
