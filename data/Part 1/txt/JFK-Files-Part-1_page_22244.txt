thrceso~e ~s difficult handling problems. Gi~e~ these afparent 
factors, the NOSE~KO lead ~ay ha~e been consi~ercd expen~able by 
the KGB, •,1ithout lc,ng-lasting adverse effect en t.hc !ul!illi:-.e:tt 
of its overall intclligenc~ rtquircments. 
!IOSE?;KO was t!le first source to identify Jc:.!:les STORSBl:F.G., a 
U.S. military code clerk stationed at the Mosco~ E!nbassy, as a 
target who had rejected the KGB's recruitment offer (Pages 165-
185). The inforn.ation was received from !WSE~KO afte:- STORSBERG 
was discharged from the u.s. i\rmy, and whP.n inter•;ic-..ed on the 
basis of this infor:n.:1tion, STORSBERG ,generally cc:-:!ir:.:ed NCSE~,Y.O' s

tary code clerk h~d been recruited; frora what GOLITSYN had pra­
viously -tolcCCIA and from later investigations, it see:ns possible 
that the KGB recrui'::ed eit:1er S'!'OhSBERG or \<hl:iar.. lit:RLEY (who 
NOSE~KO said was cLt recruited or ~pproached by thi KG3). If it 
is ·assumed that S'l'CR.Sl3ERG was not recrl.!ited in the at'proach de­
scribed by NOSCNKO and in the operation dis=ussed by GOLlTSYN, 
the KGB suffered no loss in the lunerican services lea:-ning of 
this case. If it is ass~~ed en the other ~~nd th3t S~CR.53ERG or 
HURLEY was recruited, the :.-~port i nq .>y NIJS:s:;~0 assi~ ted the KGB-­

· (iii) Importance or Usefulness 
The American leads from NOSENKO enabled U.S. security author­
ities to: 
- Confirm previous information ~n the recruit.:oonts of 
13 tourists and three correspondents; 
- Verify previous derogatory info:rnatio~ on ~l tourists, 
two correspondents, and perhaps or.e -military code clerk, 
STORSBERG: 
- Reu:ove two homosexuals from the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow: and 
- Identify 3_2 KGB agents including Hedwig :OHSSOS and 
MINTKENBAUGH. • 
One or possibly t-.ro of these 32 agents (SMITH and possibly HO\i~JU>) 
in the oast had been in a position to pass classified infcrma~ion 
to the KGB, and a third (JOHNSON) had current access to classified 
information and current contact with the KGB; the two hv::::iosexuals

Against this product of NOSE:~i<O' s report~ng :!lust be balanced 
the amounts of money and ~~npower that were ne~ded for U.S. secu­

on 49 recruitments, 35 developmen~al targets, se·,en '.Jr.successful 
recruitment appro.J.ches, a,.d 33 investigations by the ~GB--a tot.al 
of 113 operational leads. CIA carried the burden of the debriefing
