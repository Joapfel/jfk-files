ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITI~S OF TH!:: 
DEPU'fY DlflECTCR (PLAN3) 
Office of the DD/P 
We com.mend the decision of the DD/P to abolish the position 
of the A/DDP/A, and believe th.at the restoration oi the previou■ 
organization with just the DD/P and COP in the line of command 
in the front office will result in a clear delineation of responsibili­
ties and more efficient operation•. 
The Staffs 
We studied at some len~h the staffs in the Dp/P. We con­
sidered a possible merger of the Fl. CI and CA staffs. We als·o 
studied proposals for divesting the sta!Is o! !!!_ operational responsi­
bilities. We believe that while both are desirable objectives, neither 
are practicable under present circumstances. We therefore urge 
that the Fl, CI and CA staff functions be drawn closer together 
under the Chief of Operations and that these organizations insofar 
as practical act in the classical sense as staffs !or the DD/P. We 
further believe that the Operational Services Staff, the Central Staff, 
anci the resic.lual of the Cover and Commercial Staff, after the changes 
recommended below are completed, be tranaferred to the Central 
Support Staff which is proposed.
