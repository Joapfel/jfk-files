- -· recent -account.- UOSEt.'JCO had transferred frOffl the U.S. £mbes5y: 
Section to the Tourist DepartmEtnt e.b-:,ut 28 Decer.iber ·l961and 
that his participation in a Tourist De~rtment approach to 
American citizen w. E~ JOHN50N on 5 Jan•Jary 1962 had be'!:!n con­
firm'!:!d by JOHNSON himself• Therefore, NOS!::-iKO vas told, much 
of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin _ 
Street affair became unt'!:nable. NOSENKO•s rE:sponse to this 
observation is described in Part v.F.3., which discusses 
NOSENKO's approach to JOHNSON. 
Also during the February 1965 interrogaticns UOSENKO refused 
to sign the page of a protocol w1;ich read as follows: 
"I have been told by rny intE:rrogators that'ABIDIAN's. 
only visit to the Pushkin Street site took plac'!:! on 30 D~c­
ember 1961. Therefore, I WdS told t~at: 
a. I could not have placed the sur~v~e~i~l~l=-=-a~n~c~e=---~---------------.,---

b. I could not have received re,pcrts about tr-.e 
stationary surveillance wi11le still .Z..3IDIAN 's case 
officer, since I was already in the Sevent~ Depart­
n,ent in January 1962. 
c. The three month _period in w'hich th'!:! sur­
veillance post vas watch"ing the Pushkin Street site 
did not expire until 30 March 1962 - 1'30re than two 
weeks after I left for ~eneva. 
Thus I could not have knQwn in June 1962 that the surveil­
lance of the dead drop site ~ad failed to produce results 
or that it had been discont:i,nued." 
·Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve­
ment with ABIDIAN as swrmarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said 
the vay in which the protocol wa~ prepared made him "look sillj•." 
On no other occasion has NOSENKO refused to si<;n protocols 
dealing with other subjects. 
NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern­
ing ABIDIAN Is visit-to-Pushkin Street-~ • NOSENK.::> :-eafffrmed that 
ABIDIAN was under special surve.U lance cover·age throughout his 
Moscow tour a~d that this s~rveillance detected his travel from 
_ the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back: he would ~ate this 
only as "sometime in 1961." NOSENKO vas asked whether KGB sur­
veillance had detected any unuaual movements by ABIDIAN during 
the period just preceeding his visit to the PENi<OVSKIY drop 
site (a reference to his\movements on- 27 and 28 December 1961 
as described above). He r~pl!f:!d that he knew definitely that 
surveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that 
ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB-surveillance at 
I .•·.,- , any time during this period._
