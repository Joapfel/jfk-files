H. Reactions of ?IOSENKO's Fa.-:iily 
Two WC!'.len who said they were the mother and wife of r:OSENKO 
called at the A;nerican Embassy in Mosco·,, on five occasions 
between 24 February and 23 March 1964,•·and NOSENKO, who on 
the basis of physical descriptions confirmed their identitiea, 
said he h.:.:c! no doubt that the KGB had directed them to do this 
in order to pressure .him to return. '1'!1::? women expressed dis­
belief that NOSENKO had voluntarily betrayed his family and his 
country. They sought a personal meeting with him in the united 
States or a~ywhere else, sub~itted letters for him, and returned 
to the I:mbassy to ask whether he had replied; the ycungi:::r Mrs. 
NOSENKO explained that she required so~a definite statement in 
writing from her hus~and so that she could plan her own f~ture 
and th,11:. of the NOS Ell KO children. 
NOSE~KO proposed to respond to his family's letters b7 
'"riting two ot his own, one which would be intendc·d for KG:J 
consumption and the other for his wife alone. The first of 
these would state ~OSENKO's irrevocable decision to remain in 
the United States and to scw:r all tics with his family and 
homeland. The second letter would be read by Mrs. NOSENKO in 
tr.e Embassy, left there, anJ not reported to the KGB; in it he 
would exp=ess hope for~ reunion, a~k her to wait for hin, and 
tell her to indicate her willingness to join him in the West 
by writing either "yes" or "no" on the letter itself. Although 
NOSNEKO prepared both letters, only the first was Eent to his 
wife; it was mailed from Washington to the NOSE'.lKO home in 
Moscow on 7 ,\pril 1964. 
From March 1964 nothing was heard fro:n NOSENKO's relatives 
until mid-1966, when Yuriy D:nitriyevich KOROLEV,** a Soviet 
journalist, visited Paris and spoke with representatives of the 
French magazine Paris M~tch. KOROLEV indicated that he would 
i Only once befor~ had members of a defector's family called 
at a foreign embassy in l-!0scow. Following the defection of 
Yuriy Vasily•3Vich KROTKOV in England in September 1963, his 
wife appeared at the British Embassy to make inquiries about 
him. KROTKOV, an admitted agent of t:ie KGB Second Chief 
Directorate, is believed by MI-5 and CIA to remain under 
KGB control. 
** CIA ~ecords show that KOROLEV was employed at the Soviet 
Pavilion of the Brussels World's Fair in 1958 as a photo­
correspondent for the Soviet publication Sputnik. He visited 
Japan in 1963 and the United States in February-Marc~ 1965, 
at the invitation of Life _nagazine, as a, photographer for 
Novosti, a Soviet news agency. On the latter trip he was to 
be accompanied,by Feliks Avramovich ·ROSENTAL, an interpreter 
but no record of ROSENTAL's arrival is available. KOROLEV 
is believed to be identical:._with Yu:::i:,· KOROLEV who, as of 
1964, was employed part-time for the United Press Inter­
national correspondent in Moscow, Henry SHAPIRO. Both 
NOSENKO and GOLITSYN have identified SHl1.PIRO as an agent 
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate (see Part V.C.).
