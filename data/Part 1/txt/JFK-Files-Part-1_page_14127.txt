MEMORANDUM FOR: 
FROM 
SUBJECT 
18 August 1967 
Chief, WH/3 ,.+-:: 
Chief. WH/3/Venezuela 
Assigr.ment of Emilio Rodrigues 
1. I wish to ~4ke it clear that I do not oppose 
_______ the assignment of Rodrigues per se to Venezuela, but I 
do have sqme reservations on what he is going to be 
doing. COS, Caracas intends to use him as the case 
officer for the CIHAVOC and CITILT Projects. Since both 
are basically CE/CI projects I think this is a great 
mistake. The amount of research in these projects 
necessarily requires a great amount of files research 
which Rodrigues in his cover situation will not be 
able to do. This -ill entail a greater amount of work 
for the inside case officer, defeating the purpose for 
...-hich Rodriques ...-as originally considered; freeing the 
inside case officer for developmental work. 
2. The intoduction of Rodrigues into the CIHAVOC 
Case will also i'nt:oduce one more step through which most 
of the vital information that CIHAVOC-2 produces must 
pass. For example, his info now goes through CIHAVOC-1 
to the case officer. Wit.h the addition of Rodrigues 
one more time consuming step will be added. 
3. I am also of the firm opinion that different 
case officers should be used for these operations 
since both are penetrations of the same party and at 
times produce similar info. In addition, both are 
extremely sensitive and_the compromise of o~e could 
possibly lead to the compromise of the other. 
4. If Rodrigues -as assigned to Caracas for the 
handling of a sensitive case wr.ich exposure would be 
embarrassing to the United States, such as a high level 
political penetration or a sensitive Soviet/Satellite 
Case then it would be -..·ell Justified. However, I feel 
that his assignment as an outside ca~e officer for 
these two activities is not since they could be better 
handled and serviced fro.~ the 1ns1de.
