Subject's staff duties incluJ1..' 1.ksk chief responsibilities for support 
and guidance to field proRrams including the research and targetting' 
required to conduct an effective recruitment pro~ram. Although such 
duties requiring supervision arc new to him, he is also making 
progress in this capacity. Kith proper guidance and assistance, ho 
will develop into a most effective supervisor. 
Mr. Floros native fluency in Spanish and his Latin background 
have proven most valuable to Cuban operations. ln fact he represents ' 
himself as "Latin American" in handling one of this agents. For an 
officer his grade, he is vcrr mature, self assured, has good common. \ 
sense and is certainly a professional. Subject has completed two tour~ 
in the field and is an exr,ericnccd ops officer. lie is intelligent, ' 
imaginative, uses good tradccraft at all times and has a clear headed 
approach to the business. lie .cxpresses himself well orally and in 
writing, and works very well with other case officers. Mr. Flores 
keeps up to date on political, cconomi~ and social affairs pertaining 
to Cuba and he willingly acccpts difficult tasks- requiring frequent 
separations from his family. 
Subject definitely -has potential. He is operationally agrcssive 
and is gaining ~xperience as a manager. Mr. Flores is already perfor­
ming a~ a higher level than his grade. In approximately a year, he 
should be again dispatched to the field as a senior officer responsible. 
for handling Soviet, Chinese or Cuban targets. lluring the next 
reporting period, Mr. Flores should receive training in superivsion. 
lie is a solid performer in the Cuban Operations Group and has contri­
buted much to our successes during the past year.
