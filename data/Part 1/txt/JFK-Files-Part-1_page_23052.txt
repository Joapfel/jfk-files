Scientific Research 
6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences 
is done at both -the CNIC and at the National nesearch Jnstit11tes. 
The general directives for such research arc oriented to~ards: 
a. TtecxpP.rimental verification of conclusions arrived at:, 
or discoveries made, by foreign scie11lists. This work 
of verification is effected (1) principal!: in order 
to train Cuban ~ersonncl in the methods of higher re~ 
search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in­
format ion complementary to the d iscovcr.y. 
·b. Original research work done by Cuban personnel advJsed 
by iorcign scientists. This work is directed to~ards 
(1) the attainment of results of i'nternational .. ir.-,_i;or­
tance to be used in propaganda praising Castro's 
education syste~, and (2) the achievement of discoveries 
•1n applied science that would serve either as an econ­
omic saving or to earn foreign exchange. As of zjd­
Jnnuary 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing 
of scientific. importance. During the first half of 67, 
Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC to·orient all its re-
.search projects towards pro~uction technology so that -
the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be 
partially recovered through improved p~oduction. 
7. Department of Biochemis.try. The most important of the 
CNIC departments 1s the Department of Biochemist_ry; it occupies 
several new buildings and forme~ private homes. It is head~d-hy 
Dr. Mora (fnu), a Chilean microbiologist. This department '"as 
conaucting research on polarimetry, enzymology, .spectograpi.y, 
and the synthesis of ·a steroid hormone fro_m stigmasterol, a 
sugar-cane by product. 
8. As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a 
steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will aln1ost 
surely continue to fail because stigmaste~ol i~ ~n inert 
steroid lacking in biological.activity~ 
• 9. Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., was preparing a rese:;,,cli 
thesis for the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences; his resc;&J•cll 
·project, the biochemistry of lipides i~ cardiovascular diseases, 
is of .scien1:ific interest although not of internat_ional. impc.,·­

10. Department of Ultracentrifugation •. Although nom'i1Ja;. ~-
a separate department; the Department of_ Oltracentrifugatior, 
in fact functions as a subdivision of the Department of llio­
chemistry. As -:,f 1llid-November 196~ it contained thc~inost ml)dci·i,
