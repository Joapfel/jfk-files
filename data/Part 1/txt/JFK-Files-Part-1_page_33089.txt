FOLLOWING REASONS BELIEVE AMCIIALK-5 OPERATION NOT THE .PROPER VEHICLE. 
A. POSSIBILITY OF DGI REVENGE AGAINST AMCHALK-5, HIS FAMILY, 
AND FRIENDS DOTH IN CUBA AND US. 
B. POSSIBILITY THAT OPERATION WOULD JEOPARDIZE A~Y FUTURE 
CONTACT BETWEEN RVRCCK ANn OFFICIAL CUBANS ABROAD, AS CUBANS NATURALLY 
WOULD REGARD ALL FU'fURE CONTACT AS POSSIBLE PROVOCATIONS. 
C. ~UBANS WOULD PROBABLY MAKE PUBLIC PROTEST TO CANADIAN 
GOV SAYING ALL WAS RVROCK PLOT TO DAMAGE CUBAN-CANADIAN RELATIONS. 
COULD FURTHER MENTION THIS SECOND CASE, FIRST BEING LISAGA CASE IN WHICH 
CUBANS MAY SAY WE ALSO TRIED TO DAMAGE CUBAN-MEXICAN RELATIONS. 
CUBA MIGIIT REINFORCE ITS CASE BY MENTIONING AMCHALK-5'S TRUE NAME 
AND WHAT CUBAN GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF HIS ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF
