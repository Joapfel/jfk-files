1. INTRODUCTION.. In Reference E, Jli\YAVE forwarded a review 
of the nature of. ·its relationship with AMCARBON-2. This review 
indicates .that the relationshi'p with A?itCARBON-2 evolved from that 
action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security 
breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which wns 
being carried out.by the Identity l relative to the fact that the 
establishment .of .. the I~entity 2 was being- kept from the YODELT 
South Campus as a-result of security restrictions which were in some 
way 1 relnted·to JMDUSK. While the relationship with AMCAilOON-2 
stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis 
situation, the··establishment of a working relationship with the 
Identity 3 was o.n objective which JlnVAVE bnd always hoped to obtain. 
As a matter ·of·. f.act·, in Reference _A, the recommendation was m.atle 
that JmVAVE.be given.approval1n contact the major South Florida • 
news media in an att~mpt to work out a relationship with these neW;:: 
media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity 
spotlight oli thoseKUBARK activities in South Florida which might 
come to their attention. Thus, when a relationship was established 
with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE 
might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of 
achieving the objective of having a relationship With the Identity 3, 
which would si~ultnneously. insure the security of J'MWAVE's operations 
and give JMWAVE an outle~ into the press which could be used for 
surfacing certain select-propaganda item.a .. In the period October to
