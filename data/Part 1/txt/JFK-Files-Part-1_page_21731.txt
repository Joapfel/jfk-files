G. XOSEXY.O ::-._s no v,<li<l claim to certainty that the KGB 
recruited no American Embassy ncrsonncl between 1953 and his 
defecticn in 1964. (?revious conclusion) 
The conclusion in tnis summary is that XOSENKO is oi the 
o;;>inion that there were no KGB ·recruitments oi Gnited States Embassy 
personnel in Moscow between 1~53 and December 1963 with the exception 
. 06 
of "ANDI;_EY" (Dayle Wallis SMITH) and Eer~eJ·t"nOWA~ who actually 
was a~~ employee 1,ut did work part of the time in the Emba~sy. 
The question here if; whether or not the ex?ressed opinion o! 
NOSEN:XO is sufficiently based on actual knowledge so that this opinion 
can be accep~ed as absolute evidence that there were. no other KGB 
recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. -The 
only logi_c.:.1 conclusion is :hat the o?inion of NOSENKO cannot be 
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, -there is a possibility that· 
a recruitment could have occurred and :NOSENKO not be aware in any .. 
way of the recruitment. This should in no way be interpreted as a 
suggestion that NOSE};"XO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased 
observer without ?ersona.l knowledge could and should be hesitant to 
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO 1n this particular area. 
·The actual basis for the stated opini~n of NOSENKQ.shp,\Jl4i be

elQUnined and can be cited as follows.
