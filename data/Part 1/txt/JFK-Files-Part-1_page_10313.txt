departure f~r Guatemala with LIRING-3. This wound may have 
convinced the Guatemalans that he bad recently.been involved 
in terrorist activities and may, in fact, have cost him his 
life. Identity B of the same report is the nipbew of Identity F, 
a Mexican Comnunist who was arrested on 19 September 1968 1

appo!nt~ent to talk at leuglh aoout his experience in Guate~ala 
with the LIRIXG Station Chief, J,.:::RIXG-10. The general idea: 
is for LIRISG-3 to go to PBRUlIE.'i in the booe that he can be! 
.used to penetrate PBRL'J!E."i-sponsored subversion efforts· in Ultin 
America or become, at least for a time, a reporting source in 
PDRUYEN. I

Guatem~la to discuss the LIRIXG-3 case and its Guatemalan/FAR 
implications whenever the Guatemala City Station, after 
reviewing the available infol"l:lation, feels ready for such 
discussiou. Please advise. -"I l
