(v) T.1c KEYSlRS Ca~c 
Tho approach tu KEY~ERS is the only ti~r during his 
service in the U. s. Emba~sy Section that ~USF.:,Ko claims to 
bave had dire:ct contact with an American ~tkt~a~ed in ~os­
cow. (!'-OSESKO said on o;ir, occasion that this ·xas the onl)· 
fRcc-to-face ~~co~ntcr he could recall; and, ~n another, 
that it yas possible that Sl'ORSEfRG--thc onl:,· other possibility-­
may not have seen hi~ on the ni~ht he was approached in the 
l!oscow hotel.) KEYSERS thc1•cfon.• ts the only tr.de-pendent 
American soc1·ce ._ho could 1.-on.t irm that ~,OSE~lW was involved 
in operations ai;ain~t ~e:ricao E.,,bai:;sy p1_-rsonnel in 1960 or 
1961. ~OSESKO hi:n5elf po!l.ted cut, ho,.·c,·er, that this coc-
tact •a~ of v~rr short duration, and that it was possible 
th.a.t KE"iSERS would not 1·ecogn~ze him. This was the case: 
KEYSERS tailed to identiiy :,OSE!iKO's photograph and described 
the officer who approached hiu as a can considerably older, 
shorter, and probably of a mcch heRvier build than ~O~Eh"KO 
was. Although ~OSE~T.O was able to provide a description of 
this incident, he did not know much about the O\'erall KGB 
case 3i;&inst Y..L'YSERS and a number of discrepancies ha,•e been 
noted. 
Io 1962 ~OSE~1(0 first reported the approach to KEYSER$, 
without naming him, but sa)·ing he was the successor to STORS­
BERG. Since dcfcctini;t in 1964, SOS~KO has continued to 
identify hia as 51'::RSBERG's replacement. In fact, KEYSERS 
was sent to Moscow as an assistant to the Embassy medical 
officer; he also worked in t~e office of the Air Attacbe as 
a collateral duty and for a short while in 1961 ~as unde~ 
training 1o the r:.ilitary code room as a "back-up" crypto­
grapher for STORSbERG. STORSBERG's replacement in Moscow 
was ZCJUS.
