Deu Dr. Guitart, 
Ploase excuse my writing in Inglish but I find myself 
short of time ond, it is quicker if I write in Engli11b. 
I am returning herewith the papers you forwarded to me· 
and an also enclosing a visa waiver for Doisy GUITART Fox •. 
Visa waivers ore of little value thes.e days bec11use ot· 
various restrictions that have arisen in connection with 
travel to the United Btntea from CUba via l\nother country .. 
Thia situation I will discuss w1tb you when I an in New 
---~Orleans which I expect will be during the week of. 
12 August 1963. 
You mentioned that your son, Jorge, might contact me. 
To date, he hns not called-so I trust that thore bas .been 
no need on his part to.see me. 
Since I bave received no vord from you I suppose Rene 
hns not yet answ.ered your letter. Let uo ho·pe t_hat we hoar 
from him soon. 
I would like to discuss with you the possibility of 
_ contacting your friend Sr. Camayo of Holguin. Perhaps.by 
the time I arrive you will have bod some good ideas oil how· 
best .to carry this out. I'D looking forward to seeing you 
and vill call you as soon as I ·arrive in order to make an 
appointment to see you. 
Bost rogArds, 
Carl Teele
