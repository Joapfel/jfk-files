6. Masferrer alleged to Clark that he was r resentin some twen 
- Cuban exile orga zations, aq ~h_e wa, working with a Haitian, Charles 
ForbenLJ1eaiI_<il an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois La Mort. 11 
Forben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or 
baying a PBY-S aircraft for use against Duvalier. Maaferrer claimed that 
Forben's group was in a position to take control of the Ile de la Gonave;. 
an laland just off the west coast of Haiti in the gulf north of Port au Prince. 
It la conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the 
name of the islanci in question, but baaed on the description of its location 
by Maaferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved._ At any rate, 
ID return for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Maaferrer 
and some of his Guban ·exiles use the island in question as a base from which 
to harraH the eastern end of the Island of Cuba. 
T. Clark told Masferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve, 
he wollld hive to report the COD'l!"ersation to the USG and could not do any­
thing without clearing with the USG. Maaferrer said that he bad no objection 
io tiiia, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group, 
bat he asked that Clark not mt[!ntion his intention to harrua Cuba, since he 
maintained that the USG would forbid this as being against USG policy. Clark 
said that Ma.aferrer would bave to.Jeave to him what matters he chose to 
di•c:11•·• with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark c:oa1d reach Maaferrer 
tbrough·Rou•s office for about a·week, and thereafter c:oa1d pass a message 
-, to h1m through Rou. 
8. Clark g'>t in touch with me because I bad bown blm during the 
wu; I had known his family for many years, and one of bl• closest friends, 
lame• B. Watriaa, is a cous~ of mine and was, until about~- ;·ear ago, 
associated with the Agency. Incidentally, I believe that Clark has bad •om~ 
dlamaalona with SOD with the idea of poHtl,iy being uai',d in connec:uoii with 
ipeciaioperatioila. ··--
