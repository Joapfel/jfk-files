In addition, a number of Americans--e.g., Walter RASK, Adam 
BROCH ES, Her.ry APISSOU, Herbert HO,IARD, Vasiliy VO::J.:OV, fiilliam 
WI.I.LACE, Thomas Whitney, and Stanley ZIRING--denied having teen 
recruited by the KGB, as NOS~lKO said they had been. 
The only note~orthy internal inconsistencies in NOS~KO's 
report_ing on KGB operations involving Americans appear in the 
HAru~1DNE case, where he has given conflicting information on the 
KGB's ability to obtain photographic evidence of !-.is homosexuality, \ 
and in his advice on ho-..i to identify ".A::ORE'l"--that he was the only i 
witness to testify in Roy RHODES' trial. and that he did not testify J 
at Roy RHODES• trial but· was cnly interview,!d in the pre-trial in­
vestigation once. Part VIII.O. covers the extent of his kn~wledge 
ab~ut American casus in which he took part P':!rso~ally or as a 
supervisor. Regarding others to which his official positions did 
not give hir,, access, NOSENKO has indicated that it was his per-
sonal contact with KGB colle~~Jes whic~ e:1abled him to report on 
nine recruitments (Herbert HOtl,\RD, Sam .:,kFFE, the ~GS agent in 
France, the YOUNGER couple, "SAS!-!/\'', end two unnar.:e-:i agents in. 
Geneva), three development cases (George VA.'1 LAEI'HEM, Attorney 
General Robert KrnNEDY, and Stephen HOFr.-v.tl): three unsu~cessful 
recruitment approaches (Richard HhRZ-~TO:~E. Peter BINDER, and 
Collette SCHWARZENBACl-i): and thrt:·e investigatio:1s (Thomas BARl1iE­
LDn', Lewis oo.m~. and George WINTERS). NO~E:a~o' s alleged asso­
ciates in the KGB thus gave him the names oi four recrui~ed agents 
and sufficient details for one mvre to be identified by subsequent 
investigation, JOH2~SO~. All of the NOSENKO leads to developmental 
operations, unsuccessful recruitment _approaches, and investigations 
have been identified. 
(11) Damage to the Soviets 
Three criteria can be used in assessing the harm to Soviet 
interests caused by NOSENKO's operational leads to Americans: 
First, the originality of his information on recruited 
agents and unsuccessful recruitr.lent approaches: 
Second, the agents' access to classified information 
at the time he reported on the~: and 
Third, the possibility of identifying them on the 
basis of the details provided or in <=<'~-u :-.: -:_;_on "lit>. det.:?.il"' 
~ccelvcd from other·sources. 
There is no reason to believe that NOSENKO's information on 22 
Americans under investigation while in the USSR could have damaged 
the KGB, especially since all of them had left the Soviet Union 
before the NOSENKO leads were received (P~ges 402-410). In an-
--other- category, -NOSENKO'-s leads to-35 .. hner.icans under _development ___ _ 
(Pages 379-397), there is no means for evaluati:lg their impor-
tance to the KGB because i~ is impossible to estimate with con­
fidence the likelihood of the KGB recruit~ng sone or any of these 
targets, vulnerability and assessment data, whe~ coupled with 
spasmodic or even continuing KGB access to the target, would be 
no guarantee that he is recruitable. Nevertheless, following 
the criteria listed above, NOSE:..~o•s statements on KGB operation­
al interest stemming from their homosexuality did bring about.the 
recall of Robert ARMSTRONG and Stephen HOFFMAN from the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow. •
