27 October 1969 
Deputy Chief, WH/7 
Your request this subject 
Following our receipt of inforlll3tion that Clemard­
Joseph Charles had taken a list of requirements into 
the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and asked help in 
filling them, WH Division sent a J1e111orandum on 
19 August 1969 to the Chief, DCS, asking that DCS's 
contact with Louis A. Bri:m (from whom Charles bad 
received the requirements} be terninated. 
'Ille DCS New York office on 29 August 1969 sent a 
memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted 
Brun bad been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded 
that no further requiren€nts would be given him. This 
memorandum did not, ho•ever, say that contact would be 
terminated; in fact, it said they would continue to de­
brief Brun whenever be returned from a trip to Haiti. 
This memorandum was.sent to Port-au-Prince (B'?PW-1347, 
17 Sept 1969). 
'Jhe Station replied (Port-au-Prince 6496, 1~ Oct 69) 
that this was not enough, that the contact should be 
completely severed. WR/Branch 7 officers then met with 
Mr. George Musulin of DCS to discuss the matter further, 
WH/7 Qfficers maintainini; that there was more political 
action_· hazard to this contact than the FI product 
justified. Musulin agreed to raise the matter with 
C/DCS. The result was a me:aorandua on 16 October 1969 
from C./DCS to C/WHD which referred to the original WHii 
memoraodua of 19 August acd advised that contact with 
Brun has been terminated. Port-au-Prince was so informed 
(DIR 48277, 21 Oct 69).
