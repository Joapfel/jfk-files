Comment: The form is completed by every KGB officer, and 
while it is not of critical importance to the 
KGB itself, a copy is filed in every officer's 
personnel file, a fact known to any Komsomol 
secretary or supervisor responsible for reviewing 
KGB personnel files. 
NOSENKO was unfamiliar with the name of the KGB personnel 
action form, and said he did not know of it. When its purpose 
was described to him, he gave a superficial description of 
its content. 
Comment: A senior KGB officer would be familiar with the 
form, which he would see on every occasion in 
which one of his subordinates was promoted or 
transferred. 
NOSENKO was familiar with the Employment and Service 
Record (Posluzhnoy Spisok), but he claimed he filled it out 
only in "1958 or 1957".

on entry on duty with the KGB. In citing 1957 
or _1958, NOSENKO_"is claiming that he completed 
it only four or five years after entering the ~
