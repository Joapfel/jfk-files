guests to award ce~onies, the Agency will be as liberal as possible 
within the bounds .x. :1:.-ailable space and security considerations since 
one of the pt,rpost)S ·±. an award ceremony is to let the family, friends, 
and a::mociates of L'r:o r·=-cipient know thathe has been honored. 
2, In imp].e::::i::'cling this policy the points listed below will be 
guiding criteria: 
a. Acy A:;r~::cy employee who is a friend of a recipient 
may come to --.3:~ ceremony, up to the limit of space available, 
if the recipie:r. r-ks that he be present. 
b, Arry G~-.:?.rnment employee (who is not employed by the 
Agency but v.i:J,:,, is witting of the recipient's employment) can -
come so Ion; -u. there are no operational security rea~ons that 
would make hl~. ;,resence inappropriate. 
c. Any f~:f~,:.d who is not omployed by the Governnient may 
be invited o.~y :i it _is obviously desirable (Example-- A.very 
close old frie:ii. '1;:10 ~stood in the relationship of "family" to the 
recipient whe::. :;,c:.::iject had no immediate family). Friends who 
are not empl.~ by the Government normally would be
