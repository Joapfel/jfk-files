give it greater aupport than it has previously received. \Ve recom­
mend that the police group in the CI Stafi receive such augmentation 
as is necesaary, a~d that Project [ C: 
] be transferred from the NE Division to the CI Sta.££. 
Liaison with Department of State 
We urge that the DD/P centralize liaison with the Department 
of State and maintain careful records of all discussions bet\veen the­
Agency and State Department officials. We note that nearly every 
area division chief has a weekly meeting with his counterpart in the 
Department_ but that under_ the pre sent system there is no organized 
method for ke~ping the central management of th~ DD/P informed 
of wh=-t ta..ltes place a.t these meatings. 
Advice to State on Bla_ck Propaganda 
We recommend that the DD/P develop procedures which will 
insure that other appropriate agencies of the govermnent (Department 
of State, • Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately 
informed of black propaganda activities which otharwise might be 
rn..isunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a foreign 
power. We have in mind our discussions with the Departznent which 
heard expressed concern that the Department was unaware of certain 
black propaeanda activities relating to Communist China and conse­
quently was led astray.
