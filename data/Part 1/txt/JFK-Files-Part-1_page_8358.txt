. COMMENT' 
· This rnay be just va:(•s inate stupidity. Maybe he 
really couldn't find the American Sbbool in the tele-
phone directory. • 
Perhaps val already knows oi some after-school activity 
of which I am una,.,are. Maybe he alrea1y knows th~t someone'.b 
-child is there, som4?one he wants.to meet .. Perhaps ~e wants 
an excuse to wander about the schoo~, mee_ting people. 
Perhaps Val couldn't care less abou'; the·schooi". Per-. 
haps h~ 1.s hoping ~or an_ excuse ·to call me, suggesting our 
chi~dren practice English together. Perhaps he is preparing 
tl'le ground :f:mc··to go to someone else he already has in mind 
.t~ explain that there is no convenient program of after­
school activities for Pmitiro He might ask that person to 
agree to have Dmit~t play with his c-hildren. 
It "just occured to m~ that for the first time. in many 
months Valentin, spoke Russian to rne. While I was playing 
tennis he shQut'ed to me i~ Rusi_ian, "You really are playing 
with your lef.t now"• And -later, "You look tired"• When I 
answered t~t I _was and that I had a head-ache, He looked 
particul~rly pleased. Normally hedo.esn•t even answer my 
Good Mor1Umg :in Russian. Perhaps he is preparing the ,a:qcc 
way for me to suggest an exchange in language le~:,ons1.he 
helps 11!8 with my ·Russian and 2xi--"t my boys play with Dimi 
in English.
