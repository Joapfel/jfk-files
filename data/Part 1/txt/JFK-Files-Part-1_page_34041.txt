Cuba are being brought to trizll. Throughout this period and 
whenever possible a particular effort was ma.de to i-elate 
de'\'eloJ)lllf'uts in China to present or possible developments in 
Cuba. 'lne difficulties of the Chinese economy provided 
ex11111ples to which a Cuban "twist" could be i,ut; e.g., the 
Chinese and Cuban economic failures demonstrate the failUJ"G of 
o.ppliod communism in the economic a1-ea.

3. AMSCROLL 1s continuing its analysis of the current 
sugar crop. Its releases on this suuject continue to generate 
interest ard the Station has seen cover~~ in The Miami Herald, 
El Uni~ersal (of Caracas), The Times of Too Amricas, and 
Diario Las Americas. 'the AllSCROLr, releases on Free World 
shipping to Cuba were picked up by both AP and AF'P and ware 
published in the newspapers listed in the previous sontence as 
well aa Tbe Montreal Star. The AIIHllt Bulletin :ilso carl'ies 
t·he bulk of tbese releases and we i:an therefore p1-esume cove,·aae 
ot at least some of this informn.tion in J.otin America. An • 
interesting study wns an an:Llysis of Dritish/Cuban trade which 
demonstrates that Great Britain is DOW getting the better part 
of tbe barg~in; this story was tilod by AFP aa;vas a story of 
the poor quality of molansea being sold by tbe Cubans to Dritlsb 
finDB. Finally, AMSCP.OLL continued ~o get mileage· from the 
Daalier-Benz story by reportina that this Geriaao tirm has finally 
rofwsecl to sell spare parts to Cuba; the story was filed by A!l'P 
and publiabed at least by Dial"io Ias Amoricas. 
4·~ • AM'SCROLI, continued its mailing program to Cuba, but on a 
further reduced scale. During the quarter aoout 5,000 were 
::iailcc ve;.--sus 5 0 000 during the previous quarter.· We count a 
diatribution during tbia quarter of 7,127 press .releases a~ 
econOlllic studies to places other tban Cuba. 
&. A recent development which may 1>;1ve an interesting 
operational potential was a telephone ca·11 to Al!SCROi..L from 
Czarnikow-ntonda, the New York sugar broke1·s, which was 
triggered by an AMSCOOLL "case study" of the problems being 
faced by a CUban sugar mill. The Urm told AJ&SCOOU .. that i~ baa 
tor some time suspected Cuban sucar production figures and 
wondered 1t AMSCP.OLL bad any such suspicions. AMSCROLL (through 
AHPRAD-1) bas written to say it would be most interested in 
.following any leads troa Czarn1Jt0'11J-l!ionda tba t could support a 
conclusion that Cuban production figures are false, whiob 1a 
where tbla matter noi, lies. Tbe officials of Czarnikow-aionda 
are vell lmown to .\MSCROLL and we shall be interested in seeing 
what tba 11.rm developes for AKSCROLL.
