MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/133 
SUBJECT: Operational Redirection of QRPBONE/1 
1. In response to your request that I examine the 
QRPBONE/1 project to determine how it might best.be 
redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and 
money involved, I have talked at some length ~itb appro­
priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been 
advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/l's dwindling 
productivity are as follows: 
A. Key centers of activity of the radical left 
in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For 
different reasons QRPHONE/1 's access in these tbre·e 
capitals is either circumscribed or off target. The 
British have asked that he not operate in London "'l'L'"~ 
against African targets. His reputation amongfurget 
groups of interest to us in Paris.and Stockholm has 
been so tarnished that be bas not~"'ta1ten into their 
confidence significantly enough to be of value. 
.B. Although be bas a multitude of contacts among 
the left, virtu~lly all are shallow, periodic, and then 
very brief when they do occur. Even bis correspondence 
to the more important radical leaders, which used to be 
quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing. 
c. Because bis contacts are so cursory, be bas 
been unable to develop a close and continuing personal 
relationship with any one of them in order to develop 
the intimate confidence so necessary for operational 
exploitation. 
D. His cover bas always been thin and thus bas 
circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic 
allegations of bis being a JKLANCE agent.
