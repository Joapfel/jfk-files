letter states ta NSA has no objection to the Director's 
provisio11 of NSA's damage assessment to the House Permanent

that NSA does not feel that it would be appropriate to reveal 
the names of Cortgre~smrn and staff who are aware of NSA's

9. (Confidential ·· DH!) LIAISON Received a call from 
Ed Greissing, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff, 
regarding the Hause Select Committee on Assassinations request 
for access to ,,Church Committee transcripts of testimony by 
Agency employets.Y I asked him to send Ted Shacklcy's

I reminded him that Mr. Sanchez had asked that his testimony 
not be shown and that that should be considered the final 
Agency response. 
10. (Secret - DFM) LIAISON Called Earl Eisenhower, Scriate 
Select Committee on Intelligence staff, who mentioned he woulc1 
like the briefing on counterintelligence to be presented to 
the Committee during the first week of August. I later picked 
up a letter from Eisenhower on this subject. We confirmed 
tomor,-.,row' s briefing of four Committee staff members to cover 
thep,1~rt.ha Pctersonl case, specifically the allegations of 
poiso·, pills; thc,·-c:hscovery of the antenna in the chimney of 
the Moscow Embassy; and the Shcvchcnko case. Eisenhower 
repeated his earlier request to Lyle Miller, Actig:_g: Legislative 
Counsel, for a trip to NPIC to view Wrangcl Island ·which is part· 
of t11e USSR but which some U.S. citizens claim really bcloncs to 
the U.S. Eisenhower had viewed maps· of the Island but wants to 
see photographs as none of the maps arc more recent that ten 
years old. I agreed to try to set this mecti.ng up for Friday,
