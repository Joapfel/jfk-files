Subject's performance durin" tho perioi of over one year under 
r~view continued. to do!lcrve the rating of Out-standing. lier major 
contributions durii:ig. that period were in tho field~ of operational 
research and exploitation of information obtained throuKh technical 
menns. She was, during this period, given full responsibility for 
tho handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis­
trative matters. In view of the difficulty of recruiting target 
personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from 
technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task 
with her usual enormous capability for work, displayinK initiative 
and great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the 
other tasks listed in this report together with sonsative reporting 
sent by a· sep~r.ato channel, altogether a much heavier workload than 
is usually carrled by one person. She was helped in thls by her 
good knowledge of Spanish, a talent for administrative wor,k, con­
sidorablo analytic oxporience and great devotion to her wor~. 
Subject should bo corisidered for promotion to the grade of GS-14 at 
tho first opportune momon·t.
