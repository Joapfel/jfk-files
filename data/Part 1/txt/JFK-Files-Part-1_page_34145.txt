1. A result of QUSPOT-2's recent .. holiday in the JMWAVE area has 
boon to esta·blish a correspondence _between bl/m an~- AJO'.R:AME-1, tbe 
A~'C'C'-'-
S\f$,..rn 
signor o·f tt,e Suplemcn,to E!i!Eecial of the AllSCROLL Economic Bureau, a 
copy of which ls forwarded by separate cover. QUSPOT-2 has indicated:­
~hni .,o could use AMSCROLL economic studies and that he could arrange· , 
for publication of at least some of these in Identity A. Jlo suggested_" 
thnt the original of such publications be sent to Identity B with a 
copy to him. •Thi~ was done in the case of a recent economic report 
which was shortly thereafter published in Identity A. QUSPOT-2 air­
mailed this story to A~RAME-1 which arrived at about the same time 
as the copy the lilndrid _Station airmailed to the JIIWA\'£ overt address. 
2. We wish that the article being forward~d by separate cover , 
als9 be surfaced in Identity A. T~e original has been airmailed to 
IdonUty B with a copy to QUSPOT-2 per QU~POT-2's suggestion. JMWAVE - •• 
fools that this is a useful mechanism and unless advised to the 
cont~ary we propose to·forward additional A}JSCROLL studies to Identity- B 
for pubiica tion ii;i Identity A. Sho,uld Madrid prefer ,re, of course, c·an 
in tho future forward such' articles directly to the Station tor 
placemont instead of airmailing them to Identity B. 
3. StudJ;es similar to the ono being forwarded are regularly 
i-p,epafed in English on a number ·of ec~nomic subjects. They are 
distributed to shipping firms, ·certain banks engaged in international 
co.llll1l8rce, in'ter_national trade organizations, internation,al commodity 
houses, etc. They are translated into Spanish solely for use ~n 
Id~ntity A; thus, in this·sense, these reports are~ "exclusive"._
