GOLITSYN, who had s0rve•i th~ ~GB ~0st recently as a counter­
intelligence officer in Helsinki d-1ri:1:i- 1960 .:ind 1961, reported 
separatcl 1 two possibly related leads :.o or-eratio:1s a3ainst Am­
erican personnel assigned to the United St~tes E~~.:issy in ~oscow.

other il recruitment. approach Lo an r.::rno.::issy er.plor:e whic:1 GC1LIT­

items of information frui;i diiferenl K:=.·_; Secc,nJ Cnief Directorato 
officers at different times. 
GOLITSYN provided the first of these leads on 23 December 
1961, when he reported infor~ation he said ~e learned during 
conversations with his pQrsc;~al fricr.d G?.Y,\ZNOV at: 1:Gn :-lead­
quarters in Moscow so~e tim~ between Apcil and July 1960.* At 
that time GOLI'l'SYt-1 was ,•1sitir:g the /;;nc.::1cc1n :''~part1hcnt of the 
S-=:cond Chief Directorate 11, c,::1necr.1.0;1 .-:ith his ,,re:_:iaration3

had pe:rs'.JDoU.y ;:,:c-:,pared o.n c,peration 1;,•:olv1n:J :::n Arn8ri.can mili­
tary code clerk to the point th~t the ~GB was "99 per cent sure" 
that the recruit.Dent approach Lo this code clerk would be suc­
CE'.ssful. GOLITSY:~ subseqm,,~tly n:c:rrc·,:ed the.' time of his conver­
sation with GEY,\ZN<)'J down tc, "April or '.-!uy 1960" and quoted 
G?.YAZNOV 3.s saying that the }:GB "is certain '.:hat the rec.::uitment 
is preparea and will be successful." GOLITSY~ also said that 
the recruitrr.ent pli:rn for this oper:-alio:1 "e\'.!.dently invclvod a 
woman," but could provide no further details. Duri~g these same 
taJ.!<s, according to GOLI'I'SYN, GRYAZ~JOV sa 1d tha. t al th·::>ugh the 
KGB had earlier recrui~ed U.S. DepJrtmcnl of State coae clerks 
in Moscow, this would be the first recruitm,~nt of i.l code clerk 
in the office of the A.~erican Military Attachc since the estab­
li~hment of t:-ie Second Cni~f DirecLorat~•s American Department 
(in the 19~0's). 
GOLITSYN reported on the second operation on 26 February 
1962, while discussing the i-:GB agent PRi::ISFREU~W. GOLITSYN 
said that he first met PREISFREUND whe1: the latter ,.'ent tc the 
Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application 
for travel to the USSR. On several later occasions, GOLITSYN 
said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes. 
According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit­
ment in Moscow of at least one American Nho "could have been a 
code clerk or a diplomat." He also knew that the recruitment 
had been accomplished "in 1960, at the end of 1960" and chat 
PREISFREt:ND, having met the target at America House in ~loscow, 
had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach 
by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his 
introduction to various KGB female agents. GOLITSYN thought 
that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after "he had helped 
to create the circumstancesA and had not taken a direct part in 
.) 
* According to NOSENKO, he himself was GRYAZNOV's superior at 
this time. NOSENKO did not recall visits by GOLITSYN to the 
U.S. Embassy Section in 1960.
