NOSENKO's Statements 
11 June 1962: "Well, perhaps, t!ler~ 'O'Ould be some kind 
of fitness report lkbarakterist ilea]. Son:;1:ti1tes there tho 
Counsellor, FREERS, who was th~re before llcSYiEE.\"!Y, dict-o,ted 
something; he said that so-and-so has such-and-such weak-
nesses. We bad not known that. We are listening to your 
military atte=hes there. We know where ttey intend to travel, 
what they v.·ant to find-out. tie k.~o\l' what nachinery and what 
targets interest thea--always ... •. They chatter sonet1111es • 
. Some of the things they say are s1Jrp:l:'lsi::::g [ from thE! point 
of view of s~curi ty}. The)°-discuss, • among other things, 
where to go, what to see, w~at to t a.ke wi ri-. the=·--electronic 
equipment or not. And we are t.untinl!; for this electronic 
tQUipment end now have permi~sio~, if we a.re a~solutely cer­
tain that one of your people 1s taking ele-ctro.nic apparatus 
with him on an intelligence trip outsi1e Moscow, to take it, 
to steal it. We now hAVe authorizati~n to take any necessary 
steps to steal it. Because you now hnve i::np1,"}vcd your 
equipment. We stole some equipment in Stalingrad in 1955, 
but now you have bot~er apparatus .... ,c~at do we do [ when we 
know the attaches are taking i:1pecial.E'4uipmcntj? Well, they 
are getting ready to go a,:1d v;e bear , .. t!lat st1ch-and-such data 
interests them. We give them disinformation: we ::ake them 
think, for example, that taere are rockets there. And there's 
absolutely nothing there, understand? Absolutely nothing. 
We make it appear on the radio [by spurious·tranS?llissionsJ 
that ·there are rockets there; we even have patrols standing 
there and everytbing ••.. They talk about intercs~i&g things, 
but never in my life have I heard a conversation about agent 
operatlo::is, not once." 
12 June 1962: [Speaking again about coverage of tbe U.-S. 
Service Attaches) "They say: 'Today, let's go to such-and­
sucb a place.' They go to the nilitary attach~, the two 
assistants, and say: 'This region is --interesting. They· have 
so:nething there.' We know it at once. I personally -tele- • __ 
phone surveillance at once and tell the Chief of the depart­
ment to come at once. He arrives and I say: 'Throw in 
••• ,. •• three, four, five brigades [surveilluce teams}.' We work al­
JDOst openly against the attacbes •••. k'R.EERS. Bill FREERS, in 
particular, walks around in bis office and dictates. A11· 
this is recorded. Well, this is-very important aaterial.· • We
