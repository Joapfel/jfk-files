1. Forwarde.d herewith as Attachm~t A are copies of 
two letters written by Nikolay LEO~dv, a Soviet journalist 
with "N'OVOSTI~' who is currently in Lima on an extended TDY. 
The letters were intercepted and reproduced by liais)!"on 
(DUBRIDE) and passed to the Station with a request for a 
Spanish translation. .. 
2. The letters were translated fcir the Station from 
Russian to Spanish by DU1,IAGE1''TA-3. Following the correction 
of some obvious Spanish grammatical erros by DUMAGEXTA-3 and 
a re-typing for security reasons, the translation was passed 
to DUBRIDE. A copy of the Spanish translation (marked as· 
Attachment B) is attached for the information of the Desk. The 
lette11 give the appearance of being pure propaganda and the 
information contained tbe)ei.n may well appear in the Soviet press. 
3. We assume that tho Attachment will be translated from 
Russian to English and we would a'pprecia te a copy of the English 
translation being forwarded to the Station.
