➔-- ,,.1.vhcn I showed him pictm·es, he snid that he did uo_t_ . .rccC>gnize

0-- , they aro _rolntlvcly po·ot", it is ,,ot likt~ly th:lt they would 
,.x plny toccthor. Uc said, however, thnt he wo~1ld keep his eyes

'who_ tho two Soviets were .nnd why wo _were intt'restod in them, nnd 
he said thnt he wo•Jld be only to happy to do whn.t ho ·could.

Wbll kao~ her since she is~ regul~r plnyqr and prob~bly more or

hnd .bii~n very clo5c to LOGINOV (P-11, 712) and thn t I was interested 
.to find out ·1-c she would now, since ·he tias depnrtcd, tl~nns:Cer her 
attention to one of the other Soviets. (I wns specifically 
interested in finding 0~1t whotl-.cr or not ~lorin nud c1-:1m1n-sn had· 
met on the morning of 2~ November ns indicn ted by LIEN\'OY,. but 
ELLY had not been ·at the French Club that morning.) 
3. 1-'.LLY comraentecl thnt he hnd found it h~rd to make contncts 
at sports clulJ!3 in f.!0xico than in other _coui1tries. Mexicans were 
p:irtfrularly difficult to become friendly with and it '-':lS not nt 
all unco:,1mon to have a ton1Hs match with no personal· contnct 
,·,h3tsoever. Jie said~ ho-wcver, that he thou~ht the· French Club 
__ was bcttc~· than l!IOSt :f.n Mexico City. E,,cn though t-he people 
~t the Ft~rch cluh wero rather clanish~ it w~s easier tb get to 
know them there- than, for example, at ChapuJt_epec •
