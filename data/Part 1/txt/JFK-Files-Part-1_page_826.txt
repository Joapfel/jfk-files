(b) AHCUTLBR-2 had received a-letter from AMFAUNA-i dated 18 
October aayin~ that she would receive a visit from a person known to her 
<wbo would introduce himself aa "BtJgardo", and asking her to introduce 
"Bdgardo" to AIU'AUNA-14. Th is person has not yet arr 1 ved, and AMCUTLER-
2 does not know who he is. 
67. AMCUTLER-2 agreed to stick to thei!!ie stories in case she is 
interro1rated, and to brief ''Ketti" to support the coffee shop story. 
Sbe also told AMFAUNA-14 she had decided to go into hiding immediately. 
AIIPAUNA-14 as):ed her not to do it so soon a.ft er her vis 1 t, but AMCUTLER-
2 said that AMFAUNA-14 should provicl'3 her u•ith cover by telling the DSE 
that AIICUTLER-2 had spoken of taking a ho] idn:.: at Varadero. 
68. Making her report to ''Carlos" aft&r this meeting, AMFAUNA-14 
told these cover stories as though they had just been revealed to her 
by ANCUTLER-2. 
69. I.fourth letter arrived from AMF.AUNA-1, consisting of two 
pages of overt text. AMFAUNA-14 was sure that it contained SW because 
of tbe banalities in the cover letter. B~fore turning it over to 
ncarloa" she took it to AMCOG-3 who had suaebody make a literal copy 
of it and then destroyed the original. AJ.iFAUNA-14 turned the copy over 
to "Carlos" who had her develop it, and was again disappointed and angry 
when no SW showed up. (Station comment: this letter had contained SW 
DWBber groups for OWVL rece~t~on.) 
~ ·, 70~ On or about 10 November 1963, AMFAUNA-14 prepi:..red a written 
f.l . report for the DSE on the visitors to the AMCOG household. This report 
was actually dictated by AMCOG-3 to AMFAUNA-14 who took it down on the 
!~ . typewriter. She then made a handwritten copy of the report to turn in
