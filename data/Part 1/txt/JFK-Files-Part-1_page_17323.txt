.Dear IUllard: 
'.rJlis may seem to you liko a voice out of the void, but I 
always carry in my mind your repoated invitations to visit JOQ. 
and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to my 
brother. Strangely enough it seems to continue to be true 
tbat the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to s7 
old area where I novor expected to roturn--1 even had ono t~is 
Spring. Just now I have a spe~ific reason for wanting to 
visit your place, thnt is, in addition to our own personal 
reasons. 
For some time I havo boon bent on trying to push tor aor:a 
pcc1t1vo information from tup~ and audio. I renl1za t~at it 
ie taken for granted around th~ world that the purr,osa of taps 
anc nudio is for operationnl leads, particularly in the Klm:&SX 
field. 
In one or two pl~ces in the world, positivo production is 
outst~nding and we have beon makinb a study lor some ti~o 
trying to ~ea wh7 it ~orks in ~ome C4o~~ and not \n otbors. 
Ong of the outstanding examples is LIFF.AT nnd especially Ll~"iOY. 
Thesa seem to be far ahoad of other Himilar operations around 
the world even though they seem to approach tbo problom 
sorae-;;,hat similarly. It occurred to mo that wo miE;ht find out 
what ma~es yours so espec!ally effective by having one of ay 
p.,3ople go to your station for a few days to talk witb you and 
your officers ILild get the detailed story. I could then ta.ke 
another look nt tbg other operations and see wh~t•s mitisl.L.g or 
what'& uTong. I'm suro this would be of great help to tho 
place as a ~hole. If you agree, I vill send Paul V. Levister 
(Iden), tho editor oi our Foreign Intelligence Series (our 
Btnff doctrinal pnpors, the firEt few of which have been 
dispatched to you). a~ could bo in Mexico City on or nbout 
23 September, or any time thereafter that is more convenient 
for you and your puoplo. Could you let us know your reaction 
by cable, and if it's favorable, whon you would prefer to have 
Levister arrive. ~e would confirm bis 'J.ITA by cable.
