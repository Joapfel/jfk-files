SUMXARY 
- 1. There bas been no change in the operating procedures of the two LIEMP·ry base houses, LICALLA"and LILYRIC, or in the use ~made of the product. Raymond H. GEREND~ continues as.Project principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden bis activities, to include additional agent ilandling and the following up of ops leadR. After a slow start, some progress bas been made, 
II
.but GERENDE i& now involved ·in divorce proceedings with bis wife. 
This situatlon is steadily worsening and represents a potential 
I security risk to LIK\G>TY and other Station operations.

GERENDE 
2. As Headquarters is aware, the Station bas for some time trie<t to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. 'fbe Station bas long recognized GEREtt'DE's not inconsiderable talents: He is personabl« , fluent in two languages (to the point where be can pass either as. a Mexican or an American with no trouble), be bas considerable 
I 
experience in support activities, be has knowledge of the local scene which ~ould be bard to duplicate, and he is completely at the Station's disposal. He has also worked for RVROCK for close to 15 years, in effect making a career of B\'ROCK, and the Station r-- believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCX an obligation to see that be is fairly treated and provided with benefits 
Which would not otherwise be due an agent with less lo~gevity. On 
; the other hand, GERENDE has picked up some bad habits-be is not · 
• punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst,of 
Lall, he lacks drive and ambition.
