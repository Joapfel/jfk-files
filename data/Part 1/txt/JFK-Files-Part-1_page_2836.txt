(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
Knowledge of CIA Personnel in Embassy: 
summary and Conclusion 
' Nith the exception of ABIDIAN, there is a paradox 
connected with each of NOSENKO's identifications, as is 
most evident in the cases of@-ORELJ) and GARBLER. It is a Dl. 
fact that both these individuals were known to the KGB as 
CIA officers, a fact of which NOSENKO apparently is unaware. 
His claim is thus false, that he would necessarily know 
whom the KGB believed was a CIA officer, and to the extent 
he related it to his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the 
Eml:>assy Section, _that latter claim is unsubstantiated. 
Personal Handler of KGB Agents 
NOSENKO has named seven agents which he claimed to have 
handled while Deputy Chief of-the American Section during 
1960-1961. 
YEFREMOV and VOLKOV 
NOSENKO continued to manage these two. homosexual agents 
whom he had recruiteq. and man,aged during his assignment in 
the Seventh Department, a:nd, brought with him when he trans-
£ erred to the American Department ( see p. 111) . They were • 
used in no operations durin~the period 1960-196lc [NOSENKO 
described the compromise of Robert BARRETf) in 1959 and knew Ob 
of ·his later recruitment in 961. (See p. 134.) NOSENKO 
does not know oftBARRET!l's contacts with YEFREMOV and VOLKOvd 
in 1961, when he'claims to have been their case officer.)
