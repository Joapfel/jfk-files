1. At their most recent meeting QRPHO:IB/1 r p:,rted to RODIGAST 
that he had lost his passport in Paris during his recent visit to 
France. The loss occurred on 8 Nove.'Uber in the departure lounge at 
Orly Airport as QRPHO!m/1 was waiting to board AP 822 for London 
(leaving at 1755 h~urs). QRPBONE/1 had sho~n his passport to the im-
migration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the 
duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes· 
for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slippe~ 
from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for 
these items. At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight 
was airborne. ~
