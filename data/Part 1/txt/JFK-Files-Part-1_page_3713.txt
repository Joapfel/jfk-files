The Ambaaaador 
Political Attach, 
Statementa of Jose ~aria •chem&• ZELAYA 
1, ~n 1? ~~y Iv~• contacted by a close friend of mine 
who ia engag~c: in negotiations with •chem•" ZCl.AYA which 
.. , lead to the tw~ forming a business partnership. While 
my aource is not nurmally a source of intelligence informa­
tion, I have found hlr.a ,to be a good observer and to be 
Nliable. Ha told ma that ZELAYA told·him the following 
at a aeetin1 on 9 Hay. 
2. The ROCKEFELLCR vlait is merely a political maneuver 
oa the part of President rn:<o~ to furnish an excuse if 
anything goes wrong in L.atin Al!lerico'l. It ia preposterous 
to expect Governor ROCKEFCLJ,,ER to learn anythinR about a 
eountry in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to 
th• United States. make his report to UXON 9 and then go about 
bla.nomal duties. NIXON will adopt those recommendations 
Naal'ding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable 
to hlm 9 paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes 
wron1 9 NIXON c~n pin the blame on ROCKEFELLCR. In thi!' ,1ay 
be has a acapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the 
,. -pa-eatige or ct pot~utial poli.ti\:cll l'ival~ :10 possible good can 
ecmae from this mission. • 
3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing 
(bendiciSn) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on 
the blessing of the American Ambassador. In this respect he. 
baa proposed setting up youth_centers around the country-­
places where yrr.ingsters can go to read p,ood books 9 play 
ping pong~ etc. -- and the American Ambassador is interested. 
"• My frion;;i is'. of' tl:a opinion that ZELAYA iii atrongly 
anti-American.
