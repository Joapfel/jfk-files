Fitness 'Report - David A. Phillips 
-~ECTION C. - Continued: 
PEfr~aps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demon­
·strated':is··11i's--a:61lity tci "fire u·p11 tiis people to produce at their 
maximum capacity. A'lother outstanding characteristic is his diplo­
matic manner of deali.1g with other oCCicials. Of particular note is 
the fact that Subject',, relationship with Ambassador Dunker ot the OAS 
{who, in dfoct, has been the President's principal representativ~ ~P 
th·e Dominican Republic} are closer and more fruitful than the relation­
ship of the Embassy with Ambassador Bunker. This has in no way 
damagcd the close relatiom,hip Subject has with the Embassy and other 
government oCCicials. 
Subject had little managerial experience of the scope required 
by his present position prior to his arrival in the.DR, nor had he had 
much experience in Fl matters. Ht:' has adapted readily however, and 
he::' continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time. 
Cost conscipusr,ess is, of course, a relative thing. Mr. Phillips 
as a CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs 
heavily costs against anticipated results and expects Lo get a dollar 
·r·eturn·for eRch·one spent. Overall Subject can·bc de1:1.:ribed as ·a ~•ery 
able person. His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while 
producing at a ver·y gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself 
an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended 
for a,, Agency Award.
