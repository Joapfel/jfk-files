Tadeusz SZUID 
Th~ Sta-tion copies of the _original.reports on SZULC have 
been destroyed.- I attach, however, ~ memorandwn consisting of 
selected ent_ries from his c ~. 
2. All the intormation is from the same-source, a Polish em.i~ 
• who knew SZULC personally and.also had. informants in the Polish Embassy. __ _ 
3. There ~s little doubt that SZULO.was pro-convnuirl.st at the time~ 
. . 
and that he co-operated with Ig~cy SACUS_, a cousin who was employed 
by the Press Section·o:f .the Polish Embassy, and p,rovided him with 
"inf<:>rmation". " It would, however,· _be unwise. to. jump to the conclusion. 
that·this collaboration took the fona of espionage, since SZULC• does 
not seem to have made any secret of the _relationship. ,. .- . . . 
I .can fi~·no evidence that Ignacy SACR'3 was an intelligence· 
officer,, but he seems to have been an .active· propaganiist. He returned 
to P.olani in 1954. A report from the sa.'lle source, dated June 1956, 
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute 
for Inte~national Affairs.
