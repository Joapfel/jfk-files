Some c~e·n_tator_s incl:udlng 
· ·some Soci,)'lists ,-,conclude. that. 
many·SPo· voters defecte~ to'the 
·NPD. The respected· Frankfurter· 
Allgemoine·Zeitung fudged some 
of tho ole·ction data t'o suppor.t 
it3 argument that ·workers .had 
gono over ,to the NPD, but .. ,1 more 
careful analysis has shown ·that 
the NPD did indeed wih above-av­
erage suppoit in some working­
~lass neighborhoods. 
Many old Socialists and 
trade u~ionists, such as Willi 
Bleicher, the powerful boss of 
the metalworkers in this state, 
are cool to the coalition and . 
hb~tile to intellectuals, and 
so;ne of them a_re repelled by ·an­
archic stu<lent leftisn. Even so, 
most workers ·are _unlikely ·..inder 
conditions of full employment ·_to. 
cast what they wquld considir a 
neo-Nazi vote; ce·rtainl 1• Blei<.:her 
would never favor s·uch ·action. 
sro electoral losses would seem 
to be due·less to defection to 
the NPD than to the failure of 
lower-level SPD functionaries, 
apathetic, or even hos ti le toward 
th~ coalition, to get out· th~ 
vote, and to the failur~ of many 
trade union and norm.illf SPD 
voters to go to the polls. 
In tradi~ionally ~ocialist 
Mannheim, only 58 per~ent of 
~~ose entitled to vote turned out. 
SPD percentages dropped 14.per­
cent in one distric~ and 13 per-
: cent in anothEir. The percentag~ 
I . of N.PD. _strength rose_ to 12. l, • 
_l0.:9,-and 11:2· in the three city· 
districts, b_ut working class· 
votes would.not be needed to pro­
vide these 'percentages, espe-
• dally in the face of -a ·low. SPD 
tatnout. These. vo·tes probab'ly 
came mainly 1·rom the. CDU, ,the 
FDP, ot from· those who had not 
voted before. 
NPD Activity Pays Off 
The NPD organization worked 
hard during t~e caMpai~n, con­
ducting more meetings than all 
the other parties put together. 
The p~rty has overcome its former 
inexperience and disunity,. and 
is developing into a well-oiled 
political machine. The organ­
ization fields speakers and pro­
vides canned speeches and prop­
aganda materi~ls to local groups. 
The NPD's heritage is not purely 
Nazi. It encompasses more re­
spectable antecedents, such as 
the neutschnationaler (German 
Nationalists) and other conser­
v~tive elements. In the inter­
ests of avoiding a government 
ban, the National Democratic 
Party shuns bl~tan~ly Nazi 
appeals and tactics. 
Adolf van Thadden, the na­
tional leader of the NPD, is a 
smooth personality from a Junker 
f.1 .. ,ily who denies c!1arges that 
he was an active Nazi. He seems 
to model himself more on De 
Gaulle than on Hitler. The 
Baden-Wuerttemberg leader of the 
party, Wilhelm Gutmann, is a 
former Nazi. During "the good 
old days," he was Buergermeister 
of Tiengen ~n the Swiss boraer, 
where he.sponsored anti-Semitic
