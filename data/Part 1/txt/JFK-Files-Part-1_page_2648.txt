~n the Naval RU and of his date of graduation from the 
Institute.of International Relations). To the extent to 
which he has been consistent at all, he has cited March 1953 
as· the time of his entry to the KGB. 
Date of Entry 
NOSENKO at his first meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962, 
volunteered how and when he joined the KGB. NOSF.NKO had 
just returned from his Naval RU assignment in the Baltic, 
he.said, when he met KGB General KOBULOV and KOBULOV urged 
him to join the KGB. NOSENKO stated that after completing 
his processing, he reported for duty in the Embassy Section 
of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in 
March 1953, "just after Stali"n died". (Stallri died on 
5 March 1953.) 
Comment: According to KGB defectors, the precise date 
of entry. to the KGB would not likely to be 
fdrgotte~ by a KGB officer. The. date .is the 
·basis for-computing-length of service and is 
a common entry on KGB admini'strative forms 
periodically filled out by KGB officers in the 
course of their service. 
According to NOSENKO in January 1964, he transferred to 
the KGB from the Naval RU "in something like 1952"; "just 
• after Yu. I. GUK transferred from the· Second Chief Directo­
rate" . 
Comment: _ GOLITSYN haq reported that GUK was transferred 
• out. of -the Second Chief D°irectorate in January
