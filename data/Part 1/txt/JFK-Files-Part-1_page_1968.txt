2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDE~·;- ~O~N F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 
23 Jµne 1976 
MEMORANDU.:,1 FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group 
SUBJECT Manuel L. DE ARMAS 
SF#591 865 
1. Reference is made to the attached cable traffic which 
sets forth the "defection" of the Subject to Cuba circa April 
1976. In substance, DE AmtAS apparently gave a press conference 
in Havana on 21 April 1976 in which he claimed to be an ex-CIA 
agent who had been recruited by a fnu BLACKENHOUSE (no Office 
of Security traces) in 1969. DE ARMAS also claimed to have been 
stationed in New York City in 1971 where he maintained contact 
with BLACKENHOUSE and Richard TOMLEY (probably identifiable 
with Peter L.B. TOMLEY, Washington Area Recruiting Office). 
2. In the cited press conference, DE ARMAS made many 
allegations concerning purported CIA operations, such as 
assassination plots and a plan to rupture relations between 
Venezuela and Cuba. Details of these allegations are set 
forth in the attached cable traffic and are not treated in 
instant memorandum. However, interest in DE ARMAS' allegations 
concerning alleged CIA operations concerns the identities of 
individuals that he claimed to have been Agency operatives and 
assets; details regarding these individuals are covered in the 
latter portion of instant memorandum. 
3. Agency-interest in DE ARMAS was originally predicated 
upon the receipt of a letter written by DE AID,1AS on 12 September 
1972 in which he related details concerning his anti-CASTRO 
activities through his membership in a group called ABDALA. 
The letter also contained a request for employment with the 
Agency. As a result of DE ARMAS' letter, WH Division requested 
a Special Inquiry by the Office of Security for the purpose of 
establishing DE ARMAS' identity, which was completed in October 
1972. In May 1973 Office of Personnel opened a file on DE ARMAS 
and apparently went through the normal routine of shopping his 
file. Interest in DE ARMAS terminated when TOMLEY sent DE ARMAS 
a letter advising him that the Agency had nothing currently 
available·. Then on 22 January 19 7 3 DE ARMAS wrote TOMLEY 
thanking the latter for interest following a telephone call
