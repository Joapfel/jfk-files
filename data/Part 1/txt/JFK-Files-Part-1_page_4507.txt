1. AMCLATTER/1 reported on 19 April 1965 that he had received 
that same evening a total of four phone calls from an unidentified 
party threatening to kill both his wife and himself. 
2. The fi1•st three phone calls were received· between 1800 and 
1830 hours wh:.:::eas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours. The 
caller spoke fluent English and used extremely vile language insult­
ing to both A/1 and his .wife. ThE: \conversation during each phone 
call was short and made no sense t~A/1 who said the caller at one 
point identified himself as Jerry rrALKER when A/1 asked who was 
speaking. A/1 has never heard of anyone by this name and believes 
it to be fictitious. The caller also said on one occas'ion, "I've . 
been hearing the things you said about me up in Fort Lauderdale." 
Again, this remark made no sense to A/1. -~\'.t_•.n..-cde.,,;.,...,I+-~\-..., ._f\.}..LS,
