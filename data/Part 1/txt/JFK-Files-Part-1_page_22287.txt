- NOS£NKO was unable to say when or how the KGB first 
learned that BURG I_, "'as a homosexual, nor could ·ne remember 
who first proposed an cperation agair.st him. 
- NOSENKO gave a con~used and evasive account of his 
dealings with the First Chi~! Directorate on t~is case. 
- NOSENKO insisted that there was no official file on 
BURGI, and that none was opened as a result of this opera­
tion. The initiative for the operation came, he said, fro~ 
the Second Chief Directorate, and when NOSEHKO traced BURGI 
in the First Chief Directorate, there was no information on 
him there.• The KGB's only infornation on BURGI at the 
time of the compromise came from BURGI's visa,application 
(which showed him to be a professor of Russia~) and a few 
agent reports from the preceding days in Moscow; BURGI, 
on the other hand, reportec that during the recruitment' 
KOZLOV, the senior Soviet present, showed knowledge of the 
names of BURGI's sister, rrcther and father and knew the 
sister's occupation; details of DVRGI's background, work, and 
military service, BURG!'s relations with the Russicum in 
P.ome, which BURGI said he had never mentioned in the ~SSR: 
and BURGI's acquaintance in the U.S. with Alexander KERENSKY. 
NOSENKO cited •his• recruitment of BURGI in Kiev in 1956 as 
one of the main reasons for his rapid rise in the 1:GB. .BURGI 's, 
story of the recruitment, as re~orted to t~e FBI, definitely 
establishes NOSENKO's role as having been subordi~ate to that of 
KOZLCV--it w~s KOZLOV, not NOSE~KO, who made the recruitment. 
• DERYABIN int~rrogated NOSENKO on this case. NOSENKO's answers 
to such detailed questions as how the traces were done, how 
the travel to Kiev was arranged, details concerning the person­
nel involved, the contents of the file, and other mechanics 
of the case, betrayed an almost total lack of memory.
