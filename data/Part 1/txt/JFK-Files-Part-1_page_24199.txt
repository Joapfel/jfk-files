-------------------------------a.ACT DT]))lllC/Operat.iooal 
QREBOq/Salan Raise for OREBONY/1 
.ICTIOlllllQUllltD-IIUUUCD 
1. At tbe ti• of bia recruitment in Jane 1965, Qll.DO?rf/1 vas told that his 
$600 910nthly taz-free salary vould be raised to $&00 once be got a job in a target 
organbation. vblcb of course vaa the ioal of his planned summer acti'rity in 
Algien. 
2. Through no fault of his own, the Algiers assigmient (and other possibll­
ltlea, SUCJI as Djakarta) evaporated shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, WOFACT changed 
its si~nala and eventually decided to base QRDIO~Y/1 in Europe targeted against 
individuals and grou~• in various countries. 
3. FrMi the begimiing 1 QREW>~/1 has rroved more than satisfactory as an 
ageat. lie h.aa carried out assign111ents given to him vith knowledge and tact and 
the proper spirit, has used bis ovn inftiatift as ll!UCb as our guidnnce, aud ha~ 
Dot violated our instructions. No one vill argue that ne hasn't proved to be 
better thall ve collectively thought be would be, and in terms of his ovn 
abilities-apart from targets vhicb may or -1 not be accessible to bil!t--be 1a 
getcing bett•r all the ti:!!f!. 
4. Last year. abowt a year later thsn QR!'.1!.0!'fY/1 ci::ht h11ve expected his 
salary to go up from $000 to $800, ve raised it to $Nil. He waa pleased, and he 
bas DOt cosi;,lained as auch as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably 
QUBOHY/1 is reaponaive to the generally &ood treaU!ent he has had 9 to the 
respect for hiQ a& 6n iudlvidual and tJ1e app~eciation of hie services; probably 
_ be is carried along as ~uch by bis ovn personal satisfaction in knowing be is 
111eet1Dg require&eDts aod continually breaking oev ground.) 
5. linertbeless, LCPIPIT believes the time baa cmae to raise Q'RF.EOl<'Y/1'• 
salary to the prOClised level. We can all agree th.at we are still getting his 
services cheap: QREBOSY/1 receives no quarters 1 living allovance 1 or educational 
_ allowance h>r bia children. His increased gratitude, the relief be will tmdoubt­
edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial vorries. are aore than 
words the extra $100.
