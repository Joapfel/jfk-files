to be·bis patron (to "help bin out financially") if this co--u d be doe 
on a very discreet basis. He said he hoped to put on anothe Cuban 
shov in Chile, before returning to his iamily in Havana; LI L\T 
coverage of LIRI~G-3's apartcent for 26 October showed, -incident-
ally, that REYES ~aintains close enough relations with Silvia 
OCR,\.'i (of Lee Harvey OS\ULD fame) to be invited by her ~o be~ 
house for lunch. ! !

prominent local neurosurgeon, Juan CARP-.\SC0 with Yhom she sp nt 
sor:ie ye.;::~ iq Cuba. Bo.th are Y.exican citizens. According t what 
she previously told LIRIXG-3, Carmen ~'OLI~A helped gather so~e of· 
the infor~ation used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the 
BOSE!-.-SERGS. With· the help of Alicia ECnF.:1,ERRIA ~d the'latter's 
U!lCle (who is the current l!exican ~inister of Interior) Carmen 
obtained a prominent position on the ~~xican Olympic Committee 
in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen 
LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAYIREZ, a 
rabid pro-CASTRO Yexicari chemical engineer who is still in Cuba. 
Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican; 
physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa­
tion made available to LIFTER-I, in early 1967 both he (Armenegildo 
and bis second and present wife are bard core Yarxists.; This

LIFTER-I, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including 
the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife :naintain a close relation­
ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin IlERX.\~DEZ-Arnas. 
Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard li~e ~xist. 
Information dated 1961 from RXL..\BILE indicates that she w:\s 1 
active in Comzunist organizational '\\"Ork at GXAY and participated 
in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian Preside~t 
PRADO. Although see is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be 
quite as red now. She told R0~"TOX, for example, that she felt 
nothing but disgust ior her fanatically pro-CASTRO husband :md 
had strong resentment to~ard her step-mother. Per LID"\"0i, July 
1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PR0EXZA when the latter 
'lias at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. 
3. At a private lunch •ith Carm~n ~LI~A, 28 Cctcbcr 7 
BOITOX explained that he was a Greek leftist (although 'not a KKE 
Dember) involved in lucrative international business. He said 
that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult 
for him to operate in M~xico as openly as be would like. He_ 
could thus use OOLIXA's help in obtaining certain types of 
information and a..aking discreet contacts with ~exican government 
and business circles. ~!()LISA agreed to do what she could. She 
stated that s~e was not a member of any llexican or any ;other: 
Comnn,mist organization, but eerely a leftist sympathi~r. She 
also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with 
the Cuban Embassy. LI0XI0~-1, to whom a photograph ofiOOLI~A, 
REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is fon-arded attached) iwas shown 
stated be had never seen these three persons enter the 1Cuban 
labassy. • f ; 
4. Following the developments described above·,· tatioh 
pl~ .to: -· / 
a. Continue to develop REYES to the point fhere, 
per Reference, he may be recruited by ·80WTO~ eith~r under 
false flag as a Greek leftist or in ali~s as a W0fIRY ! . 
member to become a reporting source in ll'a\·ana. ptimary1 
motivation in RE\"ES' case would almost certainly be ',· 
financial. • i
