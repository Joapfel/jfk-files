4. Hr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-old GS-13/4, \olas nl about the average age 
for thh cla,Js and slfghtly above nveray,e in grade. Although formal gi::adcs 
arc not glvvn to grnduatee of the SOC, it was the conaenaus of DTS staff 
·fn11tructors involved in SOC 02/76 that Hr. Piccolo would almost certainly 
ran~ number one 1n thfy particular group. Bringing to the class broad opera­
tfona_l exf}erfonce ;md ur:,derstandfng, Mr. P1.ccolo \olas an active participant in 
the sh:-d11y SAi block .of. fnstruction and made contributions based on his own 
op£~ational past. n,e tradecraft instructors ~ho conducted the live problem 
fn· Richmond described Hr. Piccolo as the best student·'in street tradccraft. 
One of the Course Coordinators c'ommented that Hr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more 
th.an any of the others,· the ability to lead the group." Hr. Piccolo's term 
paper on the subject of how a NOC station might be established in Rio de Janeiro 
vas C3reful and thorough and vas described by the panel as "a~ excellent overall 
plan." To a man of Hr. Piccolo'e experience, at least some of the course may 
have-seL'lll(!d a little basic or redundant, ,but he never let it show, and always 
took part with the same enthusiasm as the more junio~ members of the cl313s. 
S. A copy of thi~ memorandum is being placed in Hr. Piccolo'a official 
personnel file.
