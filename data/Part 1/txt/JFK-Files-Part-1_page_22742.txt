On qualifications - there just aren't any in the 
civilian·or industrial category - The university work in 
Econo:nic Sciences was real, not cover, but interrupted before 
I got the degree (5 years). However, I specialized in Econo!llic 
Theory, which when considered that I studied in three ~atin 
American Universities (Costa Rica Guatemala and Cuba) does 
give me some qualification as a. "~atin American Consultant". 
The classfication as "Research Analyst" is cover except 
for that part of which the "Latin American" background could be utilized. -.-.:,,_,.-.-,,."",' --,-,, ,_.4,~;s;_. · ,::-,,- -''·'' -
Although I have had no business experience in an admidstrative 
or executive capacity I am sure that I could qualify in that 
work, especially if il were in connection with Latin America or 
utilizing my Spa . ish language ability. 
As you can see by the above, unfortunately th~re is no 
com;ercial "counterpart" for the type of work I have been doing 
for 15 years or more. !-~y feeling is that we should consult the 
"local outolacement" r.lB.n first, on the possibility that there is 
a local op~ortunity, but the op~ortunities in the ~atin American 
field whill be greater. 
(In acdition to the above,I might add that I have performed 
best in "operations" work"- which involves planning, direction-and 
coordination.) -
