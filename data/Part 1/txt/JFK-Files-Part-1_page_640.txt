that the two children have different matronymics, that noither of them 
ie his wife's l&st n,uu, and that all th~ee dependents hava different

20, It is evident from his S/W messages that AMfAUNA-1 derives 
great personal satisfaction from his work against the CASTRO re~ime. 
His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work. 
This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have been 
many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 tc, do 
something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is 
believed to be effective.
