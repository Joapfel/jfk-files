in June 1958 to the po!Jition of Ccp~t, Chief of the Ane::ican­
Canadian-British Tourist Section, hereafter referred to as the 
A-ncrican Tcurist Section. 
The on:y case of the ~une 1955-J'.~;-.e 1958 i;<.:riocl resultin-; 
in agent cc~tacts abroad, and the o~~ to which ~QSENKO ascribed 
the greatest importance-, was the recruitment "If !3t;RGI. For this 
reason, the BURG! ope=ation is di£cusscd in dct3il below, with 
particular attention being given to those as?ccts of ttc case 
which reflect upcn NOSESt;o• s own pt!rson3l role. 
(ii) The BURGI Case 
NOSESKO's statements of this operatio11 generally agreed with 
that BURGI proviccd to the Falin 1~57. The p~rt NOSESKO played 
in the case, both in his brie! initial presence with the t~o 
ho.~osexuals in the Moscow rcstaurar.~ v~ the evening of 3CRGI's 
compromise (20 J'u:-.e l'.)56) and in the Kiev events (23-28 June 1956) 
would appear to be one nocraally ta~~~ by a KGB staff officer. 
The identities ~f the other tfto Y.Go p3rticipants in the Kiev 
recruitment, KOZLOV and rETRE~KO, see~ cle3rly estab:ish~d. There 
were discrP.pancies betwet:!n NOSCNKO's a11d BU~G.i:'s ve:-sions, but 
most of these coulJ stem from NOSIJiK0's fault.1 o.:?;,-ory nine years 
after the events. (Such discrepancies incluc!e ~;r;s:.:lKO' s iailure 
to remember his first Moscow meetings with DURGI: the identity, 
role, or even existence of the person "Anatoli}·• who::, BURGI says 
introduced him to ~;osE:;Ko and partici?ated in the homosexual 
compromif.e: whether NC.SENKO Wl.S at t.he Kiev airport to ::neet BURG!: 
the locatic:, of ~OSENKO's bedroom in the Kiev Hotel as compared 
to BURGI's; NOSEilKO's reference to Bl:RGt1·s •interpreter• when in 
fact. BURGI neither had nor needed o:,e; and NOSE.NKO's failure to 
rerr£mber the unusual circ~~stances of sur.GI's dep~rture from 
Kiev.) Other co:,tradicticns and o~issions in N}SENKO's reporting 
relate to u:atters of greater operatio~al consequence:
