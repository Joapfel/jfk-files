ACTION REQUIRED: FYI 
,,. I. We forward under sep:u·a te cover subj cc t publication which was 
recently sent to AlfSCROLL mail recipients interested in economic 
material. In p1·oducing, this study a particular effort was made to 
keep it objective and factual on tho theory that in tho case of Bugar 
tho fncts speak for themselves and need only to be pulled together. 
We also believe 'that ob.jective material similar to the attached should 
over a period of time enhance the reputation of tho AMSCROLL economic 
section as a serious and objective outfit that seeks to discredit the 
Castro regime by publicizing the truth. 
2. Tho Station would appreciate Headquarters' reaction to this 
publication. Additional copies are available should distribution via 
K.MFORGET or other.means be desired. 
3. It may be of interest to report that a copy of the. attached 
report has been mailed to Identity, currently in Geneva where he is 
rcpre_sonting his company at the sugar conference. This "".as done 
directly under the AMSCROLL economic section letterhead and via 
AMWOIU>-l's brother, an employee in the' research department of 
Identity's company. •
