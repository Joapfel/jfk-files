2. NOE.MA YR was instructed by the Station to proeced with the necessary 
correspondence with Mexican, Cosca Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities 
for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of 
PBLrn·,-1£ and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the 
necessary docu menrs from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the 
Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been 
received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian 
clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMA YR will submit all papers 
to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for 
the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant 
Visa for NOEMA YR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four 
months of the date issued.
