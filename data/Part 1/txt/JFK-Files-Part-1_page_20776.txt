I have been associated With the CAS Station Chief since my arrival 
at this post on January 11, 1966, Inasmuch as I have kept in very close 
daily touch with him, I believe'that I am in position to evaluate his 
performance. 
Let me say at the outnet that the F.atoo Officer has had to work 
-under the most varied and difficult circumstances. His service at 
this post began, for example1 in a revolutionary situation mar~ed by 
great and continuing violer.~e. The attention of a good part of the 
world "'8S focused upon this si~tion, and some of the highest national 
interests of the United States were involved. The presence of t.he 
Inter-American Peace Force, of its major U.S. component, and of 
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker in ·his unusual and unprecedented role 
HI added greatlYa to the dimensions of the work done by the Rated Officer. 
In the aftermath of revolution, he had unusual~ delicate and complicated 
tasks to perform in connection With the e~tablishment and maintenance 
in power·. of _a most fragile Provisional Government. As the latter 
carried the nation to"8rd the all-important election scheduled for 
June l, 1966, the CAS Station Chief faced a changing and constantly 
challenging set of requirements. Finally, his tour of duty at this 
post has encompassed the transition from the P:.-ovisional Government 
. to a constitutional government emerging from those elections and the 
gradual firming up of the position and institutions of the present 
democratically elected administration. 
To this intricate complex of circumstances, the CAS Station Olief 
has brought a bacxground knowledge of the Latin American area and its
