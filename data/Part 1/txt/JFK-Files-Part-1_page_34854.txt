1. AMTRIGON-8 was a member of the VII.LARO crew. During 
May 1962 he clandestinely and without authcrization· boarded an 
infiltration craft moments before its departure on an 
operational mission. His absence was not discovered until the 
team had infiltrated and moved into its first position. 
2. On 8 or 9 June 1962 the infiltration team,. including 
AMTRIGON-8, be·came engaged in a ·uret'ight with a militia 
patrol. AMTRIGON-2 1 _ the tdam leader, reported that AMTRIGON-8 
had been wounded and that he assumed AMTRIGON-8 was killed 
or perhaps captured. However, no further word has been hoard 
from AMTRIGON-8 and he is presumed to be dead. 
3. ·Taking into consideration that the disposition of this 
case could have an affect on the morale of the other crew 
members and their atti-tude tow_iµ-.d WOFIRM, it was decided to 
advise the ,widow of AMTRIGON-8 that: he died a her_o 's death-­
while fighting for t_he liberatfoJ!: 'of _bi~ country· and to continue 
monthly payments to the _wi<:l~..:-:l!llSF~h~ldre~ :(or an indefinite 
pe_riod. Inclusic;m of Subjeet·•s· name on AMBUD Hero & Martyr 
rolls was deemed to be,.'the mo1:,1t suitable a.:rd expeditious manner 
in which to handle s~ifr payments. - • • -~ -
