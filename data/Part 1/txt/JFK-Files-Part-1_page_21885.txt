like to serve as a stringer for the French journal and proposed 
that he begin ~ith a story on the life of the family of a 
"So•!!'"'t secre<; agent." As KOROLEV spoke only broken French 
and En~lish, the magazine staff did not seriously pursue the 
matter at that time. 
On 10 October 1966, however, KOROLEV again ap~eared at the 
Paris Match offices, this time with one Feliks_RO$E:,TAL.who acted 
ashlsinterpreter. He displayed a photo spread showing NOSENKO's 
wife and family going about their daily affairs in Moscow, ~nd 
he subrni tted a· one-page document •• in English .which gave a short , 
account of NOSENXO 's background~ The docu:nent said in part: 
"NOSENKO' s family consists of a wife, 35, two daughters,_ 10. and 
12, a mother a.'ld a younger brother. The family is not prose­
cuted (sic) but feel very badly about the incident (the defec­
tion).· Very :oon -the wife will apply to the International 
Lawyers Organization for a div·orce and compensation. It is 
possible that ~his case will be given much publicity. His wife 
has not heard from him since he defected, but it is ob•1ious 
that he is still in the USA." The document, which was in no way 
represented as coming .from a Soviet Govern.racn·t source, also said 
that additional photographs of-NOS~KO's fa~ily in Moscow _could 
be obtained and that an interview with the fan1ily and with others 
knowing NOSENKO could be arranged for a Paris Match correspon­
dent.• 
* According to information available to CIA, a divorce from 
a defector from the Soviet Union, who is legally considered 
to be an enemy of the state, is granted automatically upon 
the wife's request. There is no known precedent for either 
Soviet-inspired publicity or divorce difficulties in any 
previous Soviet defection .
