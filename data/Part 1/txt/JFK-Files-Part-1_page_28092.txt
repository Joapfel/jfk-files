SUBJECT: Mr. Frederick C. Randall, ~-14/7 
10 October 1975 
r.- • This rc;port is submitted as part of 11 packai,:e su1,?gesting that 
Mr. R:lndall be awarded a QSI for his pcrfol'111311_Ce_ since becoming tho 
D00 Frccd9ffl of lnfonn;ition Officer in Ft-bruary of this year. In this 
_context, it is not appropriate that he see an~ sit,111 this mcmornn<lun, 
since· I wnnt this to.he a_surpris~. Nor, it seems, is it necessary 
to have l,l Reviewing Official for this interim report; the DOO has· 
suggested, :~n c;o~ntiog on my olLt·oJ:~rcle _rN.·01T111Cml'ltion of 8 August, rs 
• · for Nr:-·R.,ri<laU 's proiriof fon, that a: mcmorandtu11 be suhmi t tcd rc-coll1l)cnding 
a QSI at this time .. • • 
2. I consider Mr. Randall's perfom.:!11ce as D~/FIO (now D00/PIC, for 
f~ivac:::y Act ~nd T-0.!_A foonlinator) to be' Outstanding. As r haw said 
elsewhere, he is, in my view, the most impress1ve of an the Agency FIO's. 
combining D00 professionalism, tnc't, P,l'rsuasiwnc.•ss, analytic skills and 
an infonned, tough-miml~d approach toward sources and methoJs protect ion. 
I have received considerable lmulatory co111nt•nt ahout his work from OGC, 
OLC, O/Dl:li\ and i,;ithin the 00. 
3. From a one-man opef;;it.ion wi rh secretary, the f-OIA activity expanded 
in four n.:i,nths to an approved T/O of 7, with a pt•nding request fo"r 5 IOOT,C; 
anJ th~ j>assi·bili-.t.y o( furthc.r increases depending on public react ion tQ the 
Privacy Act o.nd the amrnmt of litigation that develops. fn,J hns dont' an 
excellent job of sclcctini his staff for 1-:h.1t is an oftl'n frnntic; frust:-ating 
arnl long·ho~rcd r.mvironm0f1t; he also r.i:m:1:ic:. them w.ell, 1,i·tlr!11cn--1r nnd
