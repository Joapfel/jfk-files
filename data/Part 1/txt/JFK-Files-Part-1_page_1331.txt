SUBJECT: Howard Hunt 
determined that $33,500 was advanced to him 
for travel and transportation of household 
goods to·and from Madrid with one trip to 
Paris £or he and his family to renew their· 
Spanish visas. All o_f this advanc~ ,was fully 
accounted for. However, in his accounting, 
one item appeare.d unusual. It was an_ 
expenditure of $1,600 for a s~nsitive 
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr. 
Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without . 
further accounting. • 
3. Also,· we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts· 
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period. 
4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it 
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The 
EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the 
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-· 
·salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an·3:ccount at Riggs National 
• Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The . 
following deposits were made to the acc_ount during 1965 and 
1966:
