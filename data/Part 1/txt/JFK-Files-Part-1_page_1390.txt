3 . .i • -The above evaluatio:p stre_sses the operational and security 
weaknesses iri this operation .. In contrast to these weaknesses 
are the positive considerations of this ~ission.· A/2 has the 
intelligence,· competence, and confid,ence to approach and re·­
cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime 
operations. at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results 
·which·thes~ .inti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter 
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.

watching.in terms of security and control for these factors 
will jeopardize the· operation as well as KUBARK's position 
if riot properly contained~
