Mr. Flores ~id n fine jl.,b while he wnR a~~t~~ed 1 t;;!.~ ~;~~L'.thi le 
desk, lie had responsibility for a variety of FI projl'cts, including 
Sl'V<.'ral complex and sensitivt.' l'nl's, which he ably handled, lie had a 
full workload and in addition to his nsHJgned responsibilities he was 
given FI ussignments Qf every type as they arose. On one occasion he 
was s~nt on an operational trip to New York City whore he was to con­
t;lct, assess and s·upport a tar~ct personality. Owin~ to circumstances 
beyond hi~ control nothing went as expected but Mr, Flores, acting 
alone, improvi-sed and adapted to the.situation. This is indicative of 
the initiativ~ and eagerness he displayed in his desk work. He was 
willing to.!earn and he accepted guidance and instruction to the letter. 
In addition Mr, Flores writes well nnd th!A is always an asset. 
Mr. Flores is fluent in Spanish, It is my impression that if 
there is one thing that Mr. Flores wants to be that is a field case 
officer, ·110 is how·-gcttini,: that chance. lie will soon lenve on an 
assignment to Ecuador. I have no doubt that ho will do very well, 
Mr. Flor~s did not have nny managerial duties •
