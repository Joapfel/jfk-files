Dear Mr~ Sternberg: 
As you might surmise, your organization is well 
known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your 
letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive se&rch for 
information pertaining_t~ your request was con<luct~d. 
No infor~ation wjs located which ~ould indicate that 
CIA has ~ver ptovided funds to the IRC either directly 
or indirectly. I irust this. letter will allay any 
apprehensions your organization ha~ had in this 
matter. 
If I can be of further assistance, do not 
hesitate to contact me. 
S_incerely, 
George Bush 
Director
