8. On 19 June 1964, the undersigned vent to the warehouse 
at Fra:conia to trJ to fit the s1gbt hood to other 7.65mm FAL 
rifles. It was suspected that the fit might be a problem when it 
~~ would DOt fit over the rear sights of three FAL rifles at Isolation. 
Altbougb it was later detenainad that tbo tllne rlfles.WOl'e cat a 
different lot and may therefore have different tblerances on tbe 
rear sigbt casting, it was felt that further checking was necessary. 
Kiu FAL rifles fr011 the same lot aa tboae obtained by WB/SA/MOB/PJil 
were unpackaged &nd the aigbt bood tried OD tbe rear sight. Ot 
tbe nine, two were perfect fits aod tbe other seven too thick . 
for the bood to fit, Tbia created a probln 1D tbat tlle e1pi 
hooda bad to fit rifles_vbicb for operational reasons could not be 
MUured before band to detenaiAe the tbickneae of tbe rear aight 
blade. Providing adJwit&ent in tbe slot of the e!gbt hood woqld 
have coaplicated tbe fixture to tbe point vbere it could become 
operationally unauitable. Tberefore it ,ra,;: deterainec1 that the 
beat solution waa to provide oeveral sull files witb tbe hoods. 
The &Seep sight on tbe rifles, a soft castiq, waa found to be 
quite easy to file. In most cases it would be neceaa&ry only to 
file several tbouaandtbs to obtain a proper fit. Thia procedure 
was explained to C/WB/SA/l108/J:1f and he stated that it would bo 
acceptable .
