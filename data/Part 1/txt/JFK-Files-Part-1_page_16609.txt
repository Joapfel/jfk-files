Al IIARIH 
1. I had introduced AMBUNNY-1 and AIIWHIP-1 to each other 
2-1 llay but the olflce was crowded, so there was very little 
opportunity to discuss operational utters. We met asaln 
on the above date, after business hours, and we wore able 
to meet in private. Although Al!WIIIP told me that he ~-.s 
delighted wltli A!l~'Y-l heraelf, as he said the ·•cubans 
like that kind of girl - not too fancy'', he thought that 
~ 1~er background - particulQ.flY her previously working for the 
G u,.S. Amtassador in BoliviaJwould·m.ake the operation very 
risky. He said that if0til were discovered that .MfPUN~-Y-1 was 
a penetration of thc(;J$NAFU-19 office (by the CUbar.sl bis 
coonectioo with ODYOKE would tben0'1:e revealed, with the result 
that all bis ''connections·• wtthCmlsNAFU-19, and ''Habaoa" would 
ho lost. AM\fTIIP-1 opined that he thought it likely that 'the 
Cubans would check her out in (!-oliviV . ,, . 
2. AMWHIP suggested the°bossibllity of using a cutout 
to introduce AMBUN~-Y-1 to the (y?i"l.;NAFU-19 installation. He 
said he vould explain in detail at a later time, what be 
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any Mre than necessary 
to AMBUNHY-l. 
3. AlHo, AYWHIP-1 stated that he was unable to travel 
to Paris before mid-June, as he had solff relatives coming 
to visit him from Italy. Attar checking with DI UBALDO, 
I subsequently lnforaed AMW11IP-l and AMBUS?-.Y-1 that the 
(';,4- (parts> operation was off. Both expres~ed relief. I told 
AYr.U~"Y-1 that &be could most likely ~ttll be utilized 1D 
\1.-"2... (Rabai), and that we would d.i.acu:ts tilt- possibHitivs at a • 
'"'fa ter date.
