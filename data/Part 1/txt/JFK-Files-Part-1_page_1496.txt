MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Meeting with E. Howard Hunt Re His Memoirs, "Undercover" 
1. On 28 September 1974 Ray Rocca, Deputy Chief/CI Staff, • 
and I met in the DCD Washington Field Office with E. Howard Hunt, 
his attorney William A. Snyder, Jr., and Snyder's associate 
Thomas W. Coons. As the· meeting began, Hunt asked if it w~s • 
being tape-recorded; I assured him that it was not.. He said he did 
not care; but that, if it were to be recorded, he would like to know. 
We then embarked upon the review according to the plan under which 
we would demand the deletion of three items as classified and then 
proceed to the remaining 29 items, only if Hunt was cooperative on 
the first three. He and his lawyers appeared very cooperative, and 
accordingly, the meeting continued to cover all 32 items. 
2. Changes were agreed to in the items set forth in paragraphs 
12, 14, and 25 of the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September 197 4. 
These appear at pages 73, 80-83, and 115 of the galley proof and 
concern the· fabrication of the Shanghai post for a Mexican operation, 
the entry into the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico City, and the joint 
CIA-Uruguayan telephone monitoring operation. The wording of the 
agreed changes is aif shown on the attached copies of the pertinent 
pages of the galley proof. Essentially, these changes disguise the 
identity of the fabricated newspaper and remove a reference to 
journalists as agents; delete the word "Guatemalan" to make the 
entered embassy non-specific; and delete the reference to listening 
posts and telephone monitoring to make that paragraph refer in more 
general terms to our ability to cover targets without referring to the 
use of electronic surveillance.
