with tbi& fun~tion which.is call~d the Second Special 
Department .. It is a part of the Operational Technical, 
Directorate [OTUj. The Special Department has several 
sections within it. Take, for example, the -section under 
Colonel [N.Ya.j KUZMIN. He tias the entire English line, 
every.thing. He has young girls.and boys there whJ have lln 
ext:ellent e:om:nand of English. They all sit i_n a room wit_h 
special equip111ent and listen continuously. Besides this, 
everything goes on tape and later they transcribe it. They 
listen to it two or three times so as to get every word .... 
[They prepare the materials.} The materials from the • 
American Enba~sy used to come to me ... and I decided what to 
keep and wha't not to keep. Why? A sum.nary report would 
come to rue with the notation that the information in it 
was Top Secret or Confidential. This was all nonsense, but - •· 
I was required to return the report within two days' time.·· 
So, I would read through the mat-eria1s to see what was .use­
ful and .what .was not .. It's not all suitable. And I would 
• underline this [the significant itc~sl with a pencil. No, 
( I wa3 wrong!. ~·•The report first went to the Chief of de­
partment &.nd then I underli:1cd with a pencil what was neces­
sary and gave it back to them [the Second Special Department, 
OTUj. They collected it. I signed a receipt that I had 
received it from the~ and they gave me a receipt when I 
returned it. And then they gave me extracts. From these 
. extracts alcne one cannot tell where the ~aterial cnue froa, 
but from the report one real.izes that the Americ.:.ns aro 
being listen~d to. It is necessary to have these extracts 
to place in the files. We have a file on each person working 
in the Embas!iy, the so-called delo-formulrar [developmental 
file}. We keep one on every Embassy employee." 
During the second of the 1964 series of meetings in 
~eoeva, on 24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes from 
bis wallet. Pointing to . .:>ne of them, he said: "This piece 
of paper was kept in my op~rational file and it represents 
the statistics for the years 1960-1961, listing those micro­
phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations 
in the U.S. Embassy." This list named eleven offices aud 
apartments in the chancery. which contained 0icrophones. 
When asked whether he .had copied the list from records or 
had drawn it up from memory, NOSE:NKO exp).ained that it came 
from an operational revfew of what "listening points we had 
in the U.S. Embassy." • 
A detail_ed explanation of his acquisition of the written 
list was supplied by NOSENKO OD 14 May 1964: 
Question: How did this list come into your hands? 
_caused you to write it? •
