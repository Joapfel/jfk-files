COMMENTS 01' Re'.VIEWING Ol'FICIAL 
I concur- in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on'du'ties No. Z, 3 and 4.--
I believe duty No. Z could have be_en rated "outstanding" rather than "strong," 
with justification. I also think,_ ho'-'<·ever, that duty·r-io. 1, involving the overall 
administration and management of.the Station and its personnel, should more 
appropr~ately be rated "proficient," or perhaps "strong." ~,. ,, l,.-
