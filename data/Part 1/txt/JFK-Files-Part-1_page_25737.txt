HMMW-9364, 29 December 1960 
1. By reference Subject's annual s..1ary was increased to lrs present 
figure of US $5,040.00. 
2. Statlon hereby requests a further increase in Subject's annual 
salary to US $5,500.00 based upon Subject's outstanding performance as 
Principal Agent ln the LIEMPTY project. The latest Ll£}.1PTY Project 
Renewal Request, recently forwarded to Headquarters, detalled GEP.ENDE's 
duties. In Starlon's opinion, the noted salary lncrease is consldere;d justified 
not only from agent's excellent Job performance, but also as an incentive 
to continued superlor work at> well as an offset to the Inflationary trend of 
the cost of llv lng ln Mcxlco. 
3. It Is requested that Headquarters lnltlate the appropriate amend­
Q1enr to GERENDE's contrac.r Increasing his yearly salary to themted figure 
of US $5, f"IO. 00 to be effective l January 1962.
