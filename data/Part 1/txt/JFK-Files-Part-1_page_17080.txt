~ FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970 
1. Projec't LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year. fs the Mexican 
Station's oreration which provides visual and photographic surveil­
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance 
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet 
personnel and their visitors c0t1ing to the Emba~sy are photographed. 
From 1 Novefllber 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo­
graphs were taken and thous-ands of pages of surveillance reports were 
completed by personnel .in this project. SB Division is pleased with 
the quantity and quality· of the photographs and the Station finds them 
useful for oper-ational purposes against the SB target. During the 
past _year s~veral U.S. c_itizens entered the Soviet installation in 
Mexico City and the1r photographs were identified by the FBI. There 
is a good ·relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City 
and ~ppropriatelr sterilized photographs are passed locally. 
2. There have been no significant security problems. ' 
3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of 
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and 
tennination of the agent who attended it'. No real loss resulted from 
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken 
from it overlapped those taken fn;im another safehouse. The agent who 
serviced the faci·l ity was getting too old to do an efficient job and 
was tenninated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was 
added to the project. 
4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and 
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,0SO; safehouse 
rental and ir-<1intenance amounts to $6~1S38; maintenance of two vehicles, 
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval 
was for S43,520 and estimated obligations for this period are $43,500. 
A r.ew, $5,000 vehi~le was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in 
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.
