Following· is a translation of a report which 1,1ource 
wrote concerning a shipment of explosives to Mexico: 
"The Communist Party of El Salvador bad .asked me to 
send them twenty-five, one qua~ter pound packages of 
gelatin explosives. They reque:,ted that the explosives be 
sent to Mexico where thef would recover them and take 
them to El Salvador. 
"In view of the request, I spoke with Manuel PINEIRO 
regarding the ship:ent itself, as ~~11 as the amount. 
PINEIRO answered by telling me to do so. 
"During my-.trip to Mexico (March 1964) I spoke with 
Rogelio RODRfGl!J;Z Lopez regarding this shipment and he told 
me that there was no need of my sending the explosives 
to Mexico as this type of explosive. was a•;ailable in the 
Embassy. I then told RODRIGUEZ that I woutd answer the 
request from El Salvador~ 
"Upon returning to Cuba I spoke with PINEIRO, who told 
me. not to send the explosives as the orders now were to 
• send nothing but l!tOney due to the recent exposure of the' >t: 
arins shipment to \•enezuela."
