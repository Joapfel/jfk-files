4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and lb above) J ;,,;JJted out, 
____ l~~-t v.e had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens 
being allo,..ed to acc..ompan1 their sp~uses abroad ,..bile Stat-c dealt only 
v.ith the larger question of Soviets ~arried to foreigners being aJJ-:,,..ed 
to emigrate ,..ithout· reCerence to ,a,hetner or not they left simul~-t:ously 
v.ith or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson comm~n1ed 
that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both 'iloe and 
St.itc had said in that light. 
5. By -.,,,ay of further explanation. l said that the statemer.ts fn 
p.1.ragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning So..-iets being 
permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based "21 a 
review of Z6 cases, of v,,hich 10 involved Americans .. In only focr o! 
these cases did a Soviet ,..ife leave :he USSR in the company of her foreign 
husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; am:! in the 
r~•maining seven cases insufficient details are kno-..n to permit •l'I• t~ 
categorize them. I added that although State's information bega.A by 
citing the issuance of 7Z4 quota and non-quota immigrant vi·sas by the 
American Embassy in Mosco"" du.ring the period FY 1954 to December 
1903, it did not indicate how many of these visas ""ere for Soviet <.itizens 
v.ho had married U.S. nationals. Act1:ally State provided detailed 
information for only sixteen cases ar.d cid not indicate in many of rhese 
-..hether or not the Soviet v,,as permitted to accompany the foreign $,?:>use.
