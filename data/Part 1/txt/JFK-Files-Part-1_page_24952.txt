of GUTIERREZ' relations ~th TTKIN. Wt1 ~M wililn<? tn uettl~ for a e;>ecific :

6. Attachment D la a copy of a New York Times article concerning ITKIN and 
one o! the completed Ieder~ 'cases in New Yo.rk City. This item is attached for 
your background reading. ·Thia rr.ay be shown lo GUTIERREZ, of course. 
Attachment Eis a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from GUTIERREZ to 
ITKIN. Again, the content· of this letter tends to support the theory that iTKIN'~ 
story, as elAborated in paragraph 2 above, is a fabrication. While possibly based 
on a real relationship. it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology 
and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved •. .Also included in this 
attachment is lTKIN's answer to the letter. Vie feel in retrospect that 
GUTIERREZ might be unhappy to read his own Jetter in the courue of a consular 
interview. We, therefore, suggest that this not be.shown to him. However, 
there is no objection to an indication that the- U. s. Government is aware that 
GUTIERREZ was in perfectly correc·t correspoudence with ITKIN during 1965 on 
business matters. 
7. We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre­
liminary indication by cable of GUTIERREZ' response, i! one is forthcorning, 011 
the questions concerning GUTIERREZ' knowledge of HARBIN. I{ there is anything 
unclear in this dispa.tch, • Headquarters v.;~d w~lcome any questions by cable. 
All correspondence should be addressed Chief, WOMUSE, via Chief, WH.
