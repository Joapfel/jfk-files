I am Very sorry that you, Luis, cannot see all this, but 
am· an optimist an<l I a~ sure that sooner or later you wil 
visit Cul;aria, Do yuu know ~hat they say about the form 
of the country? When God was dividing the Earth a~ong th

I an not exaggcratin~ -- really the coast of the Bla L 
Sea in Bulgaria is very pretty. No~ there are abcut 25 - 0 
thousand foreigners tere on vacation. And what is very in 
teresting -- the najority fror.i the capitalistic ccuntries. 
At every step one hears French, German, Swedish. ~e have 
an acquaintance -- t~e raanager of one of the hotels; he, fr
