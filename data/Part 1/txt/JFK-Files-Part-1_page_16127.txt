SUBJECT. Mitchel.I Livingston Wcrbd ·m 
. • l. t wa;·_~dvised .by the Justice D~partment on 23 Febru~y that 
W~rbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March 
inMiami, Florid~'; .The cha:r;-ges relate to importing and.distributing 
qiiahtitics of marijuana. With Wcrbel's prope~sity to raise his past . 
;iffi_liations ,._;ith the Asency, we can :mticipate problems during this trial. 
A,n ·additi0;nal problem is presented becaus'! \'.'erbel is defend~d by Edwin 
:.,__Margei ,,tho was t}fo:'~ifense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26.ca_se in 
·auf(a!o,. N~i;v-,Y:.crk irtl966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed L'ie CIA 
Gener,al Coun·sel as a"defense wftness. - •••

·1 2. The Justice Departmen·t has.received informa·tion that a person 
I 
eith~i- currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating· 
in Wcrbcl's meetings ~vith his attorney. It would be apprcciated_if all 
addressees could re,·iew their holdings on Werbel and determine if there 
j
·1·· . is _any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc­
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Wcrbcl take place 
betWP.t'n now and the beginning oI the tdai. 
3. It would be helpful if each addressee could.prepa're·_; ~~~~a;y 
of the various contact:; Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please ch.eek 
to see if you have 3!lY information on a Colonel Bayard who was ki!led in 
Atlanta. Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an 
·.-.ssociatc of Werbel's. had previous contacts with the Agency. It would 
be appreciated if. your responses could he received hy close .:,f business
