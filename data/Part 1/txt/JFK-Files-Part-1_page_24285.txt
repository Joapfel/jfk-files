eondacted la January 1972 by DC/CA and ae vitb Branch 3 
-,.raonul, wltb the parUt'lpaUon of Richard Berkey 
(now of Brancb 4, for"Mrly QRPR<JO Case Officer at 
IOIPIT). Attached at Tab A are tbe questions which 
fonaed the basis for tbe r•viev. A ful.l reccrd of the 
responaea to these qaHttona and the review discussion 
is not praetlcal so I bnve attrllJ)ted below to eumaarize 
tbe general conclualou which emerged. Attacbed at 
Tab Bare two charts prepared by Branch 3 for the reY109

2. Pl and CAJ bchding PBI Sensitive Reports, 
QRPIICIIJ: dropped from 1S'7 rr.ports in ff 1S68 to e report• 
la IT 19'71. Ills Pl reports have evtckntly not bet'n 
ased aa a bauia for CA activities since 1967. This 
BltQation t.a apparently due to a variety of factors: 
the character of the a:an hhlBc>lf, ttatrictiona pl:lced 
upon hi■, a changing political context which coapobded 
targotttn1 dlffi~ulties, the coaplications of bis own 
eeeurity altuation, and the method by which be W3B 
haadled. It 'HS agreed that ~RPP.OMF. does have inherent 
&kills wblc:b abould hnve nn application to either Fl or 
CA work. Be la politically attuned; be writes well; 
H can handle contacts in several langusges; be knows 
lao'9 to ID09'e internationally; be has an engaging social 
personality; he hna an established (if controversial) 
Npatatlon as a left-oriented journ311at/wr1ter with 
&CDe scbolaaticcredentlals. The problem remains one of 
focussing bis talent• and detenaining the platform fl'Ola 
which he should op4rate.
