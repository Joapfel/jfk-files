tio~ed that the KGB ~as in possession of documentary reportir.g 
which described ttcse ~ethods in full detail. NOSENKO does 
not appear to be aware of ~ho BLAKE was, rauch less of his im­
portance to the KGB. ~OSE~1<0 never volunt~e~ed the narne of

about 6LA.~E, the KGS agent in British Intelligence, he said 
that he had read the dossier and that BLAKE had been "an ~~ent

in Washington from 20 to 25 Af.·ril 1960. :.~iSEtlKO, although not 
in the Tourist Department at tre t1rr.e t.he latteL· report was .------
received by the KG3, s,ud that he revie...,.ec.l all important ma- . -----: 
terials of the A.-ner1can Tourist Section ...-hen he beca.':le its Chief 
in January 1962. klked whether tr.~ Tuurist Departn:ent had re-
ceived documenta=y information from ar.y agent source while 
NOS::NKO was· away fro:n the ciepartr:icnt in the years 1960-1961, 
he replied that none h~d and that he knew of no agent who could 
have provided such documentary ir.formation. 
(ii) GOLITSYN Document 
NOSENKO in 1964 reported knowing that GOLITSYN at the tiJ:le 
of his defection in Decemoor 1961 took with him an official 
top secret KGB doc~~er.t concerning Western Intelligence opc,ra­
tional activity in the field of tocrisn (Pages 147-149). He 
did not mention this fa~t in t~e Jur.e 1962 ~eetings. Altho~~h 
~OS~KO also stated that this document had been prepared by 
the Tourist Depan.rr.e:it, he has net been able to cescribe tLe 
document in detail and specifically did not mention that t~is 
particular document was in large pare ~sed, as subsequent 
analysis has shown, ~pon the above-mentioned reports sul:mitted 
to the KGB by George BLJJ<E. 
(iii)Tourist Agents 
NOSENKO assertec that the KGB detected no agents among 
t.merican tourists dcring the years 1958 or 1959, and that ~o 
tourists had been caught 1n the act of mailing letters, servic­
ing dead drops, ·or contacting age~ts, except or.e in 1959 whose 
name, NO.SENKO said, ...-as MacGUIPE (actually McGOWA.~ in 1958) . 
NOSDn<O signed a statement attesting to these facts.
