t:-ie KGB had never done anything with its knowledge o·f LUNT'a· 
homosexual pr,:,clivities and that thc._Bulgarian MVR had not pre­
viously kno-..'n of thern. 
l~OSENl<O' s description of what happened next is as follows: 
"Y.OZLO•/ and the Chief of the American Department were very in­
terested. KOZI.OV S,'lid: 'George [NCSENKO). you must help them, 
They never recruited an American.' I said that I wo.uld do what 
I could. The three of us went to see General DUMKOV, the 
Chief of the Second Directorate, Bqlgarian M\'R. I asked tr.em· 
if the1 had a homosexual ayent. They checked and ~aid they 
had one who is an operational con~adt. O.~.; i aaid, acquaint 
them, prepare a flat, make the pictures. This is the first 
Rtage. I also told the~, of course, to find out how long he 
had been Liere, why, who his acquaintance3 were, e<;c. 'l'her. \oe 
wer.t to YEGCROV, the senior Soviet advisor, and KOZLPV.called 
GRIBANOV. GRIBM:OV, I later found o~t, was in a meeting with 
the department chiefs of the Secacd Chief Directorate an4 ~as 
not in a good mood, Whl', I don't know, He didn't u:1derstand 
what KOZLOV was saying. GRIBArlOV thought t:hat I, myself, wanted 
t,:, make the approach to LUNT. KOZLOV got confused 0:1 the p:1cne. 
GRIBANOV asked to speak to me. I took the phone, 'W1".:!t are 
you doing?' he said, 'You are not at hctr.e, you are abroad. 
Yc.u were sent only for consultations, but you are li\•ing as if 
you were at home.' I aaid: 'O,K., O.K. I wasn't going to do 
anything.' He hung up. I told KOZLOV that even if the Bulgar­
ians W6re to ask me, I could not do it myself. YEGCROV became 
upset. lie tl,ought our position was bad because the Bulgarians 
were asking. 'What they ask, I will tell,• I said, 'but I am 
not leaving the office to go any ?lace or do anything. I can 
only advise them on how to ma~e the record entries after he is 
caught. I can dictate the questicns to be asked. B~t the 
approach and recruitment I cannot do myself.' 
•The Bulgarians never said anything to me about active 
participation, but they didn't know what to do. I told them 
to get two agents, M;iybe LUNT ...-ouldn't like the first one. 
The Bulgarians reported that LUNT wouldn't be there :ong. I 
told them that if they wanted to take. pictures and make a pitch 
later, that's one thing. But if they wanted ~o do it all in • 
one step, that is another. I told them they should oonsider the 
time element .. , The Chief cf the American D~partrr.ent, KOVACHEV, 
and the chief of the section dealing with tourists and American 
delegations were to make the recruitl'lent. The approach was 
N'":' made at the end of April, I think.• 
HOSENlCO went on to say: •1 was in the office during the 
1,. _ approach. I told them I would not leave. 'If you need my 
·advice,' I said, 'come to me.' KOZLOV and I were sitting in 
his office. It was the end of April, I think, apd the.next 
:: ·day I went on holiday. I don't know where or how they -approached 
: , LUNT. I only advised them that after the first conversation with 
, , · .... :.~.· . 1',im they would know if he would be willing to cooperate. I said 
:~:~·Ff ·,,_,,:,;.-y/t._~}:.'.: t:hey should have an apartment ready ..• not far from Sofia. I _ 
. · /J . • .. i ., ::,.:u :~•1:t:.~ told, them that i.f he agreed, they should . change the place right
