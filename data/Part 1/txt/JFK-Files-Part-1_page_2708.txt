NOSENKO's Information 
~ 06 • The British subject ~ir Allen LAN~ travelled in the 
summer of 1957 to the Soviet Union to visit various publishing 
houses and brought with him as an interpreter fArthur BIRS~. Db 
The latter was of Russian extraction, having ieft Petrograd 
(Leningrad) before the Revolution, and he served in(}3ritish~l 
Intelligenc~ during the Second ~iorld War. The casa was 
. handled by another section -of the Seventh Department, but , 
06 because of@IRSE\' s past, "some of our leaders decided that 
it would be goocr if one of our workers could approach him, 
would get in on the case under the cover of the Ministry of 
Culture, who would take care of this person, who would help 
him meet with all sprts of people representing our publishing 
companies. The choice fell to me. I was chosen for·this • 
job." Taking along the KGB agent Larissa SOBOROVA as an 
interpreter and using the alias "NIKOLAYEV", NOSENKO •

their stay there. The only obJect was to watch@IRS~Ob 
because he was suspected of having an intelligence mission, 
and no approach was made or contemplated. NOSENKO explained 
that the use of the NIKOLAYEV alias with~IRS~and(!?\NE]madeQ{ u( 
it necessary for him to use the same name when travelling· 
to Great Britain in 1957 and· in 1958.
