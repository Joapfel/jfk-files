1. LC.PIPIT is revising the QR.EBONY Project files--which 
have been rather haphazardly caintained over the past year or 
so (much of this time the project was without a case officer). 
In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been 
unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational 
Approval applicable to QREBOh-Y/1. We do have a copy of the 
Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -
1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed 
during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move, 
or possibly it was inadvertantly not for.,.-arded to LC.PIPIT. At 
any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy. 
2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the 
FY 68 Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents 
which ought to be available to LCPIPIT0
