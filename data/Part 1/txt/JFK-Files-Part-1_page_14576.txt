"Tell Joaqu!n ALVAREZ that regarding the 50-million 
credit request from~_CUba to SPain for 1970., there has 
been no cont'innatioil:inasmuch as we have been unable to 
talk with the_present Secretary or Commerce. We find the 
figure somewhat ·hig..'l but have no basis for Judgment to· focus 
· on any area. 
"You must have heard already about the success of our 
reception. Not only because or the number., which was quite 
high~ but_ because of the quality or the attendants_. We____ _ 
had to use two rooms. We ~d prepared only one but when 
the Minister ~~ived it b~came necessary to open another 
rooin. There was representation from the 1,11tra-right to 
. the ultra-left~- This has been a great triumph for us 
cbnsidering-that_in these countries the quality or people 
attending these events is taken well into account. 
"Comrade NEIRA., an embrace for yo.1 and for those 
working ·with you. I hope when SONIA comes over she brings 
a project for 197O,'that can be fully undertaken by us. 
We are very bad at making projects. - Thts past year we 
did many things that had not been planned., while others 
that trere planned remained undone., but with last year's 
experience we shall strive to plan better.
