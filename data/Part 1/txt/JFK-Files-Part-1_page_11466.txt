re ~G/~ & LIRI?i<i/4. 
PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, Y.f:HBE, FRASCIS and Laurence 
PIPER (C/WU/2/G). 
1. LIRING/4 is stilJ very concerned about the im­
prisonment of LIRIXG/3. l,IRING/4 ,rilJ not travel to Cuba 
until she is assured of th•• Q,.f.,. .. ~ ---= T To!~'':,':'.:. :::::.:::~:.:. 
iuu:i i;oorougnJ.y a1s~ussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out 
the danger of attemptin~ t,, intercede on L/3's behalf. 
through business contact~. L/4 contacted the Cubans for· 
assistance but they statt"d there was nothing they cou-ld do. 
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3 
bas devised an open code ~htch be uses in letters to let 
L/4 knew how be is. The h·tters are grim reading becirnse 
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer. 
Fellow prisoners have warn•:d L/4 net to let the Guats 
·transfer him to another Prhrnn as th.is usu:i.l!:; a;ds i~• the 
prisoner being shot "whilt" escaping." One good result 
from the continued impriH,mment of L/J is that both be and 
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans. i 
2. L/4 is in telephone contact ~ith the T~ird Seer~ 
tary ot the Vexican Egbassy in Guatenala. He has made 
inquiries about L/J with th~ Guats on behalf ot Foreign 
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the 
assasination of the U.S. Aa.bassador) the Third Secret~ry 
told L/4 there were three r,r,ssibilities, the first which 
be considered out nf the qu~stion was that L/3 vould be 
shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and'be 
. released within a few week3, and the third was that b~ would 
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just priorito 
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted 
to arrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a• 
typed note under her apartm~nt d•1or. She did not make the 
meeting. DRISCOLL later lr:arned through phone tap ma~erial, 
that she ca-llea the Cuban Eabass)· ar.d in1ormed them t~e \
