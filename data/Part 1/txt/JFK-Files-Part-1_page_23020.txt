FRANK.• Frank wa__t1 the hardest working student o[...l'te group. He con­
sistently ar- led himself to all phases of thi aining with equal and 
great diligence. However, his practical work,· which took ·him a 
great deal of time to perform, was always a little sloppy. When 
Frank crimped detonators or threw improvised grenades, he was 
very shaky. However, he did not seem at all nervous about·working 
with other hazardous material. He asked many pertinent questions 
which contributed to the group's training and always answered test 
questions correctly and in detail. He was cooperative arul reacted 
well to correction. Some supervision was required since the staff 
instructors were concerned about his nervousness with detonators. 
His overall performance was rated as proficient.
