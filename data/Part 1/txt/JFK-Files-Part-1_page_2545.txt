(b} During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO 
was in the Seventh Department, not the F;rst Department, 
but continued to have contact with certain officers in the 
First Section, First Department. NOSENKO is of the 
opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United 
States Embassy during this period he would have heard 
' 11 something" even though he would probably have learned 
few details. 
(c} During the January 1960-December 1961 period 
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First

that there were no recruitments by the KGB of United 
States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during 
1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of t~JfiO1238 
case or cases. There is merit to this contention by
