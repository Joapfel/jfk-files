that VIBAl4'JA underatood tho uituntion, and U,at I was sure ii 
1P01.Jld- all go well. AJdCIIALK-5 REltJUred me that he hno no inton­
tl~n ~z letting hl=t,ol! KOt into c physicnlly dangerous oituntion 
_durl~ th9 contact. 
!J. If the contact iG 1114do next wook,· AMCJIALK-5 will bo 
bac.c: r...e.t'oro 'flSo- PACHA.HKIS is. I so id wo would ':'l'nnt to dobriof 
b1a la Miami and that-either I would soe him or PACJIAHKIS would. 
1 sa.i/2 th.at lf. PACliA.'H{Il:I tulks to him, be can tell PACJLANKIS tho 
CO'llf,UrW dotaUa or the operation unless I phonod him otherwise. 
~. Wo arranged to muot AKain at 1900 houre when AMCHALK-6 
woOld have bio itinerary, und I could pnss him the mon('y he neodod. 
Al!Oil..LL-5 doosn't want to bo paid 101· thia job, but I iru,lsted 
ag~1a t.hat wo woula pay all hie expenses, and I told him to uavo 
tiiJJ ootel bill nnd c,thor rocoipts. We met at 1900 hou1·e at the 
Vizcaya bar and then drovo arouud in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed 
hla &1,:.00 for wblch he signed a receipt. A.ldC'liALK-6 had gotten 
r·ea.el'""la tions and 1:1111 leave Mluml for New York on 7 Octobor and 
- thefi fly to Lisbon that same niKht. He will spend 8 and 9 October 
in Li.soon where be will rent a car and drive to Madrid, arrivin~ 
in U.e eveninK on 9.0ctober. Ho hns reservations in tho Agum.nr 
Hotel !er 9 October, and ho will make the first cont11ct-at.0930 
boUffl OD 10 October• 
7. I wished Al!CHALK-~ good luck, Ho is much more optemistic 
about bi.a r.:bances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but 1t ls good to work 
with a man with enthuslaam. Just in case AIICHALK-5 should be 
euc:ceas!ul, we should be prepared to support him. I ~uggeet that 
we cacie Madrid telling them what and how much we are willing to 
otter eoould AMWOLF-1 be lntorestod in ..tefcctlng. I told AMCllALK-6 
that ~ coula p1·0111use uaylum, but I did not tell him how much money 
he ~ld offer as an inducement for either recrultmont in place or 
delectioo.
