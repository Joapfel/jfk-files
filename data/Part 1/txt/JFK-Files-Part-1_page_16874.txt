hours a week just watching (a!1d photl>~ra~l'ltng) IDlliARSH personnel, 
and ovor the years he h~s gottcnto know th~•. and their habits, 
very well. Ho- can spot unusual or atypi~al beha\•ior, and when he 
is asked to put a certain individual under clost.> scrutiny, his 
comments can be very us'eful. Newcomers·,_ no 1:1.atter what their 
·cover, will frequently· gravitate to -their ·1s colleagues in the \ 
,;sat:oty" of the -MllHARSll back· yai-d., theret>~· enabling us to make 
tentative AEKICK or AI:.'GIUP identifications. 'IDYers can often be 
linked up with thoir inte-rnal escort officers. In the case of 
specific targets, LICALLA· sp~tal co\·erage can so111etimcs give clues 
to-:p9:rsonal relationships which can be exploited. During_ the reportins 
. p~fr:'1'od we bad special cov~rage on· AES.l:i.ASI~ (to·determine aay . 
changes in pattern following the AAKIDRIFF defection and following 1 
the operation-against him -- a111in both cases LICALLA did report .. 
·,_: ·some. change in pa·ttern); 201-305870 (for m.ucb the samo"""'roason, 
-· .:al i_houfli h~re- tho evidence was n-ot as clear); AU>OLYP (to gather 
• informatfon ·on bis patterns and his associations); Al:.'TAKEOFF 
(for the same reason); and 201-838166 (to find out if he did, 
. ill fact work in the "restricted area" and vho bis associates were, 
a roqulrement which was quickly satisfied). Also, LICALLA bas been 
asked to report on the arrival and activities of Ti>Yers such as 
the ABKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course. told that 
"security inspectors" are expe·cted -- be is told of tho expected 1 
arrival c1 visitors, and he can spot n visitor or newcomer immediately)~ 
tho possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to nttvmpt to • 
-ident.ify, at least by associationJthe persou-wbo went out to meet 
an LNR.EAD agent (subject of Ml-:XICO CIIT 2741, 17 March 1970). Tho 
value of LICALLA to tho Rl:DTOP program in Mexico Ci~y can scarcely 
be overstated. 
LILYRIC 
8. There have been no changes during thtt reporting period of 
the operation of the LILYRIC basohouse activity, except that Bruce 
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from 
GERENDE in early December. 1-'ERNAID normally meets only LililiPTY-13, 
at pro-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH 
area), onca a week for pick-up of the files and reports. He oc~a­
sionally meets LIEMPTY-11 (LI~MPTY-13's wiie) when LILMPTY-13 may 
be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a fnmily eute1·priee ' 
with the work equally divided among LIEAlPff-13, -M, ~6, and -.27, 
who split up the hours of._duty so that there is uninterrupted 
coverage Mondays -through- .Fridays from OSOO to 1800 hours, and 
·osoo to 1500 hours Saturdays. (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may 
be requested as ne~ossnry, and the LIL\"RIC personnel responded to 
the Station request for such extra co,·erage during the AE!JIDRIFF 
and AESJ::AS ICK cases·.) The family bas continued to provide reports 
_during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front 
en tra_nce of the MJIHARSH Embassy. Sucb con~rage included, as in the 
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of lllillARSH officials, 
up~tc-date· recording of MJUIARSH license 11u:bers, special activities 
and visitors (particularly Americans~of vhoe five were spotted and 
reported on during the reporting period), and so111e 3,500 photographs. 
As an example of the value of LILYRIC co\·erage, within one week of 
the change of license plates at the MHll-\RSH Embassy (a biannual ch:inge 
affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers ~::iring no relation to 
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of tb~ new numbers 
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among 
other things, this enabled tho Station to identify AESEASICK's 
companions during hi!:i lu!:it faw days· in Ue:-tico. Without LILYRIC, 
identificationof the new license plates would have tak~n months and 
would have handicapped our opePations. LILYRIC has also provided 
specinl coverage .. of the visit of a Latin .-\3erican CP rep1·esentative, 
an~ is currently watching foi· the two . .\~ICK security technicians, 
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the L~Rl::..\D agent. Also, 
LILYRIC has reported on vi3its of Me~ican :t:..-dents and the identity 
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal 'liith thei:i or band out 
11 tern tu re to them. In short, LILYRIC's servkes, even though the
