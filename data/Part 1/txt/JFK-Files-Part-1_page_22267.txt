(iv) Remarks 
7hat at least lwo of the documents werP. not authentic is 
evidence that the CHEREPANOV papers were deaig:1ed by:the KGB 
for American Intelligence consumption. 
There is no sensitive in format.ion contained in. any of the 
documentsJ that is, the:t• are not worth tht;! risk of stealing 
either in helpir.g the West or dam3ging the KGB. It is further 
questionable how CHEREPA.~OV W3S able to steal drafts destined 
for destruction which are dated August 1958, March 1959, and so 
on, if he h.sd not acquired his motivation of bitterness against 
the KGB until 1961, as ir.dic~ted by NOSENKO and other sources. 
It is also possible to gucs~ion nu«,erous other aspects of the 
CHEREfhHOV case, some datir.g fro~ the earliest known history of 
the man and others nore recent. This see:us unnecessary in view 
of the analysi~ of the WINTERS aocwnent and the LANGELL~ summary. 
lt follows that the CHEREP;.NOV incider.t was a·provocative 
plan of the KGB. UOSE'.NKO's story about CHE.RE?A!lOV, a mutually 
confirming source on KGB affair3, must be interprete1 as an 
indication that he has deliberately lieu in reporting on the 
CIIEREPhNOV case and his part in the invci.tigation, now shown 
to have been spurious. He has also lied in attesting to the 
validity of the Cll:.REPAtmV documents and thereby to the validity 
of his own information on the same topics which those documents 
also covered.
