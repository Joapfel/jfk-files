and its eql:ipr:,,:rnt, 5uch as description~ (manufacturer, type, model} of trans­
mitter, receiver, ar.tenna type and power, frcqu~ncies and frequency ran,Je, reli­
ability of CYJuipment, nornal a:id c.rnerJ•~n::y po~·,er sources, rennte pick-up arrange­
nents~ etc. He str:':!ssed of course that none of these topics should be introduced 
int-:> the questionnaire unless Mr~ Butler \,;as convinced of their suitability for 
hi; immediate purpose as well as for the long-tenn propa9anda aim of his organi­
zation. He stated that our su:;<Jestions were entireiy proper and. in his opinion, 
were reasonable requests that would not arouse the stat ion mana9er's curiosity. 
We pointed out to Hr. 13utler that. while infonnation(about key personnel and 
their p01itical orientation-;1about the station's adninistrative policies, etc., 
was of prime importance to u~, these s•Jbjects obviously could not be introduced 
into the questionnaire. He agreed that It \·;oul<!__be be~r to~l_!cit such infor-
• mat ion in another manner, as he had done ,-.1ith'~r. Miqueo..;Narancio';'t'but because . 
of his very heavy res pons ibi 1 it ies, he did not hav~nme-to-deve-fop similar •• 
sources of information in each of the other 15 countries. 
4. It occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by 
suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision 
of the questicnnaire. He shall appreciate ½hatcver help you can give us in this 
re-Jard. 
5. In the meantime, as soon as a11 of Hr. Butler's current correspondence 
h.:;s been properly fi Jed, He expect t,:, extr.:1ct the uppro~riate information from 
the folders and to present the material in a s,::,ries of i)O-B rep;)rts.
