~aybe we went to report .to KOVSHtrJC 
maybe KO\"SHUK was. ,writing in 
room. I don't remember. 
NOSEXKO then described the purpose of tbe aeeting:: To dis­
cuss the possibility of releksing monitor positions from 
some of the chancery cicrophones and of assi~nin 6 these re-
- leased positions __ to Vladimir_[.patronymic unkn.o.wr.J PETROV, ____ _ 
Chief of the American Department's section for work against 
Al!lerican tourists and delegates suspected of being con-
nected with American lntel!igence; PETRO\' had earlier re-
quested Engli,,;h-language _1r.on1tor1n6 positions from the :chief 
of the Ent{lish-Language Section of the OTIJ's Second Special 
D~partment but had been told that all such interpreters were 
already engaged on priority urbrts. At the ucetir.g KO\'SHUK 
a1:d KLYPIN reviewP-d the microphone covere~e of the chancery 
to decide which rooms offered information of little value 
and which monitoring p_ositi ons c~ulJ · be released to PETROV. 
KO\'SHUK drew up a· list -of t.he Embassy offices and· a·partoents 
then boing cover~d on a full~ti~c basis and indicated those 
of lesser i1:1portance. At the end of the neeting, KO\'SHUK 
gave the list to NOSE~KO, who retained it in !!is safe until 
bringing it to CIA in 1964. JOSESKO has added nothing fur-
ther on the locations of ,iicrophones in the chancery building, 
and much of his information concerning the quality and v::ilue 
of the production by these microphones ca~e from this 
meeting. 
Since his defection, NOSt~K0 has spoken further on his 
responsibilities in coonection wit~ the daily transcripts 
received from thf°' Sec:o.nd SpP.cial !Jepart::ient. He said on 
14 May 1964: "All the matt,rials Jfter tl:.cy were read and 
signed were re-turned to the Second(Spcciall Depart:ncnt of the 
Operational T,·chnical Directorate. Sollie of the material froa 
this was put in the individual filP., but anyone w~o read 
it would never know where it came from. He wouldn't know 
that it came from mikes .... KOVSHUK and I read all of this. 
From this .we gave information to those w!.o needed it, de­
pending on their interest. If there was somethir.g inter-· 
. esting·, it was given to KLYPl~ to read. If KLYPIN saw 
something interesting he could take it :and give it to.GRI­
BANOV. Tatyana GRISlL','YAT [ from the _Second Special Departm~ntJ 
came by car with this .material. She went to KLYPIN. Some­
times she left them with me." 
A protocol signed by NOSE~1!:0 in 1965 states: "One of' 
my duties as Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department, 
Second Chief Directorate, was to receive, review, and give 
to appropriate case officers the production from microphones• 
in the American Embassy on a daily basis.' I also maintained 
the control book (journ~l) for these transcripts. These 
.transcripts were prepared by the Operational Technical Direc-
