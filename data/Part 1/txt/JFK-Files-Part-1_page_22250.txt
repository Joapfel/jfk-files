ilarities which may not be coir.cidental. 
_ NOSENKO ( 11 J~e 1962; see ?age 260): "We are listening 
to your Hilit.:iry J.>;taches there. We kr.o·,.. where the}• i:ltend 
to travel, -..hat tt.l!-y -ant to f ir.d o·~t. We know what machin­

they say are surpr 1s1ng. The~• discuss, among other things, 
where to go, -.hat o;o see, what to take with them - electric 
equipment or not. Ar.d we are hunting for this electronic 
equipment and now have permis&ion, if we. are absolutely cer­
tain that one of 1our people is c.a~i~g electronic apparatus

steps to steal it. Aeca~se your.ow have improved your equip­

are being monitore1 by the KGB ••• The 'flap' involving the

the sumner of 19~S ·..-as organized :J"l the KGB because conver­

As you know, as a result of this flap, the KG9 seized valu­
able direction-fir..dlng equiprr.ent from the >.merican Intelli­

It is possible that both NOSD.'X.O and the sensitive source were 
reporting a well-knn-.m event, because GOLITSYN reported in 
1962 that the 19~5 Stalingrad incident was written up in KGB 
training materials b~ an example of Second Chief Directorate 
work. The training version may have included the role of the 
microphone information (although GOLITS\~ did not report that 
it did), which moy thus have C.:l.'""le naturally to the attention 
of NOSENKO and thft P-~nsitive source. H~wever, this would call 
into question N0S1?.llY.O's allegation of direct access to all of 
the microphone product. •
