1. Wo approciato rcccivinc the intrJl'lll.'.1tion on tho two Albanian

waa forwarded in reference. 
2. We have now received a rlf;,Clrt from tho field which indicates 
thlt.t Koste Xh&Jank4 is coMected with tho Albanian Lcsation in Paris • 
.). We 1t0uld like very much to lmaw the bnckr,round ot this man's 
accoptance at tho Free Europe Univereity, includinr, now and where his 
application was madcJ whether l"Aie acc<:r,tanco was on the basis ot hio 
scholastic record ale no or on th£: bacis of recollllllcnda ti onB J if tne 
latttr, whose; and an:, other detoila available. It would be appreciated 
it you could inquire into this mattE:r !or ua. • 
L. Since requesting that favorable oonsideration be given to 
tne application ot Ramis Qira, we have received a roport which in­
dicatte th:,t he too has been connf;cted with' tho Aloonian rs. It is 
requeotod that steps be taken to en:sure that his application be dio­
approvoo. 
$. It has also been reported that a JCale111 Oolemi, also covertl,Y 
f'.mployed by the Albani.An Legation in Paris, has applioo tor ad:nission 
to the Free Europo University. 
6. All of these reports ar,pear to indicate that an eftort is 
being made by the Albanian Governcient to place their agents in the 
Free Europe Univt'rsity. It this is true, no doubt other satellite 
countrie:i will follow the B&J:le policy. It is Sllt"'.t:ested th...t the 
authorities of Free Europe Univercity be warned and advised to screen 
carefUl.l.y the students being admitted and to re!wie adclssion to 
people about whom there is any question.
