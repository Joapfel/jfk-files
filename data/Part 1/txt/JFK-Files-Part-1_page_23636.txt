MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, BRANCH III 
SUBJECTz HUMANOID 
1. Attached hereto is a letter received from HUMANOID by Jlr. 
Edward A. Yarelius, now at Headquarters and the former Cnief of Station 
at Costa Rica, ilho recruited HUMANOID. 
2. Particular reference is ciade to Paragraph 6 regarding .a change 
in assignment.· Ur. Marelius thinks that vrlli!n subject finishes his 
school year in 1953 he should be brought to Headquarters for training, 
and that .be should be convert.ea to Starr Agent for possible reassign­
ment in Latin America under deep cover. Ur. Marelius thinks that 
HUMANOID will go stale in San Jose and that a change should be made to 
better utilize his services. Although subject is the principal. source 
•. in Costa Rica, he feels that arrangements could be made for an o~rly 
tum-over an_d departure., 
3. Uhile I was assigned in Pa.'1ama I i:iet subject, at Which time 
be was contemplating moving to Panama, attending tne University, and· 
working for the Panama. station. He impressed me very well: and would 
h·ave: been quite an asset I but the deal . fetl. through due to the nigher 
cost of living in Panama and the fact that he would lose considerable 
credits in t.ransferring. 
4~ I do not know whether it. can be worked out. but I certainl,y 
110uld go along with recommending that he be afforded training in the 
u.s. and that he be reassigned, preferably to Argentina or-one of tbe 
ot.her countries where~{s ~gent.Ji need9fa for additional. unofficiaJ. 
cover. Tba question of bis"converting to Start Agent might be worked 
. out also.
