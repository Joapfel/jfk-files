Yes •. 
M,~t sort of casP officer questions were you 
answering? 
All kinds. If I cnuldn' t nnswer them, if tty 
authority isn't enough for this, it is necessary 
to discuss them with KO\'SHIIK. I wn., dis-cussing 
with KOVSHUK, with KLYPIN, with [KLYPIN's suc­
cessor as Chief 6f the American Uepart~cnt, 
S.M.J FEDOSEYEV. ~everal tines, not once, wo 
were discussing qucstiuns with GnID~NOV. Also, 
co:1ccr11 ing measures, concerning future steps. 
When it was nccossnry. 
What oth<"r duties did you havt.! as n supervisor? 
I told you. When it v:as necC"s£nry I was g-oing 
to agent rncctin~s with case officers. ~hen it 
was necessary. Or, bc!siur.::., I 1:1et p0rson::i.llv 
with "PROKHOR" [PREISFREUXDj or -~~~~,:.,..~~ 
"PROKHOH" was working a~ninst sTonscr-;n:.,, "S.t,rm!,R'' 
against ZUJ~S. I was workinR myself with 1hem. 
You personally worked agents "PP.OKIIOR" and "SARD.~R"? 
,,.hen did you find it necessary to go to an agent 
me~ting with a case officer? 
Well, for cx1u11plc, DEMKIN would come to me and 
sa)·: "You k1~ow Blla [ mtANF:i'S, :rn agent in 
America House J. Ella f.aid that !i!ORO~E had looked 
at her n.ud was smiling." This is just an [hypo­
thetlcalJ exaruple .... Okay, I am going with him, 
~earing Ella myself,. [to learn! whnt happened, 
Lwhether) it is possible to make something or not. 
You met Ella and talked with her? 
Yes, with DEMKIN. Very, very difficult to say, 
why and how we arc going. When it was necessary 
to go. 
As a rule did you try to make it a practice to 
visit the agents of the section who were working 
against the American target? 
Yes, I am tel'J,ing you. There was. such an '&gent, 
Inga [VARLA:JOVA). GRYAZNO\r was meeting with her. 
It might be necessary to go to meet her. But, we 
knew how Inga was afraid of intelligence. And,
