not want to lose coropleto touch wtth hJm, but for now he should

. 3. As for GERENDl~•s wife·,. Lih'MPTY~l9, she also appeared to 
'::. _b,e_g1·ateful for the ter,nination bonus which she hnd been granted 
(.lnd which she was told had not been carved out of what was due 
G.r:Rr~D~). On the other haQd-;-s'he has less reason to bo !oyal to 
J'KLANCE, and !1er mental stability iF- somewhat ope&1 to q1~e·st1on. 
Ther.-fore, she poses·a greater threat to LIEMPTY security thRn 
d Ut!~ G,;Ri::h1>E. ,H the same ! ime, she Jmows rnuch less about Stat ion 
operations anrt personnel than does GlillENDE. :f'urthermore, it is 
not liksly that she would (a la Mrs. LlllOCK.1:."T-1) go directly to 
the MIIIJARSHers with her information. What she might do is reveal 
tr, l:er lnwyt!r llml Gr:Rr;zm~ iiad worketl f~r L~IPUIU:: nnd therefore h::i.d 
incor,o to which she might Joel that. she i'J entitle,t. Slnce 
GE~ENDK ls no lo~g~r emrloyed and therefore no longer has regular 
• incomt! (except !or monthly payments of the ter:n.tnation bonus, 
which she ha3 agreed in writing not to claim), this threat has 
also been lessened. Theorotically, however, she could expose 
LIEMPTY nnd LIFJ::.-\T tflc!mlques (since she h::1s been !l LIF.~/\T trand<:riber), 
but she could not, ns Jar as we kn~w, expose any currently e~ployed 
agents, with th~ t.>Xception of L1EAfi-1TY-4, who is married to G:•;1rnNDE's 
sister. (Ncn•1 of tho ab•Jvc assessn,.,ul vr the possibl(' security 
threat pm;cd by Ll.t;.\1PTY-l~ is chani~ed by her 8 July visit to 
JKL..\NCI~ Headquarters.) -·
