The I.Em:ovs left Mexico permanently on 22 December 1968, 
and returned to the msa. 
LEONOV, during his years in Mexico, showed himself 
to be a capable, hard-working intelligence officer, who 
was able to fulfill his cover job with skill and at the 
aarae • time pursue hia clandestine missions. It may be 
presumed, on the basis of his capacities demonstrated 
in 14exic->, that he will have worked effectivel,. in his 
apparent taolt of setting up tbs Novosti news agency in 
Peru, and that he will also have begun to develop contacts 
among the Peruvian Communist Party and other sympathetic 
elements with an eye to spotting And assessing pr~spective 
agentlil for subsequent exploitntion by tho KGB reszidentura 
which will inevitably function as a part of the new Soviet 
Embassy.
