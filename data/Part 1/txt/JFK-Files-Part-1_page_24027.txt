One or the most violent reactions came from th'! hP.~1rt­
land of capitalism, from the small Amer1cC10 !:tel.ion wh1c:1 rr~­
duces the monthly Hammer &: Steel lfowsletter in Boston. 'ii1~ 
October issue of the m111:eographed bulletin venr;efully gives •• 
list o~ eight reasons why Khrushchev fell - ftach one a vin­
dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush­
chev but basic Soviet policies such as •the distortion of 
peaceful coexistence.• Points ·2, 3 and 8 will serve as illua­
trationes 
~. 'His German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate 
hin:self with West Germany. He was obviously ready 
to sell out the German Democratic Republic •.. 
J. The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social­
ist countries and the Communist Parties. The pro­
posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference 
of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve 
U.S. imperialist aggression against the national lib­
eration struggles. For example, Asian supporters of 
Khrushchev could have gathered in a telephone booth. 
8. The nuclear success ot People's China. Khrushchev 
~ • 'had maintained that nuclear power was the exclusive 
responsibility of revisionists and imperialists -
of white nations. Khrushchev's great power chauvin­
ism•was blown sky high in Sinkiang Province. 
Although there is no evidence that the politically insig­
nificant Hammer&: Steel group enjoys any direct support from 
the Chinese (as the Russians alleged in their •open Letter• 
of July 14, 1963), it has always off!re~ its allegiance_to __ 
Peking in the most extreme form. This is expressed aga1c ..... 
the claim that "Khrushchev's failure to re~ogni~e ~he coutra­
diction between the oppressed peoples and.1m~e~1al.is~ as ~he 
focal contradiction of our time resulted in8b11~dness con~ern­
i the leadi r6le of the Chinese Part." Tnis is a ~ta~~ 
that the hinese themselves would not want to make, expe a~ Y 
at this ~uncture. ,:
