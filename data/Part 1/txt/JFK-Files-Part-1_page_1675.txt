Mr. David L. Chris·t is recommended for the Intelligence Medal 
of Merit in recognition of his career of especially meritorious s~rvice 
which has contributed significantly to the missions of CIA. 
Mr. Christ joined CIA in November of 1950 as the first research 
and development electronics engineer in what has evolved as TSD. He 
created an Applied Physics Branch setting high standards for himself 
and the R&D engineers he recruited. His accomplishments included the 
anti-disturbance mine and the time pencil, both of which are still 
Agency stock ite~, and an iR beacon. As a pioneer in audio surveillance 
devi~es, he recognized very early that the use of systems concept 
would be most productive in meeting Agency needs. As part of his 
development program, his efforts led to the establishment of _specialized 
contract facilities such as ~ird Atomis,which in 1953 was the first 
Agency source of transistorized equipment.G~ 
In early 1957, Mr. Christ was made Chief of what is now the Audio 
Operations Branch of TSD and, realizing that a drastic upgrading of 
the caliber of field technicians was required, began aggressively re­
~ruiting and training graduate engineers. His.high standards and 
efforts in this area are reflected in the fact that the majority of 
TSD Audio mid-management personnel were recruited by him. In September 
1960, he and two associates were apprehended while on an operation in
