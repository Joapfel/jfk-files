receive necessary forms. NOSENKO stated that he heard 
noti1ing further until after Stalin's funeral, w:1en i.1e was 
summoned to KOBULOV's office and afterwards assigned to 
the Second Chief 0irectorate. 
During the July 1965 interrogations NOSENKO retracted 
his earlier claim that KOBULOV and his father had been close 
personal friends. He stated that his father's relationship 
with KOBULOV was not personal, and that KOBULOV had never 
visited the NOSENKOs. 
In a biographic·statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO 
· said that he had met KOBULOV but twice, once on 1 January 
1953 at the latter's dacha, and the second and last time in 
the elder NOSENKO's office as NOSENKO's father and KOBULOV 
w~re departing to attend Stalin's funeral. On that latter 
occasion, NOSENKO claimed, KOBULOV promised to concern nim­
.self wi ti1 NOSENKO' s entry into the KGB and it was several 
days later that NOSENKO was summoned to KOBULOV's office· 
and told i1e was appointe~ to the KGB. 
Comment: General. Bogqan Zakharovich KOBULOV was a career 
security official·, but from :the immediate· post­
war period until after Stalin's death he was 
not assigned to KGB Headquarters. Asof 1952, 
.he was posted to Germany with the Chief 
Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad, then 
directly subordinate not to the MVD but to the 
Council of Ministers and latterly to the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade. Until he returned 
from Germany in March 1953 to assume the 
position of Beriya's deputy, he had no office 
in KGB Headquarters. KOBULOV was arrested 
with· Beriya in: June 1953 ~ • and also later e.xecuted·. 
In light of the foregoing, it is·irnprobable 
that KOBULOV was instrumental in NOSENKO's 
appointment to the KGB at the times NOSENKO 
claimed. If. KOBULOV ever interceded in 
NOSENKO's behalf, it is probable that NOSENKO 
would later have been purged after KOBULOV's
