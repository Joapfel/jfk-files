;-7 So 
In my opinion, David Murphy ha~ done an outstanding job 
during the period covered by this report. 
I arrived to take up my duties as DCM in this Embassy 
.1.n December 1971. llowcver, since that time I have served 
ilS Charge on a number of occasions and while, when the 
J\mbassador was present, the Ambassador preferred to deal directly 
with Mr. Murphyiand, as a result I had only collateral dealings 
with him, I feel I had more than ample opportunity to observe 
his performance :and evaluate it. I can ::iay without hesitation 
wh<ltaocvcr that ·.he performed in a ::iupcrb manner during a 
p;,rticubrly"dif°(icult period, lie deserves top m;:irlrn not only 
fo1· hiR 01,m pcrforniancl"! but fo1· the nii'inncr in 1,;h.i.ch he d.i.rcctcd
