13, Offices-of Council (Consejo Revolucionario) 
When questioned about his business ·and private telephones, 
MIRO said, "The business phone· is also in my house, I have no office

14;; MlRO's Views on Coordinating the Activities of Other Exile 
Groups 
After Dr, ~RO reiterated his view that he should be the 
channel for funds and coordinating the activities of groups outside the 
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), etc,, I said that I under­
stood that some of these elements were unwilling to function under the· 
Consejo; and that in vie_w of that situation, did he consider that an 
Activity Committee might be organized with a delegate from each of 
these groups and under·the chairmanship of a member of the Consejo, 
This .would serve to coordinate their activities, give them a tie-in with 
the Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it, Dr, MlRO replied 
that this would merely "!et up another Consejo outside of and parallel to 
the existing Consejo, I: did not pursue this further, not having enough 
background of these organizations to be able to discuss the matter 
effectively.
