The previous inc_umbent completed his assignment at this post and 
9epartcd on June 29, 1972. During the period under review he continue, 
to perform in a highly creditable manner, working well with other 
members of the Embassy sta·ff and handling the affairs of his agency 
in a most professional, efficient and effective manner. 
In my last evaiuation [ stated that both the Agency.and_ t~e Embassy 
were fortunate to have a man of the rated officer's abili·ties and 
qualities as CAS Chief at this important post. I am happy to say 
that his performance throughout his assignment here reinforced that 
Ill. view.
