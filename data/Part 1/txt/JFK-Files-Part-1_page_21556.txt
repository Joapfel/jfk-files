The knowledge o! NOSEJ:l.'1{0· concerning cases, K<;:iB operations, 
and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department 
arid position assignment during the 1953 'to January 1964 period. The 
scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto 
is broader ·after 1957 than before, which is com!)atible with his cla.im of 
·increa.seq responsibilities. His knowledge o! the work of other depar~e·nts 
of.the.SCD from the late 1950!s .on is also more-extensive, which is also a:. 
further indication that NOSENKO actually held: the claimed positions 
during this ,period o! time.
