From the time of his first meetings with CIA in.i962, NOSENKO 
maintained that he had a close ·personal and ?rOf£·fsional relation­
ship with Major. General O.M. GRIBA!:ov, Chief of t:.~ ~econd Chief·. 
Dir~ct6rate. NOSENKO has-described recruitment approache~ iq_which 
he and CRIBJJ,OV took part together, conversations they had 6n opera­
tional matters, the_ role which GRIBJ\."IOV played i:1 his rank promo­
tions and recei?t of various awards, and his afterhours carousing 
with GRIBANOV and First Chief Dir~ctorate cc~ntcrinte~ligence 
officer Ye.A. 'rARABHIN. ~OSENKO r:as also frecp:ently me:1tio:-.ed the 
role which GRII3l~mv played in his, ?lOSENKO' s, rnofessional advance­
rr,ent within th':? KGB: GRIBANOV was wholly respcnsible, against 
NOS·E~KO's wishes, for his a?point!:1ent to the p-~s:tio!"l of Deputy 
Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section of t!1e American Department in 
January 1960; later, ,;hen NOSE?:Ko rejected his offer to make him 
Deputy Chief of the entire Arneric..-rn r,,2p<artrner.t, G:i.!BANOV arranged 
his return to the Tourist Departr,,.ent as Chief of the ·American 
Tourist Sectic~ and his later appointment as Dep~t~ Chief of the 
Tourist Department. 
NOSE:,l<o's remarks concernir.g his direct involvement with 
GRIBANOV in operations against Arn~ricans are.incl~dcd in other 
parts of this paper. l.mong lhera are his early.statements on the 
approach to code clerk James STORSSERG (Part \'.E.3.c.), his 1~62 
a£££.::!_1!t of the c1rrest. and~ei::pt to ~~-~u_!._LG._I_~ _ _cfficer Rus~~-H 
LANGELLE (Part VI.D.7.a.), ana·fils early reports on the atte~pt to 
r~fficer -Edward Ellis S~I'i'1i (Part VI. D. 2.). In all 
t;hree cases UOSEr:Ko subsequently dc;-iied having played the role he 
originally attributed to himself a~c denied having had personal 
contact wit:h the Anericans inv-:>lved. NOSENKO has also altered his 
original accounts to say that he received no aw~~cs or decoration 
for operational activity and that he had not re~eived the promo- . 
tions he claimed. • 
b. Details 
The statements of rmsENKO given below concern primarily his 
~rsonal relationship with GRIBA?JOV and how GRI9,A!lOV assisted 
his rapid rise within the organization of the S~cond"Chief Direc-. 
torate. 
12 June 1962: •01eg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV-is a great guy. 
A real pal. We, so to say, used to r.~et one another illegally 
and had women together ... ·cRIBA.~OV wrote a fitness report on 
me. It was the very best that can be given, brilliant. GRIBANOV 
wrote the very best fitness report on me. He .had an e_xcellent 
regard for me~ excellent... I am supposed to bE-ccrne Deputy Chief 
of [the Tourist] Department. I believe that GRIB~'iOV is proir.ot­
ing young people, new people, who already have experience, good 
experience, who have made re·crui tments. . I. know t._o or th-ree -·[of 
the people he is moving ahead]. ·r personally have about 12 re­
cruitments, four-or -five of them were British and the·rest Ameri­
cana. He [GR~BANOV) has l"lis eye on me in particular, an~ the_ 
question•: of my -advancement is right now uncter consideration .. ~ I 
will be Deputy Chief of Dep-'\rtment. You must· give th~ugb~ to ~e
