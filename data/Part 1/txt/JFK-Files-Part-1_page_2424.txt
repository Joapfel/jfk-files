1951 to early 1953 both in the Far East and the Baltic area is fully 
acceptable. It is not considered necessary to comment concerning all 
of the remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval 
RU service of NOSENKO as reflected on pages 49-59- and remarks will, 
for purposes of brevity, be limited in scop_e. 
The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole 
Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chief, 
Colonel KALOSHIN. He identified no ranking officers in either'the Baltic 
or Far East Intelligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identify, 
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU service, 
but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow, or through his visits 
to Geneva.": 
Attached is a copy of a handwritten memorandum voluntarily 
prepared by NOSENKO in late 1967 containing the names of a number 
of GRU personnel of whom he had some knowledge. The attached was 
not prepared as the result of any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval 
RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by 
NOSENKO at this time. The entire material included remarks by 
NOSENKO regarding approximat~ly[ff5)KGB officers, !l.OO)KGB agents, 
35 GRU officers and'.400~ other Soviet nationals.
