anything about fELCllLIN"a backgro~nd, presa:1:ably well docu­
mented by the KGB bcci"!uae FELCH!..I!; had bee:1 to tt.e t;SSR in 
two different capacities, merchant sea~an and diplo~atic 
courier, prior to arriving in l".oscow as t!"le >.ssistant Army 
Attache: also FELCHLIN had ha1 rrior official association 
with GRU officers in Austria, Gerr.iany, and the United States, 
and he continued to be ir, liaison with one of them in Mosco·-,. 
N0SE'lK0 could recall nothing about FELCIILI~'s intelligence 
activities in the USSR or hia trips about the country, or 
what had been done at.out them by the KGB. In sp~aking of 
~·[LCHLIN's expulsion from the Soviet t:nion, N0SEl,K0 re~o:-ted 
the KGB file noted that FELOILIN had been caught ta~ing 
photographs on some occ3sion, but he did not know that f[~­
CHLIN in June 1954 was arrested in Kiev with another A~~ist-
ant Army Attacne, F.J. YEAGER. (Erron~ously identified by 
N0SENK0 as an Air Force Attac~e, YEAGER likewise should have 
been NCSE~K0's large:.) N0SES~0 also did not know that 
FELCHLI~, with another Army Atta~n~ and two Air.Force Attaches, 
in September 1953 had ~ade an ~~precedented train trip through­
out Siberia and that six months later, at the end of Mar~h 
1954, had been the su.'">ject of a r.cwspapcr article 1,,hich 
charged tt-.at thf!y had lost "spy docw::ents• on the train. 
N0SE~K0 ""as unable to r,rovide a c!.J.~.e fer rELCIILI~ 's expul-
sior. from the Soviet U:1io~, and ne ~new nothing of the un-
usual circ~~stanccs cf FELCHLih's cE>parture from Moscow; 
he insisted that nobody else was declared persona non 
1
rata 
alor.g with FELCHLI~l. In f.sct, FELCll~IN was expefle"cla ong 
wit!. Air Fore•.! :~aJor ·.;alttr M.:!\I~t.l::Y, and t.he Soviets re­
fused to permit the two to leave !-!o,;cow aboard the A.'t',bassa-
dor 's personal plane until ;.ml,a533dor B0HLS~ hi~self protested, 
Confronted by his lac~ of knowledge of the ?ersona non 
~ action, N0SE~KO saiJ that he could not b~ expected to 
~the details because this incident occurred after he 
transferred from the U.S. E~assy Sectio~ to the Tourist 
Department in June 1955. N0SENK0 was then told the recorded 
date of the expulsion, 3 July 1954, and he rrplied that this 
was not true. 
- Discrepancies appeared in NOSENKO's account of one 
of the best kncwn incidents in the history of KGB operations 
against the .Air,trican officials in the Soviet Union, the 
subject of reports by G·::>LITSYN and other CIA sources and the 
subject of training ~a~erials. This was the seizure of 
sensitive technical collectio:1 equipment on 5 ~a~t 1955 i-n 
/stalir,grad from three Assistant Military Att3ches from the 
U.S. Embassy--Major John S. oE~S0N, Captain STROUD, an? , 
Captain MULE--and their expulsion from the Soviet Union two 
days later. N0SENK0 claimed direct responsibility for KGB 
work against th~se officers (Pages 103-105); he described 
an earlier attempt to defect MULE, his own plans for seizing 
this equipment at a railroac station outside Moscow, and his 
role in developing plans for the successful operation in 
Stalingrad.·· When ~0SENl<0 was pressed under interrogation to 
g·ive the entire stor}· of the equipment seizure_,,and the aersona 
non grhta action, he said that the operation was carrie out 
after e was in the Tourist Depart.mant and therefore he knew 
no more about it. ~hen told that the operation took place 
at. least a month before his alleged tra~sfer, N0SENK0 could 
offer no explanation for his lack of knowledge.
