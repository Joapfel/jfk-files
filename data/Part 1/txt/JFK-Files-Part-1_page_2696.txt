(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960) 
Soviet Homosexual Agents 
The KGB operations which NOSENKO described cornrnonly 
involved sexual entrapment. Many of the operations in 
which he claimed a personal role involved the use of homo­
sexual agents, KGB agents whose homosexuality was exploited 
against susceptible male targets. ~hile NOSENtO was never 
their official case officer, in specific recruitment­
entrapment operations he worked with "LUCH", "NIKOLAYEV",. 
"SIB~AK", "KOSHII<IN" and "STROYEV" (Victor BELANOVSKIY, / 
used in the compromise of\Richard BURGB, VASSALL, and th~ Ob 
Canadian Ambassador l•7ATKirtS) . He provided virtually no 
personality information on them and usually could not recall 
their true names. Two such homosexuals, ·however, VOLI<OV 
and YEFREMOV, NOSENKO claimed were his own agents. 
NOS EN Im claimed to have re-recruited VOLI~OV, a former 
agent (cryptonym "SHMELEV") and recruited YEFREMOV 
(cryptonym "GRIGORIY") and to have been their sole case 
officer from the beginning of their KGB careers in 1957-
1958 until they were discharged in 1963 because they had 
become too well known. He said he met them frequently, 
and directed them in' at least a dozen e~trapment operations 
or other homosexual .encounters. NOSENKO claimed he took 
them with him when he transferred to the American Department 
in 1960 and back again in early 1962 to the Seventh 
Department. 
YEFREMOV and VOLKOV 
Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a 
public toilet in Moscow, NOSENKO said,. the KGB concluded. 
that A.I. VOLKov-might be a homosexual and hence of so~e 
operational value. To verify this possibility in 1957, a 
homosexual agent of the Moscow Criminal Investigations 
Department provoked VOLKOV into a compromising situation. 
The.n VOLKOV, who had previously been a KGB agent but was 
at this time inactive, was summoned by the KGB and, after 
NOSENI<O interrogated him, he admitted his homosexuality and 
agreed to NOSENKO's proposal to work for the KGB among
