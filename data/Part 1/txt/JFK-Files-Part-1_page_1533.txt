2. By 5 July 1956, th~ fourth flight, the USSR was aware 
of the purpose of the n.i3sions and were taking counter action. 
One positive action was the stand.down of civil flights while th~ 
mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a secona action which is 
believed related is the moving o-r·MIG-19 aircraft into East 
Ger::tl3.!1Y and Poland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19 's vere :coved 
into Hungary at about this time. 
3. The pe·rro.m-ance of' the Soviet system on the 5 J"U}_y- mis~on, 
2014, wa.s indeed curious. 'While the action evident :f'ra:!!(SOMINT fZ.lj 
is no-: clee.r an explanation :which appears to fit the known :facts 
is cffered as f'ollowS: As a. result or the prev.ious missions, the 
Soviets had. concluded the essential facts concern.i:lg the missiJlllS, ·2q 
i.e., that they were :ror reco:w:ia.issa.nce, that. the--.r flew above (§5 ;ooo) 
feet, and tha.t a. penetration as deep as Uoscov -was :possible. They­
probably surmised t.~t the 5 July mission was headed. :for Moscow when 
the track appeared on a nort..lieastarly heading. Tb.e loss o~ the , 
target when it entered Soviet terri tor.r was probably deliberate and. 
the ''rec!. herring" track returning to the west was either a dodge 
or a convenience t~ avoid broadcasting a track for all the syste!lt 
to see that a 'b.ostile or int:r-uder" wa.s coming over Moscow 'iTi th no 
:!:leans available to stop it. Tnis idea. is supported by the. use 
cf a raid nu:;;fber assigned. in the regio:::i just beyo:::?.d. fue point 
·wncre the track had been ''lost". In ad.di tion, the track ;,--as not 
labeled "hostile or intruder" when it was bro;:i.dcast a.i'ter it 
b..ad passed beyond Moscow. The reporting of the track when it _did 
?.ppea:>:' was only by Moscov and 4. t has be~n suggested that other 
stations had been instructed not to broad.cast the track. Further, it ~'3.Y 
o.:t rray not be a coincidence tha.t the height bread.cast "..ra.s alnost 
exactly hall of the true altitude of the mission aircraft, but on 
t~e n,~xt mssions, four days later, the altitude reporting -was 
~on;;istently above--50,000 feeto 
·4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evid.en.t recognitio::i of 
the great heig.l:i.t of the mission flights, traclr..ing -.,-as better and 
in general the perform.a.nee of the warning system was much iraproved.

5. The next d.2.y_. 10 July 1956, the Soviet air de:f'ense wa_--rnin0J 
cortfusion or track loss. Altitude reporting -was over tO~OOO feet -, 
l_::-th one :plot passed 68,800 v:uch was ,,only 100 fe~t off target. _ 
6. _The f'irst eight m:i.ssions proved that the air d.e:fense T.ra.rning 
syst~n is deployed in depth.. This wa.s evident frcm both the continuity 1 
of' tre.ck and. most forcef'ully from the ELDf.r da.ta. collected. Some 1461 / 
il:rtercepts of Soviet Bloc radars operating in the 3000 ~c/s band were 
o'ot.'J..ined. by project ELIIl':i: as follows: T'OK&"T-1331, WB.1..c'L''-37, GAGE-26,
