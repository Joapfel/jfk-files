4. In summary, the SSU joins those who feel that this 
book would better have been left unwritten. It is a text 
replete with names, details, operational information and 
close personal privileged information based upon the author's 
assignments which has been rendered into a commercial version 
of Mr. Phillips' ·affiliation with this agency for over 25 
years. This manuscript reinforces the difficulty of a retired 
operations officer to develop a non-fiction text which is 
attractive to the public but does not contain information 
regarding intelligence personalities, organization and sources 
and methods.
