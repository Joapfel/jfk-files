1. Being fonterded USC are copies of the QJlP'HONE/1 training 
report, the .TmlliIWM evaluation, contact reports of meetings witb 
QRPHONE/1, a WOGKAR review of QRPBOHB/l's book and some notes made 
by tbe STFLIMFLAII Headquarters officer, Harve7 8. DAITCID4AH (IDEN), 
after bis meeting& witb QRPBOH'E/1. Tbese are for tbe information 
of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give 
you both the flavor of tbe variety of measures taken to assess tbe 
operational potential of QRPBOH&/1. 
2. During PAUPEROS' TDY at Headquarters 1re discussed tbe 
necessity of baving QRPHONE/1 undergo an intensive seven day 
STFLIMFLAH training prograa to be conducted by DAITCBM.AH. It is 
our opinion that in order for this training to be of maximum 
benefit, QRPaONE/1 and DAI'l'CHlv.li ought to be ensconced in a 
safebouee facility which provides security, comfort and ao 
atmosphere conducive to learuiDg. It is important that tho 
training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONB to give 
bis full attention vithout being disturbed by bis multitude of 
business and social contacts. Therefore,~ recoWDenv that LCPIPIT 
rent a cottage or beach house away from London for the duration of 
the training cycle. In discussing this with QRPRONE, be readily 
agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in gotting 
away 1rom bis family for aa long as we thought necessary. Ee
