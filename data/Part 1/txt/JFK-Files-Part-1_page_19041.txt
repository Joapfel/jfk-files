For the major parties, the· 
NPD's su9c0Ases had disturbing 
implications. In .:cntrast to -its 
various predecessors, the NPD 
appoared capable of ~obilizing 
urbari as well as ru:al support 
and of altering the general trend 
long evident_ in most West German 
elections toward a t~o-party 
system. In Jlegse, t.he combined 
vote of the Christian Democrats 
-~~d Socialists w3s a lower per­
·centage of the total vot~ than in 
the pro~ioua election four years 
earlier. Still more significantly, 
however, Ue96e and Bavaria"pr~­

Basic Characteristics and 
Sourc~s of sc~~v=t 
In spite of its direct 
lineage from the old ~erman 
Reich Paity, the NPD has tried 
to dispel the impression among 
tho general pubiic that it is the 
spiritual he,ir of Hitler's Na- i 
tional Socialists~ The·~arty _has 
sought acceptance as a. legitit.iate 
·political patty and insists that 
it intends to function within the 
established democratic order. 
Party spokesmen maintain that it 
differs i•rom the established par-' 
ties primarily in its allegedly 
-superior devotion to the national 
inter~st, which they accuse the 
governing parties in Bonn of 
having failed to protect. ~he 
NPD says it offers the voter a 
genuine choice between bankrupt 
policies of the major parties and 
a- return to national morality. 
As much as some NPD support­
ers might wish to play do~n the 
party's Nazi associations, how­
ever, it has been clearly estab­
lished that the leadership con­
sists of a nucleus of former 
Nazis. who i1ave been active in 
neo-Nazi parties throughout the 
postwar years~ According to 
police reports, some 2,000 of 
the estimated 25,000 members cf 
the :lPD belonged to the Nazi part~• 
before 1933. This ratio is roughly 
eight times that for the public 
as a whole. The party has lost 
libel suits in which it has chal­
lenged charges of nee-Nazism. 
The German Interior Ministry • 
notes the parallels in political 
outlook and philosophy between 
the NPD and the Nazis, and main­
tain~ that the party's activities 
"approach" unconstitutionality. 
In the words of one former party 
member, the NPD is made up of 
people "who have forgotten nothing 
and learned nothing" from Germany's 
past.
