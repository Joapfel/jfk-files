• .A:nerican Cont&doration vill be created. CLASC ll.lso wants to create Central 
A:no~ioan·Tra.nsport Federation and there vhere P1co 1s presence is requested. 
5. I asked Pico if his CL\.SC friends don•t'resent the tact th:i.t ho ~-orlcs tor FORDC. 
Ho aaid that this probl~ was solved once tor enr. CU.SC e~ecutivos know that 
o~ t\io principal_ i:arrents exist.Ii a!iiong tha Cuban ext.led laber s the batistiu 
a~ the revolutionaries. 'l'be &.tistianos are the Y..ujilistas of CTC aidod by ORI'? 
and ewe is against the Muj:i.llstas. They are in favor of the nvolution.aries all 
thcly aro in FORDC, vhich is the only roal.ly aotivo exile labor or6a.n1zatiorut. 
CLASC leaders knov·that FORDC is being supported b:, the US govermient, but they 
accept it as a neoessit1 and understand that it is inevitable as neither tho 
batistianos or th-, ooim:iunlote will support it and CLASC hu no twns to do so.

By no rneans I consider that Pico is an ideal JI.gent. He ~{~ht be influenced or awod 
by Huporo, Ho also is sor.iet.iroes impulsive and puts his foot in the mo•.1.th. On tho 
other hand he is I young, airessive, better educatod than average Cuban labor loadei 
lie is :i.ccepted in CIA.SC, his erganiution ORT is a bli me1J1ber and he will be the 
head of tha LAtin America.n Tr.u1sport Ferleration which vi.ll give him follo.d.ng 
advantages • a) voico and J votes at ewe Meet.ill&S b) can influence ewe doc.1.siozu 
c) will bring strong antioCastro and anti-coilllaunist influenoo d) will soften U? 
anti°'\t} out.bursts s) will nport_ to us, even it lire have to take his roliability mt 
a grain or salt. 
NOTE I I forget to call your attention to the curious little item 1n Pico•s repox 
Ho advises t.'lat the-Copoy,ne1s ga1nod the control or the Sindicato Portuarlo in
