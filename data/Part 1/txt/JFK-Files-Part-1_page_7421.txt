on the ma_tter, and that he was "reaching," but stat.cd that has he 
. reconstructs _the m:ltter: 
_ .. ,C He became, ?.wa~e that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplis°hing 
a. Gteacly flow o°f spy boo_ks,-· and that security approval was not being re­
quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers~ (He sta.ted • 
that this acti-•ity continued iater, ·as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and • 
~greed with idea that the volume of writings was sl:i,{f-icient to· indicate 
that a great of time was involved in Hnnt's writing.) Gen·. Gaynor advised 
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. The reaction 
he rccieved to his raising th·e issue w.:is that 11 1::ce>p your stinking nose oul: 
of this business." He stated th::i.!: he was lead to b~lfl"ve that Mr. Helms
