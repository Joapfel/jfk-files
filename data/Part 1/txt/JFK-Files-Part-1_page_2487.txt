NOSENKO, cl-..1ring cu:.·re;,.t interviews, has given an acceptable 
acco;;.nt o:f the [s-:ro~BERGj case. He ha.s stated t;iat he can;-.. ot precisely 
date the approach to ,STORSBERGi, b;;.t t:1.at it occ;;.rred before the 
approach at the Moscow airport to !Ja.mes KEYSE~Sj (June 16, 1961)

When recently reinterviewed,\ STORS::SERG)cor .. tin1::.ed to maintain 
that the approach occ-;;.rred in October 19& l, but the L--:.·~ernal e"idence in 
his desc:-iption oi coiiateral events r .. ,.akes it clear that the approach had • 
to have taken place co:.:..siderably .earlier. 
\Jos~ph MORONE) another code clerk at fo.e United States Embassy, 
who will b~ the subject of further disc~ssion below, has been ir..te::.:viewed 
on the basis of statements by(STORSBERG) that

,MORONE)was present in 
American House the night of the approach. Analysis of the state:me~ts 
0(1MORONE) clearly indicates that the events(STORSBER,G :describes 
could not have taker.. place later than the period Febr;;.ary to early May 
1961.
