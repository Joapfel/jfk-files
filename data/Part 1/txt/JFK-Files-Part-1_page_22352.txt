H. '-"·Alternative Explanations 
1. Introduction 
7S9. 
• ·parts VIII.B. through VIII.F. have discussed the 
inaccuracies, self-admitted contradictions, inconsistencies, 
and lncompleteness of l~OSESKO' s reporting about hi111sclf • and 
the J<GB. Collecti•,ely, these in:portant flaws in the story 
of and by NOSEUKO make it necessary to choose an explanation 
for his actions and the nature of his information. There 
are three alternatives: 
First, NOSENKO was a KGB officer but (a) has 
a faulty or selective me;wry, has embellished or 
boasted, or his reporting has been i~fluenced by a 
cor:\bination thereof; or Cb) he is insane. 
Sec~nd, NOSENKO lied about himself in order to 
save face. 
Third, NOSE~KO has misrepresented himself, either 
on his own or at the instigatior. of the KGB. 
Each of these mutually exclusive alternatives is discussed 
below. 
2. First Alternative 
According to one postulate, NOSalKO was an ~fficer in 
the KGB but has a faulty memory, h:1s a scl~ctivc n,emory, 
and/or has embellished or boasted: 
a. Faulty Memory 
NOSENKO himself has repeatedly appealed for understanding 
that "different people have different memor!.es" and thdt 
his own is. •funny," and this is supported by his forgetful­
ness and errors concerning events he is ic.n?W?LiJ1tf•endently 
to have lived through, ~ucn as the BURGI and~II cas~s. 
But it cannot be said that he is,· in g~neral, "very bad with 
names,• because he nas almost total recall of names and 
positions of hun<¥"eds o~ KGB officers in the ~.werican and 
Tourist Departments. P.e has a good memory for !~ces and 
rarely fail~d to recognize pnotcgraFhS ~f pecple he claimed 
to know. He remem!.;ered consistently detailo about certain 
operations (the compromise and investiga~ion of PENKOVSKIY, 
the surveillance of ABIDIAN to Pushkin Street, the JE~"SER 
case, the arrest of BARGHOOR.~, and the se~rch for CHEREPANOV, 
to cite a few examples). NOSENKO was precisely· accurate in 
his recollection of most of his dealings with CIA personnel 
from June 1962 onward. 
b. Selective Memory 
Although having a selective 1:1eMory is probably true of 
nearly everyone, a CIA psychologist has described NOSDiKO as 
a psychopath who would register each passing event only in 
relation to its effect on himJelf at that moment. This 
would inevitably make him indiff~rent to t~c characteristics 
of other people, for example, anc to the sequence in which 
events transpired; the aspects important to him might r.?t 
appear so to a morEa objective observer. Such a person would
