MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT 
(For the period ending 31 March 1965) 
SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy 
1. This report is the first full year report of Mr. Murphy's 
performance as Chief of the SR Division. • 
Z. Perhaps his greatest contribution during this· past year has 
been the energizing of the Division's several components with a 
consequent very noticeable increase in the ~{forts of the Clandestine 
Services as a whole against our Soviet targets. Mr. Murphy's 
enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are as 
a result pr_ofiting from his sound approach to the role and mission 
of his Division, He has fully understood ti~e fa.ct that the SR Division 
cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services 
for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet 
requirements, but must harness the interest and the energies of all 
the area divisions, In this respect, Mr. Murphy is achieving nothing 
short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also 
improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field,. while 
• -his general administration of his Division from a managerial point of 
view has continued to be excellent. 
3. The overall evaluation of Mr. Murphy's performance during· 
this past· year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors, 
is outstanding. It is because of the quality of this performance that 
favorable c<>nsideration has been given in principle to the gradual 
investment of an increasing portion of the inanpower assets of the 
Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish­
ments to date justify confidence that these increases are being well 
im,es!ed and will provide a maximum return,
