Dear Earll 
You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks 
of full-time service on the GS-13 ClnndeRtine S~rvice 
Personnel Evaluation Board, I know that this work has been 
particularly demanding. Your partlc\pation and diligent 
application of your profe~slr.mal cxpClr1e11ce have been 
decisive factors in tho succ~ssful accomplishment of the 
Board's missions. 
__________ In the course of this aNHignmont you have become 
thqroughly familiar with the ~sc and interpretation of per­
sonnel files and porRonnel practices of the Clandestine 
Service. IIPving reviewed and analyzed the fllcR of one 
hundred or more CS off'iccrs, you have had to make judgments 
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and 
their qualifications for promotion, for training required 
to overcome a deficiency or.enhance career effectiveness, 
for changes of assignment to further career development and 
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform­
ance. - Jn so -~oini:, you have carct'ully Htudied .the career 
development of n largo number of orr·icers in all components 
ol the CS, both ns individuals and in relationship to each 
other in terms of ~orit and value to tho Clandestine Service, 
You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of 
personnel and administrative prohloms on a practical working 
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel ~anagement 
whlch will better equip you to handle H11pcrviHory positions 
which require personnel rep~rting and career development of 
subordin:1tes. Tho C()mmittce format of the panels has also 
deepened your understanding ot the conf'orence approach to 
management problems.
