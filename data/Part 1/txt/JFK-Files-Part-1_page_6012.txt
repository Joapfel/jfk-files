success he nchh.•ved in tJ1is quest, or to -.·hat extent President 
DETANCOURT is prepared to help AMSPELL, is still an unknown 
quantity.-·· Jud.:ing from their_ attempts to raise funds in other 
spheres, allegedly for the purchase of n replacement vess9], they 
were not.very succ·essful in Caracas., (A Pl! c.,se Officer hnnd_ling 
the CEDAR team hns .report<'d that one. of the members complni11ed 
of forfeiting a 20-percent "kick-back" in his AMSPELL salaa·y.

~l - d. AMHINT-f211~eturned fr,..lm Cnracns and ns to bo 
expected,_ gave no indicalcron of the "s.--cret n~gotiations" 01· their 
outcome. On ·27 September, along with -Al!Hll\'T..:5, he requested a 
meeting with the JMWAVE· of fleer fcfr discussi"o1i of the A~iDARB 
funding disagreement and th,e gcnc1·nl AllSPELL situation (See 
Attachment C). Perhaps this session i;;ne Jlll'l'AVE a bit moi·e insight 
ns to AMSPELL plnns and intentions, but no r~nl solution for the 
AMBARDs resulted. In short, AMSPELL policy is to niold PBPRHI_E, 
public opinion nnd bring prc-ssure to bea1· on OD\'OKE and GPIDEAL 
for action in the PDRUMEN situation within the next four months. 
e. To implement such a policy, AMSPELL has exploited 
the impact of their 24 August attack on PBPRUIE news media, as 
well -as their Caracas Declaration. Also, they have published a 
weekly news letter in English entitled "The CUban Report" (Refer­
ence C) and nbou t 1,000 copies a1·e mailed out to ODYOKE officials 
and congressmen. Initiated in lnte Au!!Ust, the_ main theme of this 
publication hns been the Soviet/Bloc materiei buildup in PBRUMEN.
