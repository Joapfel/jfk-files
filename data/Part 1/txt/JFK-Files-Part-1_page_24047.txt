HEPATITIS BOUT 
What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreoe 
fatigue I felt When I returned to London in July proved 1."l 
time to have been acute infectious hepatitis. The disease 
-- which takes two to three weeks to develop -- was probably 
contracted in Ueanda. At least, I imagine so because r:ry 
principal contact 1n Kampala insisted on taking me to a r:...tmber 
of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda 
delicacies. 
Hepatitis was diagnosed by a doctor in Komiza. Vis. where 
my family had been holidaying since the beginning or July. 
and I was hospitalized in the isolation section of-Split 
Hospital (there is no hospital on Vis) on the 7th of August. 
My liver was swollen by one finger and blood and urine 
analysis indicated a fairly severe infection. Treatment 
consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive 
doses of vitamins. 
I was put on a fat-free diet. which I have been told to 
follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol~ 
On 20 August, I was relea:.ed from the hospital, mainly be­
cause I was pestering the doctors to let me go. ,f was 
told to have• nabsolute rest• for four to six weeks and to 
have another blood test o/1n several weeks. 
(Attached is the Yugoslav doctor's description of my case 
and treatment. with results of all blood and urine analJses. 
It 1s written h:w:a:ttv in Serbo-Croatian.)
