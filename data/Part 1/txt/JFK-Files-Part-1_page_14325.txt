< f~r a;.,taiL - We dr_ove around town for fifteen minutes. Certain 
that- no one was tl_iiling us·,: we drove to a Station safchouse 
which "has ani;tfndergrotmd:garage. SA.MKO ~-as visibly excitt:d and 
·-was enjoying 'the "cloak. and .·dagger" role, but he was nervous. 
_ He· was _hi•ghly impressed wi.th: the garage ·entrance to the safe-'

He wanted _to know_ whose apartr,1ent i·t was ·a·nd SA_C0DER said that 
it was his pr.ivatc ''pad". ~is comment was:"you sure live it up 
well." As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports, 
S,H!K0's ·tempe_r does rise. He ·was highly _excited during the 
meeting because he was askecl to leave the hot.cl room. Since 
the reservation was made for four clays, he was asked to leave. 
He pleaded with SAC0DER to do something to .. kcep him in the hotel 
r·oom or ris·k losing.the opportunity to lunch with AMAur0-1 
· because AMAUT0-1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday, 
6 June. SAC0DER admitted the error but added that there was 
a simple solution if he could noi convince the hotel manage­
ment to allow him to stay a few more clays. SAC0DER suggested 
that he should explain to the mana~er that I) his laundry had 
not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an i·mportant phone _ 
call on Saturday and that there was no way of ~etting in touch 
with the caller .. Failing this, SAC0DER offered another simple 
solution·; Since SAMK0 and AMAlIT0-1 had not yet exchanged 
addresses, SAi;IK0 could return to the A~L.\UT0-1 home ancl give 
the maid a note advising A!,IAUT0-1 that he had to change hotels. 
(SA~IK0 admitted that he told AMAUT0-1 about the possibility of 
having to leave the hotel because his reservation ettded soon.) 
SAMK0 did not at first accept _this logic, but SAC0DER explained 
that he (SAC0DER) could not plead with the hotel management 
on_,S~~!K0_1 s behalf. _ This was poor securit_y. SA~IK0 accepted 
th~s ~rid ~fter a glass of scotch and water admitted that the 
solution was indeed simple~ b~t he wa~ teiribly excited at first.
