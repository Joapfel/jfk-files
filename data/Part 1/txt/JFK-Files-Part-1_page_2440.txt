in conflict with the statements of DER YABIN, RASTVOROV and 
GOLITSYN, all o.f whom maintain that BERIYA was responsible for 
the changes. As for the issue of who was responsible for the reversal 
. of designations, it would appear that NOSENKO is in error .. However, 
the fact that he was a new junior· officer and that this was a period of . . . 
upheaval in the KGB {MVD) effectively eliminates any significance in 
this~. 
NOSENKO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing 
. . . . . 
the location of the Chief Directorate of the Militia or the history of the 
Kl (Committee of Information). NOSENKO has stated that he had no 
contacts with either office during 1953 -1955 and there is no adequate reason 
to disbelieve this statement. He is not aware of when the KI ceased to 
exist (1951 given in the· summary, but other information indicates the KI 
continued to exist in a nominal capacity until the mid-1950 1s), but care 
should be used in stating what NOSENKO should know if he held a certain 
position. Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their own 
memory concerning the location and their knowledge 0£ Agency facilities at 
any given period of time or when Agency components ·or related organizations 
were organized or ceased to exist.
