. On this point here are se~eral •• aspects for consideration. He is 
under.contract to us and although'he is not too interested in money, he 
does enjoy its benefits and realizes that it vill continue so long as 
he does. a· good Job. The more. bportant built in control. is the fact 
that' he vUi be under. false documents, and being statel-ess, he is com­
pletely dependent· on KUBARK to· perpetuate hls quasi legal existence and 
to eventually legalize. his status. Added to this is the control which 
stems from the prospect of• resettlement ill another country. This vould 
give ·hi!!l status as a citizen. Realizing these poillts, subJect is more 
than vil.llng to play ball vith us.
