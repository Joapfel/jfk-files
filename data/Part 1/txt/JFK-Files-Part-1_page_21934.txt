continued: • 
. The interrogator pointed out to ~OSENKO that 
occasions dated his entry into the KGB as 
1953, and in Septem~er 1952. The questioning 
Question: Which is the truth? 
NOSENKO: After the death of STALIN, in March 1953. Why 
did I say it Lthe other date§/? You see, I 
finished the Institute in 1949. Then I defended 
my diploma, and then came the State exams. I 
passed all the exams e?(cept one - "Foundations of 
Marxism-Leninisn}' th'? philosophy. 1..nd I had to 
take all the examinations over again. All of 
them. ·I took four, passed three, flunked one. 
Just the same, all four had to be taken over 
again. For that reason I graduated, er I received 
the diploma from the Institute in 1950, although 
officially I graduated in 1949. This is an un­
pleasant ching and I did not want to mention it. 
And right after that I was sent to the GRU~* The 
rest is just as I told you, word-fo~-word. This 
was the only thing. And then, after I said it, 
I did not wa~t to correct it. To twist around 
again. And the mistake I made was about my work 
in the KGB. It was not 1952, of course, but 
1953 ... It was 12 or 17 or 15 March. KOBULOV 
accepted me right away. STALIN was still not 
dead and I was already accepted. March 1953, 
about the 15th, about 15 March 1953. 
26 July 1965: "At the end of 1952 I came to Moscow from 
Sovetsk in Primorskiy Kray,• near Baltiysk. I had worked in the 
Naval Intelligence Point (MRP) there. My aim in coming to 
Moscow was to cet out of this work in the MRP. I couldn't 
stand that work. I couldn't stand that work ... I arrived in 
Moscow at the end of 1952, December ... I don't re~ember exactly 
the date of the order appointing me an officer in the KGB. It 
was 13 or 15 March 1951." • • 
17 April 1966 (letter to CIA case officer): "From August 
1952 until 1953 I worked at the Intelligence Point of the Naval 
, Intelligence cf the 4th Fleet in,Sovetsk, where I received the 
rank of lieutenant of the Administrative Service. From 2 April 
1953 until 4 February 1964 I worked in the Second Chief Direc­
torate of the MGB-KGB." 
. 24 April 1966 (si_gneg autobiographical statement): "In 
.the middle of March L1951/ KOBVLOV's assistant, Colonel 
SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU­
LOV .•. I worked in the First Section, First LAmericanJ Depart­
ment from the middle of March 1953.until July 1955."
