The goal of ccrt.ain Unidad Popul,i.r militanto regarclin.i! freedc,m of 
the press was most explicitly an<l rcvcalinr,ly otated hy the oq;ani:d11g 
committee for a confc1·ence of leftist journ:i.lir.ts which w:i.5 held in 
Santiago in April l97l. The committcc issued the following statcrr.f!nt 
prior· t,o the conference: 
... we believe that we muot fight for true freedom or 
the press, which will only be posoiblc when th('rC is 
true economic indcpendcnc-e. We m:iintain th:,t Chile 
will have true freedom of the prerio only when the means 
or m:i.11s communication arc p:>.rt of tile ar".1. of i;C'cial 
property, that is,· (when they) bcloni.; to. all ChiT;;ans;-_ 
The press, radio, television, and the theater r:,ust be 
tools at the-service of liqcr,'\tion and culture ·oc our 
people and not a private bl1siness, an ideological 
battering ram of the nation.ll and foreign minority 
(the capit:i lists) as is presently the case, 7 (under-
lining added) 1 
Another statement said "the mission of journalists··is to support ,incl 
defend the People's Government (the CP) together with ali the w0rkcrs." 
The declarati.on also underlined the support oi UP ncw!'men for 
"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that arc building Soci3lism," 
and .threw a bouc;.uet at Ct1ba's P1·ensa L:itin:i. agency for its .,."l:>jC"ctive'·' 
reporting o(the Chilean phenomenon. Allende him~elt lent lci,:itir.1;1cy 
to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the co:1:"~•::-cnce 
when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act ,'\O the "\·an!;u:.1rd" 
of the revolution b}' "elevating the political level of the peoplc." 
Reiterating a theme expressed on many othe.r occasions, Allende 
asserted that his Go\·ernment would respect freedom ot inform:ition 
while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessi\·e 
torerance" for the opposition media.
