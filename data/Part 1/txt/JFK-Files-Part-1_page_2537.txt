Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis 
£or the previous conclusion that the claim of NOSENKO that he was a 
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 
1963 was not credible. It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is 
not necessary since this conclusion was apparently based on inadequate 
information. During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished 
details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position 
which substantiate his claim to having been a Deputy Chief of the 
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964. 
An example "in support of the statement that the previous conclu­
sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the· written 
notes whi!=h NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964. 
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is 
inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews, 
an o.££ort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed explan­
ation of hi·s notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes. 
During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed informa­
tion concerning all aspects of his notes. This information supports his 
claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and· includes 
collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section, 
First Department, in 1960 - 1961. C0012J:i
