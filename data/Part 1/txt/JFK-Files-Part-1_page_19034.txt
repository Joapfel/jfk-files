minority rule_. Unlike the early 
1930s, virtually all West Ger-
man politicians now would do their 
best t.o main_tain a function1ng

dangers will probably not arise·

Immediate Prospects 
Assuming that· the Bonn co­
alition lasts until the 1969 
elections, its leading members 
may still modify their policies 
somewhat in the liaht of the 
,Baclcn-Wuerttamborg ~ e,:periE'nce. 
The adverse _vote of the refugees 
in the ·recent election could act 
as a brake on tho policy of de­
tente with Cze~hoslovakia and 
Poland~ although there is no sign 
of this as yet. Chancellor Kie­
singer has attributed NPD gains 
.partly. to "years of agitation 
against our own history and against 
heal thy self-confid:mce," which 
suggests ·that he may try to sound 
a more .nationalistic note. To 
the extent to ;_.hich--the results 
continue to be attrltiuted to 
student -activi tics, this will 
-s'trcngthen the de.:.and for firm­
nc·ss. Even before the t!'lection~ 
Brandt sent a telegram to SPD 
state headquarters, advising that 
speakers shouid- react "comp·letely 
har~•against student demonstra­
tions. 
Although the antistudent re­
action does not seem to nave been 
as important a factor as some have 
'believed it to be, constant vio­
lence and provocation on the part 
of the students, ~ccompanied by 
constant press attention, could 
lead to severe o~ficial or unof­
ficial counteraction. This~ in 
turn, could bring raore serious 
s_tudent violence, perhaps with 
the support of other eleme~ts. 
Some matters of student con­
cerr:i have a!)peal for others.· Thus 
students and manv trade unionists 
oppose emergency-laws, ancl this 
question is_ again being agi t'ated. 
Because of the Nazi experience, 
there is widespread aversion among 
left-of-center elenents to the 
use of force in the name of "or­
der,". however great the provoca­
tion. But also because of the 
Nazi experience, a really large 
increase in NPD votes docs not 
seem likely in the 1969 election, 
or in an earlier new election in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, should that 
come to pass. (COXFIDENTIAL)
