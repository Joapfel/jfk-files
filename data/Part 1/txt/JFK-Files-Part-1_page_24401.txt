4. You will note that the swiss Embassy suggested that 
ORPHONE/1 work through the u.s. Embassy on this matter. We have 
told QRPHO?-?E/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with 
the swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working 
journalist we suggested that ORPHONE/1 obtain.this from the appro­
.;,.,.a:i .. tc ~=ofi3dor.':'l C\rgani:ration (of whid1 he is a member) in 
London. 
5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy in London will be 
forwarding QRPHONE/l's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being 
advised of any swiss action, or statements, on this case which 
may come to the attention of 3ern Station. Any advice which Bern 
Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/l's pursuit of this matter 
will be welcome. 
6. Of course Bern Station should continue to be guided by 
the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss 
concerning ORPHONE/1.
