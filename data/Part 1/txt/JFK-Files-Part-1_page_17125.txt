amended to 1r.clude Sim?>n D. CLJ.CKF;'M' (ps) and riil.lllA J. Fl OktAU ~I (ps), 
U. s. citizens anu contract agents, under this Project in place of the 
Starr Agent written into the field project outline. At the same tiJll8 it 18 
requested that the Ul".!-,fA froject be &ll'lended to delete these contract 
agents trom the latter project. 
2. CLACliETT and FlvRI.1..1.ISI are n& appr.,.,ed under the UME!".A Project •. ' 
They were recruited in t~e United States to occupy a aenaitive Ll~l:sl base~. 
house. Because or the sensitivity of the operation an~ the equi~Mnt to be 
ir.stniled in the bllsehouse HP.adquarters decided u. s. citizens should be 
used. The ~tation sa1d appropriate docul!W!ntation and backstoppir.~ could 
be sec•Jred tor those ae1mts a,:, they could be eiven talse identities under 
which they could live while they occupied the blleehouse.

and backetopping prt!'cluded the use of U. S. citl7en..'3 under LlMr,S.\ and re­
quested perrniesion to use indigenous agents for this opera ti on. Alter dis­
cussions between John .BR,,D;, Chief of the Mexican desk, with the Lll-fF.SA/ 
Lll-:H?TY Cat-e Officer in !'.P.xico City, and di~cussions b->tween M!presttnta­

the field's operational decision to usf! indigenous agents in the LlNESA 
Project. CU.Cr-..r;Tl' and F'lOEDALISI received only a VP.ry superficial briefing 
rer,ardin~ the LlMJ::SA Project. It is not believed Subject's l11nited know­
ledge ot this sensitive operation will pose a ~ecurity hazard. 
4. Construction on the I.J.M?;ST houses is being kept about two weeks 
trorn co,r,pletion until. indigenous aeents can be cleared and recruited. The 
delay in c"rr.plP.tion is norm:il l-,r.r:,nJSP. all con!lt.ruct.ion monP.y in f-iPxico hAs 
become extremely tight because or the recent presld~ntial inauy,uration. 
5. The ~tation believes CLi,Cr-. .E.TI will be an excelltmt replacement for 
\>il.fred o. CLO .. EH (ps·), forrr,er Staff Agent un<l~r Project LI?t::TICK, who

gative .ork in particular. He also is intP.restea and enthusiA~tic in under­
takinc this asaigrunent for KUB.-.F.K. 'I'he Station needs a good bilingual agent
