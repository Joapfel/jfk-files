I. In the ·pcrlod cov~re<!~by·this r~po:rt Mr. Phillips W\l~ the Chief of 
Station ·Brazilia during thl:fi~e frame February to August 1,972. :After'that 
Mr. Phillip·s becamu the Ch1cf of Station, Caracas and ·served in Venezuela 
during the period August J 972 to f\pril 1973. At both of thci1t• posts Mr • 
Phillips was responsiule for managing an averag·e of 44 Agency employees. 
, ___ Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of. 
·'·.•;:;· 1, 8 million which was spent _on Fl, CA, Cl, anti-narcotics and protected 
,~. economic intf!lligence operations. American policy interests in Brazil and 
Venezuela are high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin 
Amcl"ica. This mcan:i that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts 
dtal'ing a fifteen month time span. 
Z. As a manager Mr. Phillip~ is operations oriented. Jn view of this he
