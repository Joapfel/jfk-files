1-IU!ORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director £or Plans 
SUBJECT Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request 
1.· Renewal is requested £or the LIEMPTY Project for 
the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1!>66 for a 
total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be 
alloted £or FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967. This Project 
has been programmed in FY 1966 £or $50,000 •. The last 
Project Renewal was approved at $45,300. Funds are 
av:iilable within WII Division. 
2, The security 0£ this Project appears to be good. 
The LIE NfRAP photo truck was repainted a different color 
in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle 
which operates extensively in the same general areas. There 
have been no apparent ramifications from the publication 
of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Comrniss ion Report 
in September 1!>64, 
_ 3. LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance 
.units at the Station, both of which are used extensively 
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage 
of diplomatic installations, agent meetings, and current 
identification photos of targets among others, 
·4, Although there ~re three stationary photo 
basehouses under this Project all targeted against the 
Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of 
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened 
through the termination of any of them, LICALLA covers 
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is 
in a unique position· to observe informal meetings and 
activity there, In May 1965 a thorough assessment was 
cadc of this basehouse to determine whether an audio 
installation could be based here, directed against these 
garden conversations, It was determined that ciue to the 
high incidence of stTeet and other ~oises, this was not 
practical, TSO and SR Divisions are consciou~ of this 
requirement, however, and if any new equi~ment is 
developed which might make this ·operation more feasible 
it will be tested, LH?ITED and LILYRIC which both cover 
the front entrance, provide coverage during different 
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio
