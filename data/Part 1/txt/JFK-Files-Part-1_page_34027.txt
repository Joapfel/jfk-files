CUBA AIO THE SOVI!:T UNION: OOH MOCH D::PErl>EtCY? 
Cuba's deoendency on the Soviet Union is known. The ouestion ls, how much de- •• · 
pendency? In order to arrive at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba's foreign trade 
statistics for the 1959-1966 period. 
We will work under the following economic assumption, ?:!ct'nomlc dependency of one 
country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this 
• indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as 
a SUJ)pller for !ts imports. 
What we will do is to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period.• 
1) According to the assumr,tion we established regarding tra,je dependency, we can 
,_-,., say that during 1959 Cuba was dependent_ upon _the Free World_ for its markets as total

" trade value for that year amounted to $ 1,305,700,000 and trade value with the· Free 
World represented S 1,289,000,000 (or 98.8% of the total trade). 
Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cuban' exports totaled 
$637,700,000 .t-ille total imports were$ 688,000,ooo. Thus, the trade balance showed 
a$ 26,~o,ooo de.fl~it, which was a refle~tion of the trend started in 1958 due te

Indicated. The sources for the figures used throughout the analysis, the

mlc Reports on Latin America, _"Cuba Come~clo Exterior• magazine, "Vision• 
magazine, "lS News & World Report•, and The Economist Intelligence lkllt's 
"Quarterly Economic Review•. 
It should be remembered that the fi9!,Jres refer only to the Cuban Trade B~ 
lance, I.e., imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments 
which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili­
tary and techical assistance, figures which do not appear in the balance of 
trade and which are
