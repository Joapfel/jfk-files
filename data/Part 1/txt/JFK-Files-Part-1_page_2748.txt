{AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
GOLITSYN's Information About KGD Operations Against Embassy 
Code Clerks in 1960-1961 
The most significant collateral information about KGn 
operations against American code clerks in this period, 
with which to compare NOSEUI<O' s assertions [on this topic] , 
is that provided by GOLITSYN after his defection in 1961. 
GOLITSYN identified KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV by name and 
from photograph as being two veteran KGB officers, personally 
known to him, who were in 1960 "working against code clerks 
in the American Embassy in Moscow. 
11 
I"li th respect to the 
priority attached to the recruitment of American code clerks 
in 1960, GOLITSYN commented in 1961 that: "The task of 
strengthening of work against Americans had been a standing 
requirement, both in the past and most particularly [in 
1960]. This work ~as particularly intensified after the 
appointment of SHEL:CPIN to the KGB ... In 1960, it was 
• recomm.'ended in· the KGB to inte!lsify the work against the 
Americans at the Embassy in Moscow, and against American 
colonies in other countries ... This question of intensifying 
work against the Americans was up before the Collegium of 
the KGB. Thereafter there was a' directive from SIIELEPIN 
regarding the intensification of work against the American 
cipher-clerks." 
GOLITSYN said that NOSENKO was not assigned to the Embassy 
Section in 1960-1961, since if he had be~n GOLITSYN would • 
have known about it. 
• Preparing for his assignment to ·Helsinki, GOLITSYN-in 
the spring of 1960 visited the Embassy Section and learned 
from GRYAZNOV that the latter had as an agent an Embassy 
code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to Helsinki . 
. The code clerk had already provided the KGB with some infor­
mation and he was considered by the I(Gn to be a 
II 
real" 
agent. GOLITSYN was told by GRYAZNOV that, if the code clerk's 
transfer materialized, GOLITSYn might have him in Hels2-n!~i 
as his agent.
