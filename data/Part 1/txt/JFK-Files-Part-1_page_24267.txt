minority groups shou~d form their own 
organizations separate from the RU. QRPHONE 
said Wright is very bitter toward the Black 
Panther movement and thinks that Eldridge 
Cleaver is "bad" and that Huey Newton and 
Bobby Seale are "corrupt". 
SAN FRANCISCO 
In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with _ 
Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared 
in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin 
Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated 
into the English the entire Fundamentals of 
Political Economy. He was once a member ol the 
RU. 
Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as 
she was several months ago, even though her brief 
exposure to the world of labor union organizing 
was a failure. Her comments about the RU were 
to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos 
Organization) which she said is going to bring 
disaster to the whole RU because of its • 
predilection for violence before the groundwork 
for revolution bas been laid. Fineman feels that 
Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild 
and erratic than in the past and has in fact 
become a good M-L. 
QRPHONE saw Paul Richards, Hodee Edwards' 
son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from 
the Mid-West, which he left because of the people. 
He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the 
country where the Government ought to test nuclear 
warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose. 
Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he 
must have caused some embarrassment to the 
delegation by bis naivete. He attempted to meet 
African revolutionaries, particularly members of 
the MPLA, which be didn't realize were Moscow­
ortented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send 
him material on the various African liberation 
movements. Lee Rose works for Bell Telephone 
Coapany although Earl, her husband, is unemployed.
