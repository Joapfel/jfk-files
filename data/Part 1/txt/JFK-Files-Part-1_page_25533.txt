SUBJECT: ~~P.~Y.DS nack~rouod and Statug Report. 
of Present Marital Ccnflict 
l. While thi~ is n~t intended to -b~ a full exposition of my 
pei•sonal and private life· over J:eccnt years,' I would like to makQ 
kno~n some of the factors that have, fron mJ pni~t of view, led 
up to the present situation~ 
·2. J rcali~e thPt the· interests o! tha organt~ation and the 
interest of the :'.ndivjd•Jals wt.a may h:1vo opportanit:,r to come in 
contact with my ca3e djctate as lit_tlc p.?rsonal involvernent as 
possible ~n the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of 
security·, compartT",c·ntatton and cfficicr.cy prescribe the me.Jue 
operandi and, to a great extent the ~odus vivendi, of agency 
poroonael net only in the sense of corning a living but also in 
~anner of living. Ideally, the _less said about an agent's pri~ate

wife (LI:-;/.!P'l'Y-19) and ll".C :ai t~ tha ~"Jcrro•Jal and potenUal security· 
riskr. it t,af. entailed, I feel that s_ome explanation is necessary. 
Should it be in order, I '-'O'Jld like this cxplanatior. tc: reach not 
~nly·my present case offi~ar and Chief of Station but also the 
former·Chief anc officars with whom I have had the privilege to 
work. over the years. - -
3. - I would like to giva thanks, in advance, for _the patience 
and understanrang that h:.vc been shown r.ie thus far~ Whatever the 
final outccme, I know that people hav'l been t,encl:!.ni; over backward 
to be helpful and patient in bc,pes of an early solution to the 
conflict.
