the Lil-!E.-UG:{ buildin~ tJJ a four-a tory aiJ8rtm,mt building on tl1e far 
corner. n,e fx·onts of the houses are- all diroctJ.y on the sidewalk with 
the doors opening onto a ono-st.ep stoop. '.ll-a backs of the houses and the 
wall:3 of the back pat.ioa all abut the compound of th~ L!M::.:UCK installa­
tion, The rear wirrlowa of U1e house face a patio which ends in a brick 
wall. This brick wall is not as hi1~11 as the roof of the house, ending 
about· four feet below the 1n val of the roof. There are stairs ?Cich 
ascend from thic patio to the roof where the mai.d1 s ~Ullrter.1 are s.ituattrd. 
About halfway up t!lese st:.i.irs one can turn and obtain an unrestricted 
view ot the LIMJ=;!UCK cou.pound. However, ti1s roid 1s room off~s Ule best 
o~rational posslbilit.ies since it proviges concealment for ~e observer 
and his equipment, plus a ir.ore aJvantaeeous view. LI.'S'l'ICK-21 toli his 
maid that she would have to sleep out. at a local pension since he needed 
hP,r room for his radlo e.xyerimP.nts, Tnis is a plausible story since 
L!l-'STIGK-21 is known to oo an enthusiastic radio amateur. 
S. The maid's room has a door that face!. across the roofs in tl1e direction 
of the LDfrJUCK installation anrt one window woich faces across t.'le house 
roof toward the street, A view of the LIHT'·JUCK compound is obtai~ed by 
an ob.'lerv!'!r who is back in 11',e room looking through the partly opened door. 
Some better method of observatlon will be worked out wi1ich will eliminate 
the security hazard ol a <loor partiall;, opened ai.t all times of op,?r~tion.
