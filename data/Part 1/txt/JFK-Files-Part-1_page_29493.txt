ith the llend of the Covert Tax Unit on the subject problem. 
• The writer wns informed that the Covert Tax Unit· is not able 
to nccept and .forwa1·d· a Covert rctu1·n for the year 1962 for 
·the subject indi\'idual· since n Form 1099 had been issued. 
It was further stated thnt the Internal Revenu~ Service, while 
performing n ser\'ice last yc:ir (tax year 1961) of this nature, 
would not under any circumstances permit n person _and/or 
persons receivini; n Form 1099 or _W-2 to file a Covert Return 
for such reported income. Therefore, it appears all avenues 
of escape for Irving. G. DEVUONO have been closed and he should 
file an amended returri for Tnx Year 1962 to include the KUB.<\RK 
income reported on Form 1099. •
