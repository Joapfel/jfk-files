J7.3 percent)~ The liberal Fre~ 
Dcmocratfc Party (FD.P) , made a 
slight gain, winning 14.4 percent 
of· the vote (1~64: 13.l percent). 
Against the background of last 
October's Bremen elections, in 
which the Nationai Democratic 
Party won what was then a record 
percentage of 8.9, the Baden­
Wuerttemberg results brought re­
newed er ies of alai"lll over the· 
dangers qf neo-~lazism 'in the Fed­
eral Republic. More. important, 
the rjsults also.raised doubts 
as to the future of a coalition 
g·overnment by the Qhristian Dem­
ocrats and Social Democrats, not 
only in Baden-Wuerttembcrg but 
at the federal government level 
as well. 
Baden-Wuertternherg: A Test Case 
Baden and l\'uertternberg tra­
.ditionally have been strongholds 
of liberal, nonsocialist democ­
racy in Germany. In the early 
1930s, the Nazi vote in this 
area was almost always appreci~ 
ably 11wer th.in els~where in 
Gerin.iny·. The hotbeds of Nazism 
lay in other regions, for ex.:. 
amp,·re' in rrancpnia·, 'East Prussia, 
and- Sch1eswig-Hols tein. • 
The e¢on6mic and social pie.:. 
ture in Daden~Wuertteniberg would 
lead to expectafions of ·stabiiity 
there. The proportion of the 
population. now employed-in in­
dustry :1s· higher· than in any 
other state. The economy of the 
state wa~ virtually uri~6uch~~·by 
the recent West German recession, 
during· which unemployment never 
exceeded one pe·rcen t. P~fr· <;ap-
i ta income is- above average. 
Protestants and Catholics are 
almost evenly balanced in pop­
ulation, while the ~roportion of 
protest~nts in the Federal Re­
public is slightly higher. 
A few observers correctly 
forecast the outcome, but the 
general expectation was that the 
vote for the National Democratic 
Party would be lower than in 
Bremen. The two major West Ger­
man polling organizations had 
predicted in March that the NPD 
would receive five perci::rit· of the 
vote. 
Federal-level politicians 
had campaigned actively in the 
state. Cha"cellor Kurt Kiesinger, 
a popular native son, made a 
three-day speaking tour, in which 
he sharply attacked "arrogant, 
thoughtless, and dangerous na­
tionali!:,m." lie stressed this 
theme in the Hohenlohe area, 
where the NPD later received its 
highest vote in the state. Willy 
Brandt also appeared to speak for 
the Social Democrats.
