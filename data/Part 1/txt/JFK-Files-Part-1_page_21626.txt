B. ~OSEXKO cl:c! not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time 
claimed. (Previous cor.clusion) 
The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard _ 
tr;, ~OSENKO. The conclusion in this summary is that ~OSE~i<O ente_red 
the then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his 
entry was not only facilitated by but :due to the influence o! General 
Bogdan Zakharovich KC::3 -:J LOY. 
Previous st .. tements by NOSENKO and changes relative to da'te of 
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section o! the summary 
and will not be repeated here. His statements during current interviews 
that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a c~se officer in the First 
Section, First Department, Second Chic! Directorate, MVD, are con-
sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted. 
The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that 
NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed 
• was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSE~KO as to when 
he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in -
1965 NO.SENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.
