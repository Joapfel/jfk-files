CHRISTIA~ DHlOCRACY- IN LATIN AMERICA 
ihedecisi\-e\"ictory<>f Edu.irdo Frei in. the Sep• 
t'ember·;19i•4 Chile.1n· pr_esidenti~l. :elc.:tion led r.i.iny to 
hope that Christi.1n Oeino<::racy ""-ould d_cvclop sign'ifi-. 
cantly throughou~ Latin America, compot'ing' "·ith Com­
munism on _idcolo.;ic;il grounds and ·offering an alterna­
tive, democratic _route to· social ,1nd economic progr,ess. 
No such trend has yet, developed. The Christian 
Democratic moveme:1t's appeal is.to students and iniddle 
. class, a relati_,·el~· small percenta_ge ot the pcpuiat'ion 
':.in inost Latin Arneric.:an countries. • ·as concepts of 
• • _.:basic social ·refor.-:t and the dignity of the human person 
may_ appeal ·to the vorkers, but ther still cast their 
-vote on a pr_agmati_c basis for the le.ist objectionable 
of the established parties that h,'.1ve an immedi.ate chance 
of governing. 
The movement's progress is likely to be hampered 
by its lack of strong lead.ers and effective labor or-· 
ganizations to co.-:,.p,:'!te against the ·entrenched posi­
tions of other political movements, 
, Current Balance Shee~· 
The Christian Democratic 
movement is generally ·agreed to 
be of current political sig~ifi­
cancc in only four Latin American 
countries--Chile, Peru, Vene:uela, 
and El Salvador. 
. In. only one of·these--chile-­
is the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) the governing party. ~rei's 
solid victory in the 1964 presi­
dential election was fol!owed by 
_an ··eyen more impressive ShO\oi::i.g 
in the March 1965 congressi6::i.al 
election. However, the party's'· 
reform program has run into dif­
ficulty in the upper house of 
Congress; which is still con­
trolled by the ·opposition~ no 
progress has been made in wea..~en-
ing ~lar:dst domination··of the 
urban l3bor force; and·Frei's 
• moderation has been inc.reasingly 
challenged by the left.wing of 
his o"'n party, which may capture 
control in tho next two or three 
years.· 
Th~ only other C~ristian 
Democratic party with a claim to 
a role.in government is the one 
in Peru. It was brought into a 
pre-elc_ction coalition l>y the 
dominant Popular Action Party 
in 1963 and, althou~h it g~ined 
onl~• four percent of the votes, 
it holds two cabinet posts. Its 
v.oting strengr:h h.1s been weakened 
recently by the defection of a 
dissident fac~ion ,.-hich formed a 
separate Popular Christian Party.
