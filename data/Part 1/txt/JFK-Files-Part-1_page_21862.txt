sometimes voiced moral co~punctions, from this point on NOSENKO 
expressed his primary personal concern as being his ow-n secu­
rity vis-a-_vie the KGB. 
b. Attitude Toward Defection 
Whiie willing to meet with CIA representatives during 
future trips outside the Soviet Union, which ~e estimated would 
occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused tc car.sider 
defection except in circumstances where his ;,ersonal sf:curity 
would be endangered. Iris devotion to his wi!e and children. and 
the probability that the KGB would take repiis3ls against them 
if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations bf:hind this 
·refusal. (Without elaborating or:· the reasc.ms, NOSENl<O said on 
another cccasicn that he would not w;;.nt to lea':/e th,~ t:SSR even 
on a permanent KG3 assign.~ent and accompanied by his family.) 
Other considerations ~ncluded his wid~wed mother's dependence 
on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed 
to the r~girne. For the st:!· reasons, NOSEtlKO said, he could not 
defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KHOKLO\' had done. 
c. · Motivation 
NOSENKO told David HARK on 9 June 1962 that he wanted to 
contact A.~erican Intelligence because he was in trouble over 
the·.1oss of KGB op~rational funds, for which ~e had to account 
prior to his imninent departure for the Soviet Union. His KGB 
career would be ruined if he was caught misusing this money, 
NOSENKO added, and because he had nowhere else to turn, he was 
willi"a to sell two items of information to l·:ARK. The amount 
needed- to co•,er the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210, 
and this was the price asked for the information. 
NOSENKO's statements of motivation to his CIA case officers 
during subsequent meetings are given below: 
9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO­
SENKO. asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted 
to meet with American Intelligence. He then very briefly re­
·peated what he hue! told !·1ARK concerning the loss of his opera­
tional funds. The case officer remarked that there must be 
something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not, 
in fact, his main motivation: "I have been working in this 
business·for a long time and I know what I a.!l doing. I have 
heard more than is written [in the newspapers]. A reorganization 
has been started in the USSR. In short, they have begun to do 
away with the ministries and the sovnarkhozy. But this is pre-
·m~ture. Right now our agriculture is falli~; apart at the seams 
and our industry is at the point of collapse because this re­
organization, this innov~tion, is too early. And this is not 
i just me, a young man, talking. I mingle wit.~ ministers, with my 
i father's friends, and ! heat: what they are saying~ ·: And how much 
l does a worker earn·? • 600-800 rubles iri old money, now 60-80. 
, And he doesn't sense any improvement (in his position] within the 
i total population. These are empty words only .. We have exceeded 
l _ the United States in per capita. production of butter and milk.
