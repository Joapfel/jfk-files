discussed below.) NOSENKO reported that his planned role in the.· 
approach to Natalie BlENSTOa< (see Pact VI.D.2.) was prevented 
by his preparations to leave for Geneva in March 1962. Finally, 
NOSENK0 said he pa:-ticipated in the KGB invest:!.gaUon of Lee 
Harvey OSWALD aft~r P-·esider.t KEJINCY's assassination in Novem­
ber 1963 (see Part V.D.6.). 
N0SEm<0 has indicated that his own operational work in 1962 
to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above becau~e of the 
considerabl':! ai,,o-unt of time spent on temporary duty assignments 
outside Moscow during these two years. In mid-February 1962, 
soon after assuming the duties of Chief of the J..T.erican Tourist 
Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which 
lasted from 14 March until lS Ju,,e 1962 (see Pat·t III.B.). NOS­
ENK0 estiraated th~t he had spent a total of six months outside 
Moscow in 1963 on temporary ass~gnnents. I'hes~ included a two­
day trip to Odessa to meet f~lPPEL, an inspectLon tour of the 
Leningrad KGB organiza~ion, a five-day trip to L-=ningrad for a 
conference o~ border control, a week-long trip to Alma-Ata for 
a conference qn tourist tra·.rel \o.'ith KG3 representatives from 
the Soviet Central Asian republics, and an eight- or ten-day 
inspecti.on trip to the Caucasus as a :r.ember of a teaiu headed by

ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.* 
e. Arsene FRIPPEL:

N0SENKO continued to be the Seconq Chief Directorate case offi­
cer in charge of any future KGB contacts with him. (FRIPPEL 
had no KGB contacts in Nev York City.) Describing FRIPPEL's 
past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he 
said he transferred to the Tourist Department, N0SENK0 said: 
•FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing .•• He was 
a weak agent ... I recruite-:! him 1:>ut, speaking honestly, he 
·was not an agent." Nevertheless, N0SENK0-said, the KGB hopecl 
that FRIPPEL would be. reassigned to the USSR at some future 
date. When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in 
1963, N0SENK0 met with him. once in Odessa and.once ·in Moscow,

period was the American Alexander SVENQIANSKIY. (See
