l. Forwarded under separate cover is an issue of a ! 
supposedly "literary" Cuban publication containing two short 
essays by the Salvadorian poet and writer Roque DALTOX. I 
The first of these essays is dedicated to LIRING-3. The ' 
interesting thing is that LIRING-3 was at that time imprisoned 
in Guatemala. The essay may thus be viewed as a trihutP tn

2. Roque DALTO~ (201-215097} is, according to the files 
of the Station, an agent of the Cuban Intelligence Service' 
engaged in clandestine activities for the Commuuist Party of 
El Salvador. DALTON spent some time in Czechoslovakia and is 
now living in Cuba. He is the brother of ~!argarita D.-\LTON: 
(201-7~1261}, whom the Cuban IS recruited to work in Mexico. 1 
LIRING-3 ~ot to know DALTON in Havana in 1962-63 and became 
a close fi•iend of his (see HMMA-32283, 19 June 1967}. DALTON 
at one point confided to LIRING-3 that he had been approached 
by WOFIRM while incarcerated in El Salvador.

3. The Station is hoping that DALTON' s essay is' an i 
indication that LIRING-3 is going to be viewed by the Cuban's 
in much better light after his incarceration in Guatemala. i 
A report of LIRING-3's complete debriefing by ROWTON was 
forwarded with HMMA-35904, 27 Nov~mber 1968.
