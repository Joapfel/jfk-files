What about operational vehicles? Automobiles? 
You sec, we had one automobile for the whole 
department. Besides this, we could apply, when 
necessary, to the officer on duty for the Second 
Chief Directorate and he would give a car, be-· 
cause he has a number of cars at his disposal.· 
Approximately how much of your time did you spend 
supervising GRYAZ!-:OV and KOSOLAPOV?. 
I can't say. 
Was it the most important function? 
·A: Yes, it was important. All work in the First 
Section was important. This was the most impor­
tant. But one day I could devote the whole day 
to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day, 
maybe two hours in the day. The rest of the day 
I will be absent. I will be neeti11g with KLYPIN, 
or I will be having a meeting with-surveillance, 
or I will be at anPther place. Th~ third day, 
again, maybe the whole day, maybe part of it. 
No, I can't tell you. It depends on the situa­
tion. 
(111) Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence 
As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of 
NOSENKO's responsibilities was to serve as Acting Chief 
when KOVSHUK was absent from the office. NOSENKO recalled 
'· that he fulfillaJ this function during KOVS!IUK' s two 30-day 
leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember 
when this leave occurred in those years. He also served as 
Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when 
ltOVSHUK was ·in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for a 
week or two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK was 111 again . 
. NOSE~1CO was unable to recall any operational or,inspection 
trips that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other 
spe~ific time that he could remember KOVSHUK being absent 
was for several days in connection with preparations for 
President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in 
1960. 
HOSENKO's description of -his duties in KOVSHtJJc°'s ab-
sence was suauaarized in a protocol wbicb he signed on -3..· March 
1965:
