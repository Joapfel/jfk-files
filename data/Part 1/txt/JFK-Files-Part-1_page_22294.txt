NOSDi1.IJ said ?RIPPEL waa his .. agent and said, repeatedly: 
•1 recruited hi.lQ,.mys£lt.• In 1962 no other KGB officer was 
mentioned by NOSENKO, who qucted from a nl.!Ifober of his conver­
sations with FRIPPEL. In 1964 SOSENXO said he and t:HELUOKOV 
•hLd carried out the recruitment together,a but NOSENKO was the 
case officer. According to FRIPPEL'1 account, CHELNCKOV '-"&B 
the senior officer in the recruitment and in the later u:.eetinga. 
NOSa-'lCO ne\-er 111et FRIPP£L alone while FRIPPEL was stationed 
in Moscow. The only times he ever did so were later, he said, 
when FRIPPEL returned to the USSR, and these consisted o! a brief 
'Visit to FRIPPEL's hotel room during FRIP?EL's visit to Moscow 
i"n tl".e sw:r.ier of 1962 and a Bhort meeting in Odessa -..,here FRIP­
P~ was on a cruis~ in February 1963. (Both of these meetings 
took place after NOSENKO, in his 1962 contacts with CIA, had 
e.xpo5ed FRIPPEL a~ d Y.GB agent.) According to FRIPPEL, in the 
Febr1.ary 196 3 r.ieeting. NOSENl<O phoned so.-neone to ask wh~tl.er•~ ~ 
he cculd accept FRIPPEl,'s in-.·itation to board the ship; tte 
a."'ls,.,er w:is evidently no. NOSE!'.'iCO denied this, insisting that 
there was no one in Odessa s~perior to nitn, and as a Deputy Ve­
partt'lent Chief, he wo~ld not have to ask anyone anyway. 
?:OSENKO, CHELNOKOV, and their wives dined at FRIPPEL' s 
house in ~oscow some tirr.e after FRIPrEL's recruit.raent. NOSENKO 
ackncwledgcd this to have been a l!lCSt unusual procedure a~d 
C'C'ule nane no parallel in KG3 agent handling. As~cd why it 
happened, he said: "Because he invited me,• and when asked 
why CHEL?mKOV ar.d his wife went a lung, NOSENKO said: "6ecause 
he was also involved in the recruitir.ent.• 
NOSENKO said h2 retained operational control of FRIPPEL, 
then still Moscow representative of a tourist firm, when ~OSENKO 
shifted in June 1960 from the Tourist Depart~ent to the Aceri­
can Oepart.Jnent; Later NOSE!~KO also c.aintained re~ponsibility 
for contact during F~IPPEL's visits to the USSR alter FRIPPEL's 
PCS. departure from Hoscow in January 1961 and after his o-.-n re­
turn to the Tourist Department. According to FRIPPEL, who saw 
no sign of change in NOSENKo·•s reponsibilities during his rela­
tionship with him, he recalled meeting CHELNOKOV (who had 
stayed in the Tourist Depart:11ent) alone, without NOSENKO, prob­
ably in-1960. 
FRIPPEL said he was queried by NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV only 
once concerning U.S. Embassy personalities, specifically on 
BOilDEN and WINTERS. NOSENKO, who claimed case officer re­
sponsibility for Embassy Security Officer ABIDIAN in 19£0-1961 
as well as for FRIP?EL said the two did not know each other: 
in fact, they met socially several times. NOSESKO could re­
call nothing which F!UPPEL ever reported to or did for the KGB, 
dismissing the aubjcct on several occasions with: "He never 
gave anything of value." The only question NOSENKO posed 
when he ca:i:e to FRIPPEL in August 1952, FRIPPEL said, was 
,..hether t!'·,e agent kr.ev ·,what th,? newspaper editors he was es­
co~ting were going to ask KHRUSHCHEV in an interview. Accord­
ing to FRIP?£L, in the February 1963.meeting NOSENKO posed 
no questions and merely made polite conversation until FRI??EL 
excused hi:llself.
