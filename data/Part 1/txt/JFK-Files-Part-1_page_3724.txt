KEKORAHDUK FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: Manuel A.~".:'tHE Buesa 
17 April 1969 
1. ARTIME.comes to Managua frequently, always using 
LAMICA Airl5neP. and frequently flying over Cuba. He is 
aware of the p~ssibility of a highjacKing and says that he 
would never :nake it n11t of the Havana airport alive if 
the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him. 
2. He explains his trips as legiti~ate business. 
One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms, 
canteens, web gear, and similar equipment.and supplies 
for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise, 
in which he was involved a yea.r or so ago, involved lumber 
and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua 
to the States. He dealt with a•Nicaraguan businessman • 
named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through. 
At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying 
. to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in 
Germany here. I have heard no more about this. A more 
NCent line is Nicaraguan beef. for export to the States •. 
Be says that he h.4s made cont(lct with· the tcp ·man of th.e • 
. S I W restaurants in tl,e. Stattlls. • This man, .uter checking 
eaaples cf Nicaraguan beef, siays he, will buy all he can get. 
The supplier at th» • end· woulct be CARN IC, a meat · packing 
enterprise owned by President SOMOZA. (There is nc dcubt· 
.ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may 
k stymied by tha import quo·tcls, especially since Nicaragua 
• :_. over-exported to the States ii\ 1968 and had troubles as a 
• NSUlt.)

not on a;,erytrip. ~is viiit;r. tQ ma ha.a li .. aa laaa fr .. quant
