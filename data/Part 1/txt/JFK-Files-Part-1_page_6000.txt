Dear Brothers: I 
I hope from I call (LD telephone) yesterday you are nware of my, 
I • ' 
how desperate we ar~,. financially. The week before last, I went t9 
Villas nnd I I to know that the DRE nag haR now been raised J~as wapt you ·-:,.· 
in the Frco ~rrttory in CUba. -A' small guerrilla (group) well supplied, 
. I is now· reptosenting I us in the North Zone of Las Villns. And the . i . 
guerrilla banda in ~atanzas to whom we have off~rcd some support will 
no doubt como into tiur ·organization if assured a little more help from 
I 
the DRE. 
I We have been working on the total reorganization and if wo 
I 
cannot claim completb success it is because if our limi~ed resource~. I • 
Propaganda, althoughlon a small scale, is functioning well, ram 
i 
enclosing a copy of 9ur last issue of Trinchcra and examples of tho 
seals we nrc producing ·in homes of Pre- University members. These I . 
arc now appearing in lpublic places. As you can see there is a willing-
I 
ness to work and with a little material support a great deal of eff-
. ; . 
ectiye work could be forthcoming. 
I cannot underst~nd yet, the delay in sending mane). You remember 
I how you witnessed our1 needs that day in Varadero, Luis? We only 
i had a few centavos in
1
capital? Well, that is the. way we are now. 
We have asked a small 
1
local loan and after that must travel to Las 
I 
VJllas for a loan from the Provincial (Committee) there, since they 
seem to have money. 
not sent money, you 
I 
~ hope upon receipt of this (letter), if you have 
w1!i1 do so immediately. 
I 
Concerning the travel oi Angel (A°llHINT-58 infll tration), advise 
i 
me as soon as this can
1
be arranged so that we can check the security-
aspects here. Our purpose is a to be organized to facilitate the work
