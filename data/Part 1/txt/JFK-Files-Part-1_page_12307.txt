on some $800 of the am(•unt. The final note on De ARMAS

Army with a notation that he had psychological ~nd 
behavioral problems." The gist of the· aforementioned 
FBI information has been passed to DEA Caracas. All 
agencies concerned agree that contact with De ARMAS 
should cease. De ARMAS again-contacted S.A. Duncan in 
Caracas on 26 February 1976 and _requested a meeting_; he

that he l.3S on his own and that DEA would not get fo~
