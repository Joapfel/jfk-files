First Section could listen to a p.s.:..·tic--..i.la.:..· tape but he had to go to· OTU

It is believed that a:1.y pres,ra:ption that the KGB recovered or • 
transcribed all conversa.tions even in the thirteen areas listed by 
NOSENKO as having active microphones is not reasonable or even 
realistic. It is also unrealistic to presuxne that any conversation con-
ducted within reasonable distance of an active microphone was r..ot 
compromised to the KGB. The latter is a factor to be considered in 
any damage assessment; it is-not an approp:::-iate basis for a P~.e~u....--nption 
foat NOSENKO had to have been aware of this or this just because some-
one had a conversation in one of the roo:::ns in which there was an active . 
microp11one and NOSENKO has claimed he reviewed t}1e 11take 11 from 
microphones in the United States Embassy. 
It is apparent that there are a number of imponderable factors 
to be considered such as whether the conversation could be picked up 
by the microphone, whether the :rnonitor could recover sufficient portions 
of the conve:rsation to understand the gist of what was being said, and 
even if he did, whether he would consider it of sufficient L.--nportance or
