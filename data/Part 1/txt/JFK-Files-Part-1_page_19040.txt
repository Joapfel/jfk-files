Ori~i~~ and Early Successes 
.-<~ :·:F6~ined from th~ remnants of, . 
ttie-'.·di!funct _G.ernian ·Reich ·'_Party 
(D~P)--one of .a number-of· ultra­
nation.u-I·stic:· splinter groups 
_ whi~}). have dcitted the poll tical, 
l.ind,s~~pe of·. pcst,..ar Germany_-.-the 
NPO. g1.H:ckly established a polit-·. 
ical ~i;ipa_iatus capable of furic- ' 
tioning thro~~~out the country. 
The ne_w part:i,;· ·soon distinguished • 
itself by its relati~~ success 
in a~tracting the supp~rt ·of other 
ultranationalistic-elements and a 
variety of politic;a·1,malconte·nts. 
Earlier:attempts by othe~_groups 
to unite· dispapte nati.on'alists 
invariably had foundered on_-per­
sondl rivalries and tac~icil-dis­
agreements. Some were- no more 
than platforms for self-expres~ 
sion by leaders·advocating a 
particular set of ~xtremist no­
tions. Even the most successful, 
the So~ialist Reich Party (SRP), 
which at its hi~h water mark 
obtained 11 percent of the vote 
in the- Lo\1er S:ixcn}' Landtag elec­
t'ions in.1951, was un'able to 
establish elfective working rela­
tions with rival rightist groups 
before it:was outlawed by the 
West German supreme court in 
1952. 
During its first year, the 
NPD encountered many of the prob­
.l_ems experienced b}• its predeces­
so·rs. ·The party was unable to p~t 
on an effecti~e·campaign for tht 
SeptOJ!tber 1965 national elections 
and obtained only 2 percent of 
the votes-~short of the 5-percent 
minimum required for representa­
tion in the Bundestag. In local 
electloh·s in. Bavaria and Sch'i'eswig­
Holstein in Ma_rch 1966,· .however, , 
the .NPD ·showe·d that ·it could com­
m:ind pocli:'ets .of s·p:-ength. In the 
Bavarian cities of N_uremberg ari,:I 
Bayreuth, it received be.tween 7 
ahd -10 _percent of the vot_e and __ . 
elected representatives to the lo­
cal _governing councils. These 
gains were facilitated by c9ncen- • 
~rating the party's efforts in 
s~lected·areas such as the Protes­
tant centers of Middle and Upper 
·Franconia in heavily Catholic 
Bavaria. 
The first clear demonstra­
tio~ that the .NPD could attract 
inore than the ultrar.ationalist 
vote came two weeks later· ir1 • 
Hamburg, where the party nearly 
doubled its vote as compared with 
the Bundestag election the year 
before. Although the NPD failed 
to elect any deputies, the Chris­
tian Democrats and the Socialists 
were concerned about its ability 
to se~ure even 3.9 percent of 
the vote. The threat to the tra­
ditional third party, the conserva­
tive Free Democrats (FOP) became 
apparent. The FOP fell a third 
below its 1965 vote and lost 4 of 
its 12 seats in the Hamburg city 
. council. Profiting from a decline 
• in the economy which was already 
under way and the increasing pub­
lic disenchantment with the lead­
ership of then Chancellor Erhard 
in Bonn, the NPD accelerated both 
its organizational effort and its 
public relations campaign. 
The stage was then set for 
the party's breakthrough in the 
Hesse and Bavaria state elections
