SECRET 
D. Both to give QRPHONE/i time to cleanse his 
tattered image and because there ~re almost as 
important operational tasks in West Africa, ih~ idea 
is to move bim (1) to Nigeria or (2) - to ·Ghana ·tor 
perhaps a year. This is to be done ln concert with a 
suitable strengthc,1ing of his cover (i.e. two or 
three more stringerships) and a concurrent mutation 
of bis political posture to that of a plain old 
anti-imperialist rather than the more confining 
pro-Mao stance. He would be run directly by Lagos 
or Accra Station against local targets but with 
periodic trips to other parts of Africa for cover 
as well as operational purposes. Meantime, in the 
intervening months the dust may settle a bit in 
Tanzania, the close association with opposition 
elements would be allowed to fade and QRPHONE/l's 
writings and pronouncements concerning Tanzania would 
be calculatedly designed to support the Nyere government. 
E. At the appropriate time, a year or so perhaps, 
be then moves PCS to Tanzania. 
3. If you concur with the above, I will procede to 
staff this out more formally here at Headquarters and to 
advise U:PIPIT.
