ON THE JOB 
7. The:r.: seems little doubt th:it nUIZ exercise the full 
authority tlrnt presuc::bl:r • he sho,:ld have as 1.Jin.i.stcr Pleni­
pot~ntiarr. The relations between Cuba and Spain appe~r to 
remain st:i tic b-ccause:: of Sp:?in' s rc!u~al to appoint a full 
Ambassador to C'..!ba afte:- LOJE:S-DIO was expelled from .the islnrrl 
by CASTRO in 1959. RUIZ i~ involved in and is kept informed 
-011 all matters relattd to Cuban-Spanish relationG, including 
t~ade. I~ does not seem to permit com~ercial attachris to bypass 
him when they submit re~orts to their respective home offices in 
Havana. In addition, RUIZ takes n keen ar.d active' interesi; in 
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to 
Havana on Iberia without bis permission. He insists that Cuban 
officials nrriving in ~adrid consult with him before arranging 
• visits to Spanish offi·ci:11 s or factories. He seems to have 
good working relations with Spanish covern~ent ofiicials, 
because he is· ah·ays careful to "put all his cards on the table" 
in meetings ~ith the~. (The tenor of his conversation seems to 
emphasize that h~ likes things thi~ way in all hii relations, 
personal a~ well as professional).
