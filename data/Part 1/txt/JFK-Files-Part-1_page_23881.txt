But I HYO Hen in the countr7 numerous tises since then: at neverthe­

not know about it. TbeJ probably were aware, but the7 weren't going to 
bother, anyway. rro■ Lausanne I went to Jillan, Milan to Koae, ftome back to 
~~iis►atadersson again, then Paris, and from Paris to Brussels 
and baek here. Altogether it took three weeks. One could haYe taken
