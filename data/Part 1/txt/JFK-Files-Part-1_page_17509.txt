has already been p,roven, ln a rece11t operation with the LJE·HODE installation· 
as a target. ·Seven reels of "hot m tke" cake were obta hied In test runs on 
checklng both the operation (lncludlng lnsta'llatlon of the "miked" instrument

assigned to Mexico c'fi'y Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, _before con­
tinuous operatloo could'gec underway, the LIEROD~ lnscallatlon ~eclded upon 
complete rem)",raclon of its telephone system, including the lnscallatlon of a 
switchboard. Thls, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against 
thls particular target, unlesl:I a direct llne ls lnsrnlled there. However, it ls

IV~ Performance of Agents 
The overall performance of all agents employed ln the LIFEAT complex con­
tinued co be good during the period of the project review, wlch security belr,g 
saessed ln all phases of the operation. No security problem9 were encountered 
whlch were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the 
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the sec~rlcy of its personnel, Head­
quarters clearances :md ;;:valuation of new pcrsonnd wlll continue to be sought 
on those new additions who pass a strict flcld assessm~nc.
