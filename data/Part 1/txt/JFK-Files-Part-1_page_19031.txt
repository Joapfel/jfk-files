FDP Gains ~ri,t Los_ses 
Tt,ie FOP p~ofi.ted from its 
posi tiori in the opposi-tion_. Ralf 
Dahrendorf, a sociologist r_rom 
the Universit,· of t-onstanz with 
an intcrnatio~al reputation, has 
recently entered the party and 
has assumed a leading role, in­
fluencing the FOP in a leftward 
direction and attracting left­
liberal support. In the Stuttgart 
district where he was a candidate, 
~~c party vote rose by 6 percent. 
On the other hand, the new pat­
tern is not acceptaole to many 
old members o! this tradition-
ally business-oriented party, who 
looking askance at Dahrenclorf's 
readines• to debate and discuss 
with Rudi Dutschke and other rad­
ical students. ·Two of the three_ 
districts with heaviest NPD gains 
also showed heavy FDP losses, as 
did some other former FDP areas 
of s trcng th. 
Perspectives on the Vote 
The over-all picture appears 
to be that while both th~ Chris­
tian Democrats and the Free Demo­
crats lost to the NPD, they gained 
at the expense of the Socialists. 
The So~ialists suffered from 
a~athy and incurre,i some loss to 
both the NPD and De~ocratic Left, 
The N?D probably garnered some 
new and· uncor.uni tted votes. I't _ 
is fortunate for the ·si>D .ieaders 
.in Bonn -that -the al)nual • p,uty 
congress crune be fo_ro -the _·sadcn­
Wilcrt tembcrg elec"t·ion. It is 
hardly likely_ tt!at the c·ongrcss 
would now defeat a motion with­
ho,J._ciirig. endorsement of the coal!-· 
tfon, as it did by a four-vote 
mclrgin ·fn ~larch. Assuming the 
SPD remains faithful to the 
Bonn _coalition now, the prospects 
are for further erosion of its 
stren•gth ar,d for grc-ater diffi­
culties within its zanks. 
Meanwhile, the NPD probably 
will continue to ·grow_ in in­
fluence. It now is probably 
stronger in some other .are.as 
than in Oaden-Wuerttembcrg. A
