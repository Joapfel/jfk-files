it is the opinion of this examiner, that the 
mother's over-solicitousness was compensatory for her basic rejection 
of the Subject. It is not likely that she did things for him but that she 
did things to and :with him for herself. In other words, she wanted the 
Subject to be perfect ·so that he could be worthy of her love. This may 
also have been her .attitude toward her husband. The Subject did not 
behav.e perfectly, dici".not,meri,t her love an<i-consequcntly ~ppears to
