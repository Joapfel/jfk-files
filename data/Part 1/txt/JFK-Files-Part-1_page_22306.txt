in the spring of 1!160, • he l<·arned fro.n GP.Y.\~OV that he 
(GRYAZ~OV) had dcvrloped an operation against an American 
military code clerk to the pc,1:,t that the KGB •·as "99 
p,ir c.:cnt" certain that u. r~c1·uit1tent &pproa<:h to this code 
cl"rk wt>uld be succcsRful. GOLITSYS said tli:.t C:RY . .\Z~OV 
I 
t 
told hia that this would be tbe first recruitment of a mili­
tary code clerk (as contrasted to a State Department code 
clerk) in the history of tbe American Department. 'l'he_re 
were only t~o persons meeting this criterion who were in 
M~sr.ow at the tine GOLITSr.-l placed this visit, STORSBERG 
ar.d IIL1tLEY; the t>upc-rior of STORSiu:RG, HURLEY performed 
hac·k-up crypto~raphic duties in SlORSUERG • s abscncr.. l f 
~ost:SKO 's report that there was no develop::wr,t of or approach 
to HtrnLEY can b<J accepted, this 1.-.ad from GOLITS\:l would 
apply to STORSDERG rather than lll'RLEY. Thrre is s conflict 
h,)t·,,..ccn SOSES"KO's in format ion 011 the STORSBERG case :>.nd this 
st-co!ld GOLI1S\'"S lP.ad in H.at GOLITS\"N described an operation 
whi~h was in its final stages in the spring of 1960, 9hDreas 
~OS£:'\'KO (as well ai STORSBE.PG) asserted that the STORSBFF.G 
op-,ration wa:; Just under "·ay at this timo and was long and 
rlrawn-out. 
Apart from the STORSBEr.G operation, r;-OSE~7m has been 
able to supply the greatest amount of detail concerning the 
operation (also unsuccessful) acair.st the State Depart~ent 
pouch clerk Paul JE~~ER (Pages 186-1~6). This case developed 
as a result of an idea or1~inated by NOSESKO himself shortly 
after he arrived in the c.s. Embassy Section. B~cause of 
the> i:'.access1bility of American c::v!f:' clerk,; to the iGB in 
Moscow, it was :SOSF:~KO's plan to send a KGB officer to llel­
s1~k1 in order to strike up an acquair.tance with a code 
cl<>rk c-nterini: tho Soviet Cnion aboard the Helsinki-~oscow 
tritin. The first (ar.d last) time this was atte'tlptt'd, NO­
sr.~~O related, was in March 1900, when the K0B l~arned that 
Jl::S~,ER, listc,d as a "secretary-archivist" and thu,;;· a~sumed 
by th,~ KGB to be a code clerk, was sch£'dulcd to transit 
Hul~lnki en rout~ to his assign~cnt at thr. C.S. Embassy in 
)(uschw. Und,:1· ~OSEN KO• s !=UpE>rv is ion KOSOL . .\PO\' therefore . 
traw•llcd to Helsinki and boarued the ~a:!\l' train as JE:\"?-t""ER.' 
Addi t; ionally, lin.Y,\ZSOV took a KGil female ager. t to the town.' 
of l".yborg, on the Finno-Soviet border, and placed her on the 
saar, train. Both KOSOLAPOV and th"' femal~ agc-:it met and 
spokc- t11i th JE~"'!\'ER en route to }l.:>~cow, and th~ girl gave him 
her telephone number, askinK hi= to call her. After JO~"ER's 
arrival in Moscow, both KOSOLAPOY and GRYAZ~OV subnitted 
writtP.n reports to XOS~KO describing the contact~ on the 
train. Although the KGB later round out that JE~~ER was only 
a pouch clerk, not a cryptographer, he was considered of 
intr,rr:st and when JE:'\~""ER failed to telephone the fi:-male 
agent, the two -.·ere bro-:.ight together in a ''chance m.eeting" 
at the Moscow airport. Jn"'!\"ER~ would have no part of the 
agent's invitations, however, and the operation therefore 
went no. further. 
•When NOSENKO was told of the GOLITSYN visit in May or June 
1960, be denied that it took place, saying that be ceces­
sarily would know if it had.
