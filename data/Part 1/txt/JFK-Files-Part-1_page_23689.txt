the V-20 as the Intermediate Craft (IC) for this opera-
tion and substitute a 17' Johnson boat with tlrin 75 hp. 
outboard notora wb.1cb could eaneuver tru·ougb shallower 
water aod which could be more easily canou.flaged. The 
basic reason for this decision was the fact tbat Decem-
ber through February are the low-water months in tho 
Al!'rntllt'X operational a.rAa. Dllr!n: this eh~llow water 
seasc,a, the heavier. wider V-20 CaJI only be used in the 
deoper and sore beaYily-gwi.rded infiltration canals.

P/A, aDd A.UGJU:.&-1 a.nd A!UKA-1. four radio operator 
ca.ndidatea. to be trainocl for future uso in Plf opura­
tiona. were recruited during the reporting period. 
B. llecruitina for lmAPBON infiltration ca11didates coo­
tinued during the reporting period. One prospective 
i~iltree was recruited during the ~ontb of November 
and tbe case officer was active ia assessing and debrief­
ing~ other candidates. It 1s hoped that by March 1965 
one or aore of these candidates will be trained and pre­
pared for infiltration for clandestine lruAPnOH recruit­
ing. In large aneasure this will depend upon the success 
of Oporation AlITEUNJt X in re-orga.n.J.&ing the ratline to
