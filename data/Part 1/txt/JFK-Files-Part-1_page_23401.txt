a business which he h, enthusiast.ic about and is a more natural 
place for HlliT-anist-2 to ~ake unooserved contacts. It also 
supplies Hur~anoid with a more access~ble spot and efficient means 
to photostat mail intercepts ~nd return the~ to the po~t office 
in ti;ne insteaci of com,.utin~ back and forth from his home in 
the suburbs of San Jos,. -
c. Therefore, it is sug1ested that Humanoid's semi-weekly 
contacts with Hwr.anist-2, instead of being cancelled, be changed 
to a weekly_letterdrop, and a live contact once a month to take 
care of salary pay:::ents and briefing. This lettercirop can be 
effected by Humanist-2 passing by the photo shop at night and 
dropping his messa~es through the slot in the door usually used 
for after-hours delivery of films to be developed. The film 
drop will be into a padlocked box, accessible only to Humanoid. 
d. ReP-ardin£ Humanoid's contact~ with P.umankind-1 and 
Humankind-), these are conducted in a thoroughly safe manner. 
Mail extracted from postal channels by them is deposited in an 
envelope and placed in a post office box. It is checked daily 
by Humanoid, and if anything is.there, it is removed, photostated, 
and returned by him the same ciay. If anyone is noticed hanging 
a~ound the post office boxes, Humanoid does not go near the box 
and returns later when the way ~s clear. . 
e. Another factor has arisen since the last dispatch which 
has made this oost office ooeration more secure in that the 
.Director of the Post Office.is now beholden to Humanoid. In a 
recent legal squabble noted in th.e press which was raised by a 
local Com..,,uni st co:iplaining about the government confiscating 
his mail from abroad, the governwent desired to prove that this 
mail was Col:ln:unist propa~anda which they had a right to confiscate, 
and the President therefore requested the-Director of the Post­
Office to furnish sa::.ples to prove this point. With this ."heat" 
on him,.the Director made a frantic appeal to Humanoid, who was. 
able to procure these samples for him, ~ich satisfied the 
President, and for which.the.-Dfrector was truly t:rateful. 
Therefore, no trouble is 'expected. from this inter_cept _operation 
as long as the present personnel-are being used, and ample warning 
will be given Hl.ll!lanoid in advance of any change in the present 
attitude •
