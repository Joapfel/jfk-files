concerning w}1om NOSENKO :..as fu::::-nished information. NOSENKO 
has identified ZENi<IN {whose first na1ne he does not recall but 
possibly is Yul"iy) as an office:r oi t:1e Second Section, First Depart-
ment, SCD. Acco:.:-<ling to NOSZNKO, one group of the Second Section • 
both before and a:fter 1960 - 1961 was .engaged in 11 ope:-ative games" 
against American Intelligence and that ZENKIN was a :member of this 
group. NOSENKO has advised that ZENKIN t:raveled a~road i..---.. cor.:iection 
witn activities of the Second Section, bu: that he had no specific 'k.. .. owledge 
. . 
regarding the activities oi ZENKIN on t!,.ese t:rips. • NOSENKO has iur-
nished some fragmentary information w}-... ich he learned in regard to· 
ZENKIN and when the full name of SERGEYEV (Z:SNKIN) together with 
nis photograph is obtained, this fragmentary information from NOS ENKO 
may prove quite useful. 
As regards the KOSOLAPOV .{GARLAND 1 matter and the opinion 
expressed by GOLITSYN based on the refusal of ZENKIN to discuss the 
case {GARLAND) that it must have resulted in a successfa.il rec:ruitment, 
there appears to be an inadequate basis for this presumption. According· 
to NOSENKO, and there is no reason to disbelieve NOSENKO on this 
point, ZENKIN was in foe Second Section, not fo.e First Section, in 
1960 - 1961. He was not Chief of the Section, but only a Senior Case
