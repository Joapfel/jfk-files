1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/l"s 
lack of financial forward planning. LCPIPIT believes that it would 
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a 
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both 
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis­
cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of 
such a program. He is willing to participate in such .an arrangement 
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him. 
We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals 
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable 
WOLADY insurance firm. 
2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the 
cost of.i life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion 
not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint 
this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and 
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were 
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.
