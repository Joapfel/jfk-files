Present Situation: 
9. In early February, 1966, Hunkeler met with a Case 
Officer of_ the_ Cracas Station who reviewed Hunkelers existing 
business activities in Venezuela and who told Hunkeler that 
/ the Caracas Station desired to use a Hunkeler company for 
non-official cover purposes in Venezuela. The success 
of Hunkelers coml!lercial activities in tt.e Dominican Republic 
(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office 
in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not 
yet been time to query Station Santo Dooingo as to whether or 
not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilities. 
(Hunkeler is presently phasing out of ouch organiz~tional 
work in the WAVE area in order to devote more. time ~to the 
chore of setting up his operations in Santo Domingo and 
Yenezuela v1here both of his companies are currently doing 
business.) 
10. There are several aspects of Hunkelers present business 
. ' 
activities which have not yet been finalized: He will soon 
terminate his lease at' his present ·address and has not yet 
decided where to re-locate !,is off'i::es; he is still in 
negotiations with an investcent group in Haiti and may 
undertak~ a consultant type survey there which would provide 
access to Haiti of possible interest to that Station.
