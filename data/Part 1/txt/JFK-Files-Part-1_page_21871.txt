• - <my with great difficulty that I was able to got away 
for the t~ip in January_ 1964. It was necessary to con­
vince CHE~~OKOV and then to ask CJIELNOKOV to convince 
BOBKOV and in 1963 to convince KOVALENKO. In this r 
advanced many reasons: that I had not spen~ all the 
money (in foreign currency); that the medicine which 
• ~·\:' ·, '.:. : 
I bought for my daughter·had proven very successful 
and that I needed to buy some more medicine to car=y 
out one more series of treatments; that this trip 
would not be a long one and that since I was'already 
the deputy chief of the Department I would not be -able 
to travel abroad any more and so, therefore, this trip 
would probably be my .last. Of course, all this was 
said at convenient moments and outside of work. 
Things were easier with the Eleventh Department (which 
deals with trips abroad) because I was on good terms 
with PENCHENKO who covered Switzerland, besides which· 
when I came back from Geneva in 1962 I had orought him 
a number of presents. 
•1a. The publlcation in 1963 by the forelgn press 
of the 'lASSALL case put me on my guard since in the 
newspaper Times it said outright that the English 
learned aboui:'nim thanks to the A.r:1ericans who learned 
about VASSALL in the spring of 1962. Fortm1.:1tely, the 
leadership of the FCD,as I learned from GVK,·CHURANOV, 
and TARABRIN, came to the conclusion that here the 
Americans had been helped by GOLI?SYN. But: at the 
same time the FCD was not completely sure of this. 
But the publication in the American press of Alsop's 
articles on the CIA alarmed me extremely. This ar­
ticle in one spot said plainly that as far as is known 
the KGB does not have any ~ources in the CIA while at 
the same tjme the CIA has penetrated the KGB. From 
this moment, I do not conceal this tact, I began to 
feel afraid that the KGB would someho~ learn of my con­
tact with you. This article deeply 'interested' the 
KGB. 
•19. During the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I 
got,a pass in the Second Department and went in order 
to look at him myself, For sometimes it is enough 
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself 
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort 
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked how 
PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked his ap·­
pearance and I understood that everything which had 
been said in the KGB about him and· the sort of per;son 
th~y were trying to make him out to be (that he was 
morally degraded, that he had descended and sunk into 
a swamp) that all this was nonsense, bluff, and chatter. 
And PENKOVSKIY, the same as GOLITSYN, gave me a feeling 
of greater confidence in the correctness of the deci­
sion taken by me to leave the Soviet Union.
