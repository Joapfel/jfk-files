For exsmple, I wns 1n ~vann in .'.!'~ly after hurric!lne 'J.m· hit Western: Cuba 
la,st J\.uie, a. _number ·of hiildiliE~ and hous.es h,'td to be. Fe~ired aU over-. the

·'lnother 'inaunple 'is - that \he food quota on the ·-rat.ion booit is largel7 a, 
"paper•· reality. tAtat I ~an is ttnt the food on the book is rarely available, 
and whole months paas without o:ny meat, lard, oil, rice, beans, being distrib- • 
utod. ,\t this pr,ecise time, in lhva.n~, ttiere -are no seasoning ingredients avail­
able to tha consumer. When the P.J"oduct is available again,_ the meager boc;>k 
quota is what each one gets, vithout any compensation for the tilne during wblr.b 
he could not even get t!ts,t. 
"8 a result of this, queue~ lil"O longer every dill; vith people· _st.yl!f~ la~" ·.o 
line • since the early. 1r0rning hours to rinke sure t-hat they von 1 t ·be left ~out. 
1~~ are of.ten fights am :even mihor riots at the queues on account or their-
ritation that this si:tuatio:il causes-. • • 
Also I have. seen that • the .regime ·1s opening rrnny new restaurnnts~ ai1egecl-
ly to: make reereat~on facj,-lities available to the. i>e?pie. In reality, ~ever, 
what they seek is- ~ ·extract money from circulation, as the prices at these ili1V 
pla:~es are extrat;,rdinarily high; Hence_, only tho_ members of the ruling lliJeV 
cl~ss" may enj'?J" the nev _spots, as th·e wor~ing people could never afford them. ••• 
I ~l be ~PPY to. attempt· t6 answer any _questj,ons .that you may have re­
garcUn,g t:hose m:eas ot u:re· or c,f events in Cuba today with which 1· am familiar.
