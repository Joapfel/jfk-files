(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
Purpose of Geneva Trip 
NOSENKO explained that it was his personal wish that 
had brought him to'Geneva, that he was allowed to travel as 
"a treat" when it appeared to be the last occasion he might 
have to travel to the l'lest. [NOSElTKO said in 1962 that when 
he became Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, as he 
expected to become, he would travel to the Nest every two 
or three years.] He had discussed the possibility of the 
trip in 1963 with then-Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV, 
and secured his agreement. He also talked with officers 
of the Soviet Delegations Department, but after it had been 
deci.ded that he should go, the Chief of that Department, 
[N.T.] ZHARIKOV, suggested that it might be unnecessary for 
a security officer to ac~ompany this particular delegation. 
[A.G.] KOVALENKO,·the hew Chief of the Seventh Department, 
supported NOSENKO's assignment as a personal favor. 'Although 
at one time NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV approved the trip, he 
has later·asserted ·that GRIBANQV.wasnot involved and that 
if GRIBANOV had learned of NOSENKO's plans, he would:not 
have permitted NOSENKO to go. 
. . NOSENKO ~.s only mission was to concern himself with the 
general security of the delegation, ashe had done.in 1962. 
He had no specific tasks such.as on his earlier assignment 
(e.g., · investigating SJAKIDV or supervising the BELITSKIY 
operation). • 
c;:omrnent: . NOSENKO has n.ever. satisfactorily explained why 
a Deputy Chief_ of·the.Seventh Department would 
draw an unrelated assignment abroad· which 
would ~ast many weeks if not months. In 
another context, NOSENKO ·had described a KGB 
conference to take place about this time where 
plans were to be drawn up for KGB operations 
during the corning tourist· season: he ·acknow­
ledged that he was expected to attend, but 
nevertheless went to Geneva.
