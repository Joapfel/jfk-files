frOl!I a rlirect appro.1.:h to the vlolator11 by 1.NCOLL,\R offln•r IDEN E, wh<' 
had c,:,::e to Key \..',·,,t unbeknownst to IDf-:N ,\. Through frit•n,°l,i i!'I Miami, 
IDES A foun,l out l[lf.N t,; 1,;as in ch.1rgc of lDEN A's ·op .. r<'tlon in Key West, 
had a hocos<!xu.:il rel:Hionship •Jlth IDES F which went back f,>r mnny ycari, 
(and was resp,.msihh• for the bn,akup of IDI::N l::'s first u~irriagt•), had big 
real estate Jealtl i:l>lng in Miao!, had 11 Sviss bank account, and was still 
using SKHERALO cover 111 Miami. • 
11. IDEN P, vho was aware of IDEN E's LNCOLUR connection, and t~ 
other !..'-COLLAR assct!l iri the Miami area, h:1J agreed to assist LNCOLLAR 
only if L"COLIJ\R off lcials could guarantee IDf:N E vould never know of 
thei.,. refationship or see any of thci r infor~.>.1nt reports. !DEN I arranged 
for this throu&l, ~utN C, and the three agents' files were placed in 
lDE..'l ~•s· sa"re. lDEN A subsequently has lcarneJ IDEN E routinely saw 
all of IDE."i P's repotts. Later, when the revelations in the pn:ceJing 
paragraph were k:t~vn, OIDEN I _told IDEN A there were many allegations about 
IDEN E, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN· C. lDEN C had ·assured .. 
him he would be brought to Washingtor~ to discuss the i..atter, but nothing' 
ever CS!!le of it. Ironically, IDEU E was taken into LllsCOLLAR on th~ o·rders 
of L'\COLL.-\.~ Director IDE.'l R, and it was specified that no clearance·_o·r 
background check would be undertaken on him. 
12. ·IDE~ I and lDE.'l A decided to .1ppro,ich IDEN F to learn more about 
IDE.~ E~ During a ono hour d_iscussion, IDF.N F said he had been appointed 
the recruiting officer within BKHERAI.D for persons who ·would go to 
LNCOLL.\R~- IDEN F sa-id he had kno1,1n IDEN E for -a long period of time, and 
had brought him a long in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes li)EN F 
_also engineere<l the 1bsence of a security check on IDEN Eby LNCOLLAR 
since he did nc>t; wnnt his homosexual relationship •with IDF.N E revealed. 
At that point lDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what h&d been 
learned, including IDEN F's admission th:it IDEN E had told him IDEN A 
was an LNCOLLAR asset. IDEN G denied knoving IDEN F, but said he would 
-check on IDEN E. lDEN A met with IDEN G the next day in Miami to fill 
him in furthe.r; ·and li>EN C ordered a .full investigation. In the meantime, 
IDEN F told IDEN E of· his ·rneeting·vith IDF.N ~ and IDEN A, and IDEN E 
-wrote a mecorandum saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) ·had c;,vet-
. stepped the bounds. ·of propriety in _his relationship with an LNCOLLAR 
as·set (IDEN A), awl that IDEN "t and IDEN A were running an investigation 
oo !DEX E. IDEN E described the situ:nion as "intolerable':. The L.'lCOLLAR 
inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in 
discussing an LNCOLLAR employee w-ith an .asset. The Internal Affairs 
section of L'<COLLAR did cuntinue the IDEN E proue and concluded by May 1975 
that the charges a1,alnst IDEN E were accura~c. In thu meantime, IDEN 1 
was interrogated by IDEN Mon his re~tionshtp with IDEN A.
