Ref, On.A 429 706 
1. Ref forwarded the tapes and a roug!l transoription of the debriefing 
session vith Subject, which were held on February 17, 1S, 19, 2), 1965. 
2. In aooordanoe vith ~eadquart.e~s• instructions, these maetinga 
were kept on a don•t-oall-,_1s-,,;u 1 ll-oa.ll-7ou basis - in fact GIBSON waa given 
no means tor calline us. Also in aooordanoe vith ~ea1q~artere 1 inetr11otions, 
ve did not pay GIBSON at a constant rat& of over $100 _per hour. The first 
, ($300) pa,yment to GIHSOR vas in fact more than we had originally inten48d to 
give bi.a as a "binder", but in light of the i111111inenoe of his trip to ~ope 
v-;. advA.nced him that sum ~o help him to meet his expenses. Tt,is nicely 
·ooincided vith our own time table, since the time he vas gone - some three 
weeks - should have provided adequate time for the initial ta:i:e to be 
reviewed and for requirements to be r,r'3parell. and ponohed to the field. At 
Bil¥ rate, the total sum given to OIBSON, tor his time and a ahot at his 
111&11111£ list, was 1700. 
3. LCH.l..'ltVEST may vel 1 teel that it has been done out of $700 in COA 
t'unda. The inton.ation obtained on ChiCom contacts ot GIBSON, or on an:, 
,, ChiComs at all, waa slight. GIBSCll olaims not to bave hail more than very 
little contact with them, and not to know too much about them. Unl9ee t~era 
ia hard info to ti1e contrary, ve are inclined to balieve that GTIISO~ vas 
tellin& pretty much the truth in this resi:,ect, as inileeil seems to have been 
the oaee almost all of the time. While this le a bit of a disappointment, 
in a way, and 888118 to lessen the il!ll'leiiaoy of L~RAR~T interest, it 
certainly does not appear to eliminate crnsow•s potential worth. 
4. The London Station ccn~inues to feel that GIBSON has considerable 
potential as a source of positive intelligence on a wide Tangs of targets -
targets that appear to be only lightly covered otherwise, although we 8!"8 
not alV8,YB able to judge this. A review of thi<J !ebriefing C!L!l only cause 
one a oertain amount of &111aze11ent at G!DSON' s encyoloped.ic knovledp of •any, 
ll8IQ' groups, personalities and parties or the far lett, 11 tsrally trcm • 
.America to Zanzibar. Ve leave 1 t to Headquarters, o~ oours9~ to evaluate
