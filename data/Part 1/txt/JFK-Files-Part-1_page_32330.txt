In a very short time, Mr. Flores has becor.ie an important factor in LA/COG Is efforts to directly hand le ··cuban on-island a~ents, and to expand its recruitment program. Iii s flu<'nt Spanish, past operational experience, versatility and ability to blend into the local scene in most Lat in American countries, make him highlr qualified for his present assignment. lie demonstrates sound oper:itional judgment under often trying conditions, and good ability to communicate effectively both orally and in writing. His frequent TDYs demand long and unusual hours, which he gives ungrudgingly. 
Almost immediately after his assignment to LA/COG in March 1974, 
Mr. Flores was c=ailed upon to handle a sensitive walk-in case. The agent had already' been recruited and many of the developmental aspects of the case had been resolved 
b
rior to Mr. Flores~ introduction, but it still required a Headquarters ased case officer to provide the neces-sary continuity wherever the- agent surfaced overseas. The case is com-plicated and time-consuming, involving extended TDYs and utmost adherence to good tradecraft procedures, It has developed into one of our most product ive: __ sources of information on Cuban clandestine

3. BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL 
COMMU•T• o, ••v1cw1Na OP'rlCIAL. 
I concur with the rating officer's comments and performance evalua-
tion. Soon after his arrival at·LA/COG, Mr. Flores took over the 
handling of a sensitive agent. While the agent's bona fides had already been established and -his modus operandi determined, considerable ad hoc 
judgement and direction W<:?re required to continue the agent's motivation 
and ensure his viability. Mr. Flores did extremely \,'e 11 in his guidance 
of the agent in a series of complicated, extended meetings ,,hich took 
place in several LA countries. Good, professional tradecraft and sound 
judgement were exhibited by ~Ir. Flores.
