~!f.M)RA'fil.N R>R: Deputy Director for Operations 
StlBJ1:CT: Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recoliinendation: 
Fred Randall 
1. We've spoken of the need td look further at both Agency 
and D00 implications: of the Freedom of Infonnation Act and, now, 
the Privacy Ac~. including the. increased number of appeals and 
litigation cases,.Md of the logic of collecting a coterie of 
deponents or affiants to take ~e of the load off of both you 
and me. The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents 
must include 14' s and 15' s, to incojporate the_ necessary clout 
with ~~e divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information 
to the out~ide. world. 
2. Fred is a GS-i4/7. He had jlJst cane to me at the tjme of 
the last GS-IS panel exercise and had not been recommended for 
promotion by FRD.' i consider his performance over the past 6 months 
to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other 
directorates' fIOs; I have co~siderable laudatory testimony from 
OGC, OLC, 0/DDA and within the D00 as to his professionalism, tact, 
persuasiveness, ~alytic skills and realistic, while tough-min<le<l, 
, protection: of D00 sources and methods. This includes occasional 
arm-wrestling with D00 branch/division/staff chiefs, OGC and OLC 
lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his-current gr:ide level. 
3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle prorotion 
reconme.ndat ion to GS-15 with Ev, who, in tum, has mentioned it 
to r.ardon. The re.tum signals I got ~ounde<l positive. 
,4. 1 d9, therefore, reco1TJnend that you. approve Fred's prornotion 
to GS-15, effective as soon as the action c:in he cut.
