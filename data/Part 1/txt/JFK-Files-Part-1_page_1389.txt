to <;iuanabo or Havana and safehouse .him .. This, however, may 
jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks th~ maturity and 
pati~nce necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
• ness. ·ae may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under­
take a clandestine assignment on his own.· When A/2 and 3 
ste·p ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately A/2 
- ha~ .a suffic~ent resource of judgement to go about.his busi­
ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication. 
For this reason an attempt will be made.to steer A/3 towards 
developing assets ·around his {!_a ther 's far€) with maritime 
reception ~apabilities. L1

2 .. A/2, on the othe:r hand, appears to ~ve a sufficient -numbeJ 
of supporting assets ·t9lJrI'OV4ie f<>,! his6safety while in Havana 
However, he has not- seeH\.YALSJandl_PUARTE]for over a year. In 
addition_ both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army 
. organization and this position may dampen .their eJ;f~cti~'funess 
:j..n recrui_ting. within the Army. f. Station reports o~l.9UART:§ con­
·flict with A/2's evaluaµon o:rhis man. While there is no 
evidence to v.e.rify that {DUARTE is pro-regime, th~e ha~been 
a reGent report. on him from AM EO/3 which claims(EUARTE is an 
opportunist who might work for th~highest[bidder.~CA/ 's . 
rebutta·l. to these remarks is that. DUARTE_)t{4s assisted him in 
the past" and when the -chips wer~ own he continued to aid him 
in his under~round activities.o~~his still leaves a question 
mark next to the worth ofl._9UARTE.)vhich unfortunately can only 
be resolved by direct cont·act between him and A/2. There are 
other secµrity implications which should be discussed in this 
evaluation. Both A/2 -and A/3 cannot be considered truly se­
curity·conscious. Whi~~ safehoused A/2 wrote a letter to a 
·contact in· Miami which was to be transmitted by his case 
officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking 
contacts in Havana and conveyed the impre.ssion that a trip 
was in the cffing. A/2 has written several other letters 
no·t seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres­
sion. A/3 on the other hand talirfd g9it3 freely about his on to four friends in New ork rior to comin to 
as J.o ning 
AMICE and AMTR K .on an operation that would take them 
first ~Miami_ and th~i to Cuba. Once there they would go 
to ~is father's farmladd begin,.t.o make contacts. ~/3 also 
stated· at a man nded @_UART~~ould be one of the:1-r con­
tacts. This loose talk coupled with A/3's attitude that 
KUBARK exists· only to serve him makes him a marginal candi­
_da te for this operation. Howevet, if A/3.is exfiltrated 
' .<.t"hree -days after his .entry into Cuba, the operation will 
•. ~ain 1 his us~fulness and eliminate some of the risk he 
presents ..
