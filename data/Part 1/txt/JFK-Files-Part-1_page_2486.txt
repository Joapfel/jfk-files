The following comments a.1·e concerned with several specific 
cases in whiC:-1, acco::di:r..g -::o N'GSENKO, there was a~ app::oach by the 
KGB, interestir4g bfo::mation was developed, or in whid1 at least a 
conside.:-able amour4;: o:f specific wo:.:-k was ca::ried out by NOSENKO, 
KOSOLAPOV and GR YAZNOV. 
The :first case, (James STORSBERG; is covered on pages 166 -
177 of the previous sum..--nary. Little adc:.itional com..--nent is considered 
necessary on this case since there cioes not appear to be ar.y adequate 
reason to question the general sto.:-y oi NOSE?\KO i:..1. regard to the KGB 
,- -, 
effort againsttSTORSBERGj. 
It is recognized and mentioned elsewhere that NOSENKO in 1962 
exaggerated his personal involvement in the case, particularly in placbg 
himself as present wit;;i GRIBANOV when the recrui~ue:c.t pitch wa.s made 
to 1STORSBERG/. NOS:SNKO has retracted this particular claim, but 
there is no reason to doubt that he was engaged for approximately a year 
in the planning and activities which preceded fo.e unsucce.ssfo.l app.:-oach 
to\STORSBERG). 
An issue was previously made over the tirnil:g of the app1·02..ch 
to;STORSBE~G; since STC:.:<.SBZRG) dated this as Octooe:::- 1961, NOSEN:-<:o
