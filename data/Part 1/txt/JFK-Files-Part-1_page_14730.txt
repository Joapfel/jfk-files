'6. Source d'esct.ibed -KGB influer.te as "o.verwhelming". For example, 
a· Soviet going abroad.on an offfcfa.1 assignment cann·ot refu"se. to 
. cooperate with the KGB because such refusal ·would mean that t_he 
person wouldn't be abl_e to :travel, ias the KGB has a· say about his 
final clearan_ce. Source also gave the example of an a.pplicant for an 
unimportant joti ~ith the Minsk Symphony who ~as ~r1ginally turned 
down .. But when,.,A~SENOV spoke to th·e KGB offfcer responsible for the 
Symphony, the ap·pncant was not only hir'_ed but received the greatest 
respect from .the Symphony 01 rector during the entire period of h·; s 
e~ployment. • 
7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavnikt) 
because they:are considered politi~ally reliable and ~atriot1c. 
Many otstavniki • recruited by th_e_ KGB are former Osobjy otdel (Special 
.~ection, secut1ty functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for 
them .. Such retirees are fr.equently used in stationary positions, • 
re~6rting on or guardfn~ specific areas. • 
8. Since the KGB relies.on spotters for the selection of its 
agents, the spotters ttiemselv_es can get into trouble if they recommend 
the "wrongll_ person .. This means·ttiat the spotters are afraid to select 
clever people, so in~the end they se1ect mediocre ones. Selection 
is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer 
is a kolkhoznik, he ·;s •immediately 50% qualified. If he was in the . 
· Army. particularly ir. the Osobyy otdel. th_is ad<ls another 30'.t. Other 
qualifi~ations are ba~ed on the person's being "quiet", "average". 
or "ord1na·ryll. •
