13 July 1965 
I'~ pleased you have received at least one of my letters, 
. but I still wonder if you got a large -~~velope containin~ three 
letters which had·been heii and retu~~ll at once. As one of 
the let~ers was rather detailed and dealt with matters of so:e 
icporta::.ce, I'm rather disconcerted -- to say the least -- :t:=:z 
to think that it cay not have found its way to you. The enveloye 
measured 8 by 5 inches an~,was light t~ in color. A confir::a­
Uon 0£ its receipt would•· be appreciated. 
Of course, I understood about the service, the newsletter, 
not being a definite thing. In a:y case, I a~ not loo~ing for 
a s1nec~re, but !er n good, deep cover and that seemed to be o:e. 
It also gave me so~ething to offer contacts •.. ~ and would have 
stranr;the:ied m.y position considerably. At present, my cover,1s 
as light as the ~peror 1 s new clothes. • 
-"-:· , Still no positive reply from any publication 1n the States, 
and the general s1le:ce fro!ll '!!JY A:::erican 11 friends 11 ls not very 
encouraging. Here, the situation is much.better,.and if I can 
get to Algiers in good ti~e, after visiting Gr1ppa and Andersso~ 
and seeing so:e contacts in Paris, my position will be better, 
but I still see myself representing the West Indian G-azette or 
Oinnaoon and/or the Institute of Race Rela tio::.s. ,·.rs. S~e1la 
Patterso~, their editor, even sug5ested that I do a Short paper-· 
back book for them, gathering together the conference doctutents 
with a::i. a=alysis. ill of this is better than nothing, but 1t 
de£1n1tely isn't much. 
On the other hand, for the future, lloureddine Medjd-ouo, 
who has been Tunisian cultU!'al attache here, is returning to 
Tunis to take over the editorship ot the Socialist Destour ?arty 
paper, L1 Act1on. He has su~~est~d that I write some features 
for him,~ the Atro-As!a:i Conference in Algiers and that I 
try toge; to funls to discuss future projects with him while 
I am 1n ?iorth Africa. You well know what cany Africans and 
Arabs thi!lk of fw::.isia at present, so there may not be much 
that we can do with this arrange~ent. 
fh1s afternoon, I saw Dennis Phonbeah at the fan;anian 
High Oo=ission. U,2til three.~onths ago, h~ was at the U.N. 
He clai~s that Verges ca~e to London last Dece=ber and saw Babu 
about ~e and other :atters, but that Babu was not convinced. 
He says he did not know that I was in London until recently -
. this was our first ~eeting s~;ce the spring of 1964. Now, he 
proposes that he try to get the editorth1p of Tr.e Nat1o~ali3t, 
the fJliU paper 1n Dar es SalaeJJ,for me. We will discuss the 
matter again at lunch next Uonday. It would be a fixed post . 
1n Dar and I cu 1t yet ~fatho~ why he is willing to suggest 
me for the job. Re clai:s he has not been 1n touch with Verg""es.
