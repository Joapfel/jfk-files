. c .. As a penetration of a Communist Party {i;INL~,C~ 
was a singleton. , Al though as a. former Commucist leader 
he has had experience in handling people, he has not 
had experience in handling sub-agents for WOFI~M. There 
was evide.J}ce du1·ing the reporting reriod that ~INLUCK)OI 
was having real trouble managing t,ls co-workers in 
LIANCHOR. However, hnndicapped by the fact that he was 
not paying his co-workers fees or salaries, ~INLUC~).o J 
probn.bly did as well ns he could in controlling his 
.. co-workers. The real fault J.ay ir his poor selection 
of co-\l·orkers. 
11. Effectiveness of LIANCHOR Arti~les~lnd Fe~tures: in 
the Station's opinion tho5a articles wh{ch(LINLUCKjwrote were 
• forceful and effective, but too long. The articles written by 
ol(i,INLUCK's) co-workers apparently were in•:!ffective to the point 
I 
that they were not considered worth pu')Lishing. ?e Capri.lea 
newspaper chain of Venezuela apparently felt tbat(..!.,INLUCK's)ot 
articles were well worth running, despite the fact that they 
bad to be published in installmcn\s. The leading newspapers 
in,each of th~ Central American republics appeared to believe 
ttfat(LINLUCK'sJ articles _merited automatic publication. It is 
assumed thP.tU,INLUCK'~articles were published :regularly in _ c::,­
Bolivia due0 \to La Paz Station assistance~ However, because no o 
newspaper felt like paying fees to LIANCHOR or answering~INLUCK'~ 
correspondence, it has not been possible to ascertain whether 
LIANCHOR articles have been published with any regularity in 
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia 9r Ecuador. It is too much 
to ask third country stations to scan the press daily for a~ticles 
by seven different people. The Mexic2 s..tation h\-s appreciated 
the assistance received from the~ara~il:lJ ~aJb:idse)@nd Guatemala(~ 
CitY)Stations which have been the principal source of the clip­
ping-s oi1(i.INLUCK's)LIANCHOR articles submitted as _Separate Cover 
Attachment "B" to this dispatch.
