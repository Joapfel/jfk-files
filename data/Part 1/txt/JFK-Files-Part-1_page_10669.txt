Bureau's position, both then and now, apparently is that 
Souza has little potential as an asset for internal security 
■atters and therefore would not justify any substantial fi• 
aancial obligatian. In very low key, it was made clear to 
O'Brien that the Agency was interested in Souza's Positive 
Intelligence potential (his access in Havana should be good, 
given his long friendship with Roa and his closeness to 
Marla Celia Girona Fern4ndez (201-327421), cousin of Celia 
S4~chez Mand~ley) and well might find justification for ~ro• 
Yiding modest. security for Souza's old ~ge. •
