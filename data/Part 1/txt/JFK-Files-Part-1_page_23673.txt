SNAP-OY SIGHT HOOD FOR 
THE 7.62 BELGIUll (FAL) RIFLE 
1. The sight hood snaps over tho existing rear sight on 
the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) rifle. It is designed to raise the rear 
sight to compensate for the more curving trajectory of the under­
loaded ammunition and is an open sight for increased night sighting 
capability. 
2. The sight hood is oriented with the three screws facing 
the muzzle end of the rifle (See attached drawings). Press 
down on the hood until the ball detent snaps into the peep hole 
3. The slot for the existing rear sight is made tight 
so that the hood will fit firmly in place, If it fails to fit, 
file the existing rear sight as necessary. If the sight fits 
the slot but is difficult to snap on and off, or is too loose. 
adjust the ball detcnt by turning the center set screw on the 
sight hood. 
4. The weapon must be zeroed on a known distance firing 
range to determine the sight settings and proper sight picture 
for standard and underloaded ammunition when using tho hood. 
The only adjustments possible are those already on tho rifle. 
(That is, elevation control using the graduated ramp and windage 
control by adjustment of the two locking screws at the base of 
the existing rear sight dovetail.) 
NOTE: It is very important to hold the rifle t~e·same way each 
time so that the relation of the eye to the rear sight 
remains constant. The user must determine his own zero 
for each rifle and hood combination and maximl.lJC effective 
range for each ammunition type.
