ME.\IORANDUM FOR: Chief, Wei:;turn llcmisphcni Division 
SUBJECT LIONION Project Renewal Request 
l. Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for tho 
poriod 1 July 19ti9 through JO June 1970 (FY 1970) for $11,994. 
Funds ure nvnilnble. 
2. Pro,icct LIONION is :\ suppo1·t project which ·pro\'idcs 
the Mexico City Stntion with fixed photograph!~ and physical 
survcillnnce··of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. 
The su1·vcillancc is ·conducted by tw0 indigenous agents located 
in a basehous& d!rcct~y across from the Cuban comp6und. At 
:times the IH•im:ipa'l ·.',gc:ul also acts as a disp;J.tc!:C!" ft'!" the 
~IE~ERACE surveillance team. Iriformntion is radioed to the 
.team concerning tht.• departu1·e o.t Cuban of ricials, thus allowing 
the team to 1·emain a inure discreet distance from the t,u·get. 
3. As reflected in the attached Project Renewal. an 
riudio device planted in the gatehouse of tho compound could 
be monitored at tho LIONION basehouse, aiding greatly in 
identifying visltv1·s. Since thc·time the St:ltion sub:llitted 
th0 renewal, hOWC\'~r, this devic~ .ceased ~o function along 
with the rest of the LISM!Pi\N •• dcvices. This' insl.111:ltion 
was monitored throu~h carrier cui·rcnt from the LISAMPAX/ 
LISASll basehouse. also situated in Jront of the compound. 
Since the connection between the two baschouscs wns by carrier 
current only, and since the agents in cacfi bascho~ie nrc un~ 
aware of the other'd nctiyity, a possible cnMpro~isc of t~~ 
LISAl\lPANILISASll nctivity should not affect LIONION seclll'ity. 
4. Although the LIONIO~ Project does not produce dis~ 
,cminable ~ositi\'c intelligence, it is considered by the 
Station ns essential to its Cubnn op~rations. The 4.100 or 
more selective individual photographs produced annually,
