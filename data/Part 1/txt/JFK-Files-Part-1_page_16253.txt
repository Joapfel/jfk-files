He is ~il a_lert and ast.ute observer of .small details •,rhich. 
_ he retates· ·correctly to ·_their larger aspects. Being quite re­
sourceful, he combines illl3gi~ation with sober matter-of-fac:tness. 
He follows prescribed rules and.regulations when absolutely 
· necessary ar.d, wheneve~ pc,s·slble, exercises his mental indepen­
,dence. _ He forms his own op'inlon 1;1,nd judgment and keeps his own 
_counset·:in making .decisions. He.may accept somebody else's 
S!Jggestions that he con-siders suitable for his purposes but he 
.. is .not actually influenced by other:.~ At times, h_e may deliber­
•• •• 1;1,tely _make somebody feel a$. if he is seeking his advice and 
,-following it~ but, in reality,. he does what he. considers best, 
He is very critical and ;,evaluates by high standa.,ds. He can be 
very outspoken in his crit'icismor he can cautiously withhold it 
. depending .on his a·ppraisal o.f the circuinstances. His interests 
cover small items ·of informa·ticin. to large size projec_ts and 
-operations·. While he notices evei;y.thing that is going on, he 
can tcinc:entrate. ·on his work.· When required,' he can switch quickly 
from one task. to another. His memory functions well and he can 
reproduce facts e~sily.
