DJring rhe early part of 1\ugust 1962 a group of "coyotes" was uncov.ered 
In rhe telephone company in Mexico City and a number 6f a rres~s were made. 
This group h.td orgariizeJ ;.1 unit including linemen, cenlr;.1l111en, installation 
crew, w.1rehous.:.:men, and wor!,ers In rhc office n.:sponsible for provJdlng ser­
vice to n~w dients. It was the purpose of the "coyote",group to provide oervlcc, 
for a price, r.o those indi\'ldu;ds w,,osc requests for ins~allmions h:.1d been turned 
down by ,he cdephon.! company due to limitec.1. availability of c.1ble.; 3nd contacts. 
(Note: Th~ company gene.ally keeps a cerrnin nurr,ber of "spare pairs" in each 
cable for its 0wn use In providing special s.:.:rvice, comp311y phoaes. and for re­
routing duri:1g repairs rn ocher cables. It was these sp;ire pairs and contacts 
which chc "coyotes" used to p1:ovidc illegal phone service.) Tili.:i Lelephonc com­
pany wici1in the telephone company would a l.,o collecr nwnthly fe..:!s froi11 their 
"subscri~rs". When the .-;tory came out, d1e telephone company had special 
• police 3i3tioncd in each ..:cnrral and s1X>t checks made of, lin..:mcn and crews to 
pre·vcm recurre,1ce. It was therefore necessary for che, LIFEAT linemen to 
refrain from any clande3C ine 3C[iVity for a period of alnio.;;t four Weeks so as
