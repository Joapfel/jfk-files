1. The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBOh-Y/1 
and ltarc SCHLEIFER. JAGUAR states that the information was 
received from a "most secret and delicate source which has been 
found reliable OD previous occasions." 
"STBBONY/1 was in contact with Marc SCHLEIFER while the 
latter was staying in I.Dndon with his family, en route for 
Algeria. SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers 
via Paris on the 2nd June, but he deferred his departure in 
order to meet STKBO~Y/1. It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, if 
possible, to visit Tanzania also. STEBONY/1 apparently was 
prepared to help SCHLEIFER and his family to find accommodation 
while they were in I.Dndon because they had little money. He is 
also reported to have caid that there was a possibility of his 
co-operating with SCHLEIFER in Africa. 
"According to our source, SCHLEIFER, while in London, 
arranged to contact the Tanzanian Hission, in connection with 
a job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIFER 
or STEBO!fY/1." 
2. Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/1 an~ 
SCHLEIFER, of about the same period. While TIFFANY WP.S in London 
(which puts it at the right time) STEBONY/1 was in t~uch with 
SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY should be-able to compare JAGUAR's coaiments 
with what STEBONY/1 said at the time. Ref B reflects a different 
oontact between the two, from a different ~/re. :
