Since the first of the year,· 
CLASC has in~ensified it~ ef­
forts t,, create, its own youth 
groups and appears to have made 
some progress, especially in 
Central Americ·a. 
The Role·of ODCA 
In its 17 years of existence, 
ODCA has not evolved beyond a 
sort. of fr,:1.terni ty held together 
more by-ne·gative factors such as 
hostility to the·us, to capital­
ism, and to the oligarchies, than 
by any bas:Lc agreement among it"s • 
members ·on doctrine or principles. 
Moreover, the individual parties 
have made very clear th~t they 
will fight any- eff6rt--whether 
iriitiated by ODCA or by the Eu­
ropean financial backers of the 
CD movement--to impose standards 
and~ontrols ~~at will i~pinge 
ort th_e'ir freedom bf action. 
In genc·ra 1, ODCA takes a 
~lightly less hostile lin~ on 
US· policies' 'tharr that of its 
memb~r parties: This probably 
results from the influence of . 
its piesident, Rafael Caldera of 
Venezuela. •The organization's 
t~··o vice presidents are Hect'o·.:­
Corncjo _ Chavez of Peru and "Rene 
De Leon of _Guatemala. Tomas Reyes 
Vicuna of-Chile is its secretary

Only ~n Central America has 
there been any move toward a 
more cohesive un_it geared to area 
problems. A smaller regional 
. group, the Christian Democratic 
Union of Central America, was or­
ganized last July. It now has • 
five member parties, in Guatemala, 
El Salvador, Nicaiagua, Costa Rica, 
and Panama, and a sixth may be 
. formed in Honduras.· 
European Role· and Influence 
Although Latin American 
Christian Democracy like the Eu­
ropean variety, has its roots in 
the profoundly humanistic and 
democratic ideas of the French 
philosopher Jacques Maritain, it 
does not contain the European 
fascist concept of the corporate 
state. The European reaction to 
the growth of Communism in the 
1930s had little effect on the 
Latin American CDs: consequently 
the Americans were moving to the 
politic~! left as the Europeans 
were moving to the right. •
