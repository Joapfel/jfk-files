9 •. Sccur i!~v'H'jtments - Ag aln, the information on th h; suhjcct was covered 
i:i,dcquatcly in HMMA- 18.GERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/DGMORNING 
- and LIFE.AT/Cuban Exiles duties on 10 December 1958. 111is, of course, was 
, ~n line with recommendations cont.lined in HMMA-11368 and represents a definite 
security improvement. GERENDE was told that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was bclng 
tc_rmlnated because it had not been productive of enough significant information and 
that LIFEAT/Cul>an Exiles was beingt.crminated because the occupants of the target 
apartment had moved-(Note: This was true where the Cu bans arc concerned.) 
[Additional sccur ity improvement& will be made when Simon D. CLACKETT retums 
to Mexico and relieves GER ENDE of respons lbi llty for the Llj ERSE Y sur veilla nee 
team. 
10. Operationi.tl Succci,;s and Effcctivenes~ - B rlcfly reviewed below arc the • 
separate operational actfvff1es whldicrITirEND'E managed during the period covered 
by th is report: 
A. LllvHTED-Thls base functioned smoothly, securely and efficiently 
during the periodju..ly through December 1958. The uase operator, LIEMPTY/?, 
demonstrated bis usual competence am! devotion to duty. In addition to the 
primary objective of taking photographs of Individuals of interest, L/6 al so 
prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivali:; .:md departures of all target 
per sonncl, we ek..ly reports of workers actlvitlcH at the LINlE RICK installation, 
per formed three one-man surveillances o[ Mexicans working at LIMERICK In 
an effort to ldcnti fy them by name and horne addr css, and provided SCANTLING 
with information on LIMERICK construction. During th is sLx-month perlod, 
LIEMPTY/6 took approx lmmcly 800 photographs from the Lh\tlITED base. 
~ 
Il. LILYRIC-This base is operated by LIRMPTYs/13 and 14, with LIEMPT '/ 
12 serving as a cutout between the base and GEHENDE. LIEMPTY/14 docs most 
of the photography and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular 
job and is not on the premises during-regular daytime working hours. L/14 
devotes approx im atc.ly six hours (0800-1 -!00) each day to phocograp hy and the 
remaining ti me ·is spent preparing reports. The Base personnel co1npilc 
individual logs on each target personality indicating their arrivals and departures 
from the LIME RICK insrnllat ion (Note: TI1esc reports are filed in the 
appropriate Station 201 file and are available to Stat ion of fie ers in nnalyzing a 
target personality's pattern of daily activity). LlLYIUC also prepared a 
weGk.ly report on workers act iv it ics at the Club and reports the 1.ic ensc plate 
numbers of all vehicles discharging or picking !.Ip in div idudls at LIM EH I CK. 
(No tc: These lict?nse plate numbers are rhcn chcc ked our r 11 roue h LIV FS TOCK/2 
for the owners names nnd addresses - in case of immediate or fat er operational 
interest.) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, GUSLER met 
directly with LIE.MPTY/ 12. During th is period 3pproximatcly2,000 photograpl_1s 
were taken from the LILYRIC base. • 
C. LICALLA - While LILYRl C anJ LIMITED are excellent bases for 
pi10 togrnphing individuals emeri.ng and leaving the LJ!v1E RICK lnstal lat ion, 
the LICALLA base ls the Scat ion's best source of photographs of LIMEIUCK
