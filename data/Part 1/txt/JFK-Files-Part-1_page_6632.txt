last Wooneaday night I rn.n into u situation which voa:ld ru:ivo meant the end for :2e 
1f a friend c,t mine Md not happened to be vit.h m. TW.s WJ they did not dare to 
.be<:tU&Se tw:iy nre accustomed to a1W ma allmyo vsllins o..lone,i and cars and helpers 
disnppenred (not tmJund}. I have l'Elported ey situ3tion again to ·Ui,o.police, they 
p1"0l!l1sed to do vh:lt they cnn, but it ia so truit I have to vork out nomething • 
that raakes it n little t10re '1.1£:ficult for thee. to coo;plote their pl.an. 
lll t.h friends· vho work in the acme field and ll'ho knov. obout thoae th1~a I hLve 
worked out the .t~ollov1ns1 I ritw3t sell 111;/ d06 and buy n oiuu-per one. \1hen I bou3ht.

Please don't believe that I a::i hysterical, on the e<'::trary. B,1t nmr it is so that 
I not only .feel endangered but I bava knovled.se of t.hcir intf?ntions t.nd I wu
