·thinking about exposing the ,role of lliami ~ttorney Alex E. •CARLSON, 
residing 145 Curtiss Parlatay, )liami Springs, Floridn, in the 
Bn.y of Pigs operation. AMCARDON-1 stnted that, if CARLSON were 
of any current interest to REtrrEltAN, then the Identity 3 would 
soft peddle the CARLSON angle. REUTEMAN advised AltCARDON-1 that 
he bad no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and wns of. the 
opinion that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney. The receipt 
of this operational intelligence enabled JJ.IWAVE to brief CARLSON 
on the Identity.3's over-all interest in the role that CAnLSON had 
played in the Ba)" of Pigs invasion. This. briefing, in turn, 
enabled CARL~N to more adequatel)" prepare himself for a meeting 
with AltCARBON-1 •. While AMCARDON-1 did attempt to pursue this 
Bay of Pigs stor)", he never did put anything into print as the story­
was overtaken b)" other developm~nts before AllCARBON-1 could finish his research. .. •. . ~

JlnVAVE tha:t· ~fr .• Trevor *ARIIBRISTER, an associa.te editor :tor the 
Saturday··Evening Post, was 1D 11iami during July 1963 attempting 
to research: .a story regarding the possibility that strategic 
.missiles were hidden in CUban caves. This· information enabled 
JllWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles 
which might-~e appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba.

gave JlffiAVB his•.resume of the discussions which he had with •

AllBIDDY-1 •·s public relations man. This ·operational intelligence 
was useful in·ternis of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-l's 
representatives were.telling the outside world about their 
operational activities. 
. f· ••• In WAv_E 6910, ·dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-1 
informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were 
being received· at. the Identity 3 relative to so-c·alled KUB.ARK 
vessels which were located in South Florida waters. This 
information.alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny was 
·going.to be directed towa~d the Identity 5. Armed with this warn­
i~g, JlrtlfAVE ·was·. able to tnke action whlch minimized the publicit)" 
repercussions.from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5. 
g • .-·In \VAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1 
reported to J'liWAVE the fact tbnt be bad received a _letter from 
Peru which contained an inte~esting operational lead to one 
Carlos ltONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JJ.nVAVE, 
Headquarters and the Lima Station. This examination revealed 
that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no 
rcnl operational potential in this lead. This incident did undersco~e 
the fact that AllCA.RBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significant 
operational leads to .nfflAVE's attention. 
h. In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCAROON-1 
advised Jl{WAVE that he bad received numerous telephone calls 
indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had defected :• from. a. Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had prcviousl ~ 
been seen in Miami during November or December 1963. At the .. sn.me 
time, AltCARDON-1 pointed out that be was suspicious and thought 
that these·telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona· 
fide defector, but was either a. GOC agent or a XUBAlUC plant, who 
was being used as. a me.ans of creating an incident which would 
embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishin~ boats penetrating
