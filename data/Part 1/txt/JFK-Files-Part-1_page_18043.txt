During ihc proje~t year, the pulsu camera coverage of 
tho Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued, Little or no 
use wns beinH made of the product from this camera. One 
reason for limited ~se was that thorc was no real way to 
rendily fix thu timc--or the day-- a particular photo was 
taken. There• were no o,ther significant changes in the 
project during FY 1970, 
Accompl.ishments: 
.1. The LIONION production .for FY 1970 consisted almost 
entirely of photogruphic coverage of visitors to the Cuban 
Embassv main entra,1ce and of logs of tho movement of Cuban 
EmbasS}' personnel and visitors. This vrovcd very uscfuJ. in 
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS employees in Mexico. The 
monitoring also re~ealed which cars the various employ~es 
. usually drove. 
2. LIONION also tock photographs of what appeared to 
be American visitors tu the Cuban Embassy front gate. In 
the case of America1is -who arrived in automobiles bearing 
U.S. license. pirites; the license plate numbers, car 
descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given 
.to L'.ERGO for identification. •
