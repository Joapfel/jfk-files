double agents are turned over from one case officer.to a new 
one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through 
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity 
of the new case officer, as w~s done in the case of AF.CilwtiCK 
in the spring.of 1967. 
4. In assessing the security of the operation, the 
station assumes that· the Soviets realize that they are being 
. wat,ched. as was. ev~cnced by a Soviet officer's trying to 
. ..shi'eld··an FBl-dire·ctcd walk-in from observation. There have 
been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo­
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans arc doing it 
have com~ to our attention; the probable assumption ls that 
the Me~icnns arc doin~ this. A former source who lives in 
the ·neii,::hborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew 
about LIEYPl'Y/6, one of the safchousekeepcrs, and the Soviets· 
have said they t"hink he is watching them. On the security of 
the LIC..\LLA safchousc there is a difference of opinion. 
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are 
aware that they are being observed from this post, but station 
disagre~s and produces good justification for its views, cit­
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not 
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks. 
We·hnve no e~idence that Soviet interest is any threat to the 
operation; rattier it may bn assumed that they accept the sur­
veillance as·a fact of life.
