1. WIRQqUE has·reccivcd political recogrfition from the West German 
government· a·r.d is fully documented in the name· of- Georg Fra·nk Sanders. 
This was accomplJshed. with the c·ooperation of ODIBEX·on tlie basis of the 
... fabricated story statihg•that Subject isa Georgian who defected from·· 
Eal;;t· Berlin:.on :14 July 1962 ·while_ -\\·ith a. tourist ·group. .It· was necessary 
' to ·acquire. political ·rec:'ogniHon • for SubJect 'because this. was the o_nly 
sure mearis to backstop-him if and· 'll"hen he applies for imrnigrat'ion to 
South America· •. A. Freriidenpass • would not withstand the investigation 
~equired by immigration au!horities. _ 
' .. 2. 'All 'the. S9uth Ame~ican Cons.ulates in West. Germany were contacted 
·'. w-i th the assistance ·of CAMANTiLLA in .an attempt to collect information 
• wh_i°ch would- enable HARVARD _to_ select the rriost likely country. to which. 
Subject could. imm'igrate 0ase<;1 _·on his personal preference, opportunities f"oJ 
emigr·ants~. immigration .. requirements, etc,. Columbia, Chile or Peru offer 
the best possibility • 
. • 3. T~~-,next step wil 1 be for Subject to apply to the approprfa te 
Consulate. and begin his process1ng.. Prior to having Subject take this 
stiep HARVARD will require Headquarters· guidance and thinking regarding the 
fo!Jqwi1~g_:. .. ._ 
a.

.. 
Subject as a prospective emigrant will.have to ·furnish proof 
of employment or pro6f ·of financial solvency. Subject's 
• .. West German documentation indicates that he is an engineer. 
This does not mean that he is a diplomaed engineer but rather 
a master mechanic •. This is borne out by the details of his 
falsified life history and in fact by Subject's actual skills 
• in electrical and mechanical fields. HARVARD feels that 
Subject can satisfy any South American Consulate that he is 
• experienced enough in electrical and mechanical fields to be 
'~of value to the economy of the South American country of his 
··choice. -once Subject is admitted to South America, HARVARD 
has no doubt ~hath~ can find employment if he desires it. 
·The id~al s61ution, however, would be for Subject to have a 
firm offer of employment prior to his imrr.igration. If KUBARK 
can arrange this, HARVARD feels that Subject's immigration 
could he practically ·assured·. Sutjcct could seek employment 
through the German languag'e newspaper in Santiago, Chile but 
UARVARD feels that no South American firm would take the 
chance of hiring him sight unseen unless'he wer~ a highly 
qualified specialf~t. 
If prooJ .of er,1ployment cannot bl? provided, proof of soh·ency 
is the> next 1·equ.irement ~ Only one of the South American • 
countries has state~ what it considers to be the minimum proof 
of solvency. The prospective. emigrant must show that he has 
the funds t6 silbsist for two year~ at the rate of. $125.00 per 
morith. HARVARD.fe~ls that to deposit S3,000 to Subject's 
account would be a grave mistake. HA!i".°:'!t:tt>:-:h~0 1 dbutlt rhat 
Subject is capable of taking. the moa~y·:a'nd''departJng for parts 
u-nknown unless ther.e \Vere sufficie11t :inducements---~-\-v:fnT'iis him 
in South America. HARVARD could probably ·arrange; fo_i,:_J!..J.et ter 
attesting ~o the fact that Subject has--S3-;oo-o-·hein°g ... held I for • 
him. Subject could have been working _for ODIBEX as .. a . ...coasul­
tant si~c~ his deferition. The S3,000 would be bonuses aJd 
salary. :·-.:,~ :·-:.-~~------~~-·-·:-;.-;:-~·-·1 . . • J_c, i <;-:--·.:f'v°1>' 7
