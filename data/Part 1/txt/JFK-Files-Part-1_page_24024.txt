REFERE;iCE: P.A.11 8052 
The follcr.ing round-up and co=entary on Iden A had been_drafted 
before P,\L? 3017 of 6 January 1165 and later traffic presented ti1e 
case 1n a scr-e-..iiat diffcre:it li~i1t. :;e for11ard the follo-.:ing an'F.:a;•, 
as some of the bac~;round and su~~estio~s still sec~ pertinent. 
Several questions raised belo-J have now i>ecn re:.olved, notably the aile~­
atlon of an Iden A/:JJilAfa.. link (explained by the OD~NY letter of l 
Decc.al>er 19o4, not available ".laen the follm.-in:; uas 'IITitten). Cor,ies 
of refent ?ALP correspondence o~ Iden A, passed to us on 13 JanuarJ 
1965, arc attaci1ed as Attacil::!ent J, use. 
1. \ii>on receiving tile cemoraru!w:i cited in t:ie reference, lo.'e requested 
~ .1rti1er details fr~ i.;_n;otr.:D, stress in~ our interest in tile re?ort that C7.:SA 
r:iembers h:i.d given ll>;t; C docu::ieats w:aich s:1owed l.D~i ,\ belon3ed to "the services 
of l-JJB,\.'t.:{". D/5986 of JO Dccecber 1964, u:::,omiD's ans-.,er to our query, merely 
reiterates that the tr:mou.:il source, a &ooci one, inse~ ti1c re?(>rt on a "c=i­
cation of ;;iocu::ients" by A.--:JCric::.n Co:::::u11ist:. to ·u::::; c, t.-!lic.'. :;u,1?oscdly 
established that IDE;.~ A belon&ed to KlIBAP>A; L~"'BOlr.J> states tilat the source la 
oot in a position to identify tne persons in question. UNBOir.lD's reply suggests 
the information oigbt have come from an audio operation; we :aight mention ilere 
that Ii>.El, A has appeared occasionally on u:.P~'!, but never in an informative 
way. A a.ail iocercept might also be the source of L~iliOIJ' • .O's report, or ic 
tlily have COQe from a tnird service (conceivably JACUAl\ or S;roTtl). 
2. Our co.itinuiog preoccupatio.i -.Ith the ID:C:, A question is three-fold: 
(a) his er.>ulsion fro.a IO.i::i: a (and taus from acceptance by pro-Peiping grou;,s) 
opeus Che door for uis possible recruitment; (b) ~-e would like to determi..le 
whether lus Quster was engineered by person~l enemies or wlletiler he actually 
did work for an intelligence service. and vi.licil one; (c) as Peiping regards 
the USA as its prlaary target, the Chinese can be expected to continue prop­
aganda attacks designed to create ID~~ D tension and infla.z Che_ Afro/Asians
