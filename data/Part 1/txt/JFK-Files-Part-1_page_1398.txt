MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez&LEo-/i] (201-249386) 
1. Born 7 April 1922 in Havana, Cuba, the son of a 
native-born American citizen, RABEL was brought up in comfor­
table circumstances. He attended high school in Cuba, com­
pleted the last year in New Orleans, Louisiana, and entered 
Tulane University in September 1938. He enlisted iri the U.S. 
Army in December 1940 and eventually saw combat in France,_ 
Belgium, Germany and Austria. After discharge in December -1945, 
RABEL returned to Cuba to attend the University of Havana 
and this began a life of job changes, .moving back _and forth 
between the U.S. and Cuba, and, in general, rootless living. 
2. RABEL's background reads like that of a man with no 
,all~giinces--or loyalties and no pariicular goals. Viewed in 
retrospect, his career presents a picture of unreliability. 
It is probable that RABEL's rootlessness and apparent 
unreliability applied both to his relations with CASTRO and to 
those with the Agency. It is quite possible, therefore, that 
he not only served the Agency in a superficial way but that 
he did the same for CASTRO at various times when it suited his 
purposes.· .Without po·stulating this sort of dual role (one 
which fits very well with his previous life) it is almost 
impossible to explain some of the reasonably good things he 
did for the Agency and the quite certain allegations that 
he was a CASTRO agent. This explanation is not fully satis­
factory, but it does explain his career better than the charge
