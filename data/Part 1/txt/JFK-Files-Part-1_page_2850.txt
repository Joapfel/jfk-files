CHAPTER VIII 
SEVENTH DEPARTMENT !January 1962 to Januar:t 19641 
Comment: By lat'e 1959 or early 1960 the KGB had the 
complete substance of the CIA and MI-6 tou: ist. 
agent program in the USSR. The information ob­
tained from the KGB agent in MI-6, BLAKE, in­
cl.uded accurate details of the objectives and 
targets of those operations, as well as the 
practices employed for the selection, recruit­
ment, training and briefing of the agents in­
volved. As a probable consequence of reports 
receiv-ed from BLAKE as well as by the indepen­
dent confirmation of tourist agents identified 
in the USSR, the KGB by 1.961 was mobilizing a.11 
of its resources to counter the threat. The 
KGB's tasks were made no easier by the increase 
in bona fide tourists to the Soviet Union, the 
numbers of which were increasing by thousands 
annually. Evidently uncertain of the success 
of domestic measures it was taking, the KGB • 
extended responsibility for countermeasures to 
KGB elements outside of the Second Chief Direc­
torate. To that end, selected First Chief 
Directorate residencies abroad were iristructed 
to exploit all of its facilities ~n developing 
tourist agent countermeasures. In describing 
the magnitude of its tourist agent problem, 
KGB Headqua!"ters cited the scores of American 
tourist agents who had been identified in just 
one year int.he Soviet Union. 
In fact, by the fime.NOSENKO returned to 
the Seventh Depart~ent in January 1962, the 
threat against which the KGB was deploying had 
passed~ By early 1961 the tourist agent pro­
gram was su~pended when technical collecti.on 
programs and other agent operations made the 
use of tourists unnecessary.
