hi~self (exagg~rat1ng) iD his dcscriJ~ions Qf 1962. This 
ad•11i,;sion came only after the tape o"t S'JSF:'.'!(O' s l:J62 
state:cnts had been played to hia and he had succe~si~ely 
said that (a) it wu; not bis voice, (b) h0 v.as dru:,k in 
1962, (c) thu CIA case officer in Geneva had made hlm 
nervous, and (d) CIA prohably Rpliced various pieces of 
tape together to make this false one. Still, SOSE~"KO

r---! 
said, h~ directed the entire operation from beginning to end, 
and it was bis most important case. Interrogated further 
concerni~g his rolo in the STORSBERG operation in October 
1966, SOSE.~KO said that he had rrrer read the KGB file on 
STORSBERG, which was held by GRYAZSOV. ~ 
GOLITSYN, as NOSENKO reported, didvisit the Am~rican 
Department, did request permission to use PREISFREL;\'D opera­
tionally in Helsinki, and did report this to CIA in late 
1961 following his def'ection. GOlITSYS also repo::-ted that, 
in dP.nying his request, KO\"SHUK told him that PilEISFREUXD 
had recently been used in the successful recruitment of an· 
Al!!.eric;an Embassy cmplorce, possibly a military ma.'1 and pos­
sibly a code clerk or di:;:,lomat; therefore, KOVS!lt'K said, 
PHE!SFF.ElND·could r.ot be used for six mor.ths or so in other 
opE--:i.-ations, for otherwise the Americans might beco:ne suspi­
ciuus. NOSENKO has not reported the~ie details, b•Jt has said 
only ";hat CrOLITSYN '.\°&S. instructed to_ drop intert. ... St 1n PRZIS­
rntt~D because PREISFRtUND bel~nged to the Al:1erican D~partment 
of thu Second Chief Directorate. • 
NOSE~KO volunteered at his first meeting with CIA that 
he was on leaVl' outside of Moscow on the occa,:;io,1 of WLITS~'s 
\'is1t to the A.'ll~rican Department. Since defrctin~ he has 
i~~isted with absolute certainty that this visit took place 
i:1 the late spring or c,a,·ly summer of· 1961 and has described 
his h,avc, where he went and with whom. GOLIT;)\"X' s passport 
an.! CIA travel data show that GOLlTSY~ was on TDY in Moscow 
in ,lanuary 1961. * 'iold this, NOSE'.'"KO said that it is untrue, 
that he reca.l10d being told of GOLITSYN's visit after his 
return from leavo in July '1961, and that he was certain that 
~e (XOSEXKO) was in Yoscow in January 1961. 
~SE~1CO has indirectly confirmed that the op~ration of 
which GOLITSYN learned during this visit to the herican 
~partnacnt v.·as the operation against STORS13EnG. He did so by 
bit. assertion that PREISFREl~D, his own ag011t, was use:d in 
only one operation, that against STORSBERG. Thus, as to the 
outcoI!le of this operation, there is a con fl let between NOSEN­
KO' s in fori!lat ion and tlta t earlier pro\· ided by C-OLI TSYN. 
There is also a conflict between SOSE:\lCO's state:ments that 
the r~cruitment approach tuok place some tim~ after May 1961 
(NOS~KO's dates have varied from June to October 1961,. 
STORSBERG,said it was in October 1961) and GOLITSYN's state­
ment that this approach had already been made in January 1961 
when he learned of it. 
C-OLITSYN provid~d a second lead which ~OS~1CO appears 
to confirm and which may be related to the STORSBERG case. 
GOLITS\"'S said that during a visit to the American Department 
*GOLITSYN has based his assertion that SOSE~l.O was not in 
the U.S. Embassy Section iil960 and 1961 partly oo this vislt.
