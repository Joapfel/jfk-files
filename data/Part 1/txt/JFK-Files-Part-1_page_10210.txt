i r b. According to GO~-ZAL!Z, Identity D, who 
left for Gu_atemala with LIRl:SG-3 and, according'. to 
the latter; was pl·obably executed after a period 
of detention, may still be alive and may have ma.de 
a "deal" with the Guatemalan authori tie-3., Iden~i ty D 
had apparently misappropriated FAR funds before' 
going to c~atemala. LIRIXG-9's remarks to LIRING-3, 
as mentioned in RO\fTOS's report of 5 December, may 
be connected with Identity D's misdoings.' i 
J • 
c. LIRING-3 hinted to LIRISG-9 that. he mai 
accept a teaching job at the Lniversity of Jalapa. 
(Such a job was indeed recently-offered to him.) 
LIRING-9 advised LIRIXG-3 not to accept this as·be 
would much rather send him on a trip to PBRUM.IDl'. 
\ d. From a letter received from Gust:avo 'Ftd: G.t,.tl.-br,-,\l'l.\o., 
~\•COLINDRES Barrios, LIRING-3 gathered that the • I\; (iu.art'."r-""..( _ i-•BARRIOS brothers O11.guel aud Juan Leon) may soo- '" • ...... ~-
be released and may, in fact, contar,t him in Mexico 
City. The original text of that letter and its 
envelope are forwarded under separate cover as 
=.t "t~c!~{;;=-~ IT:. ~:::.~:;~-: ~~ ~~ ~• c ~c~ .>_,-c=; "- cwa~: kb 
made to bin by Humberto GO~'ZALEZ as another indica­
tion of a possible contact by the BARRIOS brothers 
in the near future. LIRIXG-3 plans to write back 
to the address given by COLI~"DRES and mention that 
he is in contact with GONZALEZ in the hope of getting 
a reaction from COLINDRES. !

2. The Station plans to check further the i.denti ty given 
• by GO~"ZALEZ. Among other things, an attempt will be made 
via LIKA~AK-2 to chsck whether a file in that uame exists in 
the archives of the Mexican Ministry of "Gobernacion." The 
Station may, at a later date, attempt spot surveillance of 
GONZALEZ. Meanwhile, any information that can be provided by 
the Guatemala City Station to further identify GONZALEZ would 
. be appreciated. 1
