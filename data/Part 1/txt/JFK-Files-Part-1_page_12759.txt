. 7. WKSCARLET-3 ~- WKSCARLET-3 is being met on a weekly basis 
in a safehouse. l\'hi le _his acc~·ss remnins unchanged, his reporting \ 
has dropped off during this reportin~ period due mostly to the 
fact that his energies are bein~ directed against guerrillas and . 
since the capture of Gabriel Puertas and Carlos Betancourt, the 
WKSCARLETs have had little success in this field. WKSCARLET-l's 
rlivision is ~urrently working ag3inst Gordo Mansania, Solo Suarez, 
Tito Herrera, and Elias Eljury. Cluring the period he produced no 
disseminations, however, information reported by him was used for 
one field comment.
