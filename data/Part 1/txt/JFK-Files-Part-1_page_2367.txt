NO.SENKO has furnished information on or leads to a number of. 
cases, primarily third nationals but some American, .in which he has-_-
beer.. unable to furnish sufficient details to -oermit identification at this ..

possible after additional research and investigation.· Until an identi-
iication is made, the value of any particular lead to Western Intelli-
