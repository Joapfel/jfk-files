S. KDA~SINTHE: ~rated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTIIE pro..iuced 
100 rolls of film ~nd c.:-~tinue<l to be the principal source for infor­
mation on ,·•isitors to the MHH/\RSH installation, with special atten­
tion given to visits of ah•ocoru<-type" persons and political e:siles . 
. ,,..•,Tnis segment of KDFACTO~ also· continued to be the main source of 
··: information on MHHARSH, license plates and automobiles. 
6. KDLITERAL and :l-Di\13SINTHE both continue to provide detailed 
"attendance sheets" on all MJlilJ\RSH personnel. Without this combined 
coverage, lt would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to 
the MHIIARSH .. i-nstallation or to monitor their daily movements and 
a.ctiviti~s. In addition, _the two surveillance points provide periodic 
• photo studies of -tne MP-'i.:\RSH iI)stallation itself with emphasis on 
0'-cov~rag~ of any construction.changes and any modification or additions 
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also 
available.to service special support requests as required. During 
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special phot~ surveys and 
a thre_e-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE. 
S.t::•.:URITY REVIEW 
7. There were -no kno~n probl~l!'s._ o~ security relating to the 
project. In response to Reference B-request, we have reviewed all 
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound. 
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have 
established themselves as resp~ctable long-time residents of the 
area. All five assets, fou~ in one family and one in another, are 
extremely securi-ty conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets 
derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their ~TRlJs-T,~· /· '/ 
employment a1!d would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever • 
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional 
safeguard, th~ KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented 
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either 
segment of KDFACTOR kno\,S of the other's existence. 
8. The only termination of a p:-oject asset in recent y~ars was 
KDFACTOR-1, ~ho formerly processed the photo product from both 
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March 
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother, 
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access 
agen_ts. l<DFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of 
friends, and on a nurr.be::--·of recent occasions he has been very helpful 
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background 
information on people in the medical profession. Al though KDFAC_TOR-1 
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact 
surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished 
product was always accccplished by an outside ca:3e officer. 
9. Contact is rr.aintained with only two of_ the five assets. 
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, bot.~ of whom are responsibLe for the operation of 
their respective basehouse:.;. Both KDFACTOR-·2 and -5 are met weekly 
to obtain the KDLITER~L and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing 
and analysis bj• the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick­
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs, Meetings with 
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his 
:route of tra\•el to. hls overt :job. These meetings last only long 
enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries, 
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at 
the Station and have bee~ forw~rded to ncd<lqudrt~rs on bot.~ K~FACTCR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-S"s imme­
diate·family and could ce contacted through him using his emergency 
plan. 
10. We have taken action recently to guard against the contin­
gency that one of the p:-esent sites might be blown, and alternate
