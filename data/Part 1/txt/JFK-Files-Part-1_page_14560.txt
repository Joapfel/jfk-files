SECURilY: "It is normal for any member of the 
• , Cuban Foreign Service to exercise certain discretion 
· .":./fn the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is 
particularly sensitive in this respect, which 
pefhaps could be ti:aced to his probable involvement 
with th~_DGI in one way or another. 
He is quick to warn visiting Cubans of the 
CIA's e~forts ( II La Compan!a Sodedad Anonima") 
to compromise them, even.before leaving Havana. 
"Our Elnbassy," he·says, "is the primary target 
~or u.s. operations in Spain." • 
He keeps control of mail going to and 
coming· from Havana in t:1e diploma tic pouch, 
•• and states repeatedly that his office is 
-bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro­
phones. here the size of olives"). In addition, 
he thinks he ls followed openly by -~guridad. 
For au· these reasons he has aaked Havana· 
for funds ·to bu_ild a new embassy, where he plans· 
to have a_shielded roo~ free from mi~rophones. ( The 
building, which will cost approximately $600.000, 
.was approved by Havana and a Cuban erchitect travelled 
to Madrid in_ late_ March_ 1970 to discuss the project 
with Sr. YILLARROYA,_ from_ Construcciones Azagra, who 
is ha11dling the real-estate operation. Villarroya's 
telephone number is 254 4238.) • •
