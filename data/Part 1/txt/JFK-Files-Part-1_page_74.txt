1, We are forwarding herewith a reprint ot the article '"A Reporter At Large: 
Garrison", published in THE m.w YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by • 
Edward J~ Epstein, himself author ot a book, ("Inquest"), critica1 !Jf the 
Warren Commission Report. ~ 
2. Th~ wide-spread campaign ot. adverse criticism ot the U.S. ,-.mo-st recently 
again provoked by the assassination ot Senator Robert Kennedy, appears :~o have 
revived foreign interest in the assassination ot his brother, the late President 
Kennedy, too. The forthcoming t:da1 ot Sirhan, accused ot the murder ot S,enator 
Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave ot criticism and.,suspicion-~inst 
the United· States, claiming.once more the existence of a sinister "politicpl. . 
murder conspiracy". We are sending you the attached article--based either on 
first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sourqes--since it 
deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison 
, ot New Orleans, La. 'l'hat investigation tends • to keep alive speculations about the 
death ot President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible 
involvement ot Federal agencies, notably the P'BI and CIA. . 
3. The article is not meant tor reprinting in any media. It is forwarded 
primarily tor your information end .for the information otall Station personnel 
concerned. It the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the 
context .ot renewed anti-U.S. attacks, you may use the article to br~f int81'1fited. 
contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to 
assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard -• 
evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets~ have ~o explain to 
their a~diences certain basic tacts about the U .f?,• judicial system, its separation 
of state and federal courts and the tact that judges and district attorneys in the 
states are usually elected, not appointed: consequently, D.A. Garrison can continue 
in office as long as his constituents re-elect him, Even it your assets have to 
discuss this in order to ref'u.te-..:or at least weeken--anti-U.S, propaganda ot -· • . _ 
suff'icientl.y serious impact, any personal attacks upon Garrison (or any other-public 
personality in the U.S. l must be str_ictly avoided, .
