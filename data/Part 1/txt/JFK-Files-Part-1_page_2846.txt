Comment: [!.uNfj' s account refutes NOSENKO' s claims that 
the MVR had no evidence of Q:UNTJ s vulnerability Ob 
prior to receiving NOSENKO s information in 
May 1961, and that NOSENKO~s personal partici­
pation in the MVR operation was such that he 
knew that IT.uNri)_"fas given no MVR contact in the 
United Stcites.o~ oL 
NOSENKO's involvement in thefr.UNTJcase is 
unrelated to the assignment he ~aims at the 
time. ~l though NOSENKO cites the~UN'f\case in Ob 
connection with his Embassy Section dulfies, 
it resembles most of all a Seventh Department 
operation. . 
NOSENKO1 s presence in sotia in May 1961 
(when he claims his operation against f!TORSBER~ Ub 
was approaching a climax and when his subor- . 
dinates were apparently planning to exploit 
t)6 ~YSER_g' newly-discovered :vulnerability) • . 
indicates that NOSENI<O's presence in Moscow· 
was dispensableo ThertUNficase is thus not Ck 
evidence supporting NO~NKO's claims regarding 
Embassy_Section'.service in April-May 1961, nor 
regarding supervisory responsibility for all 
American code clerk operations .
