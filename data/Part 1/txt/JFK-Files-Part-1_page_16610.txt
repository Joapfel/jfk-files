I. On lO May I phoned Subject and requested that he travel to 
Waehington to discuss the background of his discussions with 
0 2. U.,N)NAFU-19 from which stemmed the suggefion that A-1 supply a 
French-English-Spanish speaking secretaryio(iDI 9's mission in 
Paris. _The meeting was quitg-a,short fur as it turned out, the Iv',., 
discussion between Subject and(lf).19 on the topic of secretarie" fiad' 
taken place in March 19651 a.ml had been little more than a casual 
sort of thing devoid of any specifics whatever and, in particular, 
devoid of any commitment by either party to proHer or to accept a 
proHerred .body. Nevertheless, Subject felt quite certain that slots 
would still be open ~(!J)l 9's mission and that a recommendation from 
him would' suffice to eHect favorable action by(LJ)I9.

2. I sketched AMBUNNY's qualifications stressing the fact that 
she had gone to sc.hool in the U.S. , had worked here, and had done 
a hitch as a social secretary for theUmerican Ambassador in La PazJ ()~ 
Subject drew the obvious conclusions that it might be difficult to 
dummy up AMBUNNY's labenslauf adequately to prevent her from 
being ''discovered" by the Cubans. At any rate, since she was our 
only candidate, Subject agreed to meet with her in New York so that 
togt>ther they could thresh out the pragmatics· of the problem. The 
meeti~g was set for ll May. Al _Marin (alias) would participate in this 
meeting,
