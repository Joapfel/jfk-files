a. The 1948 FBI report that SZULC was involved in 
supplying the Polish Legation in Rio with information 
from his personal contacts and from Ambassador John C. 
Wiley has been repeated in various versions throughout 
SZULC's file. The FBI has found similar allegations 
made by other sources who knew SZULC at that time. In 
addition, several sources have mentioned SZULC's relations 
with his cousin, Ignacy SACHS, who was the Press Attache 
in the Polish Embassy in 1947 and 1948, although there 
1s no indication that SACHS had intelligence connections. 
b. SZULC's marriage to the daughter of the American 
manager of the English language newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, 
the Herald, lasted only until SZULC had permanent residence 
in the U.S. and appears to have been carried through for 
that purpose. 
c. By 1949 (SZULC was only 23) he had come to the 
attention of the ~~'.onJbecause of his dealings 
with the Polish Legation and because investigation revealed 
his father had some (apparently innocent) business dealings 
with Russians visiting Brazil from Mexico. 
d. In 1954, about a year after he was hired by the 
NYT, SZULC obtained a sensational story, by telephone, 
from a Communist leader in Guatemala. This launched his 
career with the NYT. 
e. In 1956 SZULC was investigating Brazilian nuclear 
policy for the NYT. Although a legitimate topic, it was 
somewhat unusual for him and the timing seems unusual 
for NYT interest.
