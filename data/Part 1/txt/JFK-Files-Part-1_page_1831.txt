[ 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN ~~:·~ENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 [ 
22 November 1968 
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security 
SUBJECT Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod et. al. 
l. Reference is made to your instructions concerning this 
case and my attached memorandum concerning research on whether 
or not Itkin was ever, in fact, utilized by this Agency prior to his 
contacts with Brod. 
2. All available sources in the Agency reflect no record of 
Itkin or of Philip Harbin, who was allegedly his case officer. Harbin 
has been checked both as a true name and as an alias. Although the 
name is not registered in the Agency, this of course does not mean 
that some Agency representative did not make this up and use it 
without telling anyone. 
3. My visceral reaction is that Itkin is lying about his 
contacts with Mr. Dulles and Philip Harbin. However, since there 
appears to be a possibility of an extreme r•flap" if Itkin gives the same 
story to the-newspapers that he gave to Mr. Houston, I would,recommend 
that, with the concurrence of Mr. Helms, Mr. Dulles be interviewed and 
asked if he remembers anything about this case. 
4. I also spoke with Harry Mason, x523 l, in Finance who 
handles OS budgetary matters and is a personal acquaintance. Without 
giving him any names I asked him if it would be possible to track down 
the receipt that Itkin claims he gave Harbin for the $5000. 00. Harry 
says if the case was handled properly and the account is still outstanding 
it will be fairly easy to find the receipt. I have done nothing further on 
this, pending your instructions.
