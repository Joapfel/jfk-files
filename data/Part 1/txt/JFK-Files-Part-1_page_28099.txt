3, Reviewing Officia 1111 C:omme_nts: 
I concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the 
early days of Mr. Rand::dl'a assignment as Branch Chief, that his per­
formance could certainly have been stronger. 1t took him somewhat 
longer than i hat.l anticipated to reall~, take charge o! hill Branch. Howev~r. 
I feel that as he has continued in this assigni:nent he has made very definite 
progress. He is now gener;illy well informed on the operational acti'."ities 
taking place in his area and han begun to ex~J:"cis~ a greater deg·ree of 
initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross 
his dcs-k. Had l been lry_c rating officer I propably would have given Mr. 
nanclall a son1ewhaflowcr, more qualified "Strong" rating, If he continues 
to improve in the n1onths ahead as he has in the past 11evcral, I believe he 
can earn an unquo.lifie<l "Strong" rating for this performance,
