MEMORANDUM FOR THE. RECORD 
4 March 1969 
OGC 69-0402 
I. I showed Mr. George Carey his memorandum of 1955 
to the Director ref erring to T. and H. , and said we thought 
that H. referred to a General Hardin. After considerable 
speculation Mr. Carey finally placed T. as being Juan Trippe 
and Hardin as an Air Force General who was being placed with 
~'1 (ean Alll)for operational reasons, primarily technical information 
collection. Independently Mrs. Lovejoy had checked with Mr. 
Larocque, and he also recalled General Hardin was a man 
Mr. Carey was interested in placing with~an A@ for operational 
reasons. ~q 
2. The Air Force Register lists a _General Thomas O. 
Hardin, Air Force Major General, who retired in 1955, which 
would seem to fit in as he is listed as an airline executive. 
Mr. Carey had no knowledge whatsoever of the Itkin case, and 
we felt it was out of the question that General Hardin is 
synonymous with Philip Harbin.
