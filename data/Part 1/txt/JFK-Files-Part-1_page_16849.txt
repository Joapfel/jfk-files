()PERATIOMS· 
IL'\lltA-40,227, 8 March 1971 (Previous.Ops Report) 
l. Tbe ICDFACTOR Project continued throushout the past six 
months to support ti¥o visl•al and photographic surveillance points 
(IWLITERAL and lwABSINTIIE) directed against the MHHARSH installation. 
ADMINISTIUTION 
2. Howard T. DAGAUS handled the administration of the project 
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the 
Ops Support Section back to the Rl:DTOP Section. At that time Timothy 
H. ARCHBCLD assumed the inside admioistrative chores, and agent 
meotings ,rero turned over to tho outside case officer Br.uce H. 
_FERNAU> who had previously handled tho assets. When ARCHBOLD de­
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. Ml~NKUNAS nssumed his responsi­
biliti"s. YA.'iKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FFltNALD left 
on home leav~ on 25 June and will continue to handle the project 
assets in the futuro. 
3. Procc-ssing of the photo product is now accomplished inside 
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU. KDFACTOH-1, who formerly did all 
the processing in an outside safohouse/darkroom, was terminated 
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility 
was turned over to CHAUVEAU. The new arrangement has proven to be 
more than satisfactory. Agent meetings have now been cut to a 
minimWII, and the processing of the product and delivery to the con­
sumer has been speeded up considerably. 
PERSO?\'NEL 
4. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2 
~ 
operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this 
capacity since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE base house
