• In genaral the above constitutes the -~•le for the stated opinion 
o, 
o! NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and~erbert HOWA~were the only 
eucceuful KGB recrultmenta during 19Sl - December 1963. It ahould 
be noted that there are no other identified l{GB recrJltments during 
thls period of time which would specifically relute the oplnlon o! 
NOSENKO; However, ln view of the cited actual bast.a for tho oplnlon 
of NOSENKO, acceptance of tho opinion o! NOSENKO as belng an 
honest opinion should not be con,;-erted into a statement that 1.t ls 
abaolute proof that another recruitment could not bave occurred. 
NOSENKO may be _coir..pletely correct in hie oplnlou, but olnco 
NOSENKO was only in the Flrat Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961

ln 1955 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963· -bumot be accepted as inlalllble.
