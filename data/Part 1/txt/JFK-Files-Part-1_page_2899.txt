Top Secret 
(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964) 
When the American Embassy saw the CHEREPANOV documents, 
they were afraid that the documents were part of a KGD 
provocation, and they wondered what the Russians were 
tryft.ng to do. The Embassy officials photographed the 
documents and on the next day returned them to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. Nhen the Americans gave the documents 
to the Ministry, ,the KGB wondered why the Americans gave 
them back. 
The whole matter was held very tightly in the KGB during 
its investigation for 20 or 25 days. When the KGB .examined 
the documents, some were found to be in CHEREPANOV's hand­
writing, but no documents were found which pertained to 
CHEREPANOV's own case work, or that of the American Embassy 
Section. The KGB found no documents dated later than 
1961--none for 1962 or 1963--only 1959, 1960 and 1961. • Tl'lus 
there were a number of indications pointing towards 
CHEREPANOV, who had left the section in 1961. The KGB did 
~ot dare alert him by puttirig full-time surveillance on him, 
.. but instead mounted fixed surveillance posts at his home and 
office. In order to provoke CHEREPANOV into sor:te precipitous 
action, a former KGB colleague was sent to visit him.who, in 
the course of-conversation,· mentioned the great disturbance 
in the KGB caused by someone passing stolen KGB documents 
to the Americans. CHEREPANOV manifested no reaction to the 
news and was quite cool about the matter. The next day the 
surveillance post obs_erved him Jeav,ing his house in the 
morning at his usual time, apparently on his way to work, 
but the surve°illance post at his office soon reported that 
he had not arrived at ·work. He had "simply dropped out of 
sight". 
An intensive search "all over the city of Moscow" ensued, 
then spread throughout the Soviet Union: Border controls_ 
were tightened, photographs of CHEREPANOV were sent out to 
-~epublic _and l.9.9.al .KGB and .militia. of.fices, an_d all_ means. 
• of transport • were covered. Reports . began corning ·in from 
various places that someone who seemed to fit CHEREPANOV's 
description had been seen acting suspiciously here and there. 
Reports which came.into KGB Headquarters from Gorkiy Oblast 
strongly indicated the possibility of CHEREPANOV's presence 
there, so NOSENKO was dispatched to the area to check.
