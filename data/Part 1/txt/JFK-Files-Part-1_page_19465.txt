2. BY EMPLOYEE

3. BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL 
I concur in this evaluation. My principal interaction with Jim Moore during the 
year has ·been the result of our mutual concern for tne well-being of a capable. officer 
who per,.forms well and has ·growth potential but who is difficult to work with and has, 
on occasions, appnrently been on the br'thk of a physical breakdown brought on by 
tension, overwork and-other factors, In his approach to this problem, Jim has been 
concerned, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional. 
Under Jim's direction, th~ Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD 
offices and is holdins it. 
While Jim Moore is a long-time DCD officer, he seems to have lost none of his 
enthusiasm and drive. He is a valued and respected colleague.
