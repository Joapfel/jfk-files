1. In preparing a 1·ecent req1wst for an amendment to Raymond 
H. GERl-:ND!::'S contract, it occurrt:'<I to us that it would Fr,,bahly be 
useful to bring Headquarters up-to-elate on GEHLND~'s cover status. 
As a full-time contr:ict agent, Glm!::NDJ-: is on call at all ti1:1es 1or 
operational activity, His cover Kctlvity uot only provides him with

had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,

/fie -haa carrie~o1-; on hls payroll ns an independent salesman oo 
commission, He wonld ostensibly pay GE.RLNDI:: a certa!n a.eount of 
money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and
