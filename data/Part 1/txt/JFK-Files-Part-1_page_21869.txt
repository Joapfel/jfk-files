ginning of my entry into the Party, l ceeply hated , ·1 
·au the Party talmudisrr. and dogmatism. All the • :,.;,<,~1~\j 
Party meetings were li teral~y ~ tor~ure. ~specially I i 
when I Lec.:1:ne tile deputy chief of tne section, th";? l- /,g 
chief of the section, and the deputy chief of the J ~ 
department, ~ecause then I had to speak at these I J 
:neeti.1gs. Because this r:,eant t.o lie, to twist my ' 
soul, and to attenpt to show myself as deeply dedi- 1 
cated to the Party and its course. •i 
"11. In 1960 my oldest girl's asthr:-,atic attacks 
became worse. The question of a change of cliraate 
was raised. At that time the SCD neeaed to send an 
officer to Ethiopia for two to three years to conduct 
counterintelligence work among the Soviet specialists 
there. It cost me a great deal of effort to personally 
talk GRIBA.NOV into letting me go, The Party and work 
references had been confirmed, all the questionnaries 
were already filled out, the photos had been submitted; 
that is, all the for~alitics had been acco~olished. 
But at the very l~st moment the Central Personnel of 
the KG0 began to protest against my gotng with my 
family to Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from 
the house check made at rr.y place of residence they 
received information that I sometimes caITe home in 
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels 
with my ~ife. A tour abroad with my family was neces­
sary because of the health of my daughter (since 1963 
the illness has become better) and also it would 
have been advantageous from the financial point of 
vie~. From this time on I understood that Pe~sonnel

"12, Knowing many officers in the FCD, I began 
to understand that being sent ab~bad is entirely 
determined, not by knowled0e, experience in work and 
success, but only by the absolute 'cleanliness' of 
the person's autobiography and complete assurance as 
to his limitless dedication to the Party and the 
government. But not only being sent abroad but the 
assignment of personnel in the First and Second Chief 
Directorates and the entire KGB depends on the reasons 
indicated by me and also on good relations with the 
~adership and good connections with workers in Central 
Personnel. 
"13. I lived about 11 yeaYs with my wife and our 
life was not a bell. It is true that there were 
quarrels and basically they boiled down to the fact 
that she took an extremely unfavorable attitude to­
wards my delays at work and also when I would be de­
layed with some of my friends and acquaintances after 
work and would come home with a few drinks under my 
belt. Of course, I loved and love.'.my.children and only 
the fact that they are taken care of financially until 
they grow up and have received an education to some 
e~tent consoled me in takinq the decision to leave the 
USSR. What do I have in ~ind when I speak of financial
