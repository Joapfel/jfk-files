c. Early in the hearing of 4 February 1974 it became 
clear that the Committee could in no way handle the five 
witnesses scheduled for the day, and that the Committee 
counsels had not had sufficient time to absorb the voluminous 
written material that we had provided them earlier in the· 
week. As a result, with the agreement of Committee 
counsel we unplugged for now Messrs. Isenstead, Angleton, 
and O'Malley. Also, following the day's testimony which ended 
in the late afternoon, I stayed on into the evening to r~view 
all of the material that we had provided to the counsels to 
make sure that they would make better use of the time of all 
involved.

a. To the security arrangements which I outlined 
(see attachment). 
b. To treat the testimony as exhibits under the 
1 February 1974 understanding reached with Senator 
Bake~o 
Co That he thought it would be all right for us to have 
a copy of the transcript, but he didn 1t want us to show it to . 
scheduled witnesses. (This .is a fairly remote possibility 
because of the delay in getting transcripts.)

(Saturday Miss McGillen had mentioned that she had had a 
'.roommate who somehow knew Marchetti and that the former roommate 
had told her the Committee might be interested in talking to her, feeling 
that she had information relating to McCord 's employment in the Agency.)
