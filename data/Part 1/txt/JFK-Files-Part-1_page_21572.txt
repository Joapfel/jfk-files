F. ls there evidence· oi i'.GB dc:::c:?tion or "give away" in 
inforn-,a.tion furnished by :S:OSE:S:KO whicn wouici warrant a conclusion 
that ~OSEKKO was dis?atched by the KGB? The conclusion in thia 
summary •is that NOSE;>;K<;J was not dispatched by the KGr,. in 
reaching this conclusion, a full examina.tion of the above,,,.,, -'.,ion has 
been both a necessary and integral part. 
It is inherent that the volu~e of information furnished by 
NOSEXKO is only one· of the factors which should be given consideration 
in arrivi~g at a conclusior. that NOSE;>;KO was or was not dispatched by 
the KGB. li ;>;QSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have 
surely been willing to sacl'ifice certain information of value to the KGB 
in order to support the bona ficies of !'\OS:C:i':KO. However, if NOSENKO 
was dispatched, it must have been to acc,omplish or further a KGil 
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be 
unknown. 
An examination of the circumsta.nces under which NOSEI\KO first 
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is 
particularly pertinent since during this period of time ~OSENKO would 
have surely been under direct KGB control if there ar·e any implications 
of KGB dispatch in the NOSE::,.;Ko case.
