the ALABAU Lawyers' group, in prociiiiming Julio CARCERAN (one 
of the chief Justices in exile) as "President o( Cuba at War. 11 He·ex­
preaaed bis in<iignati<1n at this unilateral "political" move by ALABAU 
and his adherents:iLm~ng the exiled lawyers and judges, He added hi• 
beat wis,hee to me· and rem.inded me that he would probably go to New 
York on October 11th or 12th for' the SIP (Sociedad Interamericana de 
Pr~a) meeting, , I replied that I would appreciate il he would contact 
.C@rkaft.er his arrival to give his location in New York City, and that 
·ctark might have a rt;_quest from me for an appointment with him, if 
this seemed desirable. I suggested that in future phone conversations. 
I would be known as JUANITO, He agreed with pleasure that this would 
be a good procedure, I wished him Godspeed and he replied likewiae 
to me. 
U,. Comment 
During thP.se first two meetingo J endeavored to establish 
myself fav-,rably with Dr. MIRO and there.6:>re refrained from bringing 
up details of budget or opposition to any of his specific proposals, 
I listened, asked various tUestions, and he_ talked at length, 
In future meetings, after I have gained further background and 
have more pc,Ucy guidance, I shall be able to discuss with him specific 
issues and endeavor to reach agreements or compromises, as may be 
required.
