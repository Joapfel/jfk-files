He wJ!> ,Ible lo cornc to power in the first place 
because al Chile's deeply-roolt:c1 commitml'nt to the­
dcmocrJtic sy$trm and b,:causc the M.,r:w.ist parties 
were able to mobilize· a part al the prolctJriJt an.i 
the pe-asJntry, and he hJd JI his dispOSJI mJny 
Instruments for state control of .the economy v.hich 
had been devclqpcd by previous· administrations 
sin·ce ·the -193O's. However, he.· wj.s rcQuircd to 
operate within an institutionarsystcm which included 
frequent· an(! stJi;i,ered elections, proportional. rep­
resentation, and· a multiparty sy~frm which n1:1de 
majority rule very diHi.'.ult •a·nd often save veto pow­
ers to the extremes of Rir,ht.ancf left. The economy 
had been charJc.terized for nearly a century by a 
chronic tendency to inflation, Jnd successive goVl'rn­
mcnts had consistcntly ignored a1,;riculture in thi:­
lnterest of securing urban electorJI support. The 
most important systemic constraint of all, of course, 
was the existence of a professionalized .ind inst_i•· 
tutionJlly-loyal military which was unresponsive to 
the ldeologicJI blandishments of the left." 
• The immediate causes of the military intervention 
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last 
part of 197 2, the military were drawn into Chilean 
politics by both sides and became as polarized as 
the rest of ChileJn _society-with the o·,erwh~lming 
majority joining the opposition to Allenoe. The con­
flict ovrr education in March-April 1973 heit:hl· 
cned thJI polarizJtion just at lhc time the milit.iry 
were·ar:empting to e:w.tricat_e themselvrs from poriti• 
cal Involvement. Then· the expansion of arms 
searches in mid-1973 revealed the e:w.tent to which 
,C~ile was becoming an armed cJmp on the verE:e 
of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing 
military hierarchy by a· combination of leftist act iv• 
ity among enlisted men and presioentiJI mJneuver­
lng with promotions and retirements provide:! the 
classis scenJrio for a coup d'etaf
