k. AMBANG-1 Relation with Jorge Volsky 
Jn conjunction with questions t"egarding propaganda 
sent to Cuba, and the JURE 111 general plans in this field, I asked 
A-1 about his relation with Jorge Volsky. A·l stated that he con­
sidered Volsky to be an extremely- able, serious newspaperman. 
He added that whereas ~e eaw Volsky frequently on hio trips to 
Miami, the latter did not work for him. A-1 atated that Volsky 1s 
work was a lull-time job which left him little t:.n'le to do anything 
else. 
A-1 stated that JURE propaganda was produced by a twelve -
man board. 
A-1 added that the JURE expected to shortly introduce a 
statement on its position into Cuba. 
1. AMBANG-l Asks about Two Man Underwater Craft 
A-1 asked H I knew anything about a two man type 
craft whkl& travcl11 through t.he water. I presume A-1 was talking 
about the 11 sea-sled. 11 I advh~d him lhal I know little about this 
type craft, but in my opinion its use{ulneas for the type activity 
he had in mind was limited. AMBANG-l would use this craft for 
the final phase o! an infiltration effort. A-1 stated that this craft 
was being used at the hotel beache• ill San Juan as a type o{ sportiog 
activity. I will advise him that he could pursue this matter himself 
as all knowledge on this subject is publicly available.
