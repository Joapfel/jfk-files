Thts· review presents the facts and observet.ions "A'hi.ch bear 
on the~ fides of the Soviet defector Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. 
The highlights of NOS~aco•s biography, as he has given it to 
CIA, are as follows: He was born 30 Octo~L 1927, the first son 
of Ivan Isidorovich NOSE?;YO, shipyard ,,,.orker who in 1939 ..:as to 
become S~viet Minister of Shipbuilding. Aft~r graduating in 1951 
from the.Institute of International Relation3 in Moscow, where 
he specialized in internati~nal law and the English lan~1age, 
NOSENKO entered the Chief Intcllige~ce Directorate (GRU) of the 
Soviet Navy, serving first as a translator ~ssigned to the intel­
ligence staff of th2 Seven~h (Far Edstern) Fleet and t~~n as a 
senior translator and political officer at ~n intelligence unit 
of the Fo'.lrth (Baltic) FleeL In mid-March 1953, .. irr-JT",ediately 
following S'l'.\LIN 's death, :;ci3ENKO 1£,f t the Naval G!W to· become a 
junior case officer in the ~GB. He was a3siq:1ed to-t~e U.S .. 
Embassy Section of the Ar.ierican-Depart:aent, KGB Secon~ Chief 
Directorate, frrnn 1953 to ~id-1955. ~~ring this p~ricd he was 
in.:tially respo:1sible for operat.1onal activity s:1r-rou:1ding Am­
erican journalists in Moscow and l~tP~ for operations ~gainst 
U.S. Army Attaches at the· £::-,bas$y, • \•,hen tr'C\nsferr<::d to the newly 
organized Tourist Departmer.t of the Second Ch11::f Direccorato in 
1955, NOSENKO had as his targets v1-it0rs to tho Soviet Union 
from the United State6 ana the count1·ies of the British Common­
wealth. Having handled a n-.:moer of successful tourist opera­
tions, NOSE.~KO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the 
section responsible for operations against l1l'llerican, Eritish, 
and Can;,dian nationals. Ei -;;hteen months later N,,SENKO r-eturned 
to the u.s. Embassy Section as i_ts Deputy Chief. Bet ... ·een January 
1960 and January 1961 he ~as second-in-charge of all KGB activ­
ities against the U,Sc Emc;;.ssy in Moscow and personallj• super­
vised operations against tr-.e Embassy Security Officer, the 
Second Chief Directorate's mo~t imporcant counterintelligence 
target at the time, and a~ai~st P.merican code clerks, collec­
tively the Directorate· s most imp,::-rtant recruitment targets. 
At t~~ December 1961 NOSENKO again was transfF:rred to 
t};,t(_i~urist ~epartment, this time as Chief of the American-
Brit n-Caifadian Section. Six months l~ter he was made Deputy 
Chief of the Tourist Department, ar.d in mid-1963 he became its 
First Deputy Chief~ • 
From the time he first contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962, . . r 
NOSENKO's status has been under examination. Only 90w, three 
years following his defection in February 1964, is f aefinitive 
study of the bona fides question possible: the voluminous ar.d 
diverse reports by NOSENKO, coupled with collateral information, 
required that much time for assimilation, correlation, investiga­
tion, and evaluation~ NOS~NKO's own testimony, interspersed with 
representative· subsidiary cases stemming from or related to his 
reports, constitutes a large part ~f the evidence. This review 
also draws upon statements and actions by other Soviets, colla- . 
tion~ with materials from other sources, and opinions by sp~cial-. 
ists of various kindso These factual elements are presP-ntee • 
without comment or interpretation, except in the penultimate 
section of the review where the evidence on-the bona fides of 
HOSENKO is "evaluated and analyzedo -- -
