While there are some people who.admire 
flamboyance auch as WerBell's,- there ai:e

who bought WerBell and Bennett 8.

WerBell - he just doesn't want to be 
as!,O('i3ted with him in the arms b:JSines.s. 
"I like hirn a great deal. He'~ amusing and 
he's a character. But letting him run Colt 
or ietting him run MAC is like turning
