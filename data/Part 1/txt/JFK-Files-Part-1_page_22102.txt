14 May.1964: Discus~ing the list dr•wn up bI KOVSHUIC 
and the dectsion to withdraw· U.S. Embassy};SectioiJ: require- _ 
ments for full-time monitorin 6 of certain ·microphone~, tiO­
SENKO quoted KOVSHUK: "'le are getting inforoatiori frail the 
rooms of the attaches, t?le Counsellor, ari·ct the ·Agricultural 
Attache. Tha flats [Embassy apartmcntsJ--no; the bar--· 
nothing. Ot course, I know it is necessary to keep the room 
of the code clerks in spite of the tact that thPre_ is seldom 
anything recei ·,•ed except sever~l nuaibera. The code clerk is 
saying aloud s.;veral numbers. nut the flats you can take, 
not pcroanently, but temporarily." NOSENKO then cont::inued: 
"KOVSHUK said to give then these flats ... ,.Bi.It· yo~ see, 
nothing was going on in these flats. They v,,ercn't s;>caking 
or we:·a talking about steak and eggs. There was nothi!Jg 
of interest from an operating standpoint. So~otimes ~e 
beard there would be guests. Okay. There is a possibflity 
to hear E:omcthing. ·1n this case we wo:uld call maTr.IYI:V 
[English-language Section of Second Special Departme~tl aad 
say: 'This evening, this dar, this flat. Maybe .we •111 
get something.' The mikes were working riot bad at all in 
1960 and 1961 in the attache rooms--N11\·nl, Air Force. Yihen 
the man was alone we heard nothing. Hut wbe!l two or three 
men were sittiug in the rooms, the assistantq, wo:beard. 
For example, when they 1·eturned from a trip acd -discussed 
what they had seen or when the)' were preparing for a trip •••. 
But we beard nothing about agents." 
Later on this occasion the following diagogue took 
place: 
NOSENKO: GRYAZNOV was telling me in 1962 and 1963 that 
they were getting little, little, almost nothing. 
He said we are losing everything. We have no 
materials. We have little, little pieces, but 
nothing. 
QueHtion: Was be talking about the Military Attaches? 
NOSENKO: In general. I think they were speaking very 
little. God knows. Then, you see, we 'll'8re thinking 
they were taking new measures. GRYAZNOV, -
FEOOSE¥EV, and KQVSHUK considered that there was 
a room-in-a-room--a room [ acoustic) for the 
meeting. 
Question: When did you first bear about the room-inside-tbe­
