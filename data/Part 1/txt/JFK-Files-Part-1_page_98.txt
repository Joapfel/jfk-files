15 November 1974 
Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires 
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the 
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take 
place wider the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done 
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should 
... 
be plll"ged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: -
• ( 1) Duplicate material, i.e., exact copy( s) of a document. 
(2) Name trace form (Fonn 362) unless it has been the basis for 
the opening. 
( 3) All abstract slips. 
( 4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884). 
(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if 
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number 
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report. 
(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch 
cover sheets wiless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments. 
(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information 
contained in other documents in the file; :iuthorization for destruction is 
by the Recol'ds Officer. 
( 8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained fn -a 201 dossier 
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention 
fn the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized 
officer in the originating _ office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction 
over the contents of the material must po~~ Top ~e~- classification-' ...
