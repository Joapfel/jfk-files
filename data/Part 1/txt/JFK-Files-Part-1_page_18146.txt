LIF.M;i1"{-2G, _has aloo wurkeu ill LILYRlC. (Because LU:~ti'TY-13 
has a full-time Job, LIEMPTY-14 does most of the photogr11phic

work, and makes all meetin!(S with GJ::HliliDE.)

(3) Actually, no ·property as such is involved 
here. The Chief of Station authorized payment to GERENDE 
for the use of a room in hiR quarters as a darkroom in· 
1961, after G!RENDE.was ~ove1 out of n base houae in which 
he lived (rent-free) nnd maintained the dnrk room.

utilities.

processing is normally done by LIE~lPTY-4.

problem; the Station will be glad, to answer any further questions 
J~adquarters may have.
