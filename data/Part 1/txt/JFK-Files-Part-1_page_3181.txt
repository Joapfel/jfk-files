1. We have kept you up to d~t& on AEOOR's sudden move and the 
aubsequent termination of AELANYARD. .\t the i:resent time, we still 
do not know #hether or not the story of a sudden transfer t~ Mexico 
Ctt:y was in Teality the basis for the mov11 or if a comp:L•omise of the 
operation was the actual cause. As we pointed out in our c.riginal 
cable, our immediate thought was that perhaps the AVDOLMA3 flap 
-had causcad all AEKlCK types to "pull in" and that perhaps AEBOOll 
was simply following orders. subsequent investigation, hcr,wer, 
tended to discredit this thought.

coutnplate the move s~veral days bafnre we actually bad wind of it~

any case, on 2.8 September 1989, "EBOOR and wife checked out of 
their apartmeut. 
'a. llbortly thereafter, we aadft a phy■ ical check of the interior 
of tbe apartment. Bverfthing seemed to bo in ordar. ThGre wa• no 
evidence whatsoever that the technical end of the operation bad 
been tampered with. Aa we aaid bofore, it fu11ctioned ~P until and 
after AIBOOB vacated •
