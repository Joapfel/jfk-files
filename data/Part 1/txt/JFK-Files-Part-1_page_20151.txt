Secretary I CS Care.er Service Board 
• 1. After rev:lewing GS-14 &mployees assJ.«ned te the 
SR Division, I vish'to again recommend the promotion or 
Jacques ·Richardso½, Chief, Soviot _Br8Jlch, Tokyo to GS-15. 
I concur also In _ e att.Bcbed recomm£ndation for the pro-
1:10tion of Paul Haines prepared by the Ch1ef of Base, 
Berlin. 
2. The Chief or station, Tokyo and I recommended 
Mr. Ricliardson'.a promotion in December 1958. This ~lier 
rec01111:1endation pre:;onted the personal qualities of Mr~ 
Richardson. I wish simply to po1nt out at this time that 
since early 1954, Mr.· Richardaon has more than fully dis-
- cl-.arged reEJponsibllities at the GS-15 level. I believe 
tha.t it_ is definite¼ time to elevate hie to the lovel at 
vbich he baa been performing more than ae.t!.st'actorily tor 
over 5t 7981' s.
