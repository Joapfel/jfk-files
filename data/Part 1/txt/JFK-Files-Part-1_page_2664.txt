"Let us ~ake the same case of @._HAPIR~. I would 
meet drivers about three times a month or even two 
· · times. (j)At !-he rn~eti_ng· I would ask the driver what 
.. was nE¥,c;t: in (e_HAPIR~' s behavior since our last meeting, 
whethe'r~filHAPIR~ had suspicious contacts with forei­
gners, about h:fs imeetings with Russians, were they • 
conducted openly or,. ·perhaps, was (§_HAPIRQ} walking 06 
behind the-persori he met. And then the man (agent] 
would begin his report,._ qf course, if he spots 
anything suspicious he calls immediately, and I 
would see him the next morning. Otherwise, I would 
tell him at the meeting that I would see him again 
in.about-ten days or in two weeks, but if there was 
something interesting he should call immediately. 
•• ;i::t was the same with the maid and the cook. Ppon 
returning to the office I-would have to report to 
. KOZLOV about my meetings,· either orally or in 
•• wrftin.g. If,.·for example, (V.M.] KOVSHUK (also of 
the American Embassy Section] had a meeting with his 
agents, he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV. 
If the meetings were taking place late in the day 
and lasted until midnight or later and there were 
no written materials submitted at the meeting, I 
could go home and then report the next morning."
