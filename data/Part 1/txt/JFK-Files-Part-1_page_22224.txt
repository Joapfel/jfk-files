1. Test in April 1964 
Shortly after his defe~tion, NOSE::,'1<0 agreed to undergo a 
polygrap'!'l exarnir.ation vhich tr.e CIA l-.andlers. had told hir.1 was a 
routine part of liis defector processing. He ·..ras 1:-.!ormed on 
3 :-.;>ril 1964 that the test wo·.1U be ac."Ui.n1stere<! t~.e follo-.,ing 
morning, and that it was therefo~e advisable for hL~ to get a 
good night's rest and to refrain from alcor.ol1c t:P-,erages. NOS­
~:KO crank heavi.!y on the night of 3 1.prtl, did net en~er his 
bedroom until Qj')Q hours on 4 April, a.'1d follo·.iir.g b::-eakfast at. 
0730 hours on 4 April consu:r.ed several g1?.-and-tor.1cs. Subse­
quently, wr.en NOSEl~KO thought ~e ~ds noc beir.~ observed, he was 
seen to remove his hand from ·t.is lJ.ps hur::-iedly.•_ 
Followir.g a medical exan:.ir.ation by a physicia.~ ·.:ho noted 
that tWSENKO had been cirinkir.g, he was ir.uoouc~ to the CIA 
polygraph operaco::-. An expe:::.er.~ed interroga~or, flcent in the 
l'Jssian language, this polyg::aph operator c.ond·.:c-::ed the test in

"The question of Subje:::t' s (SOS~lKO' s\ will:.n-;ness to par­
ticipate in the polygraph test .as one of m1r.or co~sideration, 
since he had, on previous occasions, ag:eed that he would take 
the test. Ho~ever, whether S~bject ~ouid cont~r.~e with the 
polygraph testin~ if confronted with at~err.p~ed dEception after 
an initial test run, ~~s one of che co~s1derEd pro~lems. Con­
sequently, in order to pcecl•Jde the poss1·cilicy of Subject's 
terminating the test prior to its corr.pl~tion, 1t -was decided 
that a minor deviation. fro:n the ac;cepced poly:;raph technique 
-would be used during tte polygc3ph test.i::g; sp,ec1fically, to 
insure that a pol;·graphJ.c recc:..! of SubJ ect 's rec:ct. ions to al 1

* On 18 May 1964 a report was received on the chenical analysis 
of six types of tablets which had been taken frC!n NOSENKO's 
personal effects. In this report, a CIA chemical expert made 
the following remarks based on ch~ical, microscopic, and in­
strumental analysis including che use of X-ray: HSample No. 
4238 consisted of three 13) gr~y tablets wrapped in a piece 
of paper with the name 'Pher.om1n' ".lritcen in Russian. Micro­
scopic analysis of these ta~lets established the presence of 
a -small.-arr.ount_of _dl_-_i3!1!pJ1_e_tam1ne sulfate, a large amount of 
lactose, and a small amount ofcorri f:~:iicn;- iil~&.ph·etamine·-ts-------~-. - -
a sympathornimet1c a~ent e~ployed mainly as a central ne:-vous 
system sti~ular.t. The effect of taking amphetac1ne as a drug 
in conjunction w1th a polygraph test could exaggerate decep-
tion responses especially for a weak reactor. No phenothi-
azine (a tranq-~ilizer) whi=h 1s the active ingredient in 
'Phenomin' was present in these tablets. The ta!-lets do not 
appear to be of U.S. manufacture . ... As a result <>f the above 
examinations it was established that none ot the items sub-
mitted are of the barb1t~rate family. Althocgh either sul-
faguanidine (Sample No. 4242) or aspirin (Sample No. 4240) 
co~ld be used (and indeed have been used) as secret ink, they 
are also ~ormal medicir.als vhich a traveler might carry, and
