1 NOSENKO said that the KGD learned nothing interesting about 
Do ffiICICELsom from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or 
surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit­
ment was attempted. There was, in fact, no interesting or 
derogatory information on@ICKELSOijfrom any source.

Comment: W,ICKELSOl!}was involved in at least two 
incidents inside the Soviet Union which 
NOSENKO has not reported. In May 1954 he was 
arrested in TLilisi on the (false) charge of·. 
having photographed a bridge. In August 1954 
CL@ICKELSOB)was arrested again for illegal photo-
. graphy south of Kharkov; on this occasion he 
was held for two hours before being released. 
It is judged that such events, particularly 
those staged by the KGD, would be known to the 
KGB case officer responsible for the attache 
officer concerned.
