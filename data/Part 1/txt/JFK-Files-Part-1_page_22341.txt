In all accounts, incli;ding his 1962 statement:,, UOSE:i',<O 
has said that he entered t~e Ir.~titut~ of International Rela­
tions in Moscow in 1945. His descrip~ions of courses, events 
and tri<:nds are as vague arid unnubst;int i,"\l as his acccur.ts of 
his earlier scnooling. He h~s given various eatcs for his 
graduation and has ~xpl3ir.ed that he did so to cover up the 
fact that he failc:d liis fin.~l ex3:ninz.-;1on in the subject of
