4. The pl"Oduction·or operational information as represented by 
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA anJ LIE.."'TRAP is an imp,>rtant adjunct to the 
Sbtion'• coverase of the LIMERICK tar~et and Station tarsets of opportunity. 
lt is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK aaeeta, i.e., mon·ey 
llDJ case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued. 
C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (liiscuasod in rel&tion to project objectives): 
1. "To collect operational information and to identify oruuAtlonal 
load~ pe_rtai:ling to th:: LIMERICK target .uid St.1.tion tarsets of opportunity." Very 
little pt'Qg.uction has b.?en realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's 
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mt>.xico in early April 1959 after receiving 
sur~illa.nce, tradecraft_and ph\ltosraphy training in Headquarters. He then spent the 
rec>st of April, May and part of June beini; trained by SC~~TLL"\G in mobile sur­
veillance techniques. Th,m LIEMP1'Ys 15, lo, 17 and 2.0 were placed under his 
Bupe:r~·ision and he be~an training these age-.nts in the arts of foot surveillance and 
mobile surveillance. This team, known ·a\J the LIJERSEY team, is just beginning to 
show the excellent effects of CL,\CKETT's intensive training sessions. Although 
I..IEMPTY-17 has resi~ned anJ the team consists 0£ only four agents, including 
C.L.ACKETT, the Station believes th.!,t the team will be ready within the next month 
ta ~gin its contributions to the above objective. 
Z. Based on the training time devoted to CL.4-.CKETT ;,.nd to tho LIJERSEY 
team and the anticipat~d productio.."l during the coming project year, it is the Station's 
opinion that this ac:ivity should be continued. 
II. EXTENT TO WEICH THE RELATED M.lSSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN 
Ft..RTIU:RED. 
Proje.ct LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying \Ira.ya, to a majo,.ity of 
Static.a operations and ia th.is manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance 
of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended c.or d1;signed to 
pro>duce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the 
de,.-elopment of operational information in support o.f other Station operations. 
m. PROGRESS OF THE OPERATIO~ AND PLAl-1 ... ?',L~G FOR THE FUTURE. 
A. Oliver G. SCA.i~TLING Segment: 
1. SCANTLING's duties and res?()Dsibilities are. basically the same 
now as they were when the original LIEMPTY project outlille was submitted. Since 
SCA.~TLING is the only major factor in this pa.rt of LIEMPTY. progress, other than 
cove.re.i in the above .. ection on production, can be measured only by the fact that 
SC.. ..... "ITLING is a ye"";,. cld.er and has acquir~ci. a iew more helpiul tricks of the trade
