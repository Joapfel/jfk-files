JC" C(mTINUATION OF 
DISPATCH HAr..\-20979 
4. We have not beu•, Able as yet to establish direct social 
cc,ntact with AEBOOR. Both Nina T. MARGANUE 1md Pau1 W. 1,'EVERONE

us of his plans - will hv indeed be trnm:1ro1.·1•0-:I tu Mexico? Our 
original thought was that. the Meiico Station ~ould readily determine

whether AEBOOR's move was routine and innor.ent or if indeed there

and move to Mexico, we shall, of ccurs~, be somewhat relieved. 
However, this will not answer categorically the major question -

what happens to AEBOOR, "shall never know t~o actual reason for 
nia move. However, for ~hat it is worth, the evidence here does not point toward a C<>mJ>N>alae.
