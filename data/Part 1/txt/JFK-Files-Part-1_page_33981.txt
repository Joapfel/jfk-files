to do with tho- AMSCROLL organization. Mention uight be mndo in 
passing of tho over present morale problem (whic-h is by no moans 
limi tcd to AMSCROLL) engendered by inc1·ensing economics nnd re­
strictions in opcrntions.

8. A major effort is being made to revamp the .\.\ISCROLL 1·adio 
program to increase its offoctivenoss ns a repC\rt""r of economic

sc1·ipt writers are l:u·gc.ly ignorant. Ou1· aim is to devise a pro­
gram of economic reporting that will conform to t.hi' now guidolinos 
being developed by the Station for all its radio programs.
