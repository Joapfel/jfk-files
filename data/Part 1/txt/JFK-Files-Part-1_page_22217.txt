Fi•,e CIA case officers who wor)c.ed directly with NOSENKO have 
recorded their personal observations on his behavior and actions. 
The principal case officer, th$ first CIA representative to meet 
NOSEUKO in 1962, participated in all of the ~eetings and inter­
rogations (either personally or monitoring frcm off-stage) since 
then1 he is a senior officer with 17 years o~ operation~l experi­
ence, including extensive agent h4ndling and dealings with more 
than 10 officers of Soviet and Satellite Intelligence and Security 
Services who were defectm.-s or ag,nts in plac<:?: he has also had 
desk or s1...pervisory responsibilities connected with at least 20 
other such sources. A second cns~ officer, who particip~ted in 
the meetings in Geneva in 1964 a11p in all subsequent phases of 
the operation, has spent the 16 years of his career solely in 
Soviet operations and has hanaled several Soviet sources in place, 
as well as defectors. Three oth~r officers, who began to work 
with NOSE~KO after his arrival in the United States and conducted 
the bulk of both the dr.briefing and the hostile interrogations, 
have spent most of their careers in Soviet counterintelligence 
operations, ;Hnong them, they command an extensive knowledge of 
the Soviet Intelligence Services, and they have had a variety 
of agent- and defector-handling ~xperience. 
NOSENKO was talked to and ~uestioned in several_types of 
c:irc:umstances: 
_ .- In five tightly org~nized meetings in 1962 in 
Geneva with limited ti~e available for each of a wide 
range of topics, none of wnich could be ignored but none 
of ~hich could be covered in detail. 
- In CQncentrated but somewhat longer meetir,gs in 
place in Geneva in January-February 1964, with the know­
ledge by all participants· that items not adequately covered 
then c:ould'be dealt with ~fter the defection. 
- In routine debriefing sessions after his defection, 
first in a Frankfurt safehouse, then in a safehouse in 
the Washington area, where a spectal effort was made not 
to put pressure on NOSENKO or express doubts about his 
statements. 
. - Under detaile~ ho~tile interrogation (especially 
April 1964 and January-March 1965). • 
- In extended, det~iled debriefir.g sessions which 
NOSENKO could not evade (May-November 1964, May 1965, 
July-August 1965, and October 1966). 
Thus there were opportun.i, tie,i to _no;e _h1-_s pe_rfe>rm~nce .AA4_ r_eac- _ 
tiona.under varied.degrees of stress and control. 
The features of NOSENKQ' s conduct., manner, and ~echniques 
discussed below are confined to those which were clearly and con­
sistently observed by all of the officers involved.
