- Richard FUNKHOUSER: Suspected cf being a CIA 
officer because he is a specidlist on the Soviet Union, 
particularly economics. !lOSE?-:Ku did nc,t rcr.1ember the 
na.-nes of any agents working against !-'Ul\KHOUSER nor any 
derogatory information concernir.g him. 
- William HORBALY: SuspecteJ of b~ing a CIA case 
officer* because the KGB hc~rd hl~, by ~e3ns of micro­
pho~es in the Empassy, discussiny a report he had 
written, or dictating it, a~out his observations ori 
a trip he had taken in the Soviet Unior.. NOSS~KO said 
that he did not kno~ the names cf agents working 
against HORBl-.~,Y or w!~ethcr the· .J.gen t ~ obtained deroga­
tory information concerning him. As far as NOSE3KO 
knew, there had beer. no operatic.nal approach to or 
recruitment of IIORBALY. 
Of the seven U.S. En'.Lassy offi.:crs dcsigr.ated by 
NOSE?lKO as known or suspected CIA pe;:~-::mnel, tnrec--WI:-.'rE~S, 
WASHENKO, and liORB/,I.Y--were in fact CIA officers. When 
HORBALY .,,as first assigned t.l> .Mosco;,;, howev-:r, he was 
detached from overt employment as ~n econom1:: analyst in 
CIA. In January 1962 he severed his connections with CIA 
to beco::.e a full r.-.,~mber of th::? Forc19n Agricultural Ser-
.vice of tr .. ~ Depart:-:-:ent of Agricult1..r:.?. When liORBALY first 
arrived in Moscow he openly d1scusse:d thd fact that he had come 
to the Err.bassy from CIA. While ir. !·lcscow he had no .connection 
with or knowledge of CIA clandestine activities. WASHENKO was 
similarly detached from ov.:?rt e!:lpl.:>yr::.::nt as an economic analyst 
with CIA 1o1hen he w:is assigned to Mcsc;:,w, but w;1s c.:>opted by 
CIA for limited operational support activity, chiefly mailing 
agent letters. .l\ftcr his return frc:n Moscow l~e reverted to 
his overt CIA employment. John ABIDIAN was a State Department 
officer cooptcd by CIA: although not a CIA staff employee, he 
was for all intents the CIA "Resident" in Hos::ow from Febru­
ary 1960 until November 1961. The remaining three--KLOSSON, 
BOWDEN and FUNKHOUSER--had no affiliation with CIA. , . 
During the time NOSENKO said. he belongeC: to the• American 
Embassy ·section there were stationed in Mosco~; two CIA . 
officers, Eugene P. MAHONEY and Paul GAR3LER, whose status 
as such was subsequently found to have been known to the 
KGB before their arrival in the Soviet Union. In addition, 
one officer (William MORELL) was openly identified as a CIA 
employee to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs before 
: arriving in Moscow. Furthermore, Francis STEVENS (see ?age 
i'"· 374) reported having been.·askcd by 01:e of the two KGB offi-
i cers tryi~g t_o recruit him whether MORELL was a CIA employee; 
I when STEVENS .replied that he did not know, the- KGB officer 
, stated: •He openly says he does.• Another officer (G. Stan-! 
1 ley BROw:N), an overt CIA employee, h~d transferred to.the 
L .;_- . . ·u.s. Department of Agriculture shortly before being assigned to
