ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE co~a.iUNlTY 
Nation.al Indications Center - Watch Committee 
\V'e have examined quite carefully the National Indications 
Center, its organization. its capacity to support fully the Watch 
Committee, and its relations with other departments and agencies. 
We note that opinions within the community concerning NIC and its 
function• vary widely -• from the feeling that it should be abollehed, 
or combined with DIA indications center -- to the belief that it la 
entirely satisfactory in ita present situation. We do not fully sub-
scribe to either of these views. ' 
The· functions of the Watch Committee, and NIC, with their 
terms of reference, were developed prior to the time when DIA was 
created. Now DIA has developed~a strong capability to provide both 
early warning and indications of approaching crises to the community. 
Its capacity in this regard will develop even further in the months 
ahead. 
We are aware that USIB is now considering the Fitch Committee 
Report. But we doubt that few if any members of that Committee 
were intimately aware of the full capacity of DIA and of its future 
plans. We note that General Carroll was reluctant to be drawn into 
the Committee's deliberations .
