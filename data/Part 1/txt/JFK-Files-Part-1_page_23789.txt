wbioh was tranaaitte4 under ref1 
ave haw reoeived the f'ollowins two items of'·intelligenoe 
about s/h . 
1. Some time in lfa1' this year, s/1 said that be would 
be Coins to 'l'unisia on 15th June to work on the atatt of' the 
paper "L'Aotion." 
2. Atter his quarrel vi th Jaoq,ues VERGES in 1964, s/1

bi.a atature as a "Chinese agent"1 we still wonder, ·though, what funds he 
aq have been covering this~, ainoe n had not contacted him as of the 
time in question. Perhaps, as a result of' ref, LCPIPI'l' ma,y shed some
