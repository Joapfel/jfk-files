Excellency: 
"You ::ay recall th~t, in :::id-i-lay this yet1r, the Communist Cuban -­
Charge d'Affairos in Athens, Jcse Luis Golbr., ~as the object of world -
,,ttcntion -~!'"ter he shot a Greek bus driver over a t1•i vial traffic argu­
ment neAr the town of Therrno1wlae. Newsp;ipers throughout the world ca.c, 
ried the stc-ry 0 nd it would not be exaggcr;1ted ti) label the incident as 
nn intern~tionnl scnnd~l -one ~hich m~y be SRid to have damaged Hellen­
ic dir,nity to tho snme extent t~ which the C~stro regime ignores it by 
nccrcditir~ g~ngsters such as Galbe as its diplomatic representatives-· 
before the Greek people." • 
''On that occ.qsion, we \o;rot.e .the Greek government calling their at­
tention to the need to :;ave the honor of Greece by severing all tic:, 
diplomntic 1>11d commercial-- with the Red eovcrnment of Cuba. At that - · 
time, we w:.rried th,'.lt the gangster Gal be w.1s typic:.11 of the new promotion . 
of Red Cuban "diplomats" --mostly undesir,jble Communint:-. trained to pe.c, 
form-tasks cf espionace ~nd agitation-- :rnd sub:Jtantiated our as3erti.on 
with n quote from Odon Al\•arez de la Campa, a defecting: Cuban diplo;y,.at- • 
who had chnrged Galbe by name during a .p.rE!SS conference in Madrid." 
"Today, two new defections from the Cuban Foreign Service prompt us 
to re-open the Gal be case. \,e refer to those of Mssrs. Gilberto R .. Al,! 
many VilAr, until recently, Trade Counoel,.r to the Cuban Embassy in :TC>­
kyo 1 rrnd Luis Ricardo Alonso Fernandez, until recently, Cuban Ambassadcr to uroat Britain." · 
"Both former diplomats had always been reg.11rded as competent, ser,! 
ous men even by us, the relentless oppo3eri:i of the t:antro-l.:ommunist :ty­
:anny. Def 7re he took office .,s Cuban /\mbasiiador to the United l\ingdoo 
in 196), Luis R. Alonso Fernandez had also performed ambass~dorial du -
ties in Peru and Norway. A scholarly well-mannered mc1n he is well re 
membered by ~11 who knew him in his dirlom.:1tic office, e~en if they may 
h~ve dis~pproved of the totalitarian regime that he repre3ented. Even­
tually, he ~ecamo disenchanted ~1th Cor..ir:uni3m and publicly resigned his 
post in London only R-few days a~~. lI11 connection with fiir. Alonso's re 
signation, the Greek newspaper "\'radyni" in itn September 6 issue won' 
ders precisely why Red Cuban Ambassador Ca lbe has not been ousted yet )7"

"GilbPrto R. Alemany, an e-:ually r1ble Rnd well-bred trade srecia: -
list 1 held his Counselor's position for three years in Tokyo. His re·­
cognition of the true nature of the ReJ ~uban government led him to de­
fect secretly rand become our own secret agent in Japan·. Late last· mon­
th, after fulfilling his dangerous mis3ion, he m::ide his feelings public in Miami~" . • 
"As you can see, those dece~t peorle, who are still active in Cas­
tro's diplor.-~tic corps c~nnot stand it for a long time. These new'de­
fections show that the few that re~air. are ab:.ndoning the i:iinking ship 
to the "new 1,·aye'' of Castroi te- diplor..<1 ts --gangsters, spies and agit~­
tors in Galbe's fashion." 
"But there is more: shortly aftci· his defection, in an interview·­
with a leadir.g ?-iiami newspaper, 1-.r. ,.lemany made statements that con-­
firm our assertions to this respect. The following Rre quotes from -
