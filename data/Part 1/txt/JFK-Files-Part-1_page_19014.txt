• whose reliability has not yet been established.·' ife· ·Obtai&ied 
the information from two district officials of the Party. 
l. Acc·ording to .a ranking official of the Kiel distl"ict 
of the National Democratic P;Lrty (~"PD), Karl-Heinz· 
Knipp ha ls, the chairman of the Kicil district of the 
NPD, and Adblf v on Thad den. the national chairman 
of the NPD, are personal enemies. (~rn Comm~nt: In 
Jan~ary 1969 Knipp~als was elected to be his party district's 
candidate for the We~t German Parliacent. Knipphals, a Kiel 
law:,er, .is in his e'arly 50 1 s.· He ~-as severely wounded during 
World Wa.1·_II and-has only one arm.) 
2. ·von Thadden is aware of, and unhappy about, th~ -fact 
_that Knipphals, ·prior to joining the XPD, participated in 
Easter Marches nnd received unfavorable publicity. Further­
more, voir-Tltf\~den _is. co1icerned· about Knipphals' strong and 
1·uthless political ambitions. Ile h:i.s referred to Knipphals 
as a "second Hitler", and he welco:::es and encourages the fact 
that there is strorig opposition to Kr.ipphals even 'within the 
Kiel district of_ the party. Von Tl!adc~n, for the above 
reasons, would vciry much like to see Knipphals remain on the 
district level and is anxtous to k.:-cp him out of the \\'est 
German Parliament. 
3. The same official. who made t~e remarks about von 
Thadden and Knipphals. also stated that rnany wealthy industrial­
ists contribute funds to. the NPD a:-:onymously, because they do 
not wish thelr associatioi or sympathy with the party to 
become known.
