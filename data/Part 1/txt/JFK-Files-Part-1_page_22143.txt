• to locate an agent '·who ·could be used tc> pass tne -d~ag)ng .;' 
11\aterials to BARGHOORN and told the:n to write a sucmary of 
BARGilOORN Is backgroun(!. with a proposal tfrat • the Second> 
Chief Directorate arrest him "when he ohtai,:s materials 
which are of ·tr:terest to Amerlcail, Intelligence." This was 
to be sent in letter form to SI::.tICli.\STWf'l over GRIBANOV's 
signature; the letter was not to i:-:dicatc how BARGHOIJR'l 
was to recei\C the materinls (i.~., the-fact of provocation 
was not to be mentioned). 
GRIDASOV took a one-page letter on B.\RG!IOOP.!-1, along 
with a similar letter from GRYAZ~O\' and RASHCHEi>OV con­
cerning the :nilitary attaches, to _SDIICH.\STNYY. While 
the four--~OSi:r-.,m, KOVALENKO' GRY,\ZNOV :ir.d KOVALE~KO.:..-
were •aiting ir: GRIB.\XOV's office for his return, GRY,\ZNOV 
recei\•ed a telephone call from the local KGB organization 
in Rostov informin" him that the military attaches were in 
tho air on their way back to ~oscow. Shortly thbreafter, • 
GRIB.\NOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the KGB 
had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well 
as BARGHOORN. .(KHRUSIICIIEV was absent fron :1toscow at the 
t inie, • but SEMICHASTNYY h:id called BREZlL\EV and secured his 
api:,roval.*) 
When GRIBA!-iOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the 1nilitary 
attaches we~e already on their way back to ~oscow, he be­
came furious and sent GRYAZNOV out "to do tlie job ·or- die." 
~.teanwbile, arrnugcmcnts were made with the "Dep:irtment ·D" • 
(the KGB element responsible for disinformatiol_l, subordinate 
to the First Chief Directorate) to provide· some materi~ls 
on rockets which could be passed to BARGHOORN. While these 
were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO retur"'ed to 
their office to plan the provocation. 
BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon 
•his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio message was 
received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHOORN 
bad gone to the U.S. Embassy, and it was decided that the 
agent (n:u::c not rccalleJ, aged 25 to 30 years) would be 
placed in contact with him as soon as he caroc out. The 
KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCII.\RD of the 
British Embassy at 1900 hours, but at 1900 hours a report 
~as received that BARGHOORN had left the U.S. Embassy in 
the American Ambassador's car. He was P.lonc but for the 
Soviet driver. Nothing could be.done while BARGHOOR~ was in 
the moving car. A check on ORCH,,RD established that he was 
in the dowr.stairs hall of the hotel waiting. It was there­
fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at 
the hotel. 
•NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOOR?f re­
turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOOR.~
