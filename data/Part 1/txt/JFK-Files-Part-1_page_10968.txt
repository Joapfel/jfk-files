Good morning, Luis! How are you? We are well. We frequ 
think of Havana and of our friends (I - of a "bored'' man 
ntly 
oo). 
1-After the Black Sea we spent one week in Sofia, and the f 
lowing week we relaxEd at the Radio Sofia tourist house ( e­
fore leaving for Cuba I worked for Radio Sofia), located n 
the Vitusha, near Sofia. The Bulgarians call this mounta n 
"lungs of the capital''. It's a very lovely place. Livin in

Isn't that true? On Vitosha (sic) we remeabered all that 
We are now in Sofia, preparing to continue our tour throu h 
the mountains. I like to walk a lot, and now I have the p­
portur:-:.ty. We plan to climb the highest peak in Bulgaria 
Mus-ala (2925 meters). It isn't difficult -- it's not ve y 
high. What a good country Bulgaria is, but in my opinion she 
lacks contemplative men. Yes, yes, that's true. They ar 
all too practical. Until later, Luis!
