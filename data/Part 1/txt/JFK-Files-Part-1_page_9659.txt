I lulow of no affl!latioLS of STCA!iT v1t~ foreign 
political parttes of government. Bia attempts to get ciosc 
to :U1del CAS'J'BO ln 1960 were l:'.!ot 1vated by a desire to ex1f101t 
the jourualistlc advantages of an lntervle11. Bia o:dg1nal 
intereat in Tb~ Sh~rk and the Sardines vas appar~ntly 
motivated by money-m.aking interests and l.,y the hope that 
be might spark n sensation - e.xactly wb.at he d~d i..a.D.Bf!Gt to 
do with bls outrageous advertising. Be eeemed to <.·alculate 
that there mlgbt be libel suits poosible a 63lnat the fin,,,s 
and tho newcpapers he could provoke to attack him. 
Tbe original contract of AREVALO with 8TIIABT was 
supersedf'd by another lo Rovc>zibcr of 1961, granting STUART 
certain rights with regard to other fo=e1~n language editiomJ 
of Tbe Shark and the Sardines nnd, I believe, est~bltshing
