:i,. William P, Dirlte, Cbiet ot the 1lev Oriearis Field Office, 
conti,nues to ~e his. office most ett~ciently and· to demonstrate 
thorough knovledg~ or his area. His i~rent .conservatism and some .. . . ' 
what legalis't_ic app~ch tend to make it diff.icult for· him to accept 
_change ~d ]!lethods ~culiar to cl:9-ndestine support· vi thout most care-­
tul consideration of all the factors involved. 
2. Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area. His con­
servatism is to a degree an asset in Nev Orleans; it could conceivably 
be a handicap elsewhere.
