Dear Dr. Redlich: 
L~ December 14,.,1966, . I wrote you a long letter giving you 
all the information about our activities et the Itletitute. I have 
not heard from you ever oince, and I am afraid this letter did not· 
reach you at all, therefore, I am enclosing .e copy and following 
are a few more news about this year's activities eo far. 
I wish to let you know the~ in July our nev Review called 
'l'raliscultu:ral Psychiatry will be published here. As soon as it ia 
out, I will mail you a copy. We are editing it and it will be the 
firat of its kind in our language.
