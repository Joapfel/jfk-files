1, llead~uarters agrees truit Subject is pc:.bably riot identical vi.th 
Ivan lvanovich 05YE...'1K0V (201·121531) as was earlier believed, and has 
accordingly asGigned ivan (.,cltriyevich 201·779495 ,\ full fle~quarter!;J 
trace under that name tttrned up no lnfon>ation other than that o·riginating 
from Mexico (ity Stattc-n, 1,1hich has nov been re-classified into the oat 
file. We 111tE! pu::.zled by the fact that HD,l-1850, dated 1 Septaiber 1962, tho 
first piece of correspondence fr01:1 Mexico City Station on Subject, reported 
him as Ivan lvanovich. 
2. A photo COQ;>arison of the tvo individuals in this case ia not 
11atisfactory proof that they &i.::: in fact two people because of the difference 
ln years and exposure in the photographs. The pre•:-te:&ico City traces on 
Ivan lvanovlch reflect only a date and ,>lace of birth as identifying data. 
lt ls hoped that Hexlco City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic· 
data on Ivan teltriyevich in order to firmly resolve the matter.
