F > They exchanged nddresses. SAi!KO had 
printed hi? nddress, but A!.L.\UT0-1 asked 
him ·to write it on another piece of 
pape"r. A~L-\1.TI'O-l reasoned that he wanted 
. it written to understand .it better, but we 
believe' he will use the sample to compare 
i.t with lctte1,s SAMKO might send .in the • 
f~ture. They profuised to write to each 
other. SAMKO was given A~L.\Uf0-1 's p·rivate 
add~ess, not that of the e~bassy. • 
G. AMAITT0-1 re~rctt_ed that SA~IKO had to 
leave so soon because he would havo 
enjqyed showing SAJIKO the Spanish 
interior. S,\l!KO said he might ,consider 
returning ncnr the end of 1970, but 
AMAUT0-1 did not 'say whether he would 
be in Spain in late 1970. 
H. AMAITT0-1 said he was suspicious when 
he first saw S,UIKO noting that the natw·e 
and importance of his position make hi• 
act suspicious, but the suspicion soon 
dissipatej - so he said.

· 14. On saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both 
men embraced and agai~promised to keep in touch through 
correspondence. At this point the operation was over. SAMKO 
.was met late that evening. He was taken.to a new safehouse. 
15. Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed 
and rehearsed were successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater 
than _our own expectations. Unless we arc misjudging the shrewd­
ness of A1L<\UTO-l through our own naivete, we believe the . • 
relationship was sincerely re-established ~nd a channel opened 
fo1· future use bv AiL4.UfO-l should he desire to use this charinel 
other than t~ maintain n friendly correspondence. It was un­
fo~tunatc that his Barcelona trip interfered ~ossibly to the 
point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAt!I'0-1 
nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, S . .\MKO admirably 
fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the 
fiction of his visit to Spain~ We believe tdo, that although 
A.\L<\trI'0-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime, 
he did not ctiticize the United States which we feel he ~ight 
have done had he suspected that S..\~IKO'.s visit to M:idrid was 
sponsored by the U.S. Goi:e1·nmcnt. A\L\lIT0-:!..!1:ts_ ~o_m3._ a lo~ way since his internship as a butcffi5i.--in the -United States and -~- -·----····--· ----·---- -.
