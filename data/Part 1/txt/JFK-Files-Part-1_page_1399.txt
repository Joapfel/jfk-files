that he was a CASTRO agent from the beginning. The question 
that must remain unanswered is whether he betrayed the AMTRUNK 
Operation. He was not arrested until September 1965 (when 
AMTRUNK had already run its course) but it appears quite 
certain that he cooperated with the DSE after his arrest and 
while he was in prison. 
3. RABEL joined in the clandestine activities against 
BATISTA in March 1952, first amongM the exiles in the U.S. 
and then after late 1952 from inside Cuba. He joined the 
Cuban armed forces to further his plotting and was assigned 
to the Cuban General Staff. He was the Cuban liaison officer 
with the U.S. Army mission in Cuba from November.1954 until 
April 1956. During his entire period in the Cuban army, 
RABEL was involved with dissident Army elements; when they 
attempted a coup in April 1956, RABEL was ar:rested. He was 
released shortly thereafter, worked in the chicken business 
for a year and then returned to the u.s~ and worked with one of 
his brothers (Luis RABEL Nunez). In October 1957 he returned 
to· Cuba and became involved with the 26th of July Movement 
but had to leave a year later when. he was brought to the 
attention of the BAf"'rISTA forces because ·of a bomb explosion. 
He smuggled weapons to Camilo Cienfuegos for about a year 
and then in October 1958 he joined the Cienfuegos group. 
Shortly after the CASTRO victory, CASTRO called upon RABEL to 
set up a Cuban Marine Corps, a job he held until February 1960, 
at which time he was appointed Chief of Viviendas Campesinas.
