COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this 
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the 
Case Officer. 
I doubt that we have really divined Q/l's motivations for working 
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab 
we can make at this enigmatic subject.
