VIL EMERGENCY CO'l\'DmONS 
As regards the rf-GUireme:u listed in CSI-F No. 230-60, Annex A, for 
communications arr~T'[Il:!~ts in the event of "Emergency Conditions." 
the Station does nor anticipate that this project would or could continue 
to function under its p_resent obj~ctives. However, both principal 
agents, SCA2'.'11...Th:G and G.ERE.-'\'DE, would very possibly be wonhwhlle 
.sources of information to malnrain contact with under any adverse 
conditions. Both of these agents ldenci!y themselfs, ln term;; of 
ideology, motivation and ~rspective, more as Americans than ns 
Me.·dca·n nationals (which they are). It ls reasonable to assume, there­
fore, that SCANTLr-lG :ind GER.ENDE ·would become valuable contacts 
in any emergency situation.
