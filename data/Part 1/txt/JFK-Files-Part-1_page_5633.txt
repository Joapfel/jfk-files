ACTION ~1IRED: See Paragraph 5. 
1. the Station would like to offer its views on 
the WCDIS.:i contact, through Identity ot Paragra?h l 
Reference A (hereinatter ID&N) • ,.'1th 201-357029, as well 
as <:•.1 the question of t:ha require:::-ents which ::lOl-357029 
gave Lhrl".i.E and which "Were forwarded to Headquarters in 
Reference B. 
2. Since IDEN has been told that his contact is with 
L5SHO& and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since 
201-357029 bas apparently, in his cind at least.converted that 
fact into contact 1,,'itb R'./ROCK, and has probably spread both 
stories Iii.th his associates and thereby throughout the ,.-x:.a.1 
milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation. 
\cben we ccnsi<ier that tile LNPURE receives all tne information 
Chat ZOl-357029 gives ID~ anyway, and 1:10st ot the time receives. 
the infor:nation directly uom ZUl-357029, then we have an . 
operation that is difHcult to justi.ty. 
3. In Uie case of the requirciiieiits forwarded w'"iu'i 
Reference B, we have a situation in wich-~DISH levied 
requirements on 201-357029, through~- ::lOl-357029 
then turned those reouirements over to I..'i?URE ,.'hi.ch returned 
.tllea via ::lOl-357029 and IDE.'f to \.iCDISH. Why not cut out che 
aiddleaan ~ the securicy ce&plicauons. and save the headaches? 
4. the Station teels that the \iQDISH handling of 201-l57UZ~ 
results in a case ti.at has the potential ot c:auslngsevere­
problens for AKULE, and that it could well be that AAULE vi.11 
be made to bear the blame since elecents within RVROCK might 
feel ttuat the ultimate responsibility .tor supervision of Cbe 
case lies with MULE. •
