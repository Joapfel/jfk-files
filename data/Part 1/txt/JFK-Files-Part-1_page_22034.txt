NOSENKO: 
Q\)lemtion: 
(interrupts) How do you know this for sure? 
I was reading his report after his coming. I was 
reading also the agent's report of the female agent 
who was put in this carriage, in this carriage in 
this train, and at the station Vyborg, the first 
Soviet station, Vyborg, where she was taken by 
GRYAZNOV, and was put in the same carriage, and she 
was acquainted with JENNER. And later, it was a 
tryu as I was telling, to show her to JENNER, but 
JENNER didn't want to have a contact with her. 
That's all. It was finished ... And she was acquainted 
'e!ith him and was speaking with JEtlNER, and KOSOLAPOV 
himself was speaking with JENNER .•• I was reading 
~OSOLAPOV'~ otchet [official account] about his (trip]. 
That's quite possible. It's quite possible that thsy 
gave you a report to read concerning this. But it 
ie a fact that official records show ~~at the two men- y 
B~r~ not on the same train. They were two daym apart. 
No (trhhpered) .
