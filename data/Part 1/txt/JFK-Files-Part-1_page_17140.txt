The photo processing of the KDF ACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY) 
film take is now bcipg done by the Station. In the past, it was done by 
the Statio11, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated 
amicably in early J9Jl. The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly 
LICALLA) photo ba,oehouse was_purchased In 1957 by KDADBEY-1 for 
the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly 
by KDADDEY,.l but actually by· the Abrency. This row also houses a base­
house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the 
KDABSINTHE (formerly LIL YRIC) photo base house is owned outright by 
KDADBEY-1, who has been mosf cooperative In assisting the Station in 
ma~ntainipg and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses. 
Th~ LIMITED phot~ basehou~e was ~lso located on KDABBEY-l's_property 
when it was active. 
_ The Individua.l basehoµse operations are and have always been 
compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdo\\11 in the 
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to 
tho LIENTRAP .mobile surveillance; (b) KDF ACTOR-1 was processing 
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their 
e~act locations; (c) GERENOE was aware of all asp'ects of the KDFACTOR 
operation, and has since be~n terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCA}.7LING, 
s.taUon contract agent retired in LQ71, was aware of the KDF ACTOR Project
