5. I OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. On occasion, AMCARBON-1 is used 
to carrf out certain operational support tasks. In such instances 
AMCARBON-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action' 
within the context of his normal journalistic activities. The 
use of ~CARBON-I for operational support tasku enables JMWAVE to 
harness1the investigative facilities of the Identity 3. Several ~ 
example~ of how AMCARBON-1 has been used in opera tiona~upport , 1 ° 
tasks are outlined below: . • ,~~

_ / a. Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963 1 Andrew *ORDONO 
Camps, P.POB 30 September 1914, Giba1·a, Cuba, A 12 837 617 1 arrived 
I 
in Miam~ and was given routine CAC processing. The dftails of this 
processing are contained in MIAM-0085 2 dated 12 March 1963. After 
being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3 and 
a sens~tional story was developed. In view of this story, JMWA❖E 
tried t;o locate OROONO for debriefing. This effort was not productivt 1 
thus A~CARBON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO. AMCARBON-1 did locate 
ORDONO !in Houston, Texas. See WAVE--63071 dated 25 March 1963 1 for 
details. • 
I b. Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group. 
In UFG~-2555 2 dated 13 September 19G3, Headquarters suggested that 
JMWAVE /might be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611) 
of the iMRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims 
relati✓ e to his faction invading Cuba. Headquarters• interest in 
dtscrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's 
irresp◊nsibl0 publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1. 
As a r~sult of Headquarters' interest in .this matter, REUTEMAN had 
a luncJ/leon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at wh.ich 
AMCARB?N-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was less 
than apcurate in its claims relative to its ~ctivities in Cuba. 
In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want 
to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction 
might felease·.,. AMCARBON-1 stated that 1 in view of REUTEMAN 's 
comments 1 the,. .. Identi ty 3 would not only soft peddle, but would 
ignore/ the BANDIN faction in the future. Once BANDIN was discre·di ted 
with A~lCARBON-1, the word was -soon leaked by AMCARBON-1 to other' 
newspa~ermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source. As a result 
of thi;s action, the BANDIN group bas received minimal media coverage 
in So1th Florida since September 1963. 
~. OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. In the period February 1963 
to Feqruary 1964, AMCARBON-1 ~as furnished JMWAVE with operational 
intel~igencc as outlined below: 
! 
: a. In WAVE 4836 1 dated 21 February 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was the object of 
a great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-l's release from 
a Havana prison. AMCARBON-1 also indicated th.at A~IBEND-1 would 
probafly be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the 
UR in Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in 
terms/of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-l's movements. Subsequent 
develppments revealed that AMCARBCN-1· could not.contact AMBEND-1, 
and thus AMBEND-l's return to the United States did not cause the 
publi~ity stir that was initially anticipated. 
I b. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963 1 AMCARBON-1 
1·eported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full 
feature article on the Bay of Pig~ invasion. The intent of this 
article was to furnish a recapitulation of the entire tactical 
situition. In this connection 2 AMCARBON-1 pointed out that he was
