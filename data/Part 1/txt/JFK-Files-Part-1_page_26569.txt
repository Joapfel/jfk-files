3. 4~ong leaders of botb tbe PPS and the General Union of Workers 
~d Peasant• of Mexico (UGOCM - Union General de Obroroa., 
C~peti11~o• de l'lfexlco), there is a certain sk~pticlsm about tbe· 
tru:tb of- ~be .matter 11a it bas been prttaented la the pre11a. 
It 1• proba.bl-y true t~at arms aad material" for manufacturt1,11 
o:xplo111i_ves were confi~c~ted. It ls proba·bly true that lndoc­
tri~a-tlon session•· on political and rovolutlooary matters 
pro.baJ>ly were. held in ths houeeq wbero: the arrest& were 8'~d-.. 
And probably the youp did have eom, kind of plan for action. 
But, 1 t ls oi-mpl_y not true that there wae the sliKhtest d11nger· 
of 1-uun-udiate ·and 1ormidable rebelilon from Rico Galan and his• 
frl,nds. • 
Thia.latter conclusion ls based on the fact that Rico Galan 
is no guerrilla leader. He ia an aggroeslve lritelloctual, a 
radical, but he is not in jaU tor what he h:is-~one but for 
his ldoaa. As for~Baul ·ul~Jde Alvarez, n~d with Rico Galan 
as one of tbe leaders of be group, bo ham tbo reputation of 
bein(._fuzzy-mlnded, A leftist advonturer And certainly neither 
braNe nor dedicated. further, and Rico GBlan ia well aware 
of.tblo, popular support is eeaential to th.G_eucce5s of rebellion. 
Nono exiaim., Tho peamant~ are divided. The worhcrs ore controlled 
by tho Govern.=.ent, and the midclle-cl'1nB i's content with tho way 
tilings 11re,. Al1a<>,_ there· fo tho for1.11idal>le preced,ont of Gov9rn-
ine11t actinn age.inst any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed, 
and part1cul.arly nny sort of activity which ia Cullnn-counected. 
·The Govorw:ioiit h.u,· a'l•aye moved with enar~y, epeed, and effi­
chrncy to corilhat mJch threats aa, for oxa&1ple., during the 
Railway Worluirp Stri_ke of 1959. Sevoral leradc,ra of th~t utri.ko 
c..i·ie still in ji1il ond likely to remain tboro. Anothor example 
to the S~ptembor 1065 attcck on a rnil1 tn.ry camp ot Ciud11d tfadcr.:, 
Chlhutibi:in. • WbUo ttie Govorn.ment did not feel that his incident 
po»ed any· real, threat to 1t, i, t did not want the bad internn­
tional publicity, so vigilance vna iricrea.sed, activitiea of 
w01.1ld-bo guerrillaB we·re blocked, !ilOmc were bought oU Tilth 
MO-n~y. otbers·w1th pro-rll15Gfl nnd the u-tter was promptly 11nd 
ofticieotly ~ntrolled.
