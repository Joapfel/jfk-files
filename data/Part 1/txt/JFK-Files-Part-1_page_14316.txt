On the· ~o.::-ni.ng of ·2s .:uly, I called Sam to check in- with hi::t- - • 
a~ter being away on·T~Y fQ~ al~ost 6 weeks. ~~ sounded a bit 
l.:;:,set at not being co:1tacted:during this period, so_;r dashed • 
·ou't.to his Hollywood ho~e to explain what.had happened _and set 
him at ease • 
2. 0 It was -plain_ to see t!iat ·t~e trip had changed hlm. He ls now 
a· bit presu:-:iptuous ~ cqcky-,' and know !. t all Ja.:::·cs 3ond. He told 
me all s6rts Qf wild stories about being t~iled in-Eadrid "by 
7 or·s 'Chivatos' (Castro a;ents," and ·leading theci on long 
"8 or 9 mil,e hikes through ~:acrid." Caatro ·agents were. also 
"·.,ratching" him on -the day he was in 3arcelona a:1d oh the short 
layovc_:- his Pan A:n plane had in Lis!)Qn 0:1 his way hor':le. At no 
time·, however, was he molested by these "agents." 
3. ·The Castro surveiilance con~inl.:ed -so Sa::i says-· in Hollywood. 
"About the second night after I got ho:ne," c. l-t.-15 June, a car 
parked aero:..:. the street and a little to the r~.:i!." of his··house 
"after it got dark.'' :-lhP.n Sam got i:1to his car and went ·to the 
gas station, the car -describeq as looking like a white Volks~agen, 
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trio in • 
the neighborhood and back to -his home. Ee could not make out 
the physical description of the driver of the v-.-1. He,has··-n·ever·· 
seen this car again. • 
4. .The only other suspicious inciv:.dual near his ho::.e, was "a tall-, 
thin man," (described as~a~ut 5-11 to 6 ft an,i 170 lbs; bla~k 
hair; no distingu1shi:1g features visible; on~e wearing slacks and 
_white shirt, another.time wearing a suit). ~his individual showed 
up across the ·street f!."o::i his ho:::e "just .:.s the ~..!:. had gone co~m, 
severdl evenings during the first wee~ that I goc ho~e."' (c. 14-lS 
.:~~e) The man just walked past the f=ont back and fo=th a few tices 
and ap?eared to have his car around ·the co=ne= o~ Sa::i's house. He 
could not identify the car.or anything else about th~ man. 
S. 'Again, during the first week a~te= his ret~=n Sa::i received several 
ccleohone calls where no on~ wou!d answer when the ohone was oickcj 
l.:?, or the person ·cal ling would say, "sorry, wrong n:.:r::b..:-r." Sar.1 
has not experienced any othe:- sus;:,icicus incidents after the first 
week home from Soain. I should note that Sa~ do~s not talk of 
these . .incide:1ts with fear,. but rather::in the vein of a· po1;,erbac'.< 
detective story. 
6;, Sam would not ad~it that he e:1joyed hir.:self sqr.:~~hat in Mat!."i~ as 
a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a lux~=y hotel, 
ate as:~:ell as drank. well, saw t:-.e sites anc· eve:1 1-:e:1t ::o a ni-]!-.t 
club, ~ll on ::he house. ~e went so fa: as to say that i~ he had 
"know~'it was going to be like this, : neve: would hav~ g~ne." Yet, 
in t~e sarne b=eath, he told "~illia~" that he would be back in
