2. With regard to the four names listed together on• 
page.two of subject me□orandum, I am forwarding documents 
dealing with Justin i-lcCarthy and a Robert M. ~foore. It is 
uncertain whether or not these individuals are the ones of 
interest to thri·HSCA (our files contain references to at 
least 15 other individuals named Robert Noore; without 
considerable additional information, we cannot make any 
• p~sitive identification). I am forwarding, on loan, our 
file on Grayson Lyn~h (A-19-44-94). You may wish to consult 
_with DCD later with regard to releasing this individual from 
his'~bligation of secrecy.
