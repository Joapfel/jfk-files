• •-:- l. On Z April 1964 we had a discuulon with the D<ipartment 
-of Justice on- the status of aliens whose inspection by I&-NS is deferred 
upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency. ·, 
h was the position of the Department oI Just.ice that we were responsible 
~or ~n~ any action necessary to carrV out the ~ct!;_rns. of the parole •. 
• z. As you know,. a·basic parole·agreement was executed by the 
Attorney General and the· DCI on 10 February 1955. Aitur setting up 
conditions fo_r authorizing parole in any one _case, the agreement states: 
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume • 
responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it 
belie.,·es consistent with the i~ternal solcur1ty nciiclsottfi'elJ1Ut0<1Sta"ies 
during -continuan.;e 0£ their parole sta_tus." This means ·th • .i'f the 
responsible Agency o!Iicials mu.at take the minimum action necessary 
, to protect the internal security needs of the United.States. The word 
"minimum" is .not necessarily a limitation. It merely mean" that good 
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is ne·cessary. • ., 
3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the. 
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or. if 
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be ·removed from 
this country through arrangements made by the Agency anci, in such • 
case, L'ie Agency will in!orm the Service in advance of each proposed 
departure.
