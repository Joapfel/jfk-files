. 1. • Ai: 1400 hours; i9 August, SR/DOB case officer; 
• Fred· Iµrkpatrick and Ji;rry Pochr<>n from Defection Coordinators 
•. Office :of CIA met ~ith ·Clay Calendar and Jim Myers of .TSD/IB 
re-documentations arrangements and travel routing for possible· 
resettlement of AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC. The following 
arrangements were proposed by Mr. Calendar and Mr. Myers 
for SR/DOB's consideration. TSD/IB suggested that Subject be 
sent by black flight from here to Wt.••;t Germany, and there 
• • surfac_~d with.an··aitered Greek passport which TSD/IB now has 
. availablE,. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated 
re the possession of a Greek passport-by Subject, while Subject 
ha.a no Greek language capability. Since this passport is a valid 
one, (and wa.8, in fact, purchased by TSD/1B) and is therefore 
backstopped in name, Subject could apply. at the .Mexican Embassy 
in West Germany for.a Mexican tourist visa by .presenting this 
• passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration 
action upon declaration ·or intent ·to become a Mexican citizen and 
upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an employer in Mexico 
Ci;y. • 
2. Upon your concurrence, Mr. Pochron will arrange for 
Mr. Kirkpatrick to meet with Mr. Coolidge, ·the CL'\ contact UBed 
for introducing agency designe-es into Mexican pri\;ate industry. 
Mr. Pochron has already talked with Mr. Coolidge on two occai.ions 
·and has passed him Subject'.s file. From their talks, Mr. Pochron 
has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete 
Company of Mexico Ci_ty being cited as one possibility. 
3. AEASPIC would then openly proc·eed to pur_chase plane 
tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there, 
would b_e waiting for him:. The time table for this entire operatior. 
• was estimated at about five.weeks'. Of course we did not discuss 
Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel, 
• nor until Subject could begin earning hi.:1 own living.
