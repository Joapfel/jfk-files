.-~• to Cl;/ to· ~tia to opend approx.lmatel.y a veek vitb bis vite'• 
·"tqa117 tMre. Schroeder had not mentioned the Bulgarian Yi■ lt in 
outli.D.in6 hi• original itinerary to Bob Hartin or this o!fice, there• 
tore, it na not •ntloned 1D Schroeder's Coordination Outline. 
11. Al,1. ot tbe abO"re vould seem to indicate qu.ite otrongly that 
Schroeder, aa ve origlMJl7 &Ul"llliaed, hao been targeted by R.I.S. In • 
brid'in& Schroeder, ve MIil thro1.18b aaiwi ot the typical entrapment 
11ituations tabricated by the opposition, e.g., vomen, homosexuals, 
~ ot drug1I for Sov ci_tizens, black market activity, acceptance 
ot letters to mll outside the USSR, commit111Cnts to d111atfected Sova, 
etc. L"l add1t1on, ve atringently· admoniobed Schroeder against ~ 
notetald.Dg or· photogra~ vhicb could 1n an:, vay be conRtrued as cm­
prom1a1Jl8. Vo alao &:lerted Schroeder to the tact tbo.t some attempt 
llligbt be.llilde to wae his ::,1.te'• family aa leverage in a reoru.J.tmcnt 
atteJiWt. In this· connection,. ve pointed out to Schroeder that there 
vaa a st:rona likelihood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian senice vould 
IIIIILke an approach to hi.cl durin& his fortbcaning visit to Soria. An 
approach in Bulge.ria vould gi.Te tbe SoYo o.n opportunity tor diaavowa.l 
and also would prortde the proper aettlna tor maxirllum utilization ot 
relAtlvea. When· Schroeder mentioned that his slster-1.n-lav, FNU _ 
Mensckllt, bad indicated sne.ral ti.mes 1D the pa8t that she vould like 
to__;lee.ve Bulgaria, we atroil&l7 admoniabed him against malting any com­
.mitaento to her, po1nt1n& out that sbe my poooibly be co-opted by 
toge oppoa1t10Zl. Ve told Schroeder .that an,- representations to gain 
an_ -'e.Xit Tisa tor hie d~ter-in-.1.Av should be channeled through the 
US Lep\ion 1n SotiA. Schroeder vaa told that, 1t any pl--easure vere 
applied conoc,rn1ng his wite'e family, hio beet reaction would probab~ 
be a noncOllllittal, "I'll think it aver when I ~t bane:" All in au, we alened Schroeder as beet we could to the opposition M.O. 11nd pre­
p&rod Jl1.ni on bow beat to avoid Pcne ot the not so obvious plttalls 
vllJ.ch llig'Jt be 1n ■tore tor him. 
12. Prior to our briefing ot Schroeder, Bob Martin alerted Bell 
management to all ot tl\e :nuiJ.tications ot Schroeder's travel behind 
the CurtaiD. The managuaent vaa infonned b7 Hartin that ve telt it
