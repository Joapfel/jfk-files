be dealt· with .in· separate dispatches. On the administrative 
side·, RU·IZ listened sympathetically to. complaints about low 
salaries, old buildings and iriadequat~ operating budgets and 
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and 
expenses and a report on the consu!s' curient needs, their 
monthly balances ind their administrative activities •. The 
• printing and telephone bills were the two items. of expense 
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.

on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mtssion 
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first 
··discussed with his subordinates, lie started by assuring 
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the 
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was 
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel 
changes and-__ Hcctor GALLO Portielos, who had previously been

on vacation. He left Madrid on the 20 December 19_EI7_Jberia

5. The Cuban mission has certain financial problems 
since the present budge~ dates from previous years and does 
• not cover curi·en t expe·nses. However, the "new. economic 
activitfcs of the consulate" arc expected to assist with the 
probl'ein. Herc RUIZ isi presumably ·referring to the ·pressure 
. broltght to bea.r in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in 
the Spanish.Foreigri Office working through the Custom~ and 
the Immigra•:ion Offlc~ to force Cuban e~iles to register 
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid 
passport. r:nough exiles have responded to this pressure to 
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission, 
This source of .income will last· as long as the Cubans' friends 
in the Foreign ~linistry are able to assist them. .
