The·· p,uty puts forth slog.ins 
pro~laiming "Germany for the Ger­
mans" ~nd "Europe for the Euro- • 
peans." . Indeed, ·the NPD' favors 
a united· Europe somewhat·aiong the 
lines ·advocate~ by De Gaul-le, 
Europe, it holds, should be· com­
pletely independe'nt of the· US, 
and possess its' own nuclear deter­
~ent~ ii ~houid be built on a 
Franco-German ·alliance that smaller 
European countries sooner or later 
would have to join. The NPD would 
welcome the decay of NATO as .sig­
_n·ali.ng the end of sterile pol-icfes 
which d9 not serve Germany's real 
interests. • 
In seeking to gain the broad­
est popular acceptance, the parly 
avoids affirming the more extreme 
aspects of Nazi ideology. There 
is, for example, no obvious anti­
semitism in.the party program· 
and Jews technically could become 
pa-rty members. The privdtc dtli­
tudes of the leadership, however, 
are said to rcser.-b le tracli ::ional 
-Nazi anti-Semitism closely. The 
NPO make!l vague references·, mor.e­
over, to the ill'portance of "blood 
ties," rejects evidence relating 
to the Naz·i extermination policy, 
makes derogatory references to 
the Jews in the party press, and 
denounces aid to Israel. 
In recent campaigning in 
Lower Saxony, NPO spokesmen 
shifted tactics somewhat by no 
longer stressing issues obviously 
associated with the Nazi period 
such as war guilt and reparations.· 
Ir.stead, they sought to exploit 
current grievances including 
the economic recession, unemploy­
ment, lack of progress on reuni-
f_ication, and.-what they called 
the unreliability of NATO. 
Future Prospects 
The ~PD's failure to m~ln­
tain -the momentum o'f last fall's 
successes in this year's state 
elections in Schleswig-llolstein,·· 
Rhineland-Palatinate, and Lower 
Saxony is a serious blow to the 
party's hopes. The squabble 
among the leadership apparently 
rein(orced the feeling among un­
committed elements tha.t casting 
a -protest vote for the NPD was 
not worthwhile under present cir­
cumstances. The ~ddcspread dis­
content among farmers over gov­
ernment economy measures did not 
result in a significant shift of 
votes to the NPD. Moreover, 
there has been a strony resur­
gence of general ·confidence in 
the Ronn government. Although 
th<.! NPD benef i tetl 1.-:sr.t fall fr-,m 
the popular dissatisfaction with 
the Crhard government, the grand 
coalition headed _by cou Chancellor 
Kiesinger has displayed vigor and 
decisiveness which has been re­
warded at the polls. 
Even if the ~PO were to fol­
low its forerunners intn oblivion 
it-would not mark the end of right­
ist extremism. A portion of the 
Germ~n electorate will remain re­
ceptive to this kind of appeal. 
In th~ absence of, a party such as 
the NPO, right-wing voters ter.d 
to give their support to one of 
the insignifi~ant· splinter par­
ties, or to one o.f the more con­
servative established parties, 
suet} as the FOP, .when they 'IOte 
at all,
