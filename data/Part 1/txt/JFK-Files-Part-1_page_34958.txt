TRASSI.ATION 
Chicago, Mars, 1967 
____ __} 
Dear Kr.~ 
ln your letter of 1 May 1967 you asked Ille for my marriage. 
cortificato and my son's birth c~rtlficate, I do-not hnvo them 
because my home was immediately intervened by the so-called 
Comandanto Felix Torres who burned my family passport and wouldn't 
even let 1110 get my son's clothing. lly cousin(?), Porl'iri,.o's 
brother Rodolfo RAMIREZ EXl'llll clandestinely went to tho coasts of 
Cuba to get me. I am sending you photostatic copios of our 
parolee .cards. I belle,·c they will suffice but at tho same time 
I will •rite to Porfirio's mother who is still in Cuba since 
she has not been given po1·mission to leave and come to this country 
and I wUl ask her to··ge_t cop_ies of tho mar1·iage- certificate. 
I will send them to you ns soon as I receive them. 
Thanks again, 
/s/ Clara DELGADO ,_
