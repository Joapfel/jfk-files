It was determined there was no collateral information which 
would indicate that the statement by SHULGINA had any factual basis 
and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behalf 
of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "forcibly recruited by 
American Intelligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to 
BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as ~ loyal Soviet citizen and 
report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGINA.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with 
the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV. 
It was stated that AR TEMOV had been involved with a series of American 
to\lrist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly • 
familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV 
with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959. The summary noted this 
was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief 
of the Anierican-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-
• ment. Although not specifically stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV 
was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO 
was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO 
has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section, 
First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-
mately 1957.
