I concur in Mr. lfatts' e_valuation. ~Ir:. Moore is a verr 
•' )' -... 
good administrator and his office has performed its collection 
-mission very well and provide~ excellent 6peiational services and 
suppott. They have not been tested in our emigre program because 
of a lack of potential but I am confident they will do the job 
"ell as required. I rate Mr. Moore super-ior in his ability to. 
represent CL\ and the Intel'Iigence Community on the outside and 
he docs a very good job in representing DCD within CIA and the 
Community. In a pinch I feel that I could depend on Mr. '.\loore 
more than almost any other DCD field chief of his grade.
