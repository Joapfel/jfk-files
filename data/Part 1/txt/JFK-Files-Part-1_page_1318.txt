KUBARK stand to suffer, but ODACID will be tied directly in to the

tacts_. ~n undercurrent of friction has recently developed between 
AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on 
29 March. This was precipit~ted by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14 
the Cuban t~rm for a homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban. 
This in turn gives rise· .to the question whether AMICE/14, with a 
possible J;iistory of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made 
such an ·approach'·. to AMTRUNK/3 . - • 
D. The commitments made.to AMICE/27 or which AMICE/27 claims were 
made to him are a matter of concern to the Station. This is an 
area- over which ~~ture misunderstanding or aggravation might easily 
develop .
