The KGB document supplied by GOLITSYN, however, refers to 
a number of casca cf A::erican tourist3 w~ were !ou.,d by the 
KGB to be engage:! in intelligence col:i.ec~ion or intelligence . 
support activities. In addition to McG(J\.i;_:,, the GOLITS"iN ~ocu~ 
ment cited the cases of SIY.i-RD, Gr.A'{ an..l FF.J..l,CIS, all of t!':e:n 
CIA agents detected by the KGa in 1958 and 1959. These years 
coincide with the time when NOSENi<O claims to }-.ave been Deputy 
Chief of th~ secticn "'·t:.ich ..,as res;;>0nsible for ~ni to ring ar.d 
uncovering activities of this sort, b~t SOSE~KO has never :::.en­
tioned them. Furthe~re, the annual r~ports Gf the section 
which l:OSENKO would l1ave helped to write, by virtue of his 
clai~ed position as Deputy Chief of the American Tourist Sectio~, 
presumably included all of these ~ases. 
f. NOSENKO's Tourist Paper 
I 
NOSENKO was auestion~d at length on the review of Western 
tourist operations whi-::, he clain-,ec to have written for GR:BANOV. 
He said he gat:1c1i:cd the :::aterial for thie studr from earlier 
annual reports of the Tourist Depart~ent and by talking with 
vad ~us case of~icers, t.~en took ti':-? stcdy to GRI nA!:O'/' s • 
office. N03EN.i.;Q could r.ot. remembe:r \.lhet:ier he discu3sed his 
fir.dings with G,U3nt.OV, cc:.1~d not c;1ve any c::<aoples of the 
information which r.e incl~1ed in the report (o~her than statis­
tical information on the increase in foreign tourism), could 
not recall what the report said at.out CIA to~rist operations 
(other than there appeared to be in~r~ased use of tourists 
travellir.g by automobil~), and cij nGt kn~~ ~hat other Ar:ierican 
Intelligence services w~re sending agents into the Soviet Union 
under tourist cover during th~se ve3rs. On the basis of his 
r,:isearch for this report ar.d his c·,m experience, 1'CSENKO said 
he knew that KGB operat.ions against tourists had been develop­
ing slowly and that, at the ti~e the report -as written du=ir.g 
the tourist season of 1959, the KGB knew little about the use 
of tourism by the l\lr.erican ser•:ices. 
BLAKE'& confession that he passed docur.entary infor:ation 
on this subject to the i:ce, but 1COre particularly the intensity 
of KGB operations against tourists at this time as reflected 
in the GOLITSYN d~cu.'1!E!nt and otiler rEFOrts indicate, that this 
statement by NOSESKO must be errcneo~. 
CJ• The OSWALD Case 
According to NOSE:n:o•s account of his direct involvement 
in the case of Lee Harvey OSWALD (Pages 136-144), his partici­
pation seemed to ste;n solely from his supervisory role as 
Deputy Chief of the Alr.erican Section. In this capacity, NOSE?iJl:O 
said, he was the one who made the decision that OSWALD was 
i 
l 
•not normal" and of no interest to the KGB. On other occasions •:.1,: 
NOSEUKO has reported t..~at he made this decision together with 
his subordinate KRUPNOV, or that •t~ey decided,• or •it w3s 
decided.• NOSENKO's information o~ the handling of OSWALD in 
1959 is unique, and there is no collateral info::mation against 
which it can be reliably measured. The results of the poly-
graph examination in October 1966, hc"'·ever, indicated that .
