ADDENDUM TO JOURNAL 
OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL 
Thursday - 6 July 1978 
se 
1. (Confidential - MMP) LIAISON Accompanied Scott 
Breckinridge, Special Coordinator for the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations, OLC, and Rodger Gabrielson, f 
OLC, to brief Thomas K. Latimer, Staff Director, House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on the state of 
play as between the House Select Committee on Assassinations 
and the Agency. Mr. Latimer immediately understood that the 
crux of the problem lay in the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations possible exposure of sensitive information 
(Nosenko and/or Mexico operations) in open fora. He said 
that he would brief Chairman Edward P. Boland (D., Mass.),. 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and that 
the latter might discuss the matter with Chairman Louis 
Stokes (D., Ohio), House Select Committee on Assassinations. 
He suggested that the best approach would be for the DCI to 
raise the issues we were concerned about with Chairman Stokes 
and, then, if necessary with the President. The latter in 
turn could register his concerns with Speaker of the House Thomas P . 
. 0' Neill. Mr. Latimer said that the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence charter precluded the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence from playing a significant role in 
this matter.
