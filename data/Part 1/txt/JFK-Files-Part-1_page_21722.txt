As previously inciicated, the conclusion is there _are a sufficient 
number of unresolved c;uestions in the BELITSK.iY case so that discrep-
ancies between information f.·om XOSE;-.:Ko and the actual record in the 
BELITSKIY case cannot at present be considered as a reilection against 
~,OSE:-.KO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not 
know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case. 
The pr·cvious swnmary noted on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA 
was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955. It also 
noted that NOSEXKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY "reported to the KGB 
... that CIA had warned BELITSKIY agair.st SHULGL"'lA. 11 The previous 
swnmary stated BELITSK1Y reported to CIA that SHliLGI~ was a KGB 
agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY. 11 
There apl?ears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by 
,NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY 
against SHULGI:i.'\A," is a reasonably accurate description o{,what actuaiiy 
happened in May l %2 during Agency contacts with BELITSKIY in Geneva. 
The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially 
told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by 
the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence 
while previously in Paris, France.
