few new details of i2portance on the American correspondents, 
NOSENKO has proven unreliable regarding his work against >.rrtrJ 
Attaches: He misidentified two (YEAGER and VAU L\ETHEM), he 
claimed to have almost no information on the backgrounds and acti.­
vitiea of the others, and ho lacked even.the most important de­
tails on security affairs involving the majority of his eight 
alleged targets. In addition, NOSEnKO has told CIA almost noth­
ing al>out the work of his colleagues in the U.S. Embassy Section. 
The statements by NOSENKO about this period therefore hold 
so little substance and the manner of his reporting was so u."lcon­
vincing, that his claim to have bee~ an officer of the U.S. 
Embassy Section in the years 1953-1955 cannot be true.
