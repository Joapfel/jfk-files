l April l'Ji0 to 31 March 1971 
Commt>nts of Reviewing Official: 
I fully concur with the Rater's comments. I am 
pleased that Mr. Flannery explained the circumstances 
surrounding Mr. Williamson's recall from Costa Rica 
so well. His tour was a fine piece of operational work 
and in no way should it be tarnished by misinterpretation 
or gossip.
