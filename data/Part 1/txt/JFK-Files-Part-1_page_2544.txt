G. NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty that the KGB 
recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his 
defection in 1964. (Previous conclusion) 
The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO is of the 
opinion that there were no KGB ·:i:ecruitrnents of United States Embassy 
I 
personnel in Moscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception 
of 11ANDREY 11 {Dayle Wallis SMITH) and~Herbert-'HOWARD'~ who actually 
was a(USIAJ employee but did work part of the time in the Embassy. 
The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of 
.!· 
NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual knowledge so that tliis opinion· 
can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB 
I 
recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. The 
only logical conclusion is that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be 
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that 
a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any 
way of the recruitment. This should in no way be interpreted as a 
suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased 
observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to 
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area. 
The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKQ~ s]w;tJ.4i be 
GOUi~~;-1 
examined and can be cited as follows.
