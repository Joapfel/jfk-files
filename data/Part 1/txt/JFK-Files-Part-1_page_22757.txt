SUBJECT ~ -SPECIFIC - Arthur G. VHVADA 
Reference: HAVA 755 
DISPATCH NO. RJ<H-A-331,4 
DATE 17 January 19$7 
1. Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA's early TDY to Headquarters_ -
were held beheen the agent, the tiel:i case officer, and the Chief of Statfon on 
13 and 14 January, as a redult of which it beca'll8 clear that, unless Headquarters 
bas a co111pelllng reason to the cootrary, it lo'Ould be advisable that the conte!l­
plated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's ~~rrent contract year, 
i.e., the period of July-August 1957. 
2, A nwnber of 1.m;,ortant personal problems dis?ose VIAVA.T)A to accept the 
delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue fro111 such a postponeiaent. Hts 
'Wife is sufficiently ill at this ti111e from a form of nervous col1tie as to recom­
mend that she not travel now. Hie children would have to-lose a semester ot 
their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. ~oreover as he 
and family have resided in tropical areas for a number of yea.rs, VAIVADA would 
have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed v1.nter clothing 
tor himself and his !am.Uy which does net seem justified for a period as short _ 
as two months. Owtng to several routine but t1.J11e-consu.-u-l.ng inquiries being made 
by the local ODA':ID in connectfon with his ... -ue's visa a.-,plication, there is no 
guarantee that VHVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957. 
3. On the operat1.onal side, in spite of the. original Station request tbit. 
VAIVADA' s trnel be expedited, advantages now -of delayioi his TDY outweigh the 
disadvantages, from the Station's point of view. Host tmDOrtant of these 1.s that 
two pro:mising sour-:es ci.trrently under develo::,ment by the Station, namely AMPRODARCH-
6 and A>:?HODARCH-10, 1,ere originally contacted by VAIVADA and be bas since been 
the person working most closely with them. To substitute h1.11 with a relatively 
untrained cut-out at tlds point in the1.r develo;,mmt is not de..;irable. On the 
basis of the original pro;,osed tuaing of bis trip the Station bas however proceeded. 
'ldtb tirm plans. to transfer handling of two ot.ber sources, A.~DA.t?CH-1 and AM3I• 
VALffiT-5, to a reli-able PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be 1n1 tiatP.d whether 
VilVADA departs nav or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low­
level sources off VAIVA!JA' s bands ihereb7 treeing the lat.ter to undertalce new
