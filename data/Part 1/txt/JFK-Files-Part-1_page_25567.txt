undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service vtth a 
•. {generous te~ination payl'lent. He has earned it, ancl only termi.natioo

from :~cc:::::a:t:aw (it is the law, not custom) says that an erJployce 
who is fired ~ust be paid three ~onths' salary plLs twenty days' 
j 
salary tor Each full year employed by the company at the pay rate 
existing at the timt:! ot separatio11. GJ:.REND~'s curr-1:nt co\'cr coin~1any 
adberes to this formula. Since G.ERENn.c:•s termtnation cla\•se has· 
always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for. every 
year of service (iu the event of his termination by WOF'IRM), we would 
not want to change that, and in fact wu wish to.add to it the three 
rJonths' pay guaranteed by ME.ixican law. At the s~ time, we do see 
SOll'e virtue in the su~gP.stion in para~raph J o.t P..et B that full 
retirement iJenefits {in the eve!lt of GEHENDE's resignation) would 
apply only after 20 yeari' service, with lesser bc~efits until then. 
Our suggestion would be that in the ~vent of his resignation prior .to 
15 full yehrs of service (i.e. prior to 18 March l~7U) he be paid 
twenty days' salary for each tull year, that after 1~ years ~ut prior 
to 20 he be paid this aMount plus three full months' salary, and that 
after 20 years be be paid three months' salary plus ono months' salary 
for eve;ry iull year. It is true, of course, that Mex.ican law does 
not make any provision for payment of a terminatiou bonus to an 
employee who resigns, but most E>nlightcncd corupauif:s have some sort 
of retirement program, and, as Ref D correctly poi:1ts out, "working 
for WOFIRM is a very special case and det1erves exc{'ptional financiRl 
coris-idefation." In the- case of GEREND>-;, we arc nu attempting to 
establish any pattern. This is a special case (as are most) and the 
Station'.merely wjshes to i-nsure that Gr:RENDE, who has made WOl-'Ill\l a 
career w·i thou t- recei v in~ any career bencfi ts in r;::turn, is rewardE'd _ 
for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future. Gt::P..r.:NDE 
'fs -not witllout his faults, and he is hP.ing ndeq,,ately compensated for 
the worK he performs, but we cannot expect to get nore out of him 
without showing him greater respect. 
4. The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment 
_be made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract: 
a. In,, the event of GERr:NDE's torminatioo by WOFIRM, he will 
receive three months' pay plus one month's pay for every full 
yoar.c (?f. service since 18 !,!arch 1955, calculated at the rate 
applicable at the time of termination. 
b. GER~DE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be 
accepted by WOFIR~,f as being in its best interest, and GJ::RENDE • 
• will be eligible for terminal payment -according to the following 
formula: Prior to 18 !Jareb 1970, GER.ENDE will recei.ve. 20 days' 
pay for every full year of service since 18 l.:arch 1955; after 18 
March 1970 but prior to 18 March HJ75, GER.ENDE will receive 
three months' pay plus 20 days for ev~ry full year since 18 
March 1955; @fter 18 March 197.6 G.l:JU.:NDE will receive three months 
pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18-Marcb 
19_55. All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable 
at the time of resignation. 
s. Paragraph 10 {b) will, of course, remain in force.

· 6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another 
year without change. We assume that this bas been done, although we 
have not been notified.
