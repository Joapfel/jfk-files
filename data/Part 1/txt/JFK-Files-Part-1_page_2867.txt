a[British]double.agent~ NOSENKO was in Geneva 
at the ti'me . · 
Association with Other Soviets 
According to NOSENKO, the Soviets he saw most often in 
Geneva in 1962 were A.K. KISLOV (see above), Yu.I. GUK, and 
M.S. TSYMBAL. (Both KISLOV and GUK were involved in the 
"ANDREY" case: see p. 33· .. ) 
A.K. KISLOV 
TASS correspondent KISLOV was one of the three other;dele­
gates besides NOSENKO staying.at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva. 
NOSENKO said he arranged for KISLOV's name to. be given as a 
notional source of information 9n Soviet ~isarmament po~icy 
to KGB'aouble agent BELITSKIY (see below). NOSENKO drank 
and caroused with KISLOV while in Geneva,·and KISLOV was 
NOSENKO's companion in early June, when NOSENKO either 
squandered or was robbed of KGB. oper~tional funds. [the less 
he asked CIA to make good], and on the night of 10 June, when 
he squandered the 2000 Swiss francs CIA provided on wine and 
women~ With reference to the threat posed his security by 
KISLOV's knowledge of his profligacy, NOSENKO said that KISLOV 
was "too drunk to know what was going on", and in any event 
.constituted no threat. 
In 1964 NOSENKO reported for t~e first time that KISLOV 
had been. a KGB operational contact while stationed in tl:le 
United States and that NOSENKO had been introduced to KISLOV 
by·a KGB officer in Moscow prior to·departing for Geneva in 
1962, so that he could use KISLOV at the conference. On the 
basis of NOSENKO's favorable report afterwards, he said, 
KISLOV had been recruited as a KGB agent on his return. 
In 1966 NOSENKO named the Soviets living with him at the 
Ariane Hotel in 1962, but did not name KISLOV.
