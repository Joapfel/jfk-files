(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
NOSENI<O's Information 
Handling.of Monitor Reports 
According to ~OSENKO, only a limited number of KGB 
personnel, all in the American Department of the Second 
Chief Directorate, had access to the monitor reports. These 
included Department Chief KLYPIN (but not his deputies}, 
KOVSHUK, NOSENKO himself, and GRIBANOV, to whom important 
items were shown. The existence of the audio operation and 
its product were concealed from personnel in other KGB 
Departments. The reports were produced by the Second Special 
Department of the Operational Technical Directorate (OTU). 
The OTO Second Special Department has several sections, one 
of which was the English Section under Colonel N. Ya. KUZMIN . 
. KUZMIN's monitors, fluent in English, listened to and 
transcriLed the tape r~c6rdin~s. Their reports of the 
. pr.ece<ling: day's product were brought daily by Tatyana 
GRISHNYAT (of the Second Special Department) to the American 
Department. (In some accounts NOSENKO has said that he 
received the reports first, at other times that they went 
first to KLYPIN.) NOSENKO reviewed the reports, marked 
significant portions and usually within twenty-four hours 
returned the reports to the Second Special :.Jepartment. 
In NOSENKO's absence either KOVSHUK or GRYAZNOV reviewed the 
reports. The Second Special . uepartrnertt prepared sterile 
ab~tracts of the portions NOSENKO had marked, abstracts 
which disguised the source of the information contained: 
the abstracts were returned to the American Department for 
the reference of individual case officers in the Embassy 
Section and for filing in the delo-formulyar (developmental 
file) kept on each American employee in the Embassy .. 
Location of the· Microphone's 
In the 1962 Geneva meetings with CIA, NOSENKO emphasized 
that the KGB was listening to all conversations of the 
service attaches and partic'ularly, to conversations held in 
the office of the ·Minister Counsellor. In addition, he 
referred to "points" .. [microphones] in the office of an 
unnamed State Department employee, in the Agricultural· 
Attache office shared by_BRO'{-m and IIORBALY, and in the 
Embassy code room.
