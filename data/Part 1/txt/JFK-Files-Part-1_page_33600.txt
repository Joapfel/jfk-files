_. In July i949, Horvat wrote the Honornble Joserh c. Grew in care -
o:! the National Co=i ttee for a Fr,.e Europe introducing hilll~elf as 
the Repre:;entative of-the ne:-,:ocr:itic SJov .. ncs and Pre:;ident of the 
Int"!rr.:itional Peasant Union for Euroi::e, and su.::--.est.ing tha-t he jo:1.n 
forces i1. th the Co111:•1ittee in the common strur:--le ar,aindt Co111JT1w1ism. 
- ·In return for a trip to the United Stat.es he offered to bring a 
lar~e confidential rc,.ort on his activities to cate and pre~ent a 
scheme for :;ucr.essfully sunpres3ing comr.unism ar.d delivering the 
sub~UP,ated nations in the ::ihorte:J't i:,o:,sible ti.Jlle. He \oias informed 
that the Fw1d was confininr'. :f.ts activities to re.f\JC,N leaders already 
reaid.ine in the United States and that the prof'osell visit was -
1.rnr,o::isible at that time. 
Horvat haa recently announced his forthco~ine arrival in the 
UnitP.d ::itates. Several Slovenian and Croatian ne,-sp..-ipcrs in this 
countr-J have received articles (which he wrote himself) glorifying 
his past and pre~ent activities. None o! them, so far, have taken any 
notice of these articles ,d.th the exception of the Croat sepc.ratist 
(pro-usta:;hi) paper, "DA!'.JCt,," publieht:d in Chicaro. Supposedl7 
Dr. •·-acek was highly amused on reading the article describing the 
great "Slovene peasant leader. 0 
!lobody in Slovenia in pre-war days would havf' considered 1-'avel 
Horvat as a person to be taY.en seriously in public life. He is 
con~icercd by a number of sources a political impostor and as 
pers~nally unethical. Neither tr.e Interr.~tional Peasant Union for 
Europe, of llhich he claimed to be president, nor the De:i.ocratic 
~lovenes, of which he is a r~ore&.ntative, is considered a le~iti.11\ate 
oreanization. The Director of the Func's YU[,oslavian Research and 
Inforn.atic-n Desk was the editor of a daily pJ.pe1· in ~lovenian for 
elP.ven years before the war. He never met Horvath, seldom heard of 
him and his p.:.i:er, as far as he: h1ew, never t.o,k notice of him or his 
activities.
