GOLITSYN: Yes. Maybe four. day!:~- Then we knew that the Air.eri.:.. 
can Embassy took a ticket f_or him· (the· American .tar­
get) for the train ... _And KOSOLAPOV took a ticket 
in the same.compartment. And before the departure 
we knew exactly from.the guide [co11ductor) of that 
tr·ain that it's the sa.-cie person--(! 'm not certain. 
whether he was a) code clerk or not a code clerk*-­
but his name, his real name. It was listed. And I 
was at the railroad_ station at that time.· I went 
to see off the delegation, the Soviet delegation.** 
Question: See them off? 
GOLITSYN: Yes, the delegation. And I asked him, KOSOLAPOV: 
"Who is this persc~? I suppose !he is an) American?" 
I suppose (believeJ he said: ~He's a fat man, a 
young fat.man." 
•· i·, ... -~-- ... 
Question: The American? :-< ;··· 
GOLITSYN: Yes. And I suppose (believe KUSOLAPOV said) bespecta­
cled.**~ And KOSOL..\POV and these persons were 
smiling and looked through the window before depart­
ure. 
Question: In the compartment? The train·compartment? 
GOLI'rSYN: Yes, and then this other person visited Helsinki from 
KOSOLAPOV's division [the U.S. Embassy Section, .A.~eri­
can Department, Second Chief Directorate).**** 
o-.-~stion: When was this? 
GOLITSYN: It was in surrmer or r.iaybe September or so of 1961. 
And I asked him. I reminded him about his case .•. 
Question: Who was this? Do you remember? 
GOLITSYN: I don't remember because he changed his.name. I 
·know him but I ... And I asked him how is that case 
that I helped KOSOLAPOV with? And he d1d not want 
to discuss it. Th3t 's why I came to,:_the conclusion 
that this case was a success. Otherwise he would 
have told [me) . .And I am not sure but I can try to rec­
.•.. ognize .. _this person in pictures. 
Question: You think that you could?

when he first gave this lead, GOLITSYN identified the 
American as a code clerk . 
GOLITSYN was not asked details of·, this ,del~.gation. There 
were eight Soviets, including KOSOLAPOV, on this train. 
••• KOSOLAPOV's description does not fit John GARLAND; it is, 
however, a fairly accurate characterization of Paul JENNER.
