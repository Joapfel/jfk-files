Naturalized US citizen who worked and lived in Honduras for a number 
of -eara. He has social and business contacta with offlclala of the 
government. the armed forces and the buslnesa community. 
(1hla report vas developed by an Army repreaentatlve assigned 
to tile office of preparation.] 
For over five years I have been 1n cloae contact vlth Hondurans of. 
different backgrounda and aoclal position. Never before have~ aeen the 
anti-American aentlment which la sweeping Honduraa at the present time. 
Tbe feeling la not only evident among acudent and labor organlzatlona. 
1but a::iong aectora of what la considered to be the best informed and 
educated individuals ln the country. Most of them are convinced 
that the US has the .influence to exert diplomatic pre•,surea on El Sal• 
·wdoT tn order to aettle the pending border dispute. but has failed 
to do ao. 'Ibey see the US Government as favoring El Salvador. 
During conver86tlona with aeveral government officials they emphatically 
auted that Honduras waa ·not going to open the Pan American Highway to 
Selvadoran traffic. This ls the attitude of almost everybody that I 
tallied vlth. Thia alngle issue baa served to unite the country like 
never before. there la a new feeling of patrlotiamwhicb vaa lacking 
before the conflict vlth El Salvador. 
1be c.ampalgn against Salvadoran products baa reaulted ln an incentive 
for Honduran lnvestora. I have had several inquiries from Honduran 
bualaeasmen vbo are interested ln establlablng productlon facllltlea for 
CODS1!111er articles which were normally imported from El Salvador. 
flaeae individuals are eager to invest and eatabllah factorlea ln order 
to fill the damad for product■ whlcb were laqx,rt.ed from El Salvador. 
JloDduraa has be- purchasing arma and --.nltlon from Portuguese and 
Belgian aourcee. Some of thla armament baa arrived ln the·country. 
According to a aiU.tary informant moat of the armuwnt baa.not been 
.. u.ued, but le expected iD the couat1r7 before tbe ead of the yeer.
