MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3 
SUBJECT: 
REFERENCE: 
QRPHONE 
Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE 
Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November 
1971 
1. I made some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon 
first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best 
to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form. 
z. As you may know, we had trif'!d for years to give QRPHONE more 
meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the 
;·. operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that 
i1 your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors. 
a. Security: RODIGAST' s and QRPHONE' s personal security 
cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected 
QRPHONE from accusations of being CL\, which have haunted him 
throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in 
which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charges 
leveled at him whether or not the Ollie Harrington incident had happened 
in Paris. 
• • 
b. Location: Apart from the efficiency of the French police, 
there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of 
QRPHONE' s even going to Paris for a meeting, let alone being stationed 
t there (e.g., protection of RODIGAST' s identity, the Harrington incident~ 
and the location there of the Wright clan). I cannot imagine why he would 
consider it, or why we should advocate it.
