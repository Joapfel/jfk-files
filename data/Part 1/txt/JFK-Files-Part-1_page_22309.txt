arrived in Warsa~ on 14 December 1960 and that NOSENKO left 
for c~a on 15 Ncvember 1960, t.O~ENKO revised his st:>ry of

a:nour.t of dctai 1 i:.cl-..:rling tl·,e date of the operation ('lo'hich 
NOSENKO did not recall) and the fact that the Polish agent·.

In accountd gi~en since his defection, ~OSE:nco h3s con­

on 13 Nove!:lber 1960, arriving i~ W~rsaw on the 14th; froM 
12 to 16 November 1960, KOSOLAFOV is confirmed to have been 
in Helsinki, apparently in con~ection with an operation in­

reported that an Egyptian agent visited A.~erica House, met 
MORO?iE there, but did not report anything of interest con­
