Ml:}!():LJ.JlI:VM FOR Fl.LE 2J October 1953 
SUB.iEl.'Ts .offiALlJL 
On ~6dnesday, 14 October 1953 _l met with suoject at his a!)clrtl!ler.t in 
the Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia for tne purpose of obtainmg 
his signature on the Travel foucher prevousl_y submitted covering tu.s travel 
from \;osta llica to 1-iashington, D. C. 
BIHA.D.LJL indicated t~t· the combination of his schooling at ~erican 
University in the r.iornings and his covert training in the afternoons which 
also keeps him busy during the weekend, is keeping hll!l fully occupied. 
Tho.igh he did no_t press the issue, he wor.c!ered whether it would be necessary 
to continue his schooling at American University. He i11dicated he tr.ought 
he could handle any inquiries regarding his activities satisfactiu.l.ly. We 
both decided ho"-ever tnat, regardless of the hnrdship placed on him, he 
should continue his schooling at .American University since any inquiries 
could then oe properly and legitLutely backstopped. One of the difficulties -
-~nvolved is the m:1o;mt of daily travel between the university ar.d his 
residence. 
~as~uch as the distance ir,volved plus the high rental cost factor 
(175.00 per month) present a few difficulties. This plus the. fact that the 
plausibility of a student paying S.JCil rent is sorr.ewhat questionable', ,mu.DIAL 
indicated he might rr,ove to a more suitable location. 
On 2J October 1953 he informed he was moving to 5008 - 7th St., l~. w., 
Washington, D. c. as of this day fo::- cover, convenience, and financial 
considerations. iie will advise of his new phone nur.iber if and when it is 
available. •
