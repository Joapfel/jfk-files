b. Several offic~s objected _to references to 
the assassination of President Kennedy and the ·Watergate 
affair (pp. 5, 16, 30). These were rather innocuous 
and could probably not be justified on legal grounds. 
c. The second objection was the author's general 
verification of the information in the Agee book and the 
impact of this book on the Agency. Again, deletion would 
be difficult to justify., but you m~y wish _to· discuss the 
damage potential with Mr. Phillips directly.· 
12. Chapter ten: Retirement 
, The DDO raised the question that Mr. Phillips 
statement on page 12 that he knew Agee has been to Cuba 
five times betrays knowledge he gained either from travel 
programs or liaison services. This would be a difficult 
point to argue in any confrontation with Mt. Phillips. 
13. Epilogue 
a. The SSU questioned whether this.manuscript 
is the proper vehicle to surface the fact that two cables 
sent to Santiago in May 1973 established our non-involvement 
in the overthrow of Allende (p. 6). We could see no 
justification to strike this. 
b. The SSU further believes that revelation of 
friction between Mr. Colby and Dr. Kissinger (p1. 13) is 
also improper. Perhaps·so, but difficult for us to press 
for deletion. 
c. And last, the SSU objected to comments on 
pp. 14-18 which are suggestive of Agency judgements and 
evaluation regarding the conduct and success of the 
investigative efforts as well as other personalities 
critical of the Agency.
