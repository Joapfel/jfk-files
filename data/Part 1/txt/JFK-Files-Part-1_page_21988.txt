•. materials and reports. immediately available it was decided 
that something we.s not· quite normal· about OSi~A!.D, .and th.:. 
KGB therefore had Inturist tell him that he woul4 have ~o 
leave the USSR when :us visa expired. OSi'iALD's suicide ::,' .. 
attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that . 
it bad been right in deciding to refuse OSWALD's request ·~· 
for citil.enship, particularly as th.e hospital abo re• 
ported that he was not normal, .and ·the Tourist Department 
decided: "We will do nothing; 'A'e don't want to know him." 
Inturist was suusequently told: "'There is no KGB interest 
1n him. Do what ycu want' ... The_KGB th~ught that he was 
of no intere•t for the countty or for the KGB, that he was. 
not normal, and that he should leave the countrr." The 
Tourist Department a~d the KGB in general thereupon "washed 
their hands" of this matter . 
There was never any oper~tional use of OSWALD nor was 
there anything in OS~ALD's file to indicate that the KGB 
attempted to debrief him on his past service in th.e U.S. 
Marine Corps or other matters; this was because "he is a 
very little person and also it is felt that he is not nor• 
mal, so the KGB is afraiu to do this with him,"* The GRU 
was not informed of OSWALD's defection, .Neither was any 
attempt made to exploit OSWA~D for propaganda purposes 
in Moscow or in Minsk.· In short, there \.las no intelligence 
interest or iontact with OSWALD after the initial assess• 
ment of abnormality. 
(ii) KGB Interest in M3rina OSWALD 
The KGB had no knowledge or interest in Marina (nee 
PRUSAKOVA} until she and OSWALD applied for permission to 
register marriage, In fact the KGB diu not know that she 
was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no 
surveillance on OSWALD to show that he knew her. When the 
KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the 
Archives of the Minsk KGB as w~ll as neighborhooJ.checks and 
checks at her place of employment. The people where she 
lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple 
girl, not very clever, only fair in her studies, not an active 
member of the KOMSOMOL. She was a simple "philistine," an 
uncultured girl more interested in ~cssip than i~ anything 
.important. The KGB never considered recruiting her as an 
informant on-OSWALD "because it was considered dangerous to 
recruit a wife to report on her husband."· ~or was it con• 
sidered to recruit her for.use after shear.rived in the 
United ~tates, "because she would tell him arid also. she 
• would probably_. tell the Americans,, based o.n the· assessment 
of the type of person .she was." • • 
--: ·(iii) OSWALD' s Marriage and Departure from the USSR 
. NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties 
in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her 
departure from the 'Soviet Union. Be replied: •• "Jhe So_viet 
law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a. foreigner. It was

OSWALD as fear of bec_oming involved with an unstable -per•
