b. "Romulo," who made at least one trip! "out 
of tOlrll" from 17 FeLruary to 2 A,ril 1969 (po~~ihly 
to Guatemala) during the ~riod covered by RO'ifTOS's 
reports, appears to Lelo~g to a faction of th~ 
Guatec.alan FAR family disillusioned 1rith PBP.UMEN. 
c. The only ,real service asked LIRIXG-3 by. 
"Romulo" during the period under reviev was to put 
up an unidentified "c.omrade" scheduled to come to 
Mexico at a date which "Ro:iulo" said be could not 
detenune exactly. This "com·ade" was not the young 
Guatena.lan who dropped in on' LIRIXG-3 for a couple 
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April. 
d. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence 
that URING has done its best to denounce him as a 
suspicious elem6nt definitely not to be trusterl (see 
reports dated 15 and 19 February). 
3. Several attempts to tail "Romulo" did not produce 
narttcularl? sismificant results. A oretext investi2ation of 
apartment 102 of .:.alle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo~• 
produced the results contained in the Spanish language report 
dated 26 Febru~,forwarded ·as attachment #2. There werefno 
traces on the Ine~)".~~'i'O!i deX•~lllE.\"'TEL family. 9::-l:,= C(. ,·Nc.k1~

4. There is little question at this point that ~IRING-$ > 
is close to persc,na non grata with LIRI.SG. Hence, his further 
usefulness against the IiBRU~ target is very limited. 
ROITOS bas kept away from Ll&ISG-4 since LIRING-3's release 
from orison in Guatemala. Altbou~b LIRING-4, following her 
father's-death (see YEXIt'O CllY-0125), may visit her mother 
in PBRU~, she has no parti~ula.r love for LIRISG·or the PERU~ 
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the 
Station is, as it bas done many times in the past, waiting for 
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next m'?ve.
