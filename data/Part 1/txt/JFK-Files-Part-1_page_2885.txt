(SEVENTH DEPA.R'I'MENT January 1962-Janua.ry 1964) 
Arrest of BARGHOORN 
At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO 
described the provocation and arrest of Yale University 
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963. NOSENKO's 
most comprehensive statement, from Nhich the following 
paragraphs were largely drawn, was made on 9 June 1964. 
NOSENKO said that the purpose of the KGB operation 
against BARGHOORN was to retaliate for persona non qrata 
action taken against three Soviets in New York City in 
the case of John W. BUTENKO [in November 1963] and to 
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet (Igor 
IVANOV) in the BUTENKO case who was jailed. (NOSENKO 
had asserted in Geneva, earlier, that the operation 
against BARGHOORN "was to discourage future arrests 
such as that of IVANOV, not because of any special im­
portance of IVANOV himself.") 
NOSENKO's Information 
In 1963 four KGB First Chief Directorate officers 
ass"igned to the New York Legal Residency were caught in 
operational activity in the United States. Of the four, 
three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a chauffeur 
and had only a service passport. The three Soviet 
diplomats were hel<:i three or four·hours by the American 
authorities and then released.· IVANOV, the chauffeur, 
was arrested sinee he did not have diplomatic immunity. 
GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, 
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was 
directed·by.KGBChairman Semichastnyy to take "necessary 
measures." GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office 
NOSENKO; A.G. KOVALENKO, Chief of the Severi.th Department; 
and G.I. GRYAZNOV and Yf;!~ M. RASHCHEPOV from the 
American.Department. After.describing the arrest, 
GRIBANOV asked what information- the Second Chief 
Directorate Departments had on any American, Embassy 
employee or tourist, that could serve as the vi~tim of 
an [retaliatory] arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV said 
that at that very moment there were three or four 
k~erican Service Attaches in Rostov and that, in the 
opinion of the American Department, these officers might 
be carrying electronic apparatus. It was known that they 
had cameras, that they had been taking photographs, and 
they had been ··observed taking notes. They could be 
arrested in Rostov before they took the return plane to 
Moscow. 298
