(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - ca. 1953-June 1955) 
Additional Reporting 
Knowledge of another KGB operation involving Americans 
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in 
the American Embassy Section, against CIA officer and 
Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis Sl-:1ITH (seep. 37). 
NOSENKO claimed to have personally participated in the 
operations against E.E. SMITH in 1954-1955. The incidents 
which NOSENKO described, however, occurred in June 1956, 
by which time NOSENKO, by his own account, had beenout of 
the American Embassy Section for a year and when he was 
involved in the Seventh Department recruitment of[!ichard0£ 
BURGT\_ His involvement in the 'BURGil case has been confirmed. :..r L='.. a, :..I :' 
NOSENKO has also described the KGB recruitment of military 
cipher machine mechanic "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, se~ p. 33), 
whose true name he claimed not to have known. He dated the 
recruitment as occurring "in 1949-1950" and "before he 
joined the KGB", although he said that he knew of the 
existence of the agent during his first tour in the Embassy 
Section in 1953-1955. However, NOSENKO also related that 
"ANDREY" was recruited while Roy RHODES was in Moscow, that 
RHODES "had spotted 'ANDREY'". "ANDREY" and RHODES over­
lapped in Moscow from April 1952 to July 1953. "ANDREY" 
fixes his own recruitment as occurring in December 1953, 
and until his departure in April 1954 he was responsible 
for the entire Embassy code room. In that capacity "ANDREY" 
• was a direct subordinate of the ArmJ:. Attache cryptographic 
security officer, NOSENKO's target~y Captain Walter MUL~. ()fi

as he claimed, it -is diff1.cult to perceive how he could have
