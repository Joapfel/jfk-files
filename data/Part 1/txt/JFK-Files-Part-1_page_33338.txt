the Chilean people over the single p,. ,ltlcnctc r,'llfio 
station th,ll h.id not yet been shut down by the 
military. He began: • 
; This is surely the last time that I will be able to speak 
·.to you . .... My words are not spoken in bittcrnt•ss· 
but disappointment. In the face of these events I 
can only say to the workers, "I ~rn not going to 
resign." At this historic ;uncture I wj// f>iJY with. my 
life for the loyalty of the people. • 
&laming "foreign capital, fmperiallsm·, and reaction" 
for persuading the armed forces_ to break with their 
tradition, he said: 
History will judge them . ... My voice. will no longer­
come to you, but it does not matter. You will con­
tinue to hear It; it will always be among you. At the 
feast, you will remember me as an honorable man 
who was loyal to the revolutio"'. '° 
At 1 l:00 a.m., the coup leaders -permitted those 
who wished. to do so t.o leave the building, and­
except for his personal secretary-all the wome.n, 
• Including Allende's pregnant . daughter, left. The 
military also offered the President and his family 
safe conduct out of the c9untry ff he would sur­
render. Allende rejected· ttie ofter. The Air. Force 
then sent in Hawker Hunter bombers, which re-. 
pealedly h.it the palace. with rockets and 5et fire to 
large portions of it. Finally, shortly after 1 :30 p.m., 
Allende decided to discontinue. the resist:ince, and 
the members who had been· with. him left the build- • 
Ing in single file, led by the secretary carrying a 
.v.hite flag. Allende stayed behlrtd and, sittine on 
a sofa In a rece.,tion room on the second floor, put 
two bullets into his head. The automatic rifle that he 
1.1\l'd was a gift from Fidel Castro." 
Conclusions 
Since the coup, comments In the world press 
,,presenting widely divergent political postures have 
c,red the Chilean case as proof that the hope of 
.1 •thitvlng Ma_rxist socialism through dem<:><:ratic 
mtan\ Is a vain one. Yet most people have failed to 
I ~,,. two fundamental errors of the Allende policy, 
i ~ithPr of which was essentially related to the 
: .it,~pt to establish democratic socialism:

requisile "lhe support of the majority of the pc;or,le." 
Allende ·actr,d as ·if he had ·1hat support; but P.ven 
at lhe hicliec;t point of his popularity in the April 
1971 elections. he never achieved it. Moreo·,cr, his 
policy of deliberate class polaritation, aimed at ex­
p.:mding his elec.toral base, was more succcs'.;.ful In 
pitting professional and middle-class groups against 
him l~an in widening his supi,ort among workers, 
peasants and low-income r,roups. 
2) Madist cconomistc; and policymakers h;1ve 
always plar.cr1 primary emphasis on Investment and 
the expansion of thc productive capacity of the 
economy. By contrast, the Allende policyma~ers • 
emphasized Increases In consumption and cornbined 
this .with a: headlong rush to take over Indus tr:/ and 
agriculture-a course far removed from the "tNo 
steps forward, one ~.tep back" of Lenin .. The con::..e­
.quences of these ·policies after their deceptive Initial 
success were massive government deficits, runav,ay 
Inflation, and a near-breakdown of tho economy. 
(The arr,um<!nl that Allende's economic problems 
. were the result of a shortage of foreign credit dOP.S 
not real tr' hold water, since they were caused by 
policies Initiated before !he foreign squeeze· and 
s:nce, In any event, Allend1:'s regime managed to 
secure enouch foreign credits from Latin American, 
European, Soviet and Ch:nese sources to Increase 
the Chilean foreir,n debt from $2.6 billion to $3.4 
billion in less than three years. Much of tho ne·N· 
indebtedness was to Western. Europe and other Latin 
American countries. Surprisingly, Chile's debt to the 
USSR, China anct Eastern Europe Increased only from ' 
$9 million to $40 million between 1970 and· 
1973.")
