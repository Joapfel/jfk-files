.. ·--.Subject i;, the FE "referent" for the Washingto~'' B:f~e and, as 
such·; has the responsibility. for coordinating: all work against the 
--.F'..~· targets as well as himself handling the b'ulk of1,operational 
ac·tivity in this category. In addition, as is true of all officers 
at the Base, he is resp·onsible for contacting and developing American 
and foreign nationals in the Washington area with the ca;,abili ty 
- of producing opera tiortal and intelligence informa t·ion on other areas 
of priority inter.est to WOFIRM, His forte continues to be the 
exploitation of existing assets rather than the recruitment of new 
ag~nts, p~rticularly among foreign nationals. He writes well and 
·is ordei-:1.y and professional in his approach to operations. His~ 
work on the highly involved and sensitive WUWORTHY ,case is cited 
in this rt:!gard. Although he ,continues to feel a bit unsure of 
himself in operational areas other than FE (to a degree not warranted 
by his performance, as the WUWORTHY case shows) he is improving in 
this regard and is on his way to bringing his operational actj,vity 
·1n other areas up to the level of his perform:.ince on Asian targets. 
He performs his supervisory functions w.ell. Ho is·very cost 
conscious anq his accounting for official funds is prompt and 
1 
accurate. No particular training is contemplated or recom.menood 
at this time,
