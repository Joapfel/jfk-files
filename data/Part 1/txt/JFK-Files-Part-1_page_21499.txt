INTRODUCTION 
The following_ summary and ~nalysis is not intended to be 
all inclusive, that is to contain a ~pcci£ic comment on all organi-
zational, operational, personality and case· type information furnished 
. by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO~ To attempt to do so ·would be repetitious 
~nd confusing to the reader and would no~ be of mat~rial benefit in the 
·formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of 
primary concern. 
This summary will not contain a detailed psychological 
• assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain· a iecitation 0£ the numerous 
theories which have been··promulgated in the· past concerning varying 
·aspects_ oi the NOSENKO case. This summary will i:>e primarily 
· directed toward the question o'f whether NOSENKO was or was not 
dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively 
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in 
a··reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO 
has· admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that • 
these were of a personal nature_, intended to enhance his own importance
