subject: 
When an employee occupies personally owtwd quarters hli; SF-1190 
should show in Section 21 (5) the initi:11 purchase price as 
shown by the deed. Sccllon 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show 
rinnual rates for utillll~s as authorized by Section 1J2.5 of 
the Standa1'dized ftegulatlons (Government Civilians, Foreign 
Arca~). TI1ci~~ aru the qri1j ·items of cost to be considered. 
WH~~ the qunrters ~llo•arice system provided for reimbursement 
·ror quarters costs within· a predetermined maximum, the regu1itions 
provided that tho allowance 1'or personally owned quarters should 
not exceed 10 percent t>f the purchase price, converted to dollars 
at the ,:x<:hanv.o rate avail'ablc·at the time _of purchase, plus allow­
able, utili tics. Th•: 10· percent of purchase price was ampl0 to 
take care or taxos, dcpn,ciation·; repairs, intc1rcst 011 investment, 
and amortization of thrJ CO!-:!tH ··Hithin n re:1sonable period of Ume • 
by U; S. st11nda1·ds. Only Ilg-ht, fuel, and water could be added 
in arriving at the allowance. 
Under the c11n;ent quarters allowance systc-m, it is expected that 
tlie flat ra.te wi 11 be paid unlcic;s the authorizing officer believes 
it necessary to reduce the paymc·n t under Sc-ct ion 13-1. 2 of the 
Standardized Regulations. The employee in personally owned 
quarters would be treated the same as any other (except thal 
ho cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances undct 
Section llJ of the Standardized Rc:gulations). This makes 
unnecessary a special rate for personally owned quarters. The 
requirement to report the purchase prite on SF-1190 is to pro-
vide- the authorizing- ofJi.cer additional information to be consldcr(•d, 
togcthdr with any other purtln~nt local ~ircumstanccs, in deciding 
whether reduction of t~6 allowance is necessary and, if so, how 
·much. Only the u tili tics costs are to be considered in addition • , 
to the purc'l1ase pri-cc P.xcept in those rare instances where land 
rcn't is involved. Because of varying conditions between posts 
an~ indivld~als, it was not considered advisable to specify nny 
certain percentage of the purci1ase price that should be consiJe,·cd. 
In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing 
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly 
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally 
owned quarters should !Jc treated any ·diffE'rently than the employee 
in rented quarters arid i·eceiving the flat rate allowance.
