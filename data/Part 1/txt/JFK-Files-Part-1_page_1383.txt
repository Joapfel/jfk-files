1. AMTRlm,KL2 is a ~l Jy~ar old Cuban who· is mature for his 
years, and.fn some aegree experienced in clandestine opera­
tions. He attended {Qatholic Socia:f}&iversi ty in Havana for 
two years, majoring in Social Studies. Prior to Fidel's 
takeover- A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido 
Autentico which upheld the constitution of 1940. He supported 
the revolut.ion against Batista till it became apparent that 
Ca~tro had cast his lot for a Communist regime. During his 
university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged 
in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials. 
Following the Playa Giron invasion.a. great many in the Havana 
underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise. He 
continued~ this ork through 1961 and finally· left Cuba

scientiously applying himself in preparation for his m'ission.
