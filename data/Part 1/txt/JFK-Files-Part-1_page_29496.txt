naissance, caching, sabot_age, raids and/or guerrilla warfare 
support operations. 
3. The organizntiorial concept to be followed is that of 
small tonms which can function independently or in combination 
and enti1•ely under indigenous leadership. All personnel ·should 
be fully qualified in basic paramilit:u·y skills and should be 
physically and mentally prepared to nwunt operations on short 
notice. Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities 
ne~essary for training become available. 
4. The standardi for members of the group should be con­
st'ar1-tly· up1~raded by culling of members who become margi·nal or who 
do not dev.elop as expected. Recruitment uf promising new members 
will be dopendent on the needs of the station bas1::d on policy 
directives. Priority should be given to sabotage training to 
permit the mounting of a sabotage. ·proi,;rnm at the earlies l possible 
moment. Coincidentally, p_lannirirc·and thought should be given to 
. ·the ·topics of. cover, recruitment, training and establishment of 
• '.those facilities nece·ssary for a· rapid expansion of the group if 
a full scale oper.ational program !:,hould be developed. Also, the 
force should be identifled to the primary e~ile authority as a 
non politi.cal and independent body which is unilaterally engaged 
in the overthrow of the existing regime, The tempo_ of training 
should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual 
proficiency of the group in ail categories of activity in readiness 
for the order to mount a full scale prog-ram with all teams parti­
cipatin~ simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justifica­
tion for oporations.
