end ~entaJly unhappy. When asked about her thou~hts on Australia 
she said that it she h~d wanted to live Jn Austral~a, ~he should 
h:tni" married :in Austrv.liaa. The ~eparation I-ad n~t improved our 
intimate relationship. 
9. In Argust I wad to ta~d fi•e ~eeks' leave and to with the 
children to Astro-World ia ',ouston a;1d vJsit my mot~er's family in 
South c .• ~·')E.ta. Wh~n r sugg~sted Jo~tr,ortin;; ·mv.k~.ng Mr,nthly payments

~over the ~ack debt, in order to make the trip, she ras adamant. 
s:iring that if I d".d n•.it l1a\•e the cash for going, I should n:>t take 
lesn·e. I borrownd from my life insura,1cc policy and left with the 
three youngest children. Adriana had a touch o( bep&titis and 
joined us three weeks later. Altar spendiny ~e ~onth in South 
Carolina, we retlirned to ~:c:xico to find that LI!::~JTY-19 had very 
much enjoyed her solitude. ·we had alrr.ady talked about divorce before 
her trip to Hollnrd in the sprin~. I had told her that I would n~t 
cc~sider partin~ w:th the children and she said she woul1 consider 
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well 
as give her a s~bstnntial sha~e of what she considered was her part 
of the house. The title of the ho•.1se was in my n:t!'.lt> and had been 
since the buying of the land. LI~::!,iPTY-19siid I could mo,:tgs-.ge or 
sell the house but that Lhe money was what she was mainly interested 
1~. I told her that the sale or the house ~as not finar.cially 
wise in ~ts unfinjshed state and t~at the house and land are vory 
litcly to apprdcJate sharply over the next three or four years 
considering the hou~ing devclopm!nts going on in the area. Added 
to this was ~he ser.t. 1.nental attachment to the house and area. A 
mortgaie, on the other han~, for the amo~nt of her father's loan 
plus what she }Yas asking, was sorneth ing I could not afford considering 
the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in-~exico. 
10. At the same time. d·.h•ing Septemucrl969, that we were going 
through the a!>ove-me.1tioncd discussions, LIEMPTY-19 wns taking a 
cours~ at .Japan Airlines tn b,,cume· a tour guide ar.d group leader 
for ~rips to the Orient ns earlr as November 1969 and, certalnly, 
to ::."l:po '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer d. 1!)70. :he 
received a diplor.ia to that effect. I told her th .t if she wanted 
out rf th, marr~a~c and wanted to be free to travel lt was all 
right by me but that the c~ildren wJuld stay with me and I would 
continue to repay heh father at the aGreed rate ($~500 per month 
n nd 5 percent per y,.ar). She then so·Jght leg-a J ad 1•ice fro•,1 a•1 old 
friend, putch lawyer Guillerno Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered 
h·~r to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have 
advised LIE~.rPTI-19 that und~'r the local legal system the only way 
to try for a siz~ble rash settlement and considerable support was to 
han.; ori to tr.e children beca1:Fe LIE/.[PTY-1.9 made a radical ''about-fa,;e"
