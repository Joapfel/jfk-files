Indiar: Eml.iassy rec£:ption in 1958, perhaps two or.three times to

have played any personal pare in ~y assig~rnent to the £irst 
Section, First Depart:nent, Second Cjief Directorate in 1953 since 
at that time GRIBANO'l was Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Direc­
torate supervisir.g the Second uepartr..ent a:1d not the First De­
partment. I do r.ot kno~ who made the decision to transfer me 
from the First Department to the Sever.th Depurti:ro1::nt in 1955, but 
I did :-.ct have any person,,:.. contact or conversatic:1 with GRIBANOV 
concerning this cecision. I do no~ know if GRlHANOV played any 
perso~al part 1.n ~y appointment as Deputy Chief of Section ,in 
the Se\·enth Depart.ment in 1958. I do not rerr.ember just who was 
responsible for my appointment to tilis position. I did ·not per­
sonally discuss tr.is appointment wit.h GRIBANOV. GRIBANOV decided 
at tQe end of 1959 that I would be appointed Deputy Chief of the 
First Section, First uepartrnent, Secc~d Chief Directorate, and 
this apl)Ointment took place somt,ti!!le in January 1960. DUBAS, 
the Chief of the Seventh Departmen= in 1959, told me that GRIB.\!JOV 
planned to appoint m.? to this position and that he had spoken to 
GRIBANOV two or =hree times about it, but hau been unable to get 
GRIBANOV ~o change his plans .• I spoke to GRIBANOV myself abcut 
this matter once or twice. GRIBk~o\· did not tell ma who had 
recom.-nended me for this new position and did not tell me any 
reason for my having been selected. GRIBANOV did tell me that my 
appointment was a part of his personal plan to raise to more 
senior positions a number of younger officers, including myself 
and Aleksey SUNTSOV. The decision for me ·to return to the Seventh 
Dapar.tment in January 1962 was actually made in aboutseptember or 
October 1961. GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy Chief·of the 
First Department, but the new Chief of the First Oepartme~t,
