He y;as then told that he would remain at .this safehouse, ,mich 
thencefc?"-ard was his regular plac~ of reside1!ce. Since this 
time NOSF.NKO has had contacts with Cin personnel only, h~s been 
under full-time guari;i, and has not been permitted access to 
news media. 
Detailed interrogation of_ NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964 
in order to obtain information which he had been teluctant to 
give in debriefings, and to clarify contradicticns in wh~t he 
had already reported. This phase of the interrogations was termi­
nated on 24 April 1964. 
Despite the searching nature of the questio~s and the im­
plicit and explicit doubts of his ver3city, NOSENKO pr~ved him­
self willing to answer, or to try to answer, questions put to 
him._ Because much more information pertinent to the qu~s~ion of 
his bona fides had to Le obtained, a nc~ phase of interrogation 
was bt:gun-rnmid-May 1964. Difterent interrogators were intro­
duced and questioning was resumed in a neutral, nor.-hostile man­
ner. The period of neutral questioning conti~ued until mid-Novem­
ber 1964. 
After further consultations with the FBI, a new ~ou~d of 
hostile interrogations bega~ on 26 January 1965. NOSE~KO was 
questioned for a total of a~out 140 hours by individual interro­
gatoro and by interrogation teams consisting of two or three 
men, and he was directly challenged on many of his pre·.•ious re­
ports. He admitted that certain of his earlier stater.:£::nt:s had 
been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions in 
his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had been 
basically truthful, and that he had co~e to the United States 
solely for the reasons he had originally given. This interro­
gation was broken off on 5 March 1965. 
Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of 1964 
and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated 
on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Err.bass::· Section 
of the American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, from 
.January 1960 to January 1%2. Among the reasons for selecting 
this particular period were the comparatively large amount of 
collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state­
ments could be checked: the importance of the U.S. Err~assy and 
its personnel as the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate 
targets; their importance from the standpoint of American _ 
security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti­
vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its 
Deputy Chief. 
In keeping with Soviet practice, CIA asked NOSENKO in 
February 1965 to sign a series of,, interrogation reports, so­
call'!'d "protocols i" most· of which concern:. the- period -of, his 
claimed service in the American Department. T_}!E?_s_e we~!_ten
