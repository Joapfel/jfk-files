- ln the loss· tl).a; six months. since my preparation of the previous report on 
Mr. Rane!~µ,_ his overall-performanc;~.has "·cmtinued strong. He has effectively 
continued.to provide the day"'to-day operational support for the FR Bases in Los 
Angeles arid ~n J'nncisco and the two (soon to be three) singlct.01' officers in-----
·- ·the Northwest, Colorado and Arizona. The level and complexity of tho operationai 
support am;l guidance which he has pro~ded with skill, sensitivity §lnd humanness 
has continued uniformly high. 
Mr. Randall has again effectively trained a new Intelligence Analyst with no 
loss of efficiency or res~onsiveness t? the· ever-increasing field requirements • 
.. _Mr. Randall h.i;s been under my supervision for ZS.months as the San Francisco/ 
Los Angeles Oe~k officer and has continued successfully-to meet tho challenges .. • 
of increased re~ponsibility. It is now planned to appoint him as Branch Chief to 
be rEisponsible for the Bases in n·oston nn<J Atlanta a·s well .as Los Ang oles a~d - -----· -
San Francisco . The increase in complc.xitr of this new assignment for him will -
be heightened by the a·ssignment of additional oper.atio'nal personnel in three of his 
fo~r Bases, which will materially add ·to tlie demanding workload of his ·IlJ;"anch, 
We are ·confident he will be able to meet the challenge of these added rosponaibilitief.l.
