14-00000 
a CIA role in the Glomar Explorer (p. 26). In view of the 
fact that GSA is now trying to rerit or sell the ship, we 
don't feel we can justify a classification on these items. 
c. The DDO objected to the general discussion 
of cover starting on page 29, but we could not pin the. 
objection down to specifics. SSU commented that Mr~ Phillips 
reveals the location of many stattons· around the world • 
(including /Brazzaville) on page 31)_, but deletions of the 
names wou1Pbe(t.~\~fi.c~1 t to justify legally .. • . 
d. Both the SSU and LA Division objected to 
Mr. Phillips mention of assassination attempts o_n Castro 
(pp. 42-44), but, again, we would have trouble defending 
the classification of the information presented. 
10. Chapter eight: Rio de Janeiro and Caracas 
a. The most sensitive objections to this chapter 
involved the information on pages 15 to 20 of our role 
in Chile - Track II~ These included the allegation of 
back-channel correspondence and the fact that the information 
could distort the public's view of the whole affair. 
Unfortunately, no one could tie it to the sources and methods 
or classification questions and therefore it was not included 
in the Phillips letter. 
b. Other items of concern were the discussion 
of cover in Brazil (pp. 2-3); the ~perational use of 
women (p. 23); the employment of blacks (p. 26), especially 
the revelation that two black officers in Brazii were 
CIA o·fficers, jeopardizing their cover, and that Army 
commo went through the Agency during the Dominican crisis 
(p. 31). While all of these could cast us in a questionable 
light or make operational life more difficult, it would 
be difficult to justify their deletion on legal grounds. 
11. Chapter nine: LA Division 
. a. Although the vequested deletions from this 
chapter are rather lengthy, they do no include all 
reservations raised by our offices.
