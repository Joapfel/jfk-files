Top Secret 
(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
Comment: NOSENKO dates his transfer as occurring "before. 
GOLITSYN's defection", which he insists 
occurred in mid-January 1962 even after learning 
from CIA that the correct date is 15 December 
1961c Obliged to take the latter date into 
account, NOSENKO reconstructed the foregoing 
chronology of his departure from the Embassy 
Section and his assumption of duties in the 
Embassy Section and his assumption of duties 
in the Seventh Department. Repeated interro­
gation has never resolved the reason NOSENKO 
attached so much significance to the date on 
which he believes GOLITSYN defected. 
In claiming to have transferred from the 
Embassy Section just prior to 5 January 1962 
(when his participation in the Seventh Depart-. 
ment compromise of@. E. JOHNSON]is confirmed) ,06 
NOSENKO's account makes it impossible for him 
to have played the role he claimed in the events 
connected with ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin 
Street deaddrop. (See p. 216.) . 
NOSENKO's assertion that he was GRIBANOV's 
candidate over KOVSHUK for Deputy Chief of the 
American Department is implausiblec In contrast 
to NOSENKO's self-admitted undistinguished 
performance, KOVSHUK was a former Deputy Chief 
of the American Department.who had been personally 
invo~v.ed in such American Department operations 
of the previous decade as recruitments of Roy 
RHODES and Dayle SMITH, and the development of 
CIA officers WINTERS and fM.ORE:Ly . .and the interro- OJ 
gation oJ CIA· officer· Ll\NGELLE, and the more . 
recent attempt to recruit@_TORf:>BER~. Dl .
