B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time 
claimed. (Previous conclusion) 
The above is conclusion "B" in the·previous summary in regard 
to NOSEN-KO. The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO entered . 
the then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his 
entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General 
Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV. 
Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of 
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary 
and will not be repeated here. His statements during current interviews 
that he.entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in.the First 
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con-
sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted. 
The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) tha.t 
NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed 
was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when 
he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in 
1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.
