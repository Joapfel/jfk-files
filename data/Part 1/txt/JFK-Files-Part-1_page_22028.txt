be a code c.lerit. We wanted to send KOSOLAPOV to Hel­
sinki with ·the mission of returning 'With JE?.NER on. 
the saJ:?e train, during ,.,.hich tin1e r.OSOLAPOV was to -
study his behavior. JESN£R was yo.ing and so was 
KOSOLAPOV. 
How old was JENNER at the time? 
I don't know. We sent GRYAZNOV's agent, a ballerina, 
to Vyborg as part of this operaticn. I think her 
first name is Yeva, but I don't re::iember her last 
namer her code name was asOLISTK1\a .. _. She was placed 
on the train in Vyborg as if she had been visiting 
someone there and was re.tur:-,ing ·to Moscow. The main 
idea \<,"as to place an agent ne~r J!:N!ll::R before he 
even arrived in :•;oscow. We wrote a proposal to the 
Chairman of the KGB·gioing the reasons for doing this. 
We explained that we had usually only one year in 
which to work. The agent "SOLISTf.~" met JEtrnER and 
spoke with him. KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted 
with JENNER and spoke with him, but I can't say that 
they were all speaking to-::iether at one time. She 
gave JENNER a telephone number. 
Question: A KGB telephone number? 
NOSENKO: 
• ,Question: 
NOSENKO: 
Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but 
he didn't call her. We then noticed that he wasn't 
working in the code room but in the mail room. O.K., 
that was interesting too. We "aited one or two 
months for the call to come, but ~othing happened. 
When JENNER once went to the railroad station or 
airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with 
GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet 
again. JENNER saw her b~t did not approach [her]. 
Instead, he turned in the other direction. Only 
later did we learn that he is a very quiet person. 
There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a 
suspicion that he may have been a ho~osexual, but 
there was no proof. He was like a child. 
How much tirr.e did you have between the time of the 
anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER's arrival? 
A month, plenty of time to prepare. 
Question: A month? 
NDSENKO: Well, approximately a month. The usual approval 
from the Central Committee was necessary so that 
KOSOLAPOV could go abroad. 
Question: Who wrote this? 
- HOSENKO: I prepared the khar~kteristika· ·[offic.ial form) on 
KOSOLAPOV for this TOY and gave it to the Personnel 
Office.
