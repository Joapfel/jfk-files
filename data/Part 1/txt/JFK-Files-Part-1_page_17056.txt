:,)y-·-complc-ie list of tho new tag numbers, along with a complete

enablod the Station to ldontify tho companions of Aleksandr 
Aleks·and1•ovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officor, during his 
last few days !n Moxico. 
4. LIE:MPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the 
Soviet E1nbnssy froqucintly gruvi ta to to g1·oupings with their 
- -RIS collongues in the "safoty" of tho Embassy backyard. 
This fact enabled the Station.to make certain tentative 
KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers

to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

"restricted area" a r the Soviet Embassy and also established
