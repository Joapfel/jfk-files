concern. i strongly advised against his getting involved 
in this deal. I explained to him the problems which the 
U.S. Government was having in Greece and the current wave 
of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.· 
If Roussos .. as a former CIA officer •,1cll known in Greece 
becami· lrivolved in sucn a venture, a flap of substantial 
proportions was likely complete with widesprea~ pre,s 
play. Roussos un"i:l_erstood and agreed not to get involved-.
