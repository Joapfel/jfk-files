D.epartment.. According to NOSENKO, the prepared 
report was never typed as a formal document. 
The view has been set forth that NOSENKO took undue risk in 
carrying written notes with him out of the Soviet Union. An examination 
of this material suggests that NOSENKO was using extreme care in 
collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, th~ 
possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought 
out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con­
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with 
little or no fear that a search of h1s effects in the KGB after his depart­
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None 
of the material was registered and all could have previously been des .. 
troyed by NOSENKO. 
The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB 
documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was. registered 
or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to: 
(a) The draft report for the briefing of the Collegium 
which has been mentioned previously. 
{b) A typed two-page report on several cases. Actually 
a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of 
submitting in handwriting as the others did.
