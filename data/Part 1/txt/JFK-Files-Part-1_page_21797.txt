Comment: 
1! March 1964 
SOSENKO has never referred to the KGB direc­
~orics described. 
KGB officers I.I. PETUKHOV nad P,P .. BORISOV in Canada 
told their agent George Herman SPRECHER to cease all intel­
ligence activity for a year, to destroy any incrioinating 
materials ln his posse~sion as well as to supply the Soviets 
witb passport photographs so that deacap~" docu~cnts could 
be prepared for himself and his f~mily. SPRECHER asked 
wh~ther the action had any connection with NOSENKO's recent­
ly publicized defection, but the KGB officers denied it, 
asierting NOSENKO ~was just a secretary".
