CUBELA was given a relatively light sentence, considering 
the magnitude of the· crime. Immediately following 
sentencing he functioned as a prison physician, and 
reportedly was driving a jeep une~corted, which is unusual

edly is now practicing medicine as a private physician 
in Havana. 
f. The questionable activities and current where­
abouts of AMTRUNK-9. We have learned of the other AMTRUNK 
agent~ who were wrapped up but we have been unable to 
determine precisely where AMTRUNK-9 is. There is some 
indication that he might have.been G-2. 
g. There was overlap with other operations: the 
AMLILAC's, placing CUBELA cache, etc. 
NOTE: Cables cited in this paper, and other selected papers 
from the AMTRUNK Project, are readily available in the 
LAD/JFK Task Force office for review if needed.
