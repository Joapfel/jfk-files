JG. The research prrijects ~f this department were to be 
·directed fundamentally towards the st.udy and electronic compu~ 
·iation of the mcJific3tio~ i~ both he&lt~y acd 3ick ~er~cn= of 
&uch:,biologicul paramaters as hemodynamic o.:urves, concentra­
tion and saturation of gases and alt~rations·in the basic acid 
equilibrium of the blood, and were to i~clud~ the studi of the· 
variations in the biological parameters from the hiochemirial 
and hemodynamic point of vie~ during cardiovascular surgery . 
and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular ap~ 
paratus. In neurophysiology_ and n~uropharmacology,.the re-. 
s,carch projects woul_d be oriented· towards r~search o_n higher 
nervous activity including electrical modifications p·roduced 
.in higher 1,ervous activity; in hematology, the projects would 
be oriented towards the study of 1soimmunization and·patho­
logical alterations of the different blood cells. The electron­
ic computers .would be needEd to proce~s the immense quantities 
of dkta such.research would produce. • 
17. Dr. Fernando J. Toro, a medical doctor who is also 
an electrical engineer, was to head this department. Toro 
is reputed to be very intelUge,it, a gifted organizer, highly 
motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the 
type of research described; he has-inore than 20 years ex­
pe~ience in electromedica~ instruments. 
18. Reouced Number of Research Projects. The scarcity 
of research proJects can easily be: explained by the fact thaL 
Cuba, which •has no considerable scientific tradition, must 
first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific 
research, and such training requires ye~frs of effort. The few 
persons prepared to do· import ant research are at the present 
time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization 
of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers. 
19. Research in Antibiotics. In 1960, ~r. Jose Antonio 
Padron, an eminent research scientist, began work on·the isola­
tion and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of the:ii" 
prope·rties, and experimentation with said substances; he ini -
tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC 
collaborator. As of December 1967~ he had isolated and exhaus­
tively studied 89 new antib'iotics, many of which are too toxic_ 
for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and 
perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at 
his=disposal, should result in discove~ies of scientific im­
portance. 
CHIC Training Program 
2~. Doctor_of Basic Sciences. The CNIC offers a three­
year ti•ainin~ program leading to the degree of Doctor of Dasie 
· .::icienc,?S for which program fifth-year medical studc nts with 
cxccptjonal academic standing can qualify -if (a) during tl1eir 
r.olleg~ career they have shown special aptitudes fo~ teaching 
and research, (b) the UJC gives them,an "A" grade in political 
standing or reliability, and (c) they are cleared by a DSE 
i~vcstigation. In 1966, of _the students then in the fifth 
year of medical school, only six· were accepted by this trai11111~ 
pr9i:rara; all were excellen~ students and UJC members and arc 
now medical (!octor~: Ramon Ortiz, n,,sa Elena Simeon, Ismael 
• Ch,·k Arce, Hilda Donderis ,· Julio Ro,lriguez Docal, and his 
~ll:. ira (lnu) . As. of April l 96'B-;- probably no more than 30 
student~ were studying in this training program, chiefly be­
cause of the rigorous entrance requir?ments.
