but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational 
or policy nature. 
L'l order to avoid any misunc!crstanding of the phrase ''bona 
fide&" as considered in this summarr, XOSENKO will be judged ;,rimarily 
on whether. he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB kno,;.,ledge, 
and .whefo.er his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this 
Agency _were known to the- KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent 
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previo~s errors,_ lies and 
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion- that NOSENKO is not a 
"u"na fide" defector. 
There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement 
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or 
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For 
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas 
cons_idered pertin,:nt has been compiled. Readers m.ay differ in regard to 
whether this arbitrary standard is a co,mpletely accurate standard, but it 
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from othe·r 
sources derived through, independent investigation will permit the reader 
to assess the information·in toto against any standard he considers 
appropdate.

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector," has been conside.red in
