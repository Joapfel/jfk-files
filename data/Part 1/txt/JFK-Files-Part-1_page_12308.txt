SUBJECT: Cuban Exiles Involve~ with DEA Page S 
8. Following·a review of all infor~ation on the 
foregoing Subjects available at D[A Headquarters and 
at this Agenq·'s llcadquarters. ,,c ai"e of the opinion 
that there is no data or 6ther evidence to suggest an 
outside organization is attempting to manipulate these 
individuals in an-operation ai~ed at discrediting the 
u.s.· Government and DEA. ~e believe there may be 
c.olllislon among the three Subjects located in Caracas, 
probably:to assist one another in·nefarlous schemes to 
one deg.ree or another; however, the ·information on 
hand d6es_not suggest their motivation.~ould go b~yond 
persona,], financial or influence objectives .. While one 
cannot absolu~ely rule out the possibil-ity, fo.r example·, 
that·the Cuban Service has run one or mote of the afore­
~entioned Subjects at DEA for the purpose of harrassing 
the U.S. Government, there is no conclusive information 
in our files to connect them with Cuban intelligence or 
a Venezuelan entity whose interests are inimical to the 
U.S.
