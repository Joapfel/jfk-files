Jeremy K. BENADUM - Rcquc:s t for Rel iremen t 
1. I herewith request that th,.1 ,.1ffcctive date of my 
rctircmcht be set as of 31 O~tober l~o instead of 30 June 1969. 
2. This rcqucHt is based primarily upon my desire to complete 
ten years of servi cc in the Agency a;; is requ t red by law 
in order to be eligible for Agency Reti rcmcn t instead of 
being retired under Civil Services Statutes. 
3. Secondly, however, I believe that by remni11i11g 
in my present position until 31 Octob<.1r 1970 I can assure 
a b~tter turn-over of contacts I have with a great deal 
less loss to the A~cncy. 
'1. I should appreciate n reply as soon as possible, 
sJnce if my proposal is not accepted, I shall plan to accept 
other employment on l July 1969.
