CIA, had a source in the GRU would have come from an agent or 
source of the FCD, KGB, not the SCD. It can also be presumed that 
a sou:rce or agent of the FCD in a position to fui·nish a lead to a 
penetration of the GRU by Western Intelligence would be carefully 
protected even within the ~GB. The possibility of course exists that 
a lead from George BLAKE, an FCD agent, resulted in the exposure 
~f POPOV to the KGB, but it is not established that it did nor is there 
any reason to believe the FCD coulq. not or did not have another agent 
or agents who furnished information to the KGB" pertinent to develop­
ment of the case agains.t POPOV. 
The primary question,_ however, as :regard·s the Cherepanov 
Papers is whether,. even if it is presumed the KGB obtained information 
from an FCD source or agent which led to suspicion of POPOV or 
identification of POPOV, this would be incompatible with. information 
in the papers and could only lead to the conclusion that the papers contain 
"deceptive information~ 11 
The conclusion in regard to the above is that th.e fact the papers 
attribute the exposure of POPOV to the KGB to surveillance on WL."\l"TERS 
when he mailed the letter to POPOV in Januaryl959 is not in.compatible 
with the distinct possibility that the KGB had previously obtained. info:::--
mation from an FCD agent o:.: agents \vhich actually led to suspicion i..1. 
regard to POPOV or actuai identification of PC?OV.
