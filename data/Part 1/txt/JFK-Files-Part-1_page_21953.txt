D. June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourfst Department) 
l. Introduction 
By bis account· NOSENKO served in the American-Canadian-· 
British Section of the Tourist Departm_ent, • KGB Second Chief 
Directorate, from J1.U1e 1955 (shortly :lft~r the department 
was cre~ted to operate with and agai~st t6~eig~ travellers 
in the USSR)·until his transfer to another dcpa~tment in 
that di.rectorate in January 1960. He was. a case officer 
until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section a9out June 1958. 
In state:i.ents made prior to April 1966, NQSENKO claime,2 to 
have been twice cromoted during this four and orie-half year 
period--to-captain in July 1956 and to major in August or 
September 1959--but in a signed statement ·of April 1966 he 
said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection. 
_NOSE..'11W has described his personal and direct partici­
pation in the section's activities as consi~ting of:. 
-Recruitment of two Soviet. nationals as homosexual 
agents,•• with NOSENKO their handler from the outset until 
they were dropped in 1962 or 1963. 
-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar­
getted again8t American tourists; their number varied from 
ei~ht to 14 and many were employed by Ioturist. 
-Operations involving :4 foreigners who visited the 
USSR for variou~ lengths of time. 
-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Com­
pany representative in Moscow, whom XOSENKO continued to 
meet following his reassignment in January 1960. 
-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was 
9.f no operational interest to the KGB, and subsequent par­
ticipation in the KGB investigation of OSWALD's activities 
in the USSR. 
Each of these categories is discussed separately below. 
2. • Soviet Homosex-Jal Agents.· 
Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a 
public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded 
that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some 
operational value. The KGB therefore mounted an operation 
which verified this possibility in 1967: A homosexual agent 
of the.Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked . 
VOLKOV into a compromising situation.· .. · Theri· VOLKOV, who had . 
previously been a KGB ·agent but was at this time deactivated/> 
was called to KGB Headquarters where, af_ter NOSENKO inter~o­
gated hia, he admitted hi,s·homosexuaUty and_ agreed to ·-·1· -
