Comment: Persons not holding a valid KGB identity 
document were not permitted entry to or move~ 
ment in the building without escort. The 
interviewer's name did appear on the building 
pass. The- interviewer's name was essential 
to the issuance of the pass: the interviewer 
• had complete responsibility for the visitor's 
custody while on KGB premises. 
Initial Service in KGB (1953) 
NOSENKO stated that in the period of Beriya, in March­
June 1953, ·the two existing directorates were the First 
Chief Directorate., which, was the foreign intelligence . 
directorate, and the Second Chief Directorate, the counter­
intelligence directorate. The designations were later 
reversed-for a few-months, he said,·by Kruglov, Beriya's 
suc_cessor. 
Comment: Beriyci rev_ersed t;.he designations of the. First 
and second Chief Directorates in March 1953, 
and· they \.lere· not changed back until March 1954. 
NOSENKO does not know how his own directorate 
was designated either at the. time he allegedly 
entered on_ duty or during his entire first 
year of KG~ service. 
NOSENKO described-the KGB identity document of the-period, 
but in spite of repeated questioning could not recall any­
thing unusual about it. •
