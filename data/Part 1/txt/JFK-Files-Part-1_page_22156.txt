He first volunteered BOLSHAKO\"'s na??:e during a discussion 
of the use of Novosti as a cover or~~nization for Sovi~t ·: 
Intelli~cnce 0U1cc1·s. "Yuriy UOLSil.➔ KOV of the GRU also 
sits there," he sn1d. ''He is a colont-1 and a friend of 
mine." Two days late:r, out of context with the preceding 
discussion, he introduced the nam.? again: ''Then tt.ere is· 
this OOLSH,\KOV. He is f!"Ol!I GRU who was in the Uni tcd 
States." SOSE~1<0 then co!!'.l!lentt.-d th~t this was "a very in­

SE:SKO added, "reported dirc.!tiy" to the: Cl,ief of the GRU 
concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy. 
:-:oSESKO said BOLSHAKO\" was in-;rod-.iccd to Robert Kennedy 
by an AMer ican journalist (unna!llE.d) at a r,:ccption in the 
United States. The joun~alist invited f-01.SH:\KOV to go for 
a wa 1 k, and as they strolled "down an al h,:;," there w:is a 
man sitting on a bench dircl!tly ah-=ad of thc-:n. "The jour-
nal 1st said: 'Listen, Ge(irge l DOLSHAKOVI; are you acquainted• 
with Robart Kennedy, the bx·oth<:r of th,1 PrF:s itlen t and the 
Chief of the Dt:partracnt of JustiC:\:?' OOLSi:AKOV said: 'No. 
Of course, I have heard of nirn.' 'Would :;ou like cie to 
introduce you?' 'Of cot:rse,' • BOLSKAKOV said, 'please do.' 
He led him to the man on th~ b~nch. Tbdre was this feeling 
that all thi!=. had been pr~-~rrar,ged." 
This contact"was at the personal dosirc- of Bob Kennedy ••• 
BOLSHAKOV was call~d i~ for t~is. As you k~ow, the whole 
idea of this c.:011tact was to pas.;; in format ior. to Kennedy

to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not BOLSUAKOV who sought to

'Please tell KHRUSHCHE\' so-and-so.' He would say: 'You 
know, some of· these problems seem insolvable~,. •. And BOL­
SHAKOV wou~d say: 'And you know, at home they think this 
and that way ... • ·without sctually saying that this was coming 
from KHRUSHCHEV. But, of course, this was clear without • 
explan9:tions. It was ac exchange of views on important poll-. 
tical questions of the moment~ He was like an intermediate 
point .•. " NOSENKO coll!lllented that he persor.ally thought 
that 1 t was a "case of mutual 'feelers.' being sent ou-t ·by 
both sides--exploring soae. given current political sit~at:ion_."
