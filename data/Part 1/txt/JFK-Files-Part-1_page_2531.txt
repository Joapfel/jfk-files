furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the 
.KGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of the relation•

and BELITSKIY did not then nor has he ·since admitted to the KGB 
his association :With CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium. 
As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in 
1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some 
;' at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused 
BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result 
he told the KGB .of certain events in London in 1961, relating these 
events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA. 
The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB 
actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London 
in 1961 and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the 
developments in his case prior to 1961:

time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also • 
reporting to MI-5. This individual reported information 
received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to
