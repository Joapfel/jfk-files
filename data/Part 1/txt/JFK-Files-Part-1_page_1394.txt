change in time or location of exfiltration becomes necessary, 
an ·OWVL message could. be sent to the agents. Any urgen·t and 
immediate message which might have to be sent by the agents 
during their short stay in Havana would be on a prearranged 
open code system by commercial telegram. Such a system will 
be worked out to cover several possible contingencies .. In­
