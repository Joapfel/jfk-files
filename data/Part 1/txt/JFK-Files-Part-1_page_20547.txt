Subjl'ct has·perfo·rmed in a manner quffe consi stcrit with his long and broad ex• 
perience in ~illlY aspects ~f-the. craft of intellig~nce. His senior grade, his special 
expertise in the: field of-propaganda and publtc-aiiori"and his very high intellect 
have· contribu~ed •• to the di'l(ision 1s operation"s in the public media field a sharp 
foc_us, an ec·onomlcafconcentration·of·money and effort and a consequently 
._h_eightened irripad_ •. ·ln.the Wt.i~.IJSTLER proj~ct, Subject vindicated his faith in 
_ il rrior_ibund_ clan~estirie asset by d«frnonstrating, a"fter about a year and a halt under 
his personal direction, •that it is one of the most effective· activities of its kind. 
Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this proj_ect, it had suffered from 
visionary and diffus.e direction and from poor_ ~ase office::rwagent rappor·t. Subjec·t•s 
p·ersonal handling of this Operation is marked by excellent rapport and th_e project 
.. pr-:>spers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himseU enthusiastically 
welcomes. 
Subject•~ supen-isory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one 
to two professional staHers under official cover and three professional career 
employees under unofficial cover. The fairness and precision of his management 
has patentl)· won their respect and inapired their performance.
