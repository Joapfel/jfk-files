Cooirdinatio,:1 Fot·ms. The diacuo:.:Jion of opero.-
tio~al cooroination revealea that ACSI was willing for 
Jlli~AVE to coordinate locally those opsrational proposals 
~hich might be rece~ved fro~~~t. Col._ Causes. Once thio 
coordination was .effected and if there were diangreement, 
tllen the operation could be referred to the ~/aahington 
headquartara of both ACSI and JMWAVE. Maj. Hntlington 
stated that the forms for effecting coordination i~ nc­
cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon ~t 
Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit 
in Uiarni in the near future. In view ·of th is Maj • 
Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination 
mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962. 
1. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T 
facilities in terms of PBRUMEN operations revealed that 
tile !Jiami ACSI unit did not have any \'J/T assets in 
PBRUtmN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes 
tms'; interested in cstaolishing W/T assets in PBRU1iEN. In 
view of' 6fhis he ash:ed if JMWJ\.VE would continue to assess, 
polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thouaht 
w0:rre ouitablo \'//T candidates. Xt was indicated that we 
were corto.iall' prepared to review all npp:rcopria te cases 
and would render whatever support was required. This then 
resulted in a discussion of whether Jf,ffllWE would be willing 
to monitor ACS! W/T transmissiom:, from PBRmmN in those 
instances where the W/1' operator had not baen asseosed, 
poly(Jli'Uphcd or timinod by IillBAll{. We indicated tlla t we 
would ll3 G].Ud to moni ter:· such tranmuissions if we were 
told in ndvance of tl.1e date, time and frequencies op which 
th0 bli·oadc,lGta ,,ere to be r.ude. This then led to u dis­
cu::;0llon oi? wh.othcir JUWfWE would be willing to truncini t 
C/W r.:oooue;cs for ACS lf ac:;onts. Here aca in, r,e s ta tcd that 
we rmu:i<l i'uvorubJl.y coHGidmr any :rrequ0Gts for C/Yl ti(·,:rns­
rniao1ons providinc that we knew the content of the raessage, 
the idcnti ty of th0 U({ent v;ho was to receive it, und the 
c~ont'o location a.id oquipraent which he mie;ht be usini::;. 
Lt. Col. Cauaoa otatod tlmt in view of this discussion we 
could nntic:1..puto that he would be levying requircr.1e11ts on 
us in the near future for ouppo1r."t in the W/T field.

j o 83crrnt Uiti tine;. A discussion of S/i1 teclm:i.ques 
:ircvcaJl.cd HA:it ifu requost for the issuance of S/W were 
rocoivod from their Llinmi representative it ~ould ba ro­
vJ\.o\'.;od, o.nd if AC81C appli'oved the opsra tion 1WBARI{ would 
be n□l,0d to issue u oycitera. Jii JfJWAVE U[;Jceed via ll.ocul

Wnahingt~n would cable to Jl\iWAVE·the number of the system 
wbicb was\to bo iosued. JUWAVE would then issue the 
oyatem to tbe ACSI representative in Miarai. ------. 
3. CO!:filENT. At the conclusion of the above discuosion arrange­
cents were mde for lunch, but Lt. Col. Causas cbose not to partici­
pate in tho luncheon oeoaion. During-the luncheon conversation 
ll!l:I. l-7ntU..ngton indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col. 
Caua00 \70Uld cooparate within the spirit of the DCXD's. Ao n result 
I.le ooked that JMWAVE be <mtremely patient with ACSlt until s~ch -tit;1e ,
