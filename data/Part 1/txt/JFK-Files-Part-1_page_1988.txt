From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord, 
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division, 
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with 
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the_· , 
Agency's Audio-~, ~terme2sures Program.~~They conceived and developed 
a unique tech~~ ind1luoroscopic scannin~,which is considered to be 
a major breakthru~gh fir the detection of clandestine microphones and 
other devices targeted against t~ Agency. It gives the Agency for ~4 
the first time the capability to~etect hidden technical listening de­
vice~) a capability for which the intelligence community has expended 
large sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech-­
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations 
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies 
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the 
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures 
Committee. "2 4
