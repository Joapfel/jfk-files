HSCA Request of 20 Julr 1978 -
OLC-78-2726 
1. Attached is corrf:spondence froa the ODO focal 
point on the IISCA investigation, responding to Question 
12 of reference. It states that there arc and ha\·e hecn 
no agreements (at least not as described in the IISC:\ 
request) bct~ccn CIA and the FBI, or other govcrn.:icnt 
agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities 
to report on U.S. ~itizcns abroad ":to-contact Co.:imunist 
embassies or officials. It also states that current 
legislation forbids such reporting. 
2. Attached are copies of papers collected by 
0/IG during the Rockefeller Co!llQission's inquiry; I 
recall th:it there ,:as a 1966 ~_£recr.,ent, which is not in 
these papers. In any event they do not seem. to contain 
a specific provision such as is envisioned in the rerort. 
It is possible that interpretations of NSCID and DCIU 
provisions resul tcd in routine reporting of such con-· 
tacts, although there were no agrce.:icnts, per se, for 
such action. Since the pro~ulgation of Executive 
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on 
reporting on U.S. persons, Khich Day affect past practice. 
llovevcr, this office is not in a position to pro,·idc :m 
Agency position on this issue. , 
3. It is requested th3t you coordinate with the 
DDO in preparing an answer to an Agency response to 
the HSCA question.
