(For the Purpose of Project Renewal) 
I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION 
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING St.'gment (discussed In relation to project 
ob Je ct Ives) : 
1. "To collect operational Information pertaining to LIMERICK 
personnel and ph-yslcal facilltlcs." SCANTLING has continued (See the 
last two Pro Ject Rev lews forwa r<led as attachments to HMMA-14093, 
13 November 1959, aii<l HMivlr\-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide 
worthwhile lnformatlon percalnlng to thls objective. 
a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued t'o be 
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example, 
operational Information recently lndlcated that the LIMERICK 
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair 
safes. lbrough discreet lnvestlgatlon SCANTLING was able to: 
Identify the Hrm, lts location and the name of the owner ln the 
event that we later wished to make an approach to ·him or to 
exploit this Information ln another manner. 
b. SCANTLING ls still the Statlon~s primary source for 
keeptng current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK 
~rsonnel ln Mexico City. This ls accomplished ln several ways; 
the most important being SCANfLING's follow up of all LIENVOY 
leads which Indicate the LIMERICK people are Interested In 
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal 
request for additional J~ralls). • : 
2. "To collect operational Information pertn In Ing to other targets 
of opportunity, foreign official Installations and personnel of lntelllgence 
Interest operating tn Mexico." SCANTLING ls very useful for collecting 
lnformat ion on other Stat ion targets:
