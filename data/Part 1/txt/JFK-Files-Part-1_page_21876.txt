After tellin~ CIA on 24 January 1964 cf his decision to 
defect, NOSENKO at the same meeting concurred when CIA gave 
operational and administrative reasons for hi~ to ~tay- lh • 
·place until the middle of February, Duri~g the week tha~ fol• 
lowed, the date of the defection was mov.eu up to 8 February 
in accordance ·,dth NOSE:~KO's wishes and wit.h his reports in• 
dicating that less information of value would be forthcocing 
than CIA had at first thought. On 4 F_ebruary, however, 
NOSENiO reported that he was being r~called to Moscow for a 
conference en t~reign tourism in the USSR, and he therefore 
placed himsel! in CIA custody on that uate,* Details on 
th~ tining of SOSENKO's Jefection arc given in th~ following 
paragraphs. 
At the 24 January meeting the CIA case officers agreed 
in principle ..-ith NOSE!;KQ•s J~cisicn to defect,. };QSE!1KO 
felt that it • .. ·culll be best for hi::i to disappear fro::i Geneva 
without a trace, leaving all his pc:rsonal possessions be• 
-hind; he ass'..l:~.i that CIA could e;,:iiltrate hi::i fl'o::i Switzer• 
lane to the United States. lie wanted to carrv •Jut this 
plan as soon as possible, but tha CIA officer~ encouraged 
him--and NOSE~KO agreed•-to remain in plAcc for at least 
three weeks more, The reasons liven NOSESKO for this re­
quest were: 
- The desire to get information on the local KGB 
Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to tho Dis• 
armament Conference while he still haJ access to this 
infornation; 
• The value of having NOSESKO present when O,M. 
GRIBANOV made a visit to Geneva about 7 Februar)' a 
visit known to CIA only thrcuih NOSENKOi** 
• The potential value to be derived from NOSENKO's 
in place spotting of CIA re~ruitment targets among the 
Soviet representation in Geneva; 
• The necessity of making arrangements, accept­
able to NOSENKO, for his defection and_ resettlement~

in placo for a short time longer are chronicled below:
