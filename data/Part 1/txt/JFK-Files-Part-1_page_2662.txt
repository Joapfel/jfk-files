Top Secret 
(AMERICAN E.MBASSY SECTION - ca. 1953-June 1955) 
Although able to identify correspondents in Moscow who were 
then _recruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information 
either in conversations with his superior [V.A.] KOZLOV or 
at some point and in some undefined way after he no longer 
was working against these targets. NOSENKO made clear that 
he was not the case officer responsible for the more important 
correspondents: "KOZLOV himself was work1.~g with them, the. 
c~ief of the section himself--with @iAP~R~~'6~it}:l@HAPIRq],s Ob 
·wife .. I p..lso know that KOZLOV was working withffi"HITNE~i)~ 
and with K._Andrew J.) STEIGER;. -~!3 For each of these persons 
there was an operational fi!e which I did not see." According 
• to NOSENKO, · he _was in no way involved with @_TEIGEfil and()~ 
-:. Cb .(!dmun~ S.TEVEN~ American correspondents who he alr1eged were

to·determine whether they _had developed any 1.mportant infor­
mation. His superior KOZLOV often ·went along to the meetings 
with NOSENKO, first to show him how to handle the agents and 
afterward whenever something interesting would begin to
