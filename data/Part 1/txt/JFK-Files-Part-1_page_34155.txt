STl\'i'E!J.EHT OF 1HUL DE LA RUA C \i:TRO,-
fv name is Ralil. de la Rda Cast~, and I vas the Chief Engineer atoard Uie CUban MY 
HERRA MESTRA until Yarch 20, 1~, -vhen I jumped ship in ·Y.uronn, Japan. , 
Working conditions in the Cuban Ml!rchant: Fleet also infiuenced my decision. I 
could not stand the inteneified espionage on board 1;,y met:lte-rt: ·of the G-2. It is 
worth mentioning that the pl.an to indoctrinate Cuban n:er~hMt crevs vao a complete 
failuri,. The regime has al::ar,d.oned the proj_ect altogether, are io now trying to 
place loyal Communists as officers and crCW?J1embors, even if tM7 are not qualified 
for their jobs., 
As a matter of foct, the hck of qualified personnel is an incr~aing problem, and 
another source of trouble aboard Cuban vessels. During the laet months a iotal ot 
tventy nine officials, officers and crewe!llhers of the Cubrui Jlerchant V.arino have 
defected (data of up-to-date merchant nnrine score). After I q.Jit tho HERRfi MAF.§ 
TR4, for instance·,:- ··there· was not a .c1ngle certified engine~r on board,· al though 
there Yoro GGV~ral young fellows getting on the job training •. 'f"nis is a fact that 
should be taken into consitJeration by the 11ilslirance firms tr.at underwrito Cuban 
vessels. 
Most or the vessels are faced vith all sorts of mechanical difficulties, due to 
lack of spare parts-and a very faulty zm1ntai.nanco, ·situation that gets worse when 
• consider the sc!ll'cit;y of qualified personnel just mentioned. . 
I am very _ happ;y to have Joined thoee of rt11 fellow Cuban offiee:-e vho preceded me 
in this decision. I wish to thank the "Free Cuban Merchant Varine Committee" for 
all the attentions acc~ded -me, and l hope to rejoiri our meret.a:.t fleet soon, vhen 
our vessels agniJi sa~l under the nag of a free countey.
