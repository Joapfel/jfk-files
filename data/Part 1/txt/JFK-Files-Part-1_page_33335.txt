itary Into the. cabinet, the nJval e$tablishmcnt ~e­
came Involved In a serlou:; conflict with the left wing 
of the Allende coalition. On August 7, the naval 
lntellieence arm announced the di~co•,cry of a plot 
to carry out an enlisted men's revolt on AuP,ust 11 in 
Valparaiso and Conccpci6n. The announcement 
accused PS Secretary General .:arias Altamirano, 
MAPU leader Oscar Garreton, and Miguel Enriques, 
head of the MIR, of being the "intellectual authors" 
of the revolt and demanded thP. liftin~ ol the con­
gressional immunity of the first tNo. who sat respec­
