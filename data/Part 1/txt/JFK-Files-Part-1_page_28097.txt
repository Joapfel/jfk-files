REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall) 
I concur gen.erally with.the·commente oC the rating officer. 
J believe .Mr. Randall hu shown improvement in hie handling of hie 
Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown g·reat_er 
initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however, 
J, would still l_ike to see a so~i,what greater and quicker recognition 
on Mr •. Randall's part of operational problem ar~as. Granted that this 
ls a talent that ls frequently hard to develop, it ls nonetheless, essential 
for ail Branch· Chiefs in this Division to a.:hieve a '1igh degree_ol 
operational perspicacity. Mr. Randall has the ability and n,eeds only 
additional experience to improve J\ls focus on the operational targeting 
efforts oC his respective Dasca. lie l_s_a thoughtful and CO!!&iderate 
e·upe.rvls.or, resp~ded by hle ·subordinaltHi l_lnd he repre11enta the Divllliop 
very well indeed, Mr, Randall's career would be cnhnnctid were he in 
a position to accept a field assignment which would got him into direct 
operatfona_l contact, i.e., recruiting nnd hnndllng agents, Unfortunately, 
for family medical reason11 he will npparontly be confined to the 
Headquarteu area for an indefinite period, On balance, I consider him 
to be a good Branch Chief who willingly worko long· hours and docs his 
Joh well.
