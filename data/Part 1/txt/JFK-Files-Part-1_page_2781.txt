·made a passing reference to an operation in which he had 
placed a female· iP-·oTisi.1: UB·: agent. in con tact with an unnamed 
American from the Embassy wnile the latter was visiting 
Warsaw and later brought the agent to Moscow to further 
compromise the American. On 11 June 1962 NOSENKO was asked 
whether he had foreign (non-Russian) agents working against 
the American Embassy, and he replied that he himself 
introduced the idea of using such agents to develop 
Americans afraid of becoming involved with Russian girls. 
• He had several such agents, he said, and he sometimes asked 
the East German and Polish security services to supply him 
with such agents. As an example, NOSENKO cited the case 
of a Marine guard and a code clerk from the Embassy who 
travelled to Warsaw. The code clerk was intimate with a 
Polish female agent, whom NOSENKO had planted in their 
train compartment, on the train ':to Narsaw, and later in 
.. Moscow.
