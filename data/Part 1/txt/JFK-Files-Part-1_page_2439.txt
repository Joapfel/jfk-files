NOSENKO has claimed that the designation of his Directorate at the 
time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March 1953 was the Second 
Chief Directorate and that it subsequently was redesignated the 
First Chief Directorate, DER YABIN has stated this reversal of 
designations occurred in March 1953. 
STALIN died in early March 1953 and that same month the 
MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERIYA 
as Minister. BERIYA held this position until his arre.st in early June 
1953. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office £or less 
than a year. Yuriy RASTVOROV was recently queried concerning th~ 
date of the reversal of the designation of the FCD and SCD and places· 
it as the end of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated that • 
the change occurred "soon after the advent of BERIYA as head of the 
MVD in April 1953. 11 In the light of our inability to fix the effective date 
of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the FCD, it is 
unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation 
of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD),

was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the SCD. 
NOSENKO is of the opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, which is
