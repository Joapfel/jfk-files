REF: • JMWAYE 7100 (IN 64414) 
l. IT IS OUR OPINION THAT BEFORE SENDING AMSTALK-1 OFF 
TO SPAIN WE OUGHT TO TRY TO OBTAIN MORE ASSURANCE TilAT THERE 
WILL ACTUALL'i OCCUR A MEETING BETWEEN AMSTALK AND A RESPONSI­
BLE CUIS OFFICER TO DISCUSS A PROPOSAL MORE SPECIFIC THAN TllAT 
DESCRIDED IN TILE curs MESSAGE. 
2. IF TIIIS OPERATION RESULTS IN ANY SORT OF•AN ENTENTE 
BETWEEN AMSTALK-1 AND THE CUIS IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO REVIEW 
AND EXAMINE EACH FACET MINUTELY• THEREFORE WE SUGGESTED THE 
SGSWIRL, IF POSSIBLE, OF AMSTALK-1 Atm MARTHA TO ASSURE THE 
CLOSEST EXAlilINATION AND CORROBORATION OF EACH PHASE OF THE 
STORY AT THE EARLIEST POINT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, TIIIS 
'T?C~ 
IS AN OPERATIONAL JUDGtMENT A~'D WITHIN WAVES PC!OGATIVE TO 
DECIDE.
