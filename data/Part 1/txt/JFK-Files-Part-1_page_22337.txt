a. Introduction 
NOSEUKO drifted into the Y.omsomo:, J-.e said, in 1943 or 
1944 without givir.g the step any tho~g~t whatsoever. All of 
hie friends at the Baku school were joiaing, so NOSE~·rnO did 
too. He remained an indifferent member of this Communist 
youth organization throughout his sc~ool and university years, 
in the GRU, and during hi& first year as a KGB officer. Or. 
arriving in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American De?art­
ment in 1953, NOSENKO told CIA, he was appointed Secreta1y of 
the arnall Komsor.:ol ~rganizat~on of the Second Chief Director­
ate, a group of ai>out 17 members. 
b. Discussion 
NOSENl'.O "'as questioned by DCRYAOIN on his duties as Kom­
so::iol Secretary (Pa1cs 623) anj, 3lthough able to give a s~per­
ficial account of tr.ese functions, was feur.d to be una.,..are of 
certain basic info.rr.1ation "·hich DERYAi:HN felt a person in this 
posi tior. should have. Thus, for exa~ple, NOSt::,!<O prov iced a 
description of the :.,•stem of lt::vying dues on Kcrr:$cr.,ol m-:?mbers 
which was substan+.:ially inccrrcct and was una;.;<1rc that a Kom­
sor.:ol Congress (the first in 1:any yea:.-s and t!':.ere[cre a rr.ajor 
event) had been held curing his clai~ed tenu:.-e ~s Secretary. 
NOSENKO said that he held the position of Y.o~osnol Organi­
zation SecretR.ry until the late spring or earlr s'JJ!'.mer of 1954, 
when he got into trouble for havir.~ used official KGB ali~s 
documentation to co~ceal the fact that he received treat~cnt 
for venereal disease contracted from a prostitute. Immediately 
after this incident, said GOS~~KO, he was removed from his 
p~sition and a •strict reprireand• was placed in his Kom-
&O~~l file. Several months thereafter, on the eve of his 27th 
birthday, NOSENKO was forced out pf the Komsornol because he was 
too old. For over a year, until January 1956 .·hen ?:OSE~;Ko was 
admitted as a candicate member o~ the Corr.munist Party cf the 
S_oviet Union, he ...-as the or.ly officer in ti,e KGB _who was neither 
. a J:omson.ol nor a ?arty mer.iber. 1;os::::--;!<0 1 s accour.t of his expul­
sion fro~ the Kornsc=ol on reaching his 27th birthday is con­
tradicted by the official Statutes of the Komso~ol in effect 
at that time. These regulations stipulate a ~axi~u.~ age of 
25 years and NCSENKO should therefore have been forced out at 
the end of October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. This 
~~s explained to ::osENKO, 1,;ho insisted that he remained a member 
until he becam~ 27 years old and that no Sp,?cial exceptions 
were made in his case. 
c. Remarks 
The fact that NOSENKO is incorrect 'regarding the age limi­
tation r.iakes it doubtful that his account of t.~e venereal 
disease incident and his removal from the Komso:nol Secretary­
ship is true. The date which he gives to this incident is 
after that on ~hich he should have been expelled from the Kom­
aomol. (Additionally, NOSE~KO' s descriptions of the veneral 
disease incident, his use of false docw~ents, and his subsequent 
punish:nent by the KGB ~nd t.he Komsomol have been inconsistent; 
see Pages 80-81).
