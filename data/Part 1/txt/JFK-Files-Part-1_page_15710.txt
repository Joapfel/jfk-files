He vill initially transfer $100().00 ·to a bank 1n Leopoldville. We 
are certain that he: v-111 not abscond v!th the f:.:nds, sinc-e his docu­

gain, 
Being a contract agent, there is ample control if he sbo....-s signs of 
spending too much time.in the :pursuit of profits fro!ll his cover business. 
His salary and allownces v-111 be paid in part to a personal account 
in Switzerland {separate froc hie-business account). Thie money will 
ostensibly also repres_ent his savings. The remainder will be paid 
directly at--the station. •

WIROGUE had been recruited in France and. eY.filtrated black from West 
Ge~ to SR/.OOB. He has had no kllown r~s. ~onnections in the past. He 
vill be surfaced 1n West Germcy·and will proceed to Leopoldville. He 
will be documented as an Aus~r~_.
