This issue has been alJllost entirely devoted to a reprint of I. Ani:ins Coll.azo's sta­
tement concerning his experience as a OJFLET r8iJresentative in Lendon. We have re-. 
printed most of the contents of the stat8':lr.nt in the for= of a sign'ld article mt1-
Ued •INSIDE arFI...°l"'. 
As is known, Collazo tells of the •dog fights" that have risen between the privateers 
(such as FRAllCiISTAS) am COFI.ET over violations of contracts, bad condition of the 
ships. etc. 
He also discusses the decline in !Ne-vorld shipping to Caba am its causes, a.s vall 
as the nature and backgroum of the shippers that participate in the Cllban trade. 
Besides the above. the following is inciuded in this iSS11e: 
EDITORtALr •A CXl-!MUNIST TROTH•s Volsky. the Chief of the Soviet obsernng delegation 
to the CEPAL meeting in CaraL-as, said that •Cuba is th~ mimr daqhter ,,t the USSR.
