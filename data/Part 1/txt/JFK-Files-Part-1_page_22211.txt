it briefly to GORBATENKO, ar.d that he had unofficially run a ti~ 
check on hi& prospective bride (which was 'clean'), and that after 
the marriage he had filled out another ar.~eta ir. which he included 
all the required data on his wife and t.er relatives. After con­
siderable pror.\pting, Subject sa\d that te tad indicated t~at she 
and her parer.ts had ~en in ~Yance, k)ojt that he had concealed the 
fact that her grar.d.~other had b£en ir. German-occupiej territory 
during the .ar. (!-le admitted that the KGB would have learned this 
in a routine check, however.) I then reviewed !or Subject the 
negative security factors mentioned above, acdir.g the arrest of. 
KODULOV, the fact that his ne·., wife and her parents had been 
abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-occupied 
territory, the fact tr.at Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol 
but not yet a Party merr.ber or candidate, and the fact that Subject 
received a 15-day sentEncc for misuse __ of covC'!r documents and ir.­
currin1 venereal disease, anrl asked if he didn't think that.his 
perso~nel file had been revie~ed in 1954, and if so, what grounds 
there could have been for retaining him in tt,c i<G8.. Subject said 
that he thought that his file probably ...,a!l rcvif:,.,ed but that 
again the influence of his father had saved him. Subject added 
that another important factor was prooably his language qualifi­
cation and particularly his higher edu=atior.. I pointed out to 
Subject that if his second wife and her parer.ts had been abroad 
it was inpossible that her narr:e check could have been negative. 
He admitted it vas illogical, but insisted that this was so. 
"NOSENKO • s Knowledge of KGB, 195'.l-54 
"Entry Date into KGB: NOSENKO was reminded that he had pre­
viously given varying dates for his entry on duty in the KGB. He 
replied that he did not remember the exact date, but he was sure 
that it was in the middle of March 1953 - perhaps 13 or 15 March 
(15 March 1953 was a Su~day). He would give no explanation for 
why he previo'.lsly claimed to have entered the KGB in ··: · . • ... 
• 1952.• In fact it would be very unusual for a KGB officer to 
forget his exact entry-on-duty date to the very day because it 
is used to compute length of service and must be entered on vari­
ous forms from time to time. 
''Num"!rical ~siqnation of the !ntellicrence and Counterintelli­
gence Directo~ates in 195j: Asked to describe what directorates 
existed in the MVD while BERlYA was Minister (~~arch-June 1953), 
NOSENKO named the First Chief Directorate (FCD) and the Second 
Chief Directorate (SCD) which he said were the intelligence ar.d 
counterintelligence directora~es respectively. Asked if he were 
sure, NOS~KO said he was positive, and that the only change- that 
took place was that later, under KJ..1.iGLOV, for. a few months only. 
the FCD became the SCI>, ar.d vice versa. NOSENKO stuck to this 
even when told he. was wrong: he did r,ot say he did 'not know or 
did not remernl::er, perhaps realizing that he could not claim not 
to remember •hat directorate he served in. (Actually, the change 
.in nwnerica_l designations was instituted by BERIYA right after 
STALIN' s death in March 1953 and persisted ·until the KGB vas -
organized in March 1954. Thus, NOSEN1-:o does not know what the 
correct designation of h_is own directorate was at the time that 
he allegedly er.tered on d•jty with~ Soviet. State Security and for 
the entire first year of his alleged service there. 
• NOS~KO on other occasions has given various reasons why he 
told CIA that he joined the K~B in 1952. See Part V.B.
