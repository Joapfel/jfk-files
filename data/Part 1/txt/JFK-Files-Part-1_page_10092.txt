ii:. a iema1e, was a sec.retary in the Mexico City JBRUMAN Embassy 
for more than 30 years. She was originally restruited by former 
Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 19~-67. Although Subject 
was never a very productive asset, she did provide informa.tion on 
activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In 
approximately 1969-n, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy, 
ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss 1 
of accf'._-;s to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with 
the personnel, including the ambassador. For t!"ils reason the St:ition 
maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too 
. was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly 
upon retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This 
was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loya~ty when 
she was working in the embassy. j 
2. Subject met FAHLANGE'R, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx­
imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in 
view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the 
embassy, our relations with~her would be termina•ed. However, if 
she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work 
part or full time, we V.'Ould, of course, consider contact again. This, 
of course, never happened. ! ·

spot payments for the information she submitted. She also i:eceiveJ 
occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The
