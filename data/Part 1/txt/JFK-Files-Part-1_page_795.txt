1. INTRODUCTION. In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review 
of the nature:of its relationship with AMCARBON-2. This review 
indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that 
action which ,as taken in September 1962 to insure that a security 
breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was 
being carriediout by the'Identity 1 relative to th~ fact that the 
establishmentlof the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT 
South Campus "s a result of security restrictions which were in some 
way related t? JMDUSK. While the relationship with AMCARBON-2 
stemmed from fhe remedial action which had been taken in a crisis 
situation, thy establishment of a working relationship with the 
Identity'3 wa$ an,objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain. 
As a matter of fa~t, in Reference A, the recommendation ,._was made 
that JMWAVE b~ given approval to contact the major South Florida 
news media in1an attempt to work out a relationship with these news 
media which w~uld insure that they did not turn the publicity 
spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might 
come to their I attention •. Thus, when a relationship was established 
with AMCAHBON12, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE 
might be able1to use this contact at the I..dentity 3 as a means of 
achieving the! objecfive of having a relationship with the Identity 3, •· 
which would simul tane·ously insure the security of JMWAVE' s operations ,· 
and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for 
surfacing certain select propaganda items. In the period October to
