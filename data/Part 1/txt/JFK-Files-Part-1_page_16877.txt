of l'rosont .V.arltal Conflict 
1: While thl~ is no~ Intended to b~ a full expoRttioo of my_ 
persona 1 and pl'i val€: 111 e over •:econt years, I would 111m to rnakQ 
kn•JWn so,ne of tho factvn, that have; from mJ pol·1t of view, led 
up to the present sitt;atl.on. 
~. I roaliz~ that the interests o! the 0rgan1zation and the 
interest ot the 4..ndi.'lid•Jals w~.o may h:ive opport-..inity to c·c,me iu 
contact with my caAe dj~tate as little parsonal involv~~ent as 
possible ~n thP ltvea at agqnts. Indeed, tho requirements of 
security, compart~~ntatlun and efficie~cy prescribe the nodua 
operandi and, to a gr~at extent tho ~odus vi.,cndi, of agency 
pcrsonael net only 1n th~ sense of earning a living hut also in 
rnanner of living. Ideally, the less said ahout an agent.''$ pri.,nto 
life, the better, but, as the years gc by, changes may ~ccur which

.Job, and somcthtng co-A~;, up like the a~rui)t separatir,n o! my 
wife (LI~MPTY-19) and ::r.c with th~ perFo,u\l and potentJal ser,urity 
risk~ it ha~ entailed, J feel that s~me explanation ie necessary. 
Shoald it bo in order, I wo~ld like this explanat1gn tc reach not 
~nly my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the 
former Chief an~ officars with whom I have had the privilege to 
work over the years. 
3. I would like to giva thanks, in advance, for the patience 
and understan~ing that have been shown me th~s far. Whatever the 
~inal outcome, I know that people have been hendtng over backward 
to be helpful and patient in h0pes ~fan early solution to the 
conflict~
