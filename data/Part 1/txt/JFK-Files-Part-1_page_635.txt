Summary 
• 
" • • .. • AHFAUNA-1 is· a Cuban national who was recruited and trained in 
the United States and returned legally to Cuba(in March· 1961 to serve as 
resident agent . i1;1o,,Hav(lna.) Since then he has bui 1 t a, net (§f over twenty 
sub-agents'\and:-nas:~sent back l"O S/W messages,. from which upwards of 
fifty irite"lligence disseminations have been made. He is highly 
motivated for his W-Ork and under effectiv~ control by JHWAVE. The 
quality of his production is, for-the most part, very good and improvin,g 
although ~he is at times distracted by_ an understandable interest in :_., . J 
para-military operations. Operationally he is ~ery skillful; however, 
he has been known to take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to 
thihlc that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is lik6ly' 
in the future to be turned against us. There ~!.however, . the real 
risk that he may one day fail into a G-2 trap b~ted with the Escambray 
guerrillas.· If so, this will be due to·the fact ·that contact with the 
guerrill4& was his fi~st assignment and, although he has been re­
directed~to intelliQ~oce collection, he sometimes seems to .feel that 
~e has;.," led j n his· prj,,mary mission. This, plus the fact that he ,., 
evident believes that the end is now very close, • is apt to make him .. 
~lner • e' to ,an appeal from the "heroes of the Escfll~ '!3t\: _ X .
