TARASi@. The criticism ma.de in regard to the above elcv;,,n cases 
was that NOSENKO could n·ot describe the individual operations ·other 
than to say that h,e had recorded foe name of the target and sucn details 
as he could acquire when he reviewed,the ;.ctivities of the Seventh Depart­
ment in 1962 following his return from.the First Department. 
The n~ brought out by ~OSEX:i.{O ai.·e considered in a.nothcr 
section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review 
.. 
o! all of the notes oi NOSZNKO currently ava.ilaole indicates that his 
statements as to how and why he obtained the information in foe notes 
a.re completely plausible. A detailed explanation of the· notes furnished 
by NOSENKO would almost. necessitate a separate listing of the approxi-
mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes.
