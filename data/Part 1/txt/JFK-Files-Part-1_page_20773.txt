Mr~- Phillips 1s· an able officer and a highly cooperative member 
·_of the Country Team. I have been impressed and pleased with the 
:.degree of cooperation which exists between him and other members of 
the Embassy staff. He has, to the extent that is possibl~ considering 
the nature of his work, cooperated in our effot·ts to bring about 
maximum coordination of reporting. With rare·exccptions he has, 1-
believe, kept me appropriately advised on all matters relating to his 
functions, and the material which he provides on a rcgu~ar basis has 
been extremely useful in the discharge of my mission. 
Mr. Phillips works quietly an<l discreetly and is alert to any II(. 
sitcation which might create problems for the Embassy and the United 
States. I fully share the view of the DCM, expressed in a previous 
evaluation, th.at both Mr. Phillips and his wife conduct themselves in 
a quiet, friendly and wholly creditable manner. 
I feel that both the Agency and the Embassy are fortunate in 
having a man of Mr. Phillips' abilities and qualities as CAS Chief 
at this important post.
