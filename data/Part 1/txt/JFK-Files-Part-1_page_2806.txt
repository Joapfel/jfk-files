!AMERICAN EMBASSY: SECTION - January 1960-January 1962) 
NOSENKO received no written reports on the results of the 
stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss this matte~ 
• with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during the first month 
of surveillance, and periodically after that. These discus­
sions took place either by telephone, when KOZLOV was 
visiting NOSENKQ's office, or when NOSENKO visited KOZLOV's 
office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV or perhaps someone 
else, NOSENKO learned that the post had been discontinued 
after 90 days. On the basis of these conversations with 
KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of interest occurred 
during the period of the stationary surveillance . 
NOSENKO was in the Embassy Section during all the period 
that the stationary surveillance post was watching the 
Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard from KOZLOV 
that the post had been replaced by periodic inspections. 
NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance on 
the Pushkin Street deaddrop site to his CIA contacts in 
Geneva in J~ne.1962 because by that time the post had 
already been discontinued without anything unusual or 
suspicious having been noted, and he thought that this 
incident wou.l;d be of no particular interest to CIA. 
When last asRed whether he had visited the Pushkin Street 
address several days after ABIDilt.N had been seen .there, as 
·he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied: 
"I don'~t remember. I do not want to say that I 
visited the deaddrop. I don't remember now whether 
I·visited it or not. It seems to me that I visited 
it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited 
it with KOZLOV, but I cannot say 'res', and I cannot 
say 'no'."
