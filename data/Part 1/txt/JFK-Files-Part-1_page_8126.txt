1. F.dward G.Tichbom(P) arrived in Washington f'rolll his.trip to Cuba-during 
the nitcht (Jf Jl January 190:J/. "e vas debriefed at the 'Rotel Statler _from about 
1000 to 1.5~ hours on 1 February. Those present at the debriefing vere Messrs. 
03CPhi1 Toomc~ and Charles Penney frcm \,i"'R Division, t?)~exander Pu.nter)PP/EAil, and 
the Undersigned. This debriefing vas very interesting and resulted inJI a good 
deal or pertinent inforciation. The th~ee and a hall" reels of tare deriTed ~

points are noted below~

2. Some of the operational information and sug;:estions offared by Tichborn 
are the followings 
a. There appears to be little chance of a coaliUcn or the op~sition 
groups at this time or in the near future aince the:, are not well oriianized 
and each ,n-oup·JCDCS would 'WllJlt to be the le.ader of such an effc:>rt. Alt;o0 
according to the IID!r4bers of the or~sition to whom Tichoorn talked, it is 
the general consensus cf O?inion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosiDg 
his grip or the devotion of his folloversx for some time to co_me~ 
b. Fidel Castro seems to 'becol:le most JCl upset and almost paniced by 
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex• he cannot bear the thought 
ot someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on 
unnoticed, be feels -:on:pUled to give reasons and rake excuses. Thia then 
'blows hhe matter ap perhaps out of proportion and quickly becomes a matter 
of public knowledge. Tichoorn feels that the inducement or deiections c«tld 
perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational. action we 
might undertake. 
c. There appears to be a relatinly long-standing schism betwen the 
brothers Fidel and fuioul ~tro. Raoul is the mo11e cold individual. As an 
example, Fidel once ordered some'400 prisoners to be returned safely to their 
ho111es, but Raoul had a number of,them !tilled. The general feeling in Oub& is 
~at Fidel is not a ColllllWlist, but that Raoul is undoubtedl.7 at least a 
fellow-traveller. De-,eloping or exploiting fr.is schis~ could therefore, be 
operationally advantageous., (The _fact that they are brothers vould prob&b!.7 
hv:ve little effect on Fidel vho ~as tlr~ady reduced kix:acrt the land holdi.Dgs 
ot hie mother and another brother in conformity 'With the agrarian refor::i 
progr&JD and \/ho Jailed his sister, and· fired a Min.hter, over 2 shak&-down 
on an insurance deal.) •
