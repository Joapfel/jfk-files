JOHNSON at this time: "In Jan1.1ary of this year! recruited Lan 
American/. I cannot remember his name. H-~ is frcm California, 
a Baptist, a young guy, healthy, so~ewhat fat, and he turned out 
to be a homosexual.* He loved men. I have a:, ager.t network 
capable of anything and, in particular, althou~h I head a section 
there, I have a good agent apparacus, i.e., ! have.beautiful 
girls ... and- I h~ve young pedefasts, homos~~-.ials._ In partic­
ular, I have one special pair f.VOU<OV and YZF.:~EMOY/ - I'm afraid 
that they are known to you and the English... Here is what· 
happened. He gave me a signature. I told hL~: 'Write it your­
self.' So he typed it on a typewriter. I sa11r 'No, I don't 
want it typed. write it out longhand.' ... He had a very re­
actionary attitude toward the Soviet Union. His attitude was 
~uch that he insulted us terribly. He visited Baptist groups, 
·churches and ... insulted us, Russia, and t~e soverr.ment horribly. 
He sent letters, and we read them all - awful letters, i.e., the 
government is lousy and everything here is poor~ I §aid to him: 
'Write, damn it, that the best country Lin t~e worl~ is the 
Soviet Union, that the best government is the ~oviet Qovernment. 
vfrite, write.' In general he did everythir.; LI askeg/ but then, 
right away, he ran to the ~ssy_and told everything. This 
was in January of this year L196Y. He told everything. l 
knOW' that he told. But he ~ave me his signature that he ~ould 
help the Soviet security organs, etc. I k:10-,1 this. __ I was 
there. I decided to go to the hotel where he was staying. I 
sat down and wait~. Surv~illance was on the job. 'Tell m~-

his room,' Lthey saig/. 'We'll wait,' LI replied_/. They re- . 
ported that he had gone to eat in the restau+an·t and I went 
there at once. He was sitting alone. I approached him: 
'Hello, how are you?' I didn't say anything tg him.- _I knew 
that he had told everything in the Embassy. LI said_;/ 'How.
