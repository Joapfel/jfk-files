Airport) firmt made their appearance durir1;; this period, and AHPAN-12 . j 
(who _haa and continues to use his own S/W .Jommunicationa to JHWAVE) 
found his way into the AMFAUNA operation. All three are kno-..m to 
AHFAUNA-5, and it is believed "that sh·, is orobably t.ne cutout to them. 
~5. Identity-55 and Identity-56 were mentioned briefly as active 
during the period from December 1961 to Ap:il 1962, The for'!ller had 
boon a contact of Ar{sUNG-~91 and seeme to have gone into hidii,g i • in any 
case, nothing more has been reported on him. The latter wae an agent 
of AMFAUNA-1 in ~antiago de Cub~/()in January 1962 he was in hiding and 
awaiting a chance to go into asylum. 
46. AMFAUNA-11 r~ma.ined active durin;,, this period, anc AMFr'\UNA-9,

48. JMWAVE r~cords do not show the tccal number of AMFAUNA 
reports disseminated since Janu~ry 1~61. Tl1e figure is at least fifty, 
and is believed to be nearer one hun \red, if the present frequency. of 
dissemination can be a cri teri ,Jn. I 11 content they have leaned 
heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movements, 
location of ar-till!!ry. and avjation matters. There has been a more 
recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is 
being encouraged by JHWAVE, Evaluations of his production are lacking. 
Security Analysis: 
49. The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is consider­
ed remote. His successful LCFLUTTER, the fact (or wh.a;t is b~elieved to 
be the fact) that his close friend and fellow agent AfiSUSP-1 was 
executed, and AMFAUNA-11 s owi1 character and background, allO argue 
against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G-2. 
However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER cari1be beaten.) Also 
that there is no proof, other than the fact that AM,£.USP-11 ~ wife is 
in the JMWAVE area and behaving like a widow, that A,tUSP-lJwas really 
executed. There is documentary evj.dence ,0 Jin the .foriro(of. a letter 
written by a fellml prisoner to AMt,U_$P-l's)widow, that he was he1d 
in prison in March and April 1961. However, the person who identif).:ed
