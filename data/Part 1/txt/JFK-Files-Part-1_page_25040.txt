for a total of four tiweo, pre-urr~n3cd by telephone call 
sever~.1 clays in ach·.:.nce to his office iu a publishing firrn. 
l!eetine location was a restaur:\nt/cafc and 1:1ectir.3s 1foru~.lly 
·lasted about thirty minutes. Ile provided infor:?~t:i:on on the 
activities of these t\'lo J~1lliARS!Icrs anc~ their families, license 
plate numbers, and descriptions of visitors. 
h, LISACK-4: Ile is the portero of the apartment building 
i~ ,vhich Subject of 201-305870 1·csidcs. Ile maiutainfl a daily 
log of the movements nnd nctivi tics of this and other !,;~Ulf.RSHcrs, 
and he reports tbe li_cense plnteo nnd d~ncription of vioitors 
to the builclinc. He was r.iet weekly for n totnl of 12 tirr.cs, 
always in a Emall rcstau1·ant t1i thin \talking di,stance of tho 
downtown office where he works a half day. JJcetine hours aro 
pre-arranged. to pernit l,ISACK--1 to attend on the uay to or 
from this second job. Ho coopensatcs ior his lack of ior1:1al 
education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural 
intelligence and cooperation. 
1. LIS.i\CK-6: He is the portero of tho building in which 
Subjects of 201-83'/203 nnd 201-788861 (who took tho apartraent 
of Subject of 201-205304) .resido. He caintains a daily log 
of these two J.lllHAnm1srs, their families and \'isitors. nc was 
met 12 times ·durine- the period. Since he,,-cannot. be abzent froc 
the building for over thirty minutes ,1ithout arousing suspicion, 
- meetines are always for a brief ten minutes and are held in a 
uenrby- pa1·k. As has been reported, the case officer who h:.ndles 
. LISACK-6 became- the tnrget of· unlmown surveillance in August, 
and again in October, follon-ing Meetin3s wit.h LISACK-6. The 
• Station· believes that the sui·veillance was accidental, in that 
\ 
the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by l!lale and 
female prostitutes and other undesirable char;;.cters. In any 
event, LISACK-6 has been put on ice, to be revived if tho _ 
occupants of bis building become higher priority targets. •

j. LISACK-7: She was .not met dui·ing the reporting period. 
She remains a "reserve asse·t" for special requirements in the 
real·estate field.for such potential uses as safehouse rental, 
key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although 
there· is· ~o immediate requirer.tent for her· talents, we would. 
like to maintain her Operational Approval so t~t she can be 
. called ou as a cleared asset when needed. ,,,, --, .
