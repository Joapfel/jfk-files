Possibly identifiable with 
Salvador Garcia ROMANI-ORUE 
SF#223 776; on whom an OA ~ 
Q
as granted in September 1960 ~i 
for use by WH/4/Cuba as a P 
Agent in Caracas; files can-
eled in January 1967. On 
PRQ listed one Manuel ARTIME, 
not further identified, as a 
relative/friend/correspondent 
in U. S. 
S. The possible identification (by either DE ARMAS or the 
DGI) of those WH Division assets reflected above suggests that 
their names were either known or suspected as CIA assets and were 
thrown in with those individuals not identified above in an 
effort to legitimatize DE ARMAS' claims to have worked for the 
CIA. It should be noted that of those individuals listed above 
on whom a security file exists, none appear to have any current 
association with this Agency and, as far as can be determined, 
no actual Agency operations were either exposed or threatened. 
6. The above is provided for your information; no further 
action in this case appears necessary.
