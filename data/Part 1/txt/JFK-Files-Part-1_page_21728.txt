Dr.partment. According to :--;osE~l{O, the prepared 
report was never typed as _a formal document. 
The view has bee.1 set forth thca.t ~OSE:--;KO took· undue risk in 
carrying written notes with him out oi the Soviet Union. An examination 
of this material suggests ~hat NOSE::-.:KO was using extreme care in 
collecting material and was n~t attempting to obtain documents, the 
possession of which might be incriminating or which if be had brought 
out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con­
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with 
little or no fear that a ."iearch of his effects in the KGB after his depart-
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material wca.s missing. None 
of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-
troyed by NOSENKO. 
The previous summary stated that ;:,..:osE:NKO brought three. KGB 
documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registere~ 
or actualiy accountable. The reference to three documents was to:

• (a) The draft report for the briefing of the Collegium 
which has been mentioned previously. 
(b) A.typed two-page report on several cases. ActuaUy 
a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of 
submitting in handwriting as the others did.
