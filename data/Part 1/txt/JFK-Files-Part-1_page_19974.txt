Xr. Vitale continues to be a ;;,1os-t. loyal, cooperative and ,,·ill in,; 
wor'i:er, getting along well wlth .ill bands. His r,1aturicy and ..:any 
years of e.<perienc.:! in liis ficlc.l, in aJdition. to his t~re-'it [;~neral 
knowledge, make him a r:iost valued c,11ployec when cor:1pareri to 
colleagues of similar rank. It is because of chis that I have 
again rated Mr. Vitale v~ry high. AlthouEh Mr. Vitale has no 
supervisory responsibilities ·and fully rcaiizing his llmi.ted 
potential as a senior operations officer, I feel he is still 
undergr[lded and i;hc;uld be promoted to the next higher grade 
at the earliest opportunj_ty. Because Hz;. Vitalcs job and 
performcnce nave remained ali:1ost exactly the same as <luring the 
previous year, thi~ fitness report is al50 very similar.

COMMENTS OP' REVIEWl..,G OFFICIAL 
The reviewing official does not use the same rating scale as the 
supervisor; therefore, would ·rate subject one lettet; lower in the 
firS"t three duties and _E in the overall performance. Subject is 
conscientious, pleasant and has an excellent llstay-on-the-job" 
approach.
