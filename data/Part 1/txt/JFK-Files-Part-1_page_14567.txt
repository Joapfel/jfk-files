\. 
a) His recall to· Cuba. 
b) the 10-million- ton sugar harvest-. which 
is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970. • 
RUIZ has indicated that he is. unhappy in • 
his post--perhaps not really meaning what he 
says--, which he has occupied.for 9ver two 
years .. 
As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans 
a maj'or purge after the 1970 sugar harvest. 
he himself may be one of tho targets. Assuming 
that bis ideologfcal·inconsistencies have been 
noticed. the DGI, in the absence of pr~of 
regarding his loyalty.and considering whatever 
support he has in Havana," may request his 
recall at an appropriate opportunity: during 
a maJor reorganization o~ the Cuban Government. 
In any event, RUIZ doe3 not expect to 
remain in Madrid much longer, ~nd is planning 
to be back in lwvana by the 18th of July. 
If Cuba is successful in hatvesting 10 
million tons of sugar, and they have already 
reached six, the "victory" that Cuban propagandists 
will herald,' from July .on may have a psychological 
impae-t on RliIZ' a thought·, He will be less 
inclined to defect, in place or otherwise, at 
such time.
