MEMO;RANDUM FOR: Director of Security 
SUBJECT TYLER, Lyon L. 
1. On 5 January you queried the Undersigned as to his knowledge 
of Mr. Tyler. For your information I have known Mr. Tyler, who is 
known as "S.lug", for about fifteen years. He is an attorney and a former 
FBI agent, and my association with him stems from the So_ciety of 
Former Agents of the FBI. Most of the information set forth below 
was derived from personal contact with Slug over these years. .• 
,, 
2. Mr. Tyler entered the Bureau in 1939 and r~mairted in the 
Bureau until 1948. He served as a Special Agent al)d worked in Bureau 
Headquarters at the time of his depa~ture. Upon resigning from the 
Bureau he went to work oI) Capitol Hill and according to Slug he worked 
for Lyndon B. Johnson, then Senator Johnson. As T recall, he indicated 
that he was in charge of Senator Johnson's files and records. He also 
knows a great number of Congressmen a.nd Senators on the Hill and his 
present office contains autogr,aphed pictures of President Johnson, Vice 
President flumphrey and many prominent Senators and Represei,.tatives. 
3. Some time later Slug left his employment on the Hill and started 
into the private practice of law. He at first shared an office with the fil'.m 
of Welch, Mott and M9rgan. His contact with this firm came about through 
his association with Edward P. Morgan who is also a forrner Bureau 
agent who served during the years 1940-1947. Apparently, Mr. Tyler 
felt that he could not work with Morgan and subsequently he started his 
OWTl law practice in the Investment Building. The name of the firm is 
Tyler and Stetter. l'his is a loose arrangement since Stetter, also a 
former Bureau agent, is fnixed up in real estate and investigative activities 
as well as law p_ractice.
