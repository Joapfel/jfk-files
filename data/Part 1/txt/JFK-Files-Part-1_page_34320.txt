1.- Cuba cc-ntinuos de:;per.:tt<' attq:;:pts sell sugy:.- 'lhc Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA­
ZUCAR, on Septc.-nbor 6 C!)ncluded a sale of 5,000 tons of raw sucar for October 196, 
dclivcicy to the Iranian s~ar orE:anizati:on. The origin of this sugar wa.s hidden 1n 
that it was declared to hav~ origin~tcd in the Caribbean, including Peru, excluding 
Brazil. Market ~eports were-correct in stating that the country of ori~in was in -
fact Cuba. The price agreed to was 18 pounds :iterling per ton (C·and FJ less , -­
shillings -per ton to cover the c.--q,ensos of the tender. This doal was engineered b7 
Wostzucker of Dortmund, an orfan.i:ation al~o selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and whkh 
wishes to keep its name out of thase sales. ' 
Another interesting dovelopn~nt in Cuba's sugar selling activities during tho month 
of Sept~mber was quoting sugar for futuro delivery at or under the London spot - -
price on the day the offer was ciade. In oth·er words, Cuba is offering sug8! ~er.

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's desper­
ate need for foreign exchange. These salos at these prices can only result in a -
ne~ loss to Cuba due to Cuba's inefficient sugar production. This loss will be com 
PoWlded should the present upward trend of world sugar futures continue (tho New -
York price for world sugar on Caribbean port basis has gone from ~l.60 on Septem!>er 
l to ~2~1Q on September 27). • 
2.- Free l',brld Shipning drops 51'.t.- Twenty \'lestern vessels called on Red Cuban port., 
during tho past month of August. The trend continues downward; the August 196) t-2 
tal was 24, and the one for August 1964 was il, which means a decrease of Sl%, when 
August 1965 (20 vessels) is compared to August 1964. 
Great Britain led the "maritime fifth c;:olumnists" with 11 vessels, followed b7 Leb­
anon, Greece, France, and Italy 'l'fi.th 2 vessels each, and Cyprus with one. 
Already 852 vessels are being kept out of the Red Cuba trade by its owners or. oper,1
