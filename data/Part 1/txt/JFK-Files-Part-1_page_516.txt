6 MAR 1973. 
SUBJECT: Travel from Algiers 
1. A sensitive and reliable source reported 
on 26 February 1973 that the travel documents 
(Titres de Voyage) requested from the Algerian 
Gove1·nment by William HOLDER (Subject of your New 
• York Field Office File 164-694) ·are intended for 
HOLDER himself, Melvin MCNAIR (Bureau File Number 
157-26S60), Jean MCNAIR (Bureau File Number 157-
26561), Larry BURGESS, also known as George Edward 
WRIGHT (Bureau File Number 157-26562), Joyce 
BURGESS (Bureau File Number 157-26563), George 
BROWN (Bureau File Number 157-26564), Jean 
Catherine KERKOW (Subject of your New Y~rk Field 
Office File 164-694), and Eldridge CLEAV~R. 
2. Source speculates that CLEAVER's name was 
included with the others desiring travel documents 
in order to convince certain Algerian authorities 
that CLEAVER, who departed in early February 1973, 
was still in Algiers. Although Source does not 
know when the documents will be issued, he believes 
that the Government will do so. 
3. Both Melvin MCNAIR and George BROWN were 
arrested by the Algerian police on separate chaTges 
of possession of handguns. BROWN was found to be 
carrying a loaded re~olver, and MCNAIR had given 
an Algerian youth two pistols for safekeeping. 
One of the pistols was of Chinese manufacture. 
Neither BROWN nor MCNAIR were kept under arrest for 
any length of time. 
4. Source has been unable to~. provide any . 
additional information regarding th-e destination 
of above mentioned individuals\.. We ·are checking .,
