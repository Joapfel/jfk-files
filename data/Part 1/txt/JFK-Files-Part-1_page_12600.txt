2 . . Various Station officers and assets have studied 
. the outline, and the· ccnsensus of opinion is that it is 
probably Turkish or a middle-eastern language. 
3. It is requested that Headquarters contact the 
appropriate offices in an attempt to ascertain what language 
the outlin~ is written in, together with a translation of 
~t~ contents •. Uthough Station personnel contacted felt 
it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in 
code.
