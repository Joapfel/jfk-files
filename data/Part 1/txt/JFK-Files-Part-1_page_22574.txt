Reassignment - Artlm- G. \'a.1.vada 
29 October l.9S7, Pace 2 
IJ. Regarding my cover status: I entered Cuba in 1954 under student 
cover (Pan .A:ceric&n Foundation Scholarship), and as it becane increasingly 
J110re difficult to maintain owing to student distUl'bances, I com:::,leted a 
course in the 1a1ting or free-lance fiction am a111 thrice published. This 
writing has been '.!sed as a realistic, stq,-gap cover., even after I was 
provided with a notional business cover (Publie Surveys Institute) by Head­
quarters. I understand that journalism is considered a weak and t:uie-1r."Orn 
cover; yet if it is worl:ed at, and financially managed through a PE?RD-E 
checking account., it not only satisfies local SS probes bnt it does not have 
the inherent disadvantS£es inwlved in setting up a !'ull~fledged rosiness 
cover. I set this out as a possible suegestion to Headc;uarters, but have 
r.o insistence as to journalistic over business cover. Tne notional 
business cover provided me has proved satisfactory in a limited sense thus 
far, rnd even utilized as cover for action occasionally, b.lt I li0uld be 
uncertain about introducing it in a less "Americanized" country than Cuba.
