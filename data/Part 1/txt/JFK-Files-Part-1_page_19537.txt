ODO 
Appreciation for Outstanding DCD 
Performance 
1. I want to express the appreciation of the 
o·ffice of Stratc_gic Research for the specic'.ll effort 
recently made for us by J. Walton Moore of your Dallas 
field o[ficu. Mr. Mooie responded quickly to-our 
urgent request to obtain information on.Soviet military 
'medical services from DS-2172 and provided it to us on 
very short notice . 
._:. 2. Let me give you some background. The subject 
of Soviet medical personnel emerged as an important 
i&s':ie iri a recent cor:irnunity-widc effort to reassess 
total Soviet military manpower. The ~ommunity reassess­
ment was stir.1ulated by DIA reporting of several months 
ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military 
manpower were low by almost one million men. If correct, 
the DIA appraisal had potentially surious implication5 
for the ongoing :-tBFR negotiations as well as a host of 
intelligence judgments ·about the dimensions of the 
Soviet military threat. 
3. Durinq the ensuing interagcncy review of thP. 
individual' estir.~tes contributed by various agencies 
in °·thc Nashinqton area, we came to tl•c conclusj on that 
the number of~Soviet medical manpower cstim<ltcu by an 
Army intell~qence group wat much too high. A rapid 
seardh of headquarters' files ~urned up barely enough 
intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion or the 
medical services, but no direct.evidence on total 
medical rMnpo\.:cr. At this point it became cl'car to us 
that an im_prcvcd cstir.iate might be made with info:-mi'ltion 
from DS-2172. As we had to present o~r case to the 
manp~wer study St~ering Group early in the week o! 
M.lrch 24, spcc-d in cont.acting the Soviet scurce wa::; 
essential. •
