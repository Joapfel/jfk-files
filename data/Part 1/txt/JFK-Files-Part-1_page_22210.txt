e. The 5hooting incident in Lenir.grad d~ring World 
War II ar,d his de~ertion froi:1 the N;wal School in Baku 
would have played a very negative role in any consideration 
of his acceptance into State S~ctirity. 
f. Subject never completed_ h~gh echool in the normal 
fashion. •• - --
g. Subject was a poor student at the Institute of Inter­
national Relations. 
h. It should be added that th~ KGB would definitely 
k~o~ that N0S~IKO was in~olved in an automobile accident 
in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court), 
fo~nd guilty, and fined. This would definitely play a 
negative role in !WSEllK0' s admission to :.:he KGB. 
i. NOS£:i~O would never =e allowed to enter the ~GB having 
just recovered from tube~culosis.• In fact, there was a rule 
at that tirr.e that no person wr.o ever had tuberculosis (even 
t·o1er:ty~ars ec!rlier) would be peI:Tlitted to work in the KGB. 
w1n addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOul.r.uOV was a 
personal friend o= Subject's father, as he has told us, would 
hav~ been noted in the file and wc;,uld have played a nec;ative role 
in permitting S~bject to continue to work in Sta~e Security after 
KOBULOV's arrest in June 1953. 
"I asked SubjE:ct how he answered some of the questions in the 
anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his 
former wife, her relatives, and on his mother"s ancestry.•• I 
then asked Subject how it was, taking into accou.~t his mot~er's 
aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail, the 
Trotskyite allegations against SQbject's father, the fact that 
Subject's former father-in-law (TELEGIN) was scill in jail, and 
the fact that Suoject was present when TELEGIS's apart.~ent was 
searched--that ~e had been accepted into the KG5, particularly 
in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN. 
Subject admitted that the question was logical, and said that he 
could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important 
and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega­
tive factors. He also cited his GRU experience in this connection. 
NI then asked Subject how he had re~rted his second marriage 
tc the KGB. He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned 
* NOSENKO firs~ mer.tioned having had tuberculosis during the June 
1962 meetings, when he descrtbed it a~ a minor case but said he 
~as ur:der out-patient treatment until 19SB. He next oer.tioned 
- his illness in- 1960, describing how he sometimes coughed up a 
Mglass· of- blood"- at - a-ume·.- Although DERYABTil • s -questioning -- -
covered this part of NOS&:n<o 's life in detail, there vas no 
111ention of tuberculosis in July and Augu_st 1_965._ _I)E:aY~IN • s 
cmer.t fs based- on the 196-& information but is included here 
for purposes of context. 
•*The anketa and DERYABltl's qµestioning on this subject are dis­
cussed further below.
