Asked.on 11 June 1962 whether he had had foreign agents 
working against the U.S. E::r.bassy, NOSENKO described his havin,J 
intro1uced the idea• of using such agents to :develop-Americans.·· 
afraid of contacts with Russfan gi!"ls. -"He said tha.t he himself 
had several of these third-national ··agents, that he sometimes 
~ould ask the German and Polish services to SU,)ply hirnwith 
agents, ancl that it was unnecessary for hi~ to explain their 
intended use in operations against "!\"lericans. NOSENKO then _- .. 
gave ar. example: ~Listen, the ser9~ants [enlisted men] who 
lived in A."nerica· House had a custom--it was to:> far to g()#·to 
America, so where did they go to rest [on leave]? To Finland 
or Poland. W;:y Poland? Because they c~m fine -..or:,en there, the 
rate of exchar,ge is gooJ, and so 01,. What do we do? We planted 
a fel:".ale Polish agent (on an 11.merican) in Pola:,d. Then she • 
comes to Moscow. We arranged a chance meeting, ~nri things de­
veloped. Once two guys, a .Manne guard and a co:je clerk went to 
Warsaw. They ...,ere on leave fo::- a wee~ and a half. We knew 
-..•hen they would be goir,g. I mace ,:m ir.-rc~diate phone call to 
Warsaw. 'Give i!'.e .:!. -.;oman,' I said. • Get a geed \-:b~re for me 
there, a pretty o~e tuL not one who strikes the.eye particu­
larly.' Well, th~y sent me SU(.;h a girl. Ar.d I placed this 
Polish agent on the same train, in c~e sa~e car, even in ~he 
same compartme:1t. 'Ihe train left. One of the h.':lericans_, the 
one in whom we were particularly interested, t~e code clerk, 
wanted the girl and there, in t~e co~partment, ~hey went to bed 
together wr. • le the other Americ<1n slept. I told the Poles in 
Warsaw to give the girl an apartment and toge~ photographs. 
They arran9od ar. ap3rtr:1ent ar.d he i:.:arne there. Everything was 
O.K. After a "'eek and a half he ret:.irr:ed to H:;,scow. We did 
not rush things. A ~onth passed. Two months. i.et's not rush, 
I said. A half a year went by. I insisted th~~ nothing further 
may be done any earlier. Then I said, 'All =i;ht, let's give 
him this girl, this Pole.' She arrived [in Moscow] and they rnet 
one another. I created the conditions: -e created the condi­
tions. They slept with one another once, twice. A [Soviet] 
girlfriend showed up. The same thing. And he also began to 
sleep with the girlfrier.d. The Pole left and he was with this 
iRussian, and she was our agent. You see, first the boys are_ 
afraid of Russians. But [we gave hira] a Pole and then trans• 
!erred him to a Russian.• 
NOSENKO stated on l February 1964: •r remember we were 
working on one of the members of the guard of the American Em­
bassy, who was going to Warsaw for a good time, for a few days' 
relaxation .. * We wrote t.o our advisors [KGB officers attached 
·to the· Polish UB) to do ~verything possible--to get a pretty 
Polish girl for the fellow and to photograph any intimate 
scenes. The Poles introduced the guard to the girl, they did 
have intimate relations, but they gave us photographs without 
any intimate scenes. Just how they are sitti~g together, how 
he is kissing her--that' s all. Well, we got these photographs 
and some time went by and ;.,t,hen we ,.asked that the· i>oles send 
us this Polish. girl so that she could meet him in Moscow. They 
• The guard referred to is Frank BEGGS, a marine enlisted man

to relate to MORO~E, who has described his enc::cunter with 
the Polish girl and her subsequent recontact in Mo!lcow ..
