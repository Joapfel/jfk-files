2-. Daniel M. O1 Connell, a member of the American youth group which 
toured Communist China after attending the Moscow Youth Festival, arrived 
in Hong Kong on 6 October 1957. O1Connell provided the Consulate General, 
Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group. 
He' had the following to say about the Tylers: 
"Steve and Patty TYLER (ref. Consulate General telegram to Department 
560, repeated Moscow 8, Prague 1, of September 27, 1957) have been travel­
ing in Europe for about a year and a hall. Steve is 23. Neither are college 
graduates. O1 Connell felt that Patty was the smarter of the two, but that 
, both were quite sound in their thinking, and he was convinced of their anti-
• Communist· sentiments. O'Connell said that both of Steve's parer,,;·s had 
been in some so::t of tro~bl~ for leftist or ·communist activity in the u.s.' 
and that Steve feared that this would unwarrantably be held against him in 
spite of his violent reaction against his upbringin·g. O'Connell said that 
he had never known a case where the views of father and son were father 
apart. 11 (Foreign Service Dispatch Hong Kong, number 289, 14 October 1957.)
