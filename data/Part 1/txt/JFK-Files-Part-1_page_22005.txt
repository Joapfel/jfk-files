b. Functions as General Deputy and Actfog Chief of S,e;c-tion 
(i} Access 
Since his defection NOSENKO has maintai:wd under re­
peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSIIUK, with 
the responsibility of taking over in KOVSlllJK's abse.n~_c, he 
had acces~ to all information on th~ section's activities 
and was obliged to keep curient. on this information. On 
this basis he has been ahle t6 a~sure hi~ questioners that 
the KGB was completely unsuccessful in its attempts to re­
cruit Americana assigned to the Erub=ssy in these two years. 
NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to 
section files and his discussions with section officers made 
it certain that there were also no successes fro~ 1953 to 
1960 and from January 1962 to January 1064. His statements 
·on thi~ subject during the Febru~ry 1965 were distilled in 
a protocol which SOSENKO signed on 20 February (quoted in 
full):

SHUK, from January 1960 to January 1962, one of my func­
tions was to serve as KOVSI:UK's general deputy and to

Section during KOVSHUK's nbsence. In order to perform 
this function I had the right and the obligation of 
knowing the·details about every important activity of
