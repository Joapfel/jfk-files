TDY~s by Y.OSOLAPOV on Code Clerk Cases.· 
Introduction 
Accor:Hr.q to NOSENKO, the U.S. Er.ibassy Section officer 
KOSOLAPOV tra•ieiled only once to He!.sir,ki, and KOSOLAPOV at·: 
that time succeeded in his niszion of accompanying--togetr.e~ 
with a KGB terr.ale agent--a suspcctec American. code clerk, Paul 
Francis JE!r~ER, by train to Moscow. (The KGB later .... 1earned 
that J'E~'NER was net a code clerk but a pouch clerk ..,.ho also met 
couriers at the ~~scow airport, ::osrmm said, and this t:GB id~.., 
tification of JE?l?lER's specialty is conHrr.ied by U.S. Department 
of State files.) .:~c report by NOSENKO on KOSO!...APOV is contra­
dicted Ly two sources, trav~l records available to CIA and the 
KGB defector GGL!TSYN, 
Statements made by JENNER in 1960 and 1962 parallel those 
of NOSEWW in 1964 and 196j to the exte:.t that two young Soviets, 
a man and a woman, did converse with him en e-,e train, and later 
JEN!lER did encounter the same woman at a Ho scow airport. Never­
theless, travel records contra~ict NOSE~KO's st~tement that 
K'JSOLJ..POV was the Soviet male aboard the tra::..:-. with .;ENNER on the 
24-hot)r journey. 
Although NOSE~KO incisted that KOSOLAPOV was on a single 
TDY to FinlanG, in early 1960, travel records show that KOSOLA­
POV (under a different identity) went to i1elsinki in both the 
sprir.g and fall of 1960. Travel records on the second Helsinki 
TOY by KOSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has not reported, are borne 
out ~y GO~!TSY?l. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay 
the groundwork !er a future rel3.tionship in Moscow, accompanied 
a U.S. Embassy code clerk by train from Helsinki about November 
1960, or perhaps as late as the beginning of 1961. Again on 
the basis of travel records, it has been deterr..ined that on 
16 No\·ember 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenge::- of an A:cerican 
code clerk na.-ned John w. GARI.A:m on the daily train from Hel­
sinki to Moscow. 
The following discussion of the TDY's of KOSOLAPOV is 
divided into three parts: KOSOLAPOV's false identity for 
travel, the early 19~0 TDY, and the Nove.:tl:.er 1960 TDY. Each 
part incorporates the information from all sources, including 
NOSENKO. 
(b) False Identity for Travel 
Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV was born in Perm' on 19 Febru­
ary.1928. According to travel records, one Viktor Dmitriyevich 
KOLOSO'I, born in Perm' on 19 March 1927, was in Finland from 
31 March to 2 1-.pril 1960, in Finland from 12 to 16 November 1960, 
. and in Dermark from 25 October to 1 November 1961. ~ In .July 1965,, 
Johan PREISFREU?iD (see Par,t V.E. 3 .c.ii. ;On STORSBERG operation) 
identified for CIA_a photograph of KOLOSOV as that of a KGB offi­
cer named Vadim (last name unknown) who approached him in Moscow
