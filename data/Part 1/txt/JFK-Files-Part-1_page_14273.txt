2 •. The:•Castro regime has always attached great 
importance to, p1:opaganda activities of all kinds and when the 
new Cu'ilan Chai·gc d 'Affa ires began to re-organize the work of 
his subordinates, propagand:;L matters were not overlooked. 
A~cording to the QUDOZE and QUTDIID opcratio11s, the 
provincial consulate~ have been receiving four types of 
propaganda for dist~ibution, two of which were identified. 
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created 
by the Castro· regime, for example "The Voice of Vietnam". 
The other is newspapers. PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla, 
mentioned Granma, which he claimed many people read, and 
added thatJ_ately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde. 
3. RUIZ's id~as apparently go beyond hand-shaking and 
the distribution of propaganda. He asked the consuls to 
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific 
centers in their territories including the special positions 
of these centers and any other relevant info~mation. They 
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan 
, of visiting each one, making f~iends, trying to obtain 
.scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publjtations and 
propaganda of every type 1 free if possible or by subscription
