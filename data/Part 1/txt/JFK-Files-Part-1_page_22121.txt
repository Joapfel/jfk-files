NOSENKO: No. Nothing. 
Question: Did you know just what was the area of responaibility 
of the American Department of the Bulgarian MVR? 
NOSENKO: No. Nothing. 
NOSEUKO fle•.,. from Moscow in early April 1961 and was met 
at the airport in Sofia by A.s. KOZLOV, a former Second Chief 
Directorate officer -..,hom he_ had kriowr. in Moscow.* The follO•"· 
ing ~orning he was picked up in an official vehicle ~nd w~s 
taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far 
away. NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was 
told that "d .. ey want to know about ho·,1 to work against the Ameri­
can Legation. He said he wanted rne to tell them everything about 
how to work, right from letter 'A.'" XOSE~KO was.then intro­
duced to the Chief KGB adviser in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and 
.to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he 
was assigned an office in the MVR building. Durihg the ensuing 
weeks he discussed both g~neral M3tters and particular cases 
with individual Bulgarian officers ... .-orking ag.:-.inst the American 
target. On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers 
on the principles of operations against fcreign military person­
nel in Mosccw, and on another he visited an ~~VB surveillance 
post opposite tne American Legation. He discussed,KGB methods 
of operations againsc foreign tourists. He also addressed the 
entire American Department for about five hours and told them 
"what is necessary, • ..,hat ta pa:r attt.:ntion to, how to work.• 
At the end of his visit, so~e time in r.id-May, NOSENKO conferred· 
with the First o~puty Minister of the MV~ about what had been 
acconplished and his recommendations for i~proving operations 
against Americans. 
As an outgrowth of his TOY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has pro­
vided one lead to a case in which he said he took personal part. 
About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the end of 
April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists of foreign=rs who were 
scheduled to. visit Bulgaria,, in the near future, and he came 
across the name Horace G. Lv"NT. NOSENKO recalled that a man 
named L'JNT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him 
in 1958 or 1959 by one. of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV or 
YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual. He asked the Bulgarians 
whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages. When 
the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de­
cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an 
immediate phone call was placed to ~.oscow,.:. asking for traces. 
• NOSENKO had earlier reported that Y.OZLOV had served as the 
Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate, 
until 1953 and tl\at, until about tw9 years before going to 
' Bulgaria as a counterintelligence advisor, he had been . i ~ .. --·~ -·;" Deputy Chief of ~e Tourist Department. For the two years
