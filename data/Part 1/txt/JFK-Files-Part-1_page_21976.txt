After returning to Cene~a in 1964 and during subsequent 
debriefings and intcrroga·tio_ns, NOSENKO made the following 
additional staterr.ehts concerning the I'RIPP!'-JL case: • ·.f • .. 
' 
- Althou~h _he had personally recr-.!i ted FRIPPEL, he 
did not do 80 _:a-lone; Col_. V. D. CHEL:;01:ov, Deputy Chief 
(and later Chief) ·of the Tourist Department, was present; 
he and NOSE~KO "carried out fhe ~~cruitcent together- in 
early September·:1959_ NOSENKO was, hc'A'ever, FRIPPEL's 
case officer .. 
- NOSE?iKO attricuted his involveme::t. in the FRIPPEJ., 
recr·uitirient to--the- following: "In 1958, after 1958, 
when I becaIT!e t.he Deputy Chief of the section, my ar~a. 
of activitr was narrowed <lown. I didn't handle all the 
tourists at that time. I worked as the Deputy Chief of 
the section and I had my own little ar~a--~or example, the 
permanent r-~prcsentative of the l\r.erican i:::press Ccmpany, 
and besi1es that I hegan to collect all the ~aterial on 
all Anicrican tourist firms which have any':.i1ing to do with 
Inturist and who sen~ tourists to the VSSR." 
I 
- FRIPPEL never provided any infor~ation of value to 
Soviet to~rist operations. 
Wne:i ~OSENKO began to work in the ll.S. Embassy 
Section of t!ie l,.merican Department in 1'160, he took FRIPPEL 
with him because FRIPPEL was acquainted with so1:1e Ameri­
cans at the Embassy. NOSENKO was asked to question FRIPPEL 
about the U.S. Err,bassy <lnd such Eml:Jassy officers as George 
WINTERS and l~wis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO 
anything along this line.• 
- FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during 
NOSENKO's two mectingA with him in 1962 and 1963, when 
FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet ~nion as a tour guide. 
- NOSE~KO met •pretty steadily" with FRIPPEL during 
the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife, 
in company with CHELNOKO\' and his wife, had dinner at 
FRIPPEV'.s home, where they met Mrs. FR!PPEL. Odette 
FRIPPEL WdS unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent, 
and therefo.::-e NOSFNKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover 
for their acquaintance with FR!PPEL. Although unusual for 
KGB Second Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents 
in their homes with wives present, NOSE?:KO explained that 
he went because he •~as invited," and CHELNOKOV went "be­
cause he was also involved in the recruitment." 
- First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist 
Department and later as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of 
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department, 
NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in ~toscow hotels 
and restaurants. Throughout this period, he was almost 
invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV: •perhaps one time 
I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

Embassy Section. •
