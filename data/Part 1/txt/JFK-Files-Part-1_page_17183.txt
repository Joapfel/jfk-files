A. _·Past ProJect • Dar ; ProJecC LIEMPTY was previously approved 
f~r the period 1 De'Cember 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the 
amount of 45,000· U.S~ currency,· Station records indicate that 
through 31 October 1967. Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in------­
the field. ·It- is estimated tba.t a total of .40 130 will be expended 
-in tho entire project year. Bi-weekly accountings witn pertinent 
recefpts·and/or certifications were submitted by Raynond H. GER~DB 
to the Station finance otficer via the project case officer for all 
LIEMPTY P~pject expenditures ma.de in the field. It is estimated 
that .approxi"at~ly 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst 
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative 
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not 
incluge the 40 hour-week put iu regularly by Raymond H. GER~'NDE). 
B. During Project Year - It is requested that Project LIErilPTY be 
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1 
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a· 
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project 
year). While no _large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an 
increase in the rental of the ,·arious b:isehouses may be encountered 
as weil as the .i bove-c ited expectation of salary increases. Of ·the 
amount requested above, 26,205 dollar~ should be allowed for fiscal 
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969. A detailed break­
down of the pr~ject expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:
