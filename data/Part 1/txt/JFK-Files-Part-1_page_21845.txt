B. First Geneva Phase (Jur.e 1962) 
The NOSEl~KO case oce::ed on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of 
the Palaia des Cations ln Ger.eva during the United Nations Dis­
armament Conferer,ce. A ther:-unidcntified Soviet:, known to him 
by sight from confe:::ence ni.::etings, approached U.S. Foreign Ser­
vice Officer David ~.ARK with the suggestion t~at they get to­
gether for a tulk the follo~ing day, In the late afternoon of 
6 June, th'9 same Soviet rr.otioned !'.ARK aside and said that he 
would like to talk to him privately as soon as possible. He 
told MA!lK that he .,..as "not going to purn!? hir., for infor::1ation, 
·but sirn;1ly wanted to te 1 l :,i::1 scr.1e thi.nr;s." A luncheon r.,eeting 
was arranged for 9 June, alc~ough the Soviet clearly preferred 
an earlier date, HAHK 3c;•:is.::d CI!\ of the appointment, explain­
ing that he thought th,:i :.ti);:iroa-.:h c;o c.:::usual th-:it it might be 
an offer of coopcra~icn or ~efd~~ion. He said he believed the 
Soviet to be Yuiiy Iv~~ovi=t ~OSENKO, a meffiber of the Soviet 
delegation to the arms calk3. 
At the 9 June lunche(;:, with MAR.I<, NOSE!~KO told M~RK that 
he, NOSE~KO, was a ~GD ccuc:crintclligence officer s~nt to 
Genev~ to ensure tha securiti of the Soviet delegation. He knew 
that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he wa-: 
connected with Ar:lerican Ir.telligence.• He ~eeded approximately 
900 Swiss francs ia'!lediatcly to c-:wer KGB operational funds which 
he squandered on liquor ~nj a prostitute i~ Geneva, and he offered 
for this amount to sell t~o pieces of information to American 
Intelligence. The first of these was the identity of a former 
U.S. Embassy employee in Moscow who was a KGB agent anrl, as of 
1962, was •near ciphers" in ~he ~ashington area: the second was 
the identity of a Soviet in l-l~sccw who, although ostensibly a 
CIA agent, was actually planted on American Intelligence. Al­
t.t~ough NOSENKO at first told HAP.~: that he would stop at the sale 
of these two items, he lillcr stated: "I know ~·cu won't let me 
alone now.• At another point NOSENKO said: "I will not work in 
Moscow, but I corr.e out abo..it once a year." NOSENKO also gave 
MARK a brief chronological account of his personal anrl ?rofes­
sional past. MARK e>:plained'"that al though· he was not an intel­
ligence officer, he could place NOSENKO in contact with the 
Intelligence Chief in Geneva late~ that same day. 
MARK introduced NOSE::KO to a CIA officer at 2000 hours that 
evening, and a three-nour l!'".?eting fo_llowed at a CIA safehouse in I 
Geneva. Describing himself as a KGH Major experienced in opera­
tions against the Ame-ri-can Embassy in Moscow and against· touri'sts 
and other travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA 
IU\other Soviet source, has also reported that the 
KGB buspected MARK to be an Arr.en.can Intelligence officer; 
although he has never served in CIA, MARK did engage in a num­
ber of operational support ·activities on behalf of CIA while 
statio~ed at the U. s. Embassy in ,-toscow. _. ~· ~ .
