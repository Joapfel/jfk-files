with ~vol' tnc1l1Ues~ leads, general servicea nnd wrkin« \'9ry·· 
oat1e.factor1ly in supporting the .FI miao1on in .DorliD, At that 
time I vas -aesured by IO th't1t they vould do e-vcrything possible 
to retain r-tr. Koch in Derlln 11a the ~ repreoentative. In •19.I 
of' t.'11 o ;year I had oocll.Dion i.,· vi :ii t .Bob lullg in Nev York on 
onothor matter Md I -a1:a.1n touched u;:on Hr. Koch 1a assignment 1n

2. We tfod this flolution r.n extremoly unsutisfactor,y ono, 
Elliott, by backgrow"i, general character. nnd ntility, 111 not 
ao ueetul to l"I in berlin 11a ... Koch was end I seriously doubt that 
RfE "WOuld find him aa cati;sfactory 11s K~,ch in standard It.FE bu::ineos. 
I ki:=w • miott ..,hen ·he wati a ne,,,si:ar-er man, Md I have checkeJ vi th 
several of his termer colleagues who agree thnt h,, clooo not have 
any of the hard-hitting qualitios sc desircblo fo',{" an P.n: re_p:-e­
aentflt.i\19 in Berlin. Thia le net Nl atternf·t to bolltUo hb -
ability BB a journaliot but the Job in Berlin le ~ry much ::-cre 
thllI! that, In short, I vould an:roclnte your ctfice·,taki.ng steps 
vith RTE to retw-:n Dean Koch to 1:1.lrlin cs RFE repreeontntive, since 
his eervicee to 1-'I are very z:ruch dr,sired even on a part,..tillle be.ala. 
Our, main reason 1'or vru1ting Koch in Berlin 16 that the Rn: ctt1oe 
e~t.racts a large p<-'rcentage ot Satellite refugees end aa euch it 
is important tor us to hi.ve ··the head:ot the FIFE office in B-,rlln
