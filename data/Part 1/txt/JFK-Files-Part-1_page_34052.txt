B. ADUINIBTRATION 
4. The AlflOlOT organization remains constituted as reported 
in the previous Quarterly Report. However, in December AMASK-1 
was offered a perma~ent position as personnel director of a local 
shoe company that employs soae four hundred people. Hie starting 
salary will be $475.00 per month which will be i~creaaed ~fter 
the first three montha and increased again after the second three 
months. Tbe Station concurred with AMASE-1 that be accept. for 
these reaaons: (1) Tbe AIUCNOT position is uo\ pert113nent, (2) 
. : 
it appears that AKASX-1 will be tArminated wben Al(1{HQT ta closed, 
(3) tbill position should aolve AllASK-l'a personal financial prob­
lems, and (4) AIIASK-1 baa agreed to remain as chairman of AMKNOT 
without salary and to continue to lend bis name to the organization. 
Tbe Station expects to replace AIIASK-1 with AIIPOLISH-1 who aypears 
qualified to handle tbe band-holding and housekeeping a&pects of 
ABNOT. AIIPOLISH•l ia presently employed by a local automobile 
dealer and 1a able to take the necessary time off to handle tbe 
ARNOT matters. We aee three advantages to this development: 
_i 
(1) The Station will be aparvd a possible disposal situation when __ ,.,_ ,.,_,. ..... ____ .. _,_ AIIKNOT is closed Cit has been made clear to AHPOLISH-1 that this

1a a temporary assignment that at the most will last for a few 
months), (2) We have offered AMPOLISH-1 $200.00 per month versus 
$390.00 for AlitASK-1, and (3) AMASK-J should be in an excellent 
position to offer at least temporary emplOflD8Dt in the shoe fac­
tory to mariners to come. 
6. AD estimated total of $2,505.00 was spent during tbia 
quarter. Thia amount represents AMASK-l's salary and allowances, 
office ezpensea, and English instruction for those seeking MSTS 
eaployment. Expenses by month were: October, $855.00; November, 
$825.00; and December (estimated), $825. 00. The allotment for 
this activity for the quarter was $3,000.00 • 
. C. PROBLEIIS 
6. Tbe chief problem of the period was caused by the antics 
of Raul QUINTANA Ruiz wbo jumped ship in New Orleans after a run-
la with tbe ship's captain and after difficulties with the Immi­
gration ancl'Raturalization Service over tbe lack of proper documen­
tation ~ore-enter tbe country. QUINTANA bas been resettled in 
California, tbougb we may not have heard the last from bim; AJIASK-1 
recently received a letter from QUINTANA which said that ~UINTANA 
was about to sue tbe shipping line that bad employed bim for back 
salary and loaa of personal effects that QUINTANA claims the captain 
bad locked up. AMASK-1 was advised to ignore the letter in view 
of the difficulties already caused and 1n view of bis potential for 
further trouble (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of JMWAVJ:-3990). ' I.
