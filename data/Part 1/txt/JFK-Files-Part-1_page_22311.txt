On 24 and 28 January 1~61, before the defection, NO­
SESKO iocorrE-ctly r.amed zwus, who he said \\'aS ST0RSDERG's 
rcplac~ment, as the target of this operation. On 2 February 
1964 ~0SOKO cAlled a ~pccial meeting with his CIA handlers 
to correct this mistake. He said that, in fact, KEYSERS 
was STOHSBEr.G's replacement, and the approach had been made 
to him. (Thus S0SEJ-;K0 had forgotten the name of the one 
American Embassy official ha ever approached.) 
lo February 1965 S0SE~K0 said that the KGB believed 
that KEY~ERS did not report the receipt of the defection 
letter ecd that there was no indication that he had from 
microphones or telephone coverage of tbe U.S. EQbassy. In 
fact, Y.EYSERS. report~d the letter at o~ce in the office of 
the Militzry Attache, wtiere a microphone ~as discovered in 
1964. S0SE~lCO had earlier said that this particular micro­
phone was bcin~ ponitorcd arourid the clock by the KGB. 
(KEYSERS' homosexuality and drinking proble~s had nlso 
been discussed \\·idely ir. Embassy offices. KPSESKO was 
unaware of tLese di£cussions.} ·'. \ . \ 
N0SE~K0 did oot know ccrrectly where or how the KGB 
dEiivered to KEYStRS the letter -.·hich preceded the airport 
approach v.·hich SOS:t:~KO claimed to ha•.e made. 
(vi) 0t~er Code Clerk C3£es 
Frar:k DAY: 1'03~KO identified DAY as a State nepart1!1eot 
code clerat ar,d the targe,t of either K0SCLAPO\' or GRYAZX0V. 
As with all other code clerks, N0SE~~0 was asked whether he 
knew of eny interesting ir.forrnation about DAY, whether be 
knew of aoy ot DAY's friends in ~oscow, or of his travels 
inside aod outside the Sovi~t Union, etc. ~CSESK0 answered 
"no" to all these questi.ons. Ile said that the KGB had no 
derogatory information on DAY, was uoa~are of any vulner­
abilities he might have had, and that no operational mea­
sures were taken against him. Records show that DAY was io 
Moscow from ..!ay 1960 to October 1961. Io July 1961 he tra­
velled to the Caucasus with his friend, the U.S. Agricul­
tural Attache BRO~S. formerly an overt CIA employee. DAY 
later reported that the two were under surveillance by five 
persons at all times on this trip, tha~ on oce occasion they 
found four "repa ir:iaeo"' in their hotel room upoo returning 
unexpectedly ahead of schedule, and that another time during 
this trip an ··attractive and available Soviet fe:nale" was 
placed 1D their train co~partment. 
John TAYLOR: SOSE~'KO said TAYLOR was a State Department 
code clerk a~aThe target of K0SOLAPOV. N0SE.~K0 did not 
know of TAYLOR's previous service abrvad or of any back­
ground information the KGB might have had about hi~. He 
described ao operation against TAYLOR which centered around· 
bis intimacy with a Russian maid (a KGB agent) and bis sym­
pathy to,ards the Soviet Union and its people. ~o compro­
mising photographs were obtained of TAYLOR.and the maid, 
however, and no approach ~as made to him, possibly because 
the KGB did not want to jeopardize the more iinporta1Jt STORS­
BERG' case by ere at ing a "flap." According to TAYLOR, he was 
intimate •ita his maid from about September 1960 until the 
beginning of 1961. On one occasion they were intimate in a 
"friend's apartment" in ~loscow. S0SE~K0 did not know that 
the maid told,TAYLOR she vas pregnant or that TAYLOR'offered
