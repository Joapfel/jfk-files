Outlook 
The modest progress made by 
the Christian Democratic mQvement 
in the past two-and a half years 
suggests that it~ development 
will be much slower and less ex­

significant worker base. Its 
strength in the universities 
and its ability to compete with 
Collimunist groups on the campus 
create unfounded optimism. The
