Embassy, some of whom are u. s. citizens. During the past 
)'car, several of these u. s. citizens were identified with 
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI). 
further~ore, the movements.and habits of the Soviets are 
studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends 
and associates, especially llexican nationals. This informa-
• ~ion is usefu;t in targe-t studies. -For examl?le, the senior 
TASS repres~nta·uve, a known KGB officer, is a recruitment 
target. He is ·un~cr intensive opo1·ational scrutiny for 
leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts.

·. 4. During the past year, one of the three basebouses 
was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was 
terminated. This was done because tho agent was becoming 
less effcctiv~ with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those 
of another. The termination ,;as amicable, and the working 
hours of the personnel of the other basehousc were extended 
slightly. Another agent was also hired to help. This new 
agent is of die same family as the rest of the personnel 
occupying the baseh~use, and no additional security risks are 
anticipated from this addition. 
5. There have bee·n: no security or administrative prob­
lems. The Station and GERE~"DS are constantly on the alert 
for any sign thnt the Soviets are aware of the surveillance 
activities. Whilo'lt is quite possible that the Soviets are 
aware of· the surveillance, so far indications nre that they 
are at 1e·ast not fully aware, since no effort is made by 
them to avoid being photographed, eve_n when having meetings 
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy. 
6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational 
support project.
