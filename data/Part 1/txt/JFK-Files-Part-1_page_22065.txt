AwaI:"e that Af1IDIAN travelled fr-om the USSR two or three times 
while stationed in Moscbw, !~OSE:<KO did not know to which countries 
hewer.tor the time of tear ~hen the trips were made?-Such in­
formation, he stated, would have been of interest to him as 
ABIDI;..:-1 • s case officer since, like: L.;.;JGELLE s earlier trips 
abroad, fa~lDIA.~·s trips were presumed to be for operatior.al pur­
poses. Th~re was, how~ver. no p0ssibility for the KGB to find 
out 1;,fr1ere A.9IDIAN had gone:* .. .,, even 1f the u,s. Er,1ba3sy Section

See below for ABIDIAN's account of a similar incident involv­
ir.g a Sovi.et he met while on a trip to Armenia.

operative microphone was discovered in 1964. 
***ABIDIAN made at least 1:.hree tri.ps abroad during his two years 
in Moscow. ln August 1960 he took personal leave to visit 
his fiancee, a French girl, in the south of France and met 
'l:lith a CIA officer while there. In FebI:"uary 1961 he flew on 
the Ambassador's plane to Paris for meetings with CIA and 
then took personal leave to visit his fiancee. In September 
1961, at CIA request, ABIDIAN again flew to France and to 
We'l:1 York City and Washington for briefings connected 'l:lith 
the handling of PEllKOVSKIY in Mosco..,. 
0 ***.:fuen CIA interrogators su~gested that the KGB could h~va 
~hotographed ABIDIAN's passport on his return to MoscOtI, 
~OSENKO replied that the Second Chief Directorate does not 
~hotograph passpcrts of foreign diplomats entering the Soviet 
U~ion. c:Jhile this procedure would not be impossible, NOSENl{O 
@ddecl, it was not considered so important as to justify the 
g~cial effort involvedc
