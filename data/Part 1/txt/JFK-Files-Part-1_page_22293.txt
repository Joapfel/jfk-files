Uzhgorod, Lvov, and Minsk did th3t, he said. NOSE~KO could 
not describe l<GB arrange.~ents and support in Lvov and Minsk, 
where he said "the onlv t'"iing I needed was a car from the air­
port to the city.Q ~said they travelled by train.) 
Likewise, NOSE~KO was unable to describe the KGB proccdu~es 
for clearance, tracing, reporting and other management of this 
operation.

in Moscow, FRIPPEL ~as not recruited so that he could report 
on American touri&ts visiting the Scviet Union, or on off:cial 
and unofficial A.~ericans living there, but in hopes of learn-
ing about approaches being mad~ to De~~ers of Scviet delegations 
visiting the United States. With a wea~th of reporting assets 
in Moscow, tlOSENKO said, the KGB did not need him tr.ere. When 
FRIPPEL was reassigned to New York City, however, there were 
no plans to contact hin through the local KGB Legal R~sicency. 
FRIPPEL is idunti!ied by. KGB cryptonym in the Clll-:REPA:WV pa~•:?rs 
as a suspected A.'nerican Intelligence agent. Thc\t FRIPPEL was 
considered such b:,• the KG.9 is confinr.ed by stater.,ents of a self­
