Dtiring the first week of J~ne 1959, a three-day Meeting was 
held in London, tngland, betwee,n repre.sentat.1ves of CIA and the 
British Secret Intelligence Ser~Jce C3IS, corrmonly referred ~o as 
MI-6) on the subJect. of 'legal-navel'· intell1qence operatior:.s 
against the USSR. At the con~lus1on of this meeting there was 
dra-..n up a 19 page document surrmar izing ·.:hat had been discussed 
at the meetings. This su:nmary spel1ecl out CIA operational doc­
trine pert~in1ng to tourist. opera=ions, including agent-spotting 
techniques, criteria for ag~nt se~ect1on, agent assessment, agent 
training, and tasks to be carried out by tourist agents during 
the coming (1959) tourist season. It stressed CIA's reliance 
on tourists for the spot.ting, recon1:a~1:1ng, assessing, and 
co:nmunicating with clandest.ine assets in the Soviet Union. A 
copy of the document as well, presumably,as other British docu­
ments relating to the joint meecings was g1ven t.o George BLAKE, 
who has admitted having made a pho~ographic copy which he passed 
to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of 
1959. 
* One Robert Alan McGUIRE, a former. st.aff empioyce· of CI.A, .. 
travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April a~d· 
May 1958. Although he was debriefed on his return, he had 
no connection with·CIA in prepa[ation for this trip and 
mailed no letters for CIA inside the USSR. While in the 
Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions 
by Soviets seeking blackmarket deals,. American girls, and 
assistance in defecting to the A~ericans. While en route .to 
Leningrad, his brief case was oveLcly searched by a customs 
employee, who confiscated a Radio Liberation script. McGUIRE 
reported that he was compelled co sign a document which stated 
that the script had been confiscated, but the reasons for the 
action were left blank. NOSENKO. who has reported none of 
these details, appears to have confused McGUIRE with Edward 
McGOWAN, a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Min.sk in August 
1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO • said • 
McGUIRE-mailed a le~ter in_Minsk in 1959.
