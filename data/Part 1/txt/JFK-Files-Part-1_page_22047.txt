(c) Inforr..aticn from C·t.her Sources 
A sensitive Polish source reported i:1 1961 that on 8 !,ovem­
ber 1960 a ?olish fc:::,ale, an experienced English-speaking agent 
of the Polish L'B, arrived in Mo~co.w wile re she "'as rr.et by a KGB 
case officer named "VOI.O::.YA." She stayed at t1'e Hotel Wars;iw 
in Moscow. The Y.GB cas~ officer, apparently frorr. t.he American 
Deoartment of the KG9 S~cond Chief Cirectoratc, on 10 Nove~ber 
1960 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in 
Mosco._.. Under KGB ins i::-uctions, the Polish fcr:iale rr.et MOP-ONE 
on the trai~ to Warsaw, where intimacies began. In Warsaw on 
12 Nove!l'ber 1960 she was q•.Jite frienjly ~ith ?-::)?.0!~2, but pur­
suant to instructions, she refused all overtures to engage in 
intimacies. The next cay she took l-:GRONE to a Polish UB safe­
hcuse suitably prepared for clancestine photogr~phy, and reveal­
ing photographs of an intimate nature were taken of MORONE 
and herself. The fer.:.;1le agent again travelled to Moscow on 
5 February 1961 and stayed at the Peking Hotel. Further com­
pro:nising photographs were taken of her and MOP.ONE 0:1 this 
trip. The female agent travellej to Moscow a third time and 
on 12 and 13 February 1961 r:iore photographs were taken of her
