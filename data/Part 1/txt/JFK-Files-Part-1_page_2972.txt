Comment: fiu~h a New York City attorney, has admitted 
½hat he had been compromised while visiting 
the USSR in 1962 and that he was in contact 
with KGB officers in the United States until 
November 1963. l)~ 
~OSENKO did not .relate the~UF~ case 
specifically to his Seventh Department service 
when he cited it from writen notes brought to 
Geneva in 1964, nor did he indicate the source 
of his information. His notes state that [!uFEJ D6 
was recruited on homosexual grounds by the 
Americari-British Commonwealth Sectio~ of the 
Seventh Department, jointly with the UKGB of 
Leningrad Oblast.

NOSENKO's Information 
ISCHWARZENBACB}, who was working in Moscow at the time, 
£eh in love with a male KGB agent and was the target of an 
unsuccessful KGB recruitment attempt in 1958 or 1959. The 
KGB had incrimin~ting photography, but NOSENKO did not 
believe it was used, the KGB appeal being based solely on 
her. affection for the Soviet people. V.M. MIKHAYLOV of. 
th·e American Department Embass~ Section directed the opera­
tion. NOSENKO never read the~CHWARZENBACg] file, but he 
later saw it and the incriminating photographs.
