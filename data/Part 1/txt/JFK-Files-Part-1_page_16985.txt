1. .- --It would appear from paragraphs 2a and-~ -~f. _re_~temii~t 
KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops ha,·e not l~ completely mforn1ed--c..1f the back­
ground of the LIEMETY Project and irs agent-requirements. At the time 
HMMA-14093 (Request for Re.'lewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, lt 
was assumed that the Mexico ~sk and KUTIJBE/D could answer any additional 
questions, based on rcpo~ts and dispatchea not normally available to the 
s~nior staffs, whlch migh: be raised during the renewal process. 
2. In answer to paragraph ~. Oliver G. SCANTLING first contacted 
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early 1957 to fulfill a KUTIJBE/D requirement. 
He vis iced hc1· as an an•h~t"'Ct i.ntcresced in vlewing the LIMERlG, -lnst11Uatlon 
from the bulldlng where she lives. He was soclally acquainted with her brother, 
a Oltholic Prlesl, and knew the family to be unquestionably aml-C.ommunist. 
However; it would be Imprudent on L11~ Station's and SCANTLn-:G's part to 
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect that some antl-LL\tERICK 
intelligence service Is involved. PARADA _sugg~:ui during SCA:\'TLL"JG'e 
initial vlslt that he couid return ut s.ny time for further observations. This 
wtls reported by SCANTLING on 21 Much 1957 and it does not s~m appropriate 
to qtiery him again on the pretext for hls recent visits. 
3. While HMMA-14093 cor:re:-tly referred to LL.\rITTED, LlL YRIC and 
LICALLA as "photographlc bascltoases," the Station would like to ~mphasize 
that photographic coverage is oaly one of their functions (please sec HMMA-12095, 
4 February 1959). LIMITED is useJ as a rad lo dispatch base for u11tomoblle 
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering 
the front gate. Their p!lotography is :i.cgliglble compared to their other dutles. 
The LIL YRIC base performs the be.st pho~ography of persons visiting the front 
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the olcmres is from the 
second floor and above the street traffic which partially blocks LL\llTED 
photographs. LIL YRIC also d\X's ir.dividuul reports on LIMERICK p-!rsonnel 
entering and leavlng the main gate. - UCALLA is USL--<l almost exdusively to 
identify LllvlER!CK officials and to SU?port KUTUBE/D requirements in 
connection with the LIM.ESAjLL\·lUST Project. As an indication oi the effect­
iveness of LICALJ....A phoLOgraphic cov-=rage, the l\tcxico Station hs.s all the 
LL\tERlCK 0fficlals identified. lkfore th!..s base was activated moretnan two-
-, c--"" thirc!s of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. ln ord~r to s.ipport other 
operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all Ll\lEHlCK 
officials. In this respect, LICALLA a.as provided most of cJ1e ne,,:essary infor­
mation. The retention of this base is ~so considered vital to.the security of 
the LIMUST portlcm of the LL\IESA Project. 
4. The Station does not a~~ that the color photography and moving 
pictures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification puq,03es 
and h3ve proved useful, particularly in identifying facial fe3rures !UH.I skin 
coloring. The motion pictures were made at He.adquan:ers su~---estion (Please 
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and H.\~IW-8438, 26 January 1960).
