He replied: "Sure, I co~ld have gone as NIYOl~YEV, bet I just 
didn't want ·to. Because, look, it was k~c~u _to us that the 
Briti!;h and l\:r.erican Ir:u lligence exchange ir.forr.iation on pt:oplo 
they suspect of being KGb, anci that the British, of course, 
had probably watched r.,e when :::: w.:1s in England (j n 1957 and 1'.J58] 
and probably there it was noticed that here's this ma~ under 
the cover cf Ministry of Culture. He's not a sportsman. It 
kind of looks suspicious. Then he goes to the Soviet Embassy. 
Also SUf:picious. So then I • .ave to go to the States. Md if 
1 go as NIKOLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I couldn't use 
t.he same cover o! Ministry of Cult'.Jre tec.:ause of th~ type of 
the delc9ntion. I'd have to use a different cover. So I'd go 
there and they'd say: 'Aha, here's NIKOLA'{EV under different 
cover now.' But if I go as ~OSENKO, the British nev~r heard 
the nan,a. Nobody knows the name. Evei.-ything would be O.K.• 
NOSEm:o was then asked why he could not have travelled under 
some other alias. He answered: •That's the way it was d~­
cided. I guess so as not to get all mixed up they decided to 
send me as NOSEUKO anyway. It's up to the people who are in 
charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide.••• 
* This visa applic~tion was submitted approximately six month£ 
after the KGB rejected his request for PCS assignment to 
Ethiopia. 
** With regard to his trips to England in 1957 and 1ss·a, NOSENKO 
said that he had·been forced to use the name NIKCLAYEV because
