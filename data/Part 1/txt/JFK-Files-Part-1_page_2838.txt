Personal Handler of KGB Agents: Summary and Conclusion 
Of the five agents NOSENKO claims to have brought with 
him to the American Embassy Section from his previous Seventh 
. D.epartment assignment, none was used operationally during 
1960-1961. If NOSENKO handled LEVINA as he claimed, he 
would presumably know that his single agent in the Embassy 
served throughout his Embassy:·-·section assignment and was 
not fired earlier, as he asserted .(Jb~REISFREUN~ and~rss] 0~

_claims regarding the agents'rie handred during the 1960-1961 
period do not sustain his assertions that he was Deputy 
Chief of the American Section, responsible for code clerk 
operations, or provide conclusive evidence th~t he did or 
did not·serve in the Embassy Section. •
