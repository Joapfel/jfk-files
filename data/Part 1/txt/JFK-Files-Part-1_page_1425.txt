LA Division recommends that the passage on the ter­
rorist kidnapping in the Dominican Republic be deleted. 
for the following reasons: 
1) This incident is still fresh in the minds 
of most Dominicans and it is unrealistic to assume 
that it will not be picked up and published in the 
local press. Barbara Hutchison, USIA, one of the 
people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic 
and, according to two recent reports, is again being 
considered as a target for kidnapping. The potential 
for terrorist acts against US citi~ens continues; 
three leaders of terrorist-oriented groups are iQ 
prison and publication of this item could propel ·the 
terrorists into action. 
2) The close link between the ambassador and 
the station, as portrayed in the book could be pre~ 
judicial to his public image and might even provoke 
the terrorists to target against him . 
. ~y 
3) The station has renewed a {jiaisoJ relation­
ship and much effort is being directed toward deve­
lo~in~futual confidence. Revelation of details of 
a joint operation )by a former division,lfchief might 
led the increasingly friendly ~iaiso~ contactj to 
wonder whether we can maintain confidence on future 
operations and thereby throw the new relationship 
into jeopardy. 
4) Although the bugging of the thermoi was 
discovered and appeared in the press, the use of 
the Coca Cola case was not exposed and therefore 
continues to be an operational possibility, at least 
as far as the Dominican Republic is concerned. 
Revelation of the technique by Agee should not be 
a criterion for further disclosure.
