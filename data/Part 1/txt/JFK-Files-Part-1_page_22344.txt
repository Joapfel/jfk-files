4. Operational Circu~stanr.cs 
a. Preseoce in Geneva (1962) 
:.%i 
When be ca&e to G~ne,·a in aid-~!arch 1~62,_;,)iOSt~T.O 
was a newly appointed Section Chief in tt.e Y.GB Srcond Chiot 
Directorate, bavi~g held thls pns1tion tor t~o m~nths. 
He hie.self acknowledged to CIA that it appeared titru:..te 
for tt.e KG'J to send a new Section Chief on ar. er.tended trip 
abroad unconcected with his o~n work. Ills reasons for being 
in Ge~eva have var:~J and to so~e de~rcc contradict one 
~noth~r: The Disarca~cnt Coo!erence was not expected to 
1 ast core th~n "a few .. eeks," but NOSIN KO did r.ot ~egin his 
,.-ork e.gainst SHAlUIOV (one.· of the l!IBln re2sor.!!I for !lie being 
there) until six weeks after arrl\•al; G:U9 . .\SOV' played a 
role in his TOY, but SOS~iKO later d~n1ed this; ttere ~ere 
in :!.962 ''.1eii rcles" requiring a staff officer to acco:npany 
a Soviet dclcgation, but in 19G5 :;0s1:~1m !>aid he did cot 
rcceaber such re~ulations. He was pcroitted to ~o to Geneva 
in 1962 Ar.d 196·1, as well as to Cuba in 19 130 and fr.gland 
in 1957 and 1953, u:idc:r no supcn•ision or rcstrni:.t ~espite 
tis claic to a ~~cord ~o bnd th&t he w~s ::ot clcar◊d by tho 
KGB tor pcr~an~nt poslin~ to Et~iopia in 1~60. • 
b. Fresence in GP.ncva (1964) 
~C,S~KO said on one occa.:;ion that Gf.!!3.ASQ'/ was enc of 
those "'ho allo.ed him to come t.:> Gcne\·a in J:-..nuaq· 1S64, 
as a pcrso~al favor;• he lat~r not only dc~icd this tut said 
in 1965 tha.t GRIDA.SOV knew nc:thin~ about t!-,e: Tf;\'. l!e re­
ported the 19G-: 'I'DY o1 5ht, c~ca.;;-;c or his ::e~ positio:i, 
bo his last trip to the 'l\"est, hence the "favor'' of his 
s~periors to perglt hio this last trip; in 1962 SOSESKO 
s&id he had the assurance that as Vcputy Ucpart~ont Chief 
(..-hich be k.ncw he -was about to tecoicc) he T,ould in the future 
coae to the •est at least once a year. Also, SOS~ltO could 
not explain why a Fir~t D~puty Department Chief, it allowed 
out of the liSSR as a "treat." would go at-road tor a conference 
which could be e,cpcctcd to last 1111any -Acci<s, probably months. 
This question is COll!pounded by the fact that ~0Sr};KO would • 
be needed in ~oscow: He said that a KGB confereoc:-~ to plan 
the handling of the tourist season was to be held at about 
this time, and he stuck to this story even atter admitting 
that the telegra: recalling him tor this ~oscow c~ofercnce 
vas an invention (sec below). 
c. Access to KGB Residency and Availability to CIA 
NOS~KO in 1962 roulioely visited the KGB Legal Resi­
rleoc7 in Geneva e~cry weekday Qornl~g. although be claimed 
that he had n~ reason and that it is nor~ally forbidden (as 
other sources h:ve confir:ned).•• When asked how aod 7hy be 
SC~3:tive SOU!"Ce 
~~~~ci. ted GRIBA~U\''s personal aut!1orlzat ion of l\'OSE~KO's 
r1p in tbc !ace of der~gatory information as one cause of 
GRIDASOV's disaissal. 
• •sosE.,"KO said be did not visit the KGD !_c,i;al Residency tn 
London norc than once durln~ his visits there in a si:nilar 
capacity in 1957 and 1958, nor during his trip tc Cuba in 
1960.
