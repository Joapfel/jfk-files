The Department of State indicated concern a.bout the level in 
CIA on which Comint policy matters are handled. and also noted that 
on occasions there appears to be lack of coordination within CIA on 
Comint policy matters. Thia factor is one. of the reasons why we 
recommend raising the level of Sigint policy matters to the Assistant 
. to the DCI for Coordination and !ptf:'lligence Community Guidance. 
State's Counter Communism Office 
We reviewed. with some interest the proposed crea,tion in the 
office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs of the 
Department of State of a strategy group for combatting communis1n. 
While the full scope of its function is as yet unclear. we believe that 
CIA should follow the developments in this office closely as its 
activities_ will have considerable bearing on the work of the Agency.
