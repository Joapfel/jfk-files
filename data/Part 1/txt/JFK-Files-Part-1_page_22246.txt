(i) Introduction 
As already indicated, t:CS!:N~o•s principal knowle<.lgeability 
of KGB operations is r<llated to Al!'.ericans in the Soviet Union. 
With t.he exception of one Ger.:-.an and one Non.egian tourist case, 
his only other personal participatio~ in third-ndtional (i.e., non­
AEneric.'\n) operations stems fr9r::. his a2&0Ci.:\tion with the section 
of the Tourist Department conc~r~~d with Vnited Kingdo~ and Canad­
ii.n, as w~ll as /J:-.erican, tourists. Where he h,1s cor:r.iented on 
Eources fer the r~st of his thirc-national leadR, he indicated 
his knowlcd1e was acquired either through co~versaticns with 
other officcrR or through his po3ition as DPputy Chief of the 
Tourist Ocpartir.cnt in 1962-1963. Thus hf: r.i,tdc .r.~ clain for co:n­
p!cte~ess of his coverage, nor ~cc~s~~r1ly for absolute accuracy 
and full details on c:r.y om: c.1;.;c. t:•::i c:ttcr::r,t will be r.,ade h~re,

Of the r~aining 68 known or possible agents who have been

ccncl~sive investigation rcsult3 t.ave yet been c~tained on 30 of 
these, but the majority "'·ere said by NOSE:;Ko to be t~avel agency 
employees (guides, bus drivers, etc.). Five of the ,30 helci 
positions of trust in their respective governments: these five 
leads are discussed below in terms of fOtcntial value to U.S. 
security and potential damage to the KGB. Of the five who have been
