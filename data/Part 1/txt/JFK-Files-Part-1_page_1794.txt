of this new organization be lo.cated at [ I() J where it will have 
facilities for organization and tr~ining. Such a move will also relieve 
the burden on the headquarters building. '\Ve recommend that the 
individual to head this organization be drawn from military service 
and be a senior Colonel or a Brigadier General· with wartim.e para• 
military experience. Having in mind the total <i;isestablishment of 
I 
the DPD in its present form, we recommend that tha Air Support 
Branch of DPD be transferred to the new Pal"ainilitary Office of DD/P.
