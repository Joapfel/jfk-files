COM'IENTS OP' REVIEWING o,-P'ICl.o\1.. 
As .noted in the last ritness Report, I concur generally in the 
supervisor's 1·ntings of Mr. Vitale's performance ·as liste1; but I 
must again note that t·hcsc . .are duties whi.ch could be performed by .a 
moro junior clerical type and .that Mr. VitaJe should not be considered 
as performing GS-8 l~vel Intelligence Assistant -.vo1·k at a Proficie~t 
rating. • Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qu_al_ified for 13uch., a .ro.1.e 
and his official position title should be changed to prevent ~~Y 
misunderstanding as to th·e somewhat unique nature of his value·.to 
the Agency.
