•·•·• 'P"'• "·•;-~;J ;;~'-~t•t~~/'1~" ti";;t-.;~ iftfi~n cut short by the scri ous 
illness of his daughter. As a result of this illness it was also 
necessary for him-to spend the months of December and January on 
emergency leave in the Unfted States, returning without his famfly 
In F~bruary in order to transfer his ops workload and pack out his 
personal effects for PCS transfer to Headquarters on 4 March. 
Although the undersigned had the privilege of working with 
Subject only briefly, as rating officer he had the advantage of 
taking over handling of most of Subject's cases following the 
departure on emergency leave. Thus he was able to observe first 
hand and in detail the human material with which Subject had worked. 
the progress he had made in developing their access and capabiltt1es, 
and the respect these agents had for him~ 
During the period covered by this report, Subject continued 
his pursuit of tha MPCHEEK target as his primary operatfonal 
responsibility. He developed and rccru~ted a prominent member of 
the local HPCHEEK community·who has good access to the MPCHEEK 
embatsy and handled four other access a~ertts. He also handled a 
unilateral surveillance team and the Stati6n's press placement 
a~sets via a principal agent who in turn handled three sensitive 
assets.
