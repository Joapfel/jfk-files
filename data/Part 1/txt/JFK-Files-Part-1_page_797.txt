promotion foJ~ AMCARDON-1, and it 1·ePected confidence in him by 
the ldenti ty 3 managoment. AMCARBCH-1 is by no means ;:Ln expert 
on La tin America, but he is develop Lng his knowledge 011 the al'ea 
and, at the uoment, he gives every lndication of wanting to be a 
long-term La ~111 American specialist. QDELF has been q1.1estioned 
about AMCARBON-1 1 aud he has indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded 
in the journalistic trade as an ext:cemely likeable fellow who has 
a keen mind hut who lacks experienc'3 in depth on Latin American 
affairs. It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse 
of time, AMCJI.RBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin 
American spe,:ialists in U .s. journalistic circles. AMCARBON-1 
has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting 
to i1nprove his language fluency. It is REUTEMAN 's opinion that • 
AMCARBQN-1 hllS developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist, 
and he will ,:on tinue to grow in this field. Thus, he is a contact 
who should bo developed and harness,~d for exploi ta t'ion, bearing 
in mind that he does have long-term potential. '
