U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS 
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) 
EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS 
In handling this project, SA Shea was primarily 
interested in classifying the documents in these COINTELPRO 
files and little notice was made of any specific COINTELPRO 
actions actually being recommended in these documents. SA 
Shea pointed out that in his review he did not recall any
