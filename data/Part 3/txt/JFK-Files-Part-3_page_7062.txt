and that while the Secret S&"'Vice of the TreasUJ.7 Departme11t had assured 
. him that they had informants in ever-:1 Communist group, he believed that 
if that was true it was solely for the"purpose of getting any- informatio~ 
upon plots upon his life, whereas what he was interested in was obtaining 
a broad picture of the general movement and its activities as may affect the 
economic and political life of the country as a whole. I told him that "there

Servj_ces. He stated that the Secret Service was not being broueht in on this 
investigation as they should confine themselves strictly to the matter of 
protecting his life and the survey which he desired· to have made was on a 
much broader field.
