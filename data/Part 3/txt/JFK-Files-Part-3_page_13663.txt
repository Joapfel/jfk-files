poisbn pen or the pen device_ an4 my only question is what is 
your best recollection about what happened to the pen? Did 
he take it with him? Did you take it with you when you left 
the meeting? 
,AMI.ASH Case Officer. Again, as I· mentioned to you the 
last time, I don't remember specifically if I kept the pen and 
threw it away or if he kept it. 
What I do remember;was his reaction when I showed him 
11 the pen. I can't today tell you for. sure that he kept the 
12 pen . 
13 Mr. Johnston. It seems to me that's rather compromising 
14 evidence, if he kept the pen and you recall that. It's also 
15 such compromising evidence -- I have difficulty believing you 
16 would have thrown i_t away. 
17 AMLASII Case Officer. Yes, because it was compromising 
18 evidence. I had carried 'it one way. I mean I wasn't going to 
~ 19 carry it bacl~. It was nothing but a Papcrmate pen in which 
20 a hypodermic needle had been inserted. 
21 In other words, it wasn't a $10,000 piece of equipment 
22 or anything like this. 
23 Mr. Johnston. I agree, but it's a very compromising 
24 piece of evidence to have around. 
25 AHLASII Case Officer. That's right. But what I can't 
TOP SECRET
