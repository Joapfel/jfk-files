Mr. Adams. Well, the only limits are that we must 
relate it to a statutory basis on one of the Presidential 
guidelines we have or the criteria we have, which criteria 
1835 
are rece:iving scrutiny at the present time by Congre.ss. • .,They 
havs in the past by the-Department of Justics, and this is the 
area of guidelines. This whole area of domestic security is 
what we need guidelines in. 
Senator Mondale. Right. And· you would agree, we talked 
about this earlier, that being a Communist is not a crime. 
Mr. Adams. No, it has not been a cri:me. 
. . 
Sena:to_r Mondale. So that the whole basis for this has 
. to ·apparently stem from a Presidential directive, you think 
has.-task~d you-to do this. 
Mr. Adams. Yes. 
Senator .Mondale. Just a few other points. 
In 1970, 11/6/70, a telegram from Newark to the D.irector

"Word received.. Food donated to party by anti-liberation 
white pigs contained poison. Symptoms: cramps, diarrhea, 
severe stomach pains .. Destroy all food donated for convention 
suspected of poison. 
"However, still re~uire.d to meet your quota. Signed, 
Ministry of Information. 11
