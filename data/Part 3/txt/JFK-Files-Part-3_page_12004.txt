since February, 1969, has limited investigative and re­
porting activity in this field. As of 1/11/71 there were 
18 active and 78 inactive case in the Cuban Special 
• Section of the Security Index (19% of the 96 case total)

Current Justification 
The threat to the internal security of the u. s. 
from communist Cuba has not lessened in recent years. A 
workable priority apprehension system which receives 
current and continuing attention is mandatory. Instant 
program, as presently organized and handled, is fully 
justified.
