The Attorney General 
NOTE: 
On 6/11/75 Legal Counsel advised Mr. K. William O'Connor 
of the Department of our objection and our desire that excisions be made 
if we are overruled. Mr. O'Connor suggested the excised material be 
prepared on an expedite basis. It appears the Department will rrake 
available these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee but we feel we 
should be on record as relates to FBI recommendations and objections. 
This letter and exhibits A through E, which will be made 
available to Legal Counsel, should be delivered to Mr. O'Connor at the 
Department by Legal Counsel Division.
