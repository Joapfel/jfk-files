OLSEN: Where did you talk to Bernie the next time about this subject? 
STURGIS: It was either one or two places; it was either at his 
home in the --I believe th.e northwest section of town, or at a dinner that 
he invited me to at a steak house--and I believe it was a ranch house; this 
ranch house was· located on 36th Street just before LeJuene Road. 
OLSEN: And what happened when you next met with Barker about the 
subject'? 
STURGIS: He told me that this invitation was -- his Case Officer 
said "Take Frank out and have a dinner.u 
OLSEN: And wh.at did h.e do? Did he explore further your willingness 
to undertake this? 
STURGIS: Yes. Bernie asked me how I would go about it were the 
subject aoout th.e assassination., and he asked me how I would do it. And 
I told him, I says "Well., it would all depend. I don't want to know tho 
man or the victim's name at this time, but it would depend on the man, 
his position, for me to determine how I would get rid of the man. 
OLSEN: And also wh.ere? 
STURGIS: Where--the location., r_ight. Also, in the conversation I. 
told him--h.e went into detail with me, and he said that there was a possibility 
th.at h.e would like to go on 1fi..e thing with me,. And I told him that "Well 
Bernie, I don't like anybody to come with me; Itll be very honest with you. 
I prefer to do it myself," because naturally I did not want to have a 
witness to something that I would do even if he is an agent or not, that 
I: would do the thing. He said r1we11, how could I know that it was done."
