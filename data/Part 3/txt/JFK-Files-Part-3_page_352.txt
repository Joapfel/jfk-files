Did you get heavy pressure from 
Bureau officials to take action 
in this program? 
Not any more than any other 
case, and I had a number of 
other cases assigned to me 
at the time the COINTELPRO 
was assigned to me. 
What type of .things did you 
do? 
I do not recall at this time 
any specific action taken in 
the program. I do recall that 
a Black Panther leader, • Walter 
Wallace, was removed as leader 
of the party in San Diego. I 
believe it was suspected that 
he might have cooperated with 
the FBI. This could have been 
accomplished by interviewing 
him where the interview could 
be seen by other party members. 
If the Agents shook his hand, 
smiled, and acted like he was 
a friend, it might plant the 
seed of suspicion in the minds 
of other BPP members, I do 
not recall specifically whether 
this happened but at any rate, 
Wallace was not trusted and 
was removed as leader of the 
party. 
Could such a thing get Wallace 
killed or injured?
