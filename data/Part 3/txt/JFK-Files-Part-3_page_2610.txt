NW 38601! Docld:3 
2454 
The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women, 
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or 
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and 
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their 
rights. 
There were many calls for action from Members of Congress 
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and oth r 
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient 
demands, for immediate action. 
FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a 
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions 
designed to counter conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed 
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent,activities. 
In the development and execution of these programs, 
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made. 
Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones, 
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs. 
We must recognize that situations have occurred in the 
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well 
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's 
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering 
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet 
an imminent threat·to human life .or property.
