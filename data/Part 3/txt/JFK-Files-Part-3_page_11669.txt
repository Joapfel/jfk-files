BLACK PANTHER PARTY i 4H , I I I • l 
The Black Panther Party (BPP), a black extremist 
organization, continues to be extremely active throughout the 
country. Formed during late 1966 in Oakland, California, for 
the obstensible purpose of patrolling the black community to 
prevent alleged police brutality, it was originally known as 
the Black Panther Party for SelfMDefense. 
It expanded rapidly throughout the United States 
during 1967w68, then suffered a gradual decline during 1969. 
Revitalized in December, 1969, and throughout the 1970s, it 
expanded until there were approximately 48 branches of the BPP 
with an estimated 1,000 hard-core members supported by many 
thousands of sympathizers as of December, 1970. Another gradual 
decline began in 1971; and as of June, 1971, the Party had 710 
hardHcore members in 39 branches representing 37 cities.

, The official goal of the BPP has always been the violent 
' overthrow of the United States Government and its replacement with 
a Marxist~Leninist system. The BPP has openly advocated urban 
guerrilla warfare, assassination of Government leaders and other 
forms of violent terrorism. Since its inception, the BPP has 
aimed its most vicious invectives against law enforcement and 
particularly local police. "Off the pigs," BPP jargon for "kill the 
cop" is the battle cry of the organization. Newto.n.now claims the 
BPP was led astray by ,Q,,l~a~e.,J;,,,in his quest for violence when 
actually the BPP is a.nonviolent, community serving organization. 
In spite of Ne't'[t.9p: s peace loving front, the truth is that .B~.;$.CZJJ. 
and his BPP are just as much anarchists as ever. On 6-30"71 a 
Washington, D. C. BPP leader and follower of Newton stated "the 
ultimate goal of the BPP is the complete destruction of the 
United States Government and its replacement with Marxist-Leninist 
socialism."
