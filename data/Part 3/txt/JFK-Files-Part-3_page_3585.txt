DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO 
Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers' 
strike i.~ Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott. 
downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68 
King led a march for the sanitation workers. Like Judas leading 
lambs to slaughter King led the marchers to violence, and when .the· violence broke out, King disappeared. 
The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and 
patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there 
from his hasty exit. Instead King decided the plush Holiday 
Inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white 
patronized, was the place to "cool it." There will be no 
boycott of white ~uerchants for King, only for his followers.
