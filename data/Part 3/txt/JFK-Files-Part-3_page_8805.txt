The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover 
Director 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
Washington, Do C. 
Dear Mr. Hoover: 
'. 
Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the 
identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain informa.tion 
communicated to an employee of this Agency, Mr. Michael}fodor~~ich .. 
This information regarding the disappearance~ one 'l'homasJ:Uha wa.s 
in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then PresidentorCoT6ra,cio ~­
University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a univ-ersit}r i~-El 
Paso, Texas, and to the Di~trict Attorney of Denver, Mr. James .1 McKevitt. In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed 
Mr. Todorovich to report to me in person. ··-~ ., . 
I have reviewed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich 
and have ;-equested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point 
of honor_and personal integrity, Mr. Todorovich was adamant that he 
could not disclose the identity of his source. Under further pressuxe 
from me, Mr. Todoro_vich maintained his position, stating that in de­
fense of it he was prepared to submit his resign~tion immediately. 
Mr. Todorovich explained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases 
had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational 
in nature. He stressed that there was e1nbarrassing public speculation 
as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha 1s 
disappearance.
