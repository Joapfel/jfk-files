In the Israeli field we have continued to furnish information 
from our sensitive coverage under a program of dissemination which 
has been assigned the security designation of "SCOPE." "SCOPE" 
information is furnished only to select individua".L;tatthe Whfre-·House 
and to a previously cleared chain of command within agencies of the 
intelligence community. These data relate to attempts by officials of 
~t4~_,,JqJ;,a~_Ji,.Government to obtain favorable reaction within United States 
Government circles for Israeli_Govei:1J..mst!JJ support including economic 
and military assistance. The personalities involved in these dealings 
have included prominent members of the United States Congress as well 
as individuals within the executive arm of our Government. Favorable 
comment has been forthcoming from Dr. Kissinger at the White House, 
from the Secretary of State and from other dignitaries within the 
intelligence community who have been privy to this ''BCO.P.E~'-information 
relative to its timeliness and value to them in fornftnating policy decisions 
within our Government. •
