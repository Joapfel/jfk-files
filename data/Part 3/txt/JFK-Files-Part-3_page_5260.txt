I exhibited my FBI credentials to the 
subject and advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I 
·apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening 
paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of tnis FD 302 I 
inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the 
FD 302. Care will be exercised in the future to insure this 
does not reoccur. 
SA RICHARD"')::.. LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervi·sor on Desk #6 in the 
10/27/70 <~;;._ absence of the regular supervisor and due 
to the exceptionally high volume of mail 
ha_ndled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above 
omission from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report 
was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future 
to avoid a repitition of this delinquency.

In reference to the report of SA RICHARD G:7": 
MILLER signed out by SA LUEBBEN on 9/3/70, 
SA LUEBBEN was one of the Relief Supervise~~ 
during my extended sick leave during this period. SA LUEBBEN is a~ 
exper.ienced .R,eJ..J.,.e,f $,up.e,r-viL-sor and supervises the desk in a very 
efficient and commendable manner. Due to the exceptionally heavy 
voh1me of mail during this time, he inadvertently overlooked the 
omission in the FD 302 of SA MILLER. The -importance of advising 
Bureau subjects the identity of Agents and nature of interview wil.:. 
be discussed with the Relief Supervisors periodically and will be 
followed closely to insure this does not reoccur.
