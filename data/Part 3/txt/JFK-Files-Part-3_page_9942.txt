INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES 
TITLE XI, ORGAtHZED CRIME COilTROL ACT OF 1970 
REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES 
1. General 
Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United 
States Code, by adding a new chapter 4-0 with section numbers 841 
through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution 
and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal 
offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. • Admi.nistration 
of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury 
as 1s investiaative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed 
in section 842. Under authority contained in section 846 the 
Fed~rul Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol~ 
Tobacco and Fireanns (ATF) have concurrent invest·igative jur-isdic-
tion as to the rerrminder of chapter 40, i.e., the unlawful acts

involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails 
or directed against u. S .. Postal Service property. ·_ 
Tit1e XI greatly broadens Federal-authority pe?~tafoing to 
explosives-connected offenses. At the same time, Congress has 
expressly disclaimed any intent to o.ccupy the field to the exclusion 
of state law on the same subject matter. To e.ffact both.Congressional 
purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is 
essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully 
allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI 
have jurisdiction. 
2. Federal Bureau of Investiaation JF3I) Jurisdiction in General 
(a) Effect on orior jurisdiction,_ This agreement applies 
only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative 
juri sdi ct ion prior to the enactment of the captioned 1 aw and to 
incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter 
65, Title 18, United St~tes Code (malicious mischief). Investigative 
procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking,. damaging 
aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.
