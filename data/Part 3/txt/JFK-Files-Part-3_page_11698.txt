., BOCOV' 
"' Bocov is a code word which concerns a highly 
sensitive ,intelligence operation of this Bureau which was in . . ·-~ --
effect from 4/24/48 until 9/11/72. ~ The purpose of this 
-operation was to attempt to identify foreign subversive· . . . 
elements entering the U. S-. Although this operation is-no 
longer in existence, the disclosure of the fa.ct that it was 
once carried on would undoubtedly severely impai= the abilities 
of this Bureau to fulfill its domestic obligatio~s, not only 
with regard to the internal security of the U~ S., but also 
in investigating criminal matters of an international nature. 
Furthermore, unauthorized disclosure of details of this 
operation could jeopardize the lives of individuals who 
cooperated with this Bureau and who are currently residing 
abroad.
