DONALD R. HOPKINS 
DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR 
As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the 
Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs. This concern has been 
heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the 
U. S. Intelligence Community. In this l tght, I am requesting answers to the 
following questions concerning FBI activ-ity in Berkeley: 
1. What is the size of the conti_ngent of agents in the Berkeley field office? 
2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are 
the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse, 
criminal, etc.? 
3. What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their 
involvement in category two? 
4. What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the 
Berkeley field office? 
5. What are the interactions and working relationships between the field 
office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California 
Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many 
informers are utilized by the field office? 
6. Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's 
involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and 
individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local 
field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what 
political surveillance is being undertaken?
