.. . _. .. Mr. Cotter is very definitely deemed necessary so that an acting 
·_ ·· . • •. •• Number One Man can be designated to relieve SA Smith in the Section 
. Front Office. In the interest of continuity of responsibility and authority 
, • • :·· it is felt that designation of an acting Number One Man is a must. A 
• ••• .. _·replacement was approved by the Director for the other Agent named 
·-• along with Mr. Cotter for detached permanent assignment to the 
Department. Personnel of the Section cannot be considered adequate 
• so long as there is only one Special Agent handling Front Office 
responsibilities of the Section.
