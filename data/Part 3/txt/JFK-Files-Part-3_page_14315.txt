Meeting Of Avril 23, 1963 
At thi~cleeting, in the course of a discussion of covert 
action matters, the ~uestion was raised as to whether the Board 
should not asce~tain specifically whether the President desired 
that.the Board go into covert action program~_de~ply, and if that 
proved to be the President's wish then the Board should take -
steps to in~ure that it re6eived full briefings from-the agencies 
concerned. Chairman Killian stated that there were no limita­
tions on the Board's access to such informatiori and that this is 
well eitablished.

· informed~ the Board concerning the meeting_ ·which he, and Mr. Gray 
and Mr. Coyne had recently with Mr. Cord Meyer of CIA on the 
subj-ect of cove:rt action programs. Mr. Murphy said that_ the 
briefing covered. operations in certain Latin American coU:ntries 
(the subject of Cuba was excluded because tha.t was to be covered I 
at today'~· Board ·meeting) arid the briefing cohsis ted primarily 
of "light touches", and was of such routine nature that it see.med 
to downgr~de the importance ~hich the Board attached to covert 
action operations and requirements.
