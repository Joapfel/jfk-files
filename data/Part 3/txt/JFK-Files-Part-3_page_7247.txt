On receipt of the letter from Mr. Huston the Director,

pointing out FBI objections to certaiw of the decisions reported 
in the Huston letter. Mr. Hoover objected to relaxation of 
electronic surveillance policy, the implementa.tion of c·overt mail 
coverage, the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious 
entry of ernbassies to obtain cryptographic. materials, the removal 
of controis and restrictions rel~ting to the coverage of 
. ./ 
violence-prone campus and student-related groups and the 
establishment of a permanent Interagency Committee on Domestic 
Intelligence. The Director stated that in the "Special Report" 
he had pointed out his opposition to these aspects of the 
Report and requested of the Attorney General a prompt 
expression of his views concerning the matter. He noted that 
no action to implement the instructions contained in Mr. Huston's 
letter would be taken pending a reply from the Attorney General. 
No further action to implement the Huston letter 
subsequent to the 7/27/70 letter to the Attorney General was 
instituted by the intelligence community. There is no indication 
that the Attorney General ever responded to this comnmnication.
