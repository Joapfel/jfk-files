Also Known As 
11us11 , Incorporated 
11us11 was chartered by the State of California as 
a non-profit corporation in September; 1966, with offices 
at 8211 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California. The 
corporation alleges that "US" is primarily an Afro­
American cultural organization. 
During the spring of 1968, however, a source 
advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RQNIE MC KINLEY 
EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of 11us11, published a booklet 
entitled "The Quotable Karenga'', in which he talked of 
revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the 
plight of the black man. 
In this booklet, KARENGA stated 11 ••• You must have 
a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The 
cultural revolution gives identity; purpose, and direction. 
... The revolution being fought now is a revolution to win 
the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we cannot 
wage the violent one .... When the word is given, we'll 
see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much 
you blow up. And when it's 'take that white girl's head 
too', we'll see how tough you are ... 11 
The above source advised that 11US" members are 
required to study and memorize this booklet. 11us11 members 
are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu 
of their given names . 
. A second source advised that KARENGA had 
spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he 
talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 .men, obtaining 
weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and 
revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to get 
life is to take a life and as we get stronger, we will 
take what we want from the white man's United States." 
He also stated that if the police killed any "US11 members, 
the "US11 organization would kill some of them.
