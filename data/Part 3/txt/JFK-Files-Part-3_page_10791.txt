In discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired 
issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform 
with the original plan proposed by the President or which was 
envisioned by the discussions occurring prior to the time the 
President issued his Directive. The original plan, insofar as 
., the Bureau was advised, contemplated the setting up of solely 
a coordinating agency which was given the power to perform certain 
functions which it would be determined could more adequately and 
e~0r..0~:!.~?.lly be r>er-fo:i:-rnAd centrally for the benefit of all 
Governi"llent agencies. The memorandum noted that "undoubtedly if 
this Directive is approved and the Central Intelligence Group 
is successful in setting up complete foreign coverage, the 
Bureau would undoubtedly be pushed into a 'second rate' position 
insofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the 
domestic field ... It is inevitable that the Central Intelli­
gence Group must enter into the domestic field picture insofar 
as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign 
intelligence existing in that field. Also, it is impossible to 
separate entirely foreign intelligence and the domestic functions 
performed by the Bureau."* 
In reply to the Directive proposed by General Vandenberg, 
a letter was sent to him June 25, 1946, which stated that the

clarification purposes only." The Director suggested that to 
the item relating to the Director of Central Intelligence acting

Mr. C. A. Tolson noted an exception by placing an addendum on the 
memorandum. The Director's comments were set forth. This ·is· 
more fully reported below under.the heading, "Director's Comments."
