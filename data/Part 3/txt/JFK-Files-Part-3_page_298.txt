Seidel: 
The BPP in San Diego was very effective in causing 
their mm problems and their mm extinction and their 
criminal activities were not restricted to the examples 
I've given. 
Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast 
Program? 
No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after 
the Breakfast Program was started that other members 
of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from 
contributions made to the Program. 
On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP 
Breakfast Program in that ·we received complaints 
from several dairys and bread companies, et cetera, 
that they had been approached by BPP members with 
veiled threats of extortion if they did not donate 
quantities of food; et cetera., to the BPP Breakfast 
Program. The FBI and local police investigated and 
I believe as a result their practices were discontinued, 
but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable 
offense of extortion. 
Did you have any connection with distribution of 
11cartoonsn depicting BPP members as compromising each 
othe:i; et cetera? 
No, but I have seen "cartoons" in the BPP newspaper. 
Have you ever seen or read copies of the BPP newspaper? 
No
