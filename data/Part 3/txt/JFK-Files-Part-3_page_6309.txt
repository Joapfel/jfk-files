This memorandum advises that the Senate Select ~·, ~ 
Committee (SSC) intends to release to the press copies of \ 
eight FBI documents (attached). The release of these 
documents is scheduled for 10/24/75, following the appearance 
of .Assistant Directors Wannall and Mintz and Section Chief 
Branigan before the SSC. 
These documents were made available to the SSC 
responsive to specific requests. They have been excised 
and declassified where necessary. With regard to dissemi­
nation of FBI documents to the Select Committees of Congress, 
both the White House and the Department have held that, ,;f" . l 
once a document has been excised, declassified and furnished 0'/ 
to either Select Committee of Congress, it is that Committee's { 
property to do with whatever that Committee deems appropriate.i 
However, we do have an understanding with the Committee tha~ 
allows for more extensive excisions once the Committee decides 
to make documents available to the press. Personnel in the 
Senstudy Project have reviewed the attached eight documents 
and have made additional excisions which are acceptable to 
the SSC• These excisions are designed to protect Bureau 
sources, targets and, where possible, the identity of Bureau 
personnel. REC-114 0 ;,L ~I/ re :3 J' j -956 
The contents of the documents that will be made • • 
available generally portray the Bureau in a favorable light. 
They highlight: (1) tiglit supervision and control of the 
mail intercept programs; (2) general objectives of the program; 
(3) accomplishments; and (4) Departmental officia"'i"s'kn~wl~dg-e 
of the existence of some of these programs.
