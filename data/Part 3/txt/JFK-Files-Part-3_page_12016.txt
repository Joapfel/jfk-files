headquarters and foreign support. In addition, evidentiary 
information that could support prosecution is regularly 
furnished to the Department. 
Our ultimate objective is of course the prosecution 
of the BPP for violations of Federal criminal, civil rights 
and security statutes. A secondary objective is to more 
completely develop details of the BPP for intelligence 
purposes. 
In July, 1969, the Attorney General established 
a special task force for the specific purpose of developing 
a prosecutive theory against the BPP. Attq~neys of this 
task force, known as the Special Interdivisional Unit, have 
interviewed many of our informants in furtherance of this 
p~:::-pcse and have ins ti t,.,_t-i=>d a continuing Federal Grand Jury 
in San Francisco. Ten of our informants have testified 
before this Federal Grand Jury and its is anticipated that 
others will be called. 
It is recommended that the intensive investigation 
of the BPP including all surveys and procedures outlined as 
-above be continued.
