I . forth above under the caption, "The History of Foreign Intelligence 
Collection in the United States - Prior to World War II," 
President- Roosevelt conducted certain conferences following 
which he issued instructions with regard to invostigations of 
• :fascist and communist activit:los in.tho United Stataao Those 
investigations were to be for intelligence purposes. For the 
most part, they took on a counterintelligence·aspect; howeverp 
during the course of .them foreign intelligence information was 
developed. either as an outgrowth of •investigative activity or 
through the conducting of technical surveillances. 
We found no record regarding the designation of the 
FBI as the agency responsible for collection of foreign intelligence 
information in the United States as of the time the Office of 
Coordinator of Information was created on 7/11/41. Neither did 
we find any record indicating such responsibility had been 
delegated to any other agency~ 
b.. ·Req~sts From Other Agencies 
From time to time the Bureau has received specific 
requt:s i.::. .fi:om vt~:..e:;,:-&.gonc:!.c:: cn.se<l upon. whia!! 'ti!~ l}~vA undertaken 
the coll,~ction of foreign intelligence information i.n the 
) United States in a clandestine fashion., Two instances of this 
~/ nature were based on request~ from the Department of State and 
from· .the White House., 
(1) Department of State Request - Recognizing a gap 
in our intelligence coverage of friendly governments, on 
10/21/55 we discussed with the then Deputy Undersecretary of 
State, Robert Murphy, the question of instituting limited 
-disc·reet technical surveillances on official establishments of 
selected foreign nations, principally those lqcated in world 
/. trouble areas. We pointed out that the FBI stood ready to 
institute such coverage as might be desired by the Department 
• o:f State. 
Mr. Murphy was 'quite· receptive ta- this idea, stating 
, • : •. -:' ·· -that--limited .. coverage sufficiently flexibl.e to· change with

in nature, would be inst.ituted. By this, :Mr. Murphy explained 
that he did.not feel at that time that al1 desirable coverage 
should be instituted at a given datep but rather.that coverage 
should be placed on one country at a time as moving events abroad
