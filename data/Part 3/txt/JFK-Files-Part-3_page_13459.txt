question .. of the Col1stitutional rights of Amsrican citizens, 
from whatever source, I think is very important. Last year I 
testified before Senator [Muskie's Committee in which I 
expressed some doubt about subjecting all surveillance type 
activities of the unusual type to the supervision of the 
courts in this co~ntry on the ground that I was a little trouble 
about the idea of getting the judges into this kind of 
business, because it is a mean and dirty bu~iness. 
Since then, I have rather changed my mind, and I 
am inclined to think that where the government feels that·there 
must be the types of surveillance which could intrude on 
constitutional rights, that for whatever it might be, foreign 
policy, national security or otherwise for American citizens 
and resident aliens, that that should be done under the 
supervision of a court. 
Now, it is going to be difficult to state that in 
such a way as to exclude the diplomatic community, and I do 
not think we want to extend constitutional rights to ths 
diplomatic community, because they do not have the duties of 
citizenship to go along with it. 
MR. SHANNON: One other quick one here. I don't 
·want to pre-empt the General, who has something, but you 
mentioned the CIA sometimes~· you believe, got into some 
activities that were questionable because they had the money.
