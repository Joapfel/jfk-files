• National Committee to Combat Fascism 
Set up to coexist with Black Panther Party branches in various cities in the 
United States are chapters of another organization called National Committee to 
Combat Fascism. In actuality, there is little difference between the two. This 
group, a Panther Party front, was set up as the result of a revolutionary conference, 
called National Conference for a United Front Against Fascism, held in Oakland, 
California, in July, 1969. The conference, sponsored by the Black Panther Party 
and assisted by the anarchist Students for a Democratic Society and the Communist 
Party, USA, was called to form a coalition of black and white radicals, described 
as "oppressed people." 
The National Committee to Combat Fascism is considered by Party leaders to 
be the "political organizing bureau" of the Black Panther Party. Its specific task 
allegedly is to raise the political level of the people and educate them against 
the system. 
International Section 
On September 13, 1970, the International Section of the Black Panther Party 
officially opened in Algiers. Joining Cleaver on the staff were his wife, 'Kathleen, 
and Field Marshal Donald Lee Cox, a fugitive from justice. Cox faces charges 
of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, based on a 
warrant issued on April 20, 1970, at Baltimore, Maryland. He also failed to appear 
on May 14, 1970, in San Francisco, to answer Federal firearms charges. 
This section, in its entirety, was expelled from the Black Panther Party by 
Huey Newton on February 27, 1971. The expulsion resulted from tensions and 
differences between Party hierarchy which led to disruptive factionalism.
