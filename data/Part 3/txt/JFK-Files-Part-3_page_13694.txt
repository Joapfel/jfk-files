Mr. Baron. C~n you re~-al~ a~;:thi~g about your conversatibn 
that produced that understanding? 
.NtLASII Casa Officer. No, just the general conversation 
of the time and what we were trying to do. 
In other words, we were trying to organize a coup. and 
the problems that we had been through specifically with N•U.J\Sll 
in trying to persuaue him that the u.s. government was serious 
about supporting Cubans who were opposed to Castro. 
So this statement that appeared in the spP-ech was 
certainly public notice that this was the case. 
!~r. Baron. !'lid Fitzgerald or anyone else say anythin•! 
to you that led you to believe that the PreRident had been 
specifically informed that representations would be made such 
as the ones on Octohcr 29th that Robert Kennedy or other hig!1 
American officials would stand behind AMLASI!? 
! 
Al\Ll\511 Case Officer. Ho, he didn't specifically tell me. I

Mr. Daron. Did your conversations with Fitzgerald about
