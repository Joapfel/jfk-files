The contents of these pages concern the "Chilean 
Project." On 4/16/71, CIA proposed technical penetration 
of the Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C., to collect foreign 
intelligence data and to compromise classified encrypted 
diplomatic traffic. CIA proposed that access be made 
through one of their covert contacts. The FBI declined. 
The Attorney General then requested FBI cooperation. On 
5/13/71, a memorandum was sent to the Department of State 
for approval of that operation and such approval was obtained 
on 5/17/71. On 7/14/71, the Attorney General authorized 
activation of the microphone installation at the Chilean 
Embassy until 10/8/71. CIA requested continuation as the 
expiration date approached and on 10/15/71, the Attorney 
General authorized such continuation. The technical • 
surveillance was discontinued as noted in memorandum to 
the Attorney General and CIA dated 2/7/72. The surveillance 
was reactivated on 12/27/72, and was eventually discontinued 
on 2/22/73.(S) 
On 6/19/73, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force 
requested FBI investigation of the alleged burglary of the 
Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C., on or about 5/13/72. 
The Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D. C., 
conducted an investigation of that incident and submitted 
a complete report to the Office of the United States Attorney. 
That report was in the possession of the Watergate Special 
Prosecution Force and on 10/30/73, that Force advised the 
FBI that no additional investigation was desired. There 
is no connection between the "Chilean Project" and the 
alleged burglary of the Chilean Embassy on or about 5/]3/72, · [ $)
