Dear Mike: 
This will confirm our telephone conversation con­
cerning the procedure whereby we will make available to 
you, or your designee, copies of draft reports relating 
to the Justice Department. As we discussed, the pur­
pose is so that any classification (or other such 
problems,~' the identity of informers) which may be 
inadvertently raised in our reports can be· identified. 
The first two drafts relating to the FBI are ready. 
They are: 
1. "The. Use of Informers in FBI Domestic 
Investigations"; and 
2. "Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs". 
(Substantial portions of which relate to the 
FBI.) 
I would appreciate it if someone very ~romptly could con­
tact Frederick D. Baron, my assistant (224-1746) ;·who 
will arrange the details. of location and time for the 
review.
