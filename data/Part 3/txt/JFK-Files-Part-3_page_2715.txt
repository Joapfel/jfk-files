• Senator Hart of Michigan. This is what .should require 
us to rethink this whole business. 
Mr. Adams. Absolutely. 
And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well 
as the _Congressional inpu~ are going to address themselves to. 
Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked.about a wide range 
of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetratio 
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's definition 
of when an extremist or security investigation-may be under­
taken refers to groups whose activity either involves violation 
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation 
of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then 
informants may be used. 
Another guideline says that domestic intelligence 
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations. 
The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation 
relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved, 
upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back 
agai?, iI'i. a world of· possible violations or activities which 
may result in illegal acts. 
Now, any constitutionally pr~tected exercise·of the 
right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition, 
conceivably may rcault in. violence or diGruption of a 1 n,-.::,1 ..._ __ '-4 ....
