Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
During the conversation with Mr. Clark he advised 
further that it is not the intention of Mr. Colby to use 
as any part of the CIA's defense for alleged domestic 
activities the allegation that such activities were under-
l
taken because the FBI had failed or was unwilling to carry 
out its responsibilities in the domestic area. Mr. Clark 
noted that he is aware that there have been references to 
such a claim in the newspapers but he assured SA Schwartz 
that Mr. Colby does not support this position in any way. 
Mr. Clark volunteered to arrange a personal meeting between 
Mr. Colby and an appropriate ~BI official to discuss this 
point, if the Bureau so desired. \ n~,;'
