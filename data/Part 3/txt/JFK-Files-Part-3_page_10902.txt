0 I want to make certain that the activities and the -
functions of the Central Intelligence Agency were care­
fully confined to international matters, to military 
matters, and to matters of national security. We have 
enough pooplo now running around butting into ovorybody 
elsets business in this country without ~stablishing 
another agency to do so.. I 
"What we·ought to do is to eliminate 90 percent of 
the present snoopers instead of adding to them. 
"I do not think it would be the Central Intelligence 
Agency's right, authority, or responsibility to check.on 
the ordinary domestic activities of the average American 
citizen, and yet they could have the power and authority 
to do it under this bill as written." •
