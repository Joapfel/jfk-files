Re:ference is made to your inquiry of 
Mr. Alex Rosen of this Bureau regarding the current 
Cf.unw1nist Party membership of Hunter Pitts O'Dell. 
We have developed evidence through our 
coverage of the activities of the Coz.mmnist Pai~ty, 
USA, which indicates that as of July, 1962, Party 
leaders considered O'Dell to be a member of the 
Puty. 
This in:formation is, of course. highly 
--,sensitive· and confidential.
