• We are, however, vigorously pursuing all leads relating to the 
possession by "The New York Times" and other newspapers of the "McNamara 
Study" and have proposed that the field be authorized to immediately initiate 
interviews with friendly newsmen concerning this matter. We believe this area:

. . We know Ellsberg to have been friendly with a number of individuals connected 
with the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) in Washington, D. C., and evidence 
exists that the IPS has been in possession for some time of documents which may 
be identical with the "McNamara Study. II We have also learned, in tracing the 
development of Ellsbergts thinking from "hawk" to "dove," that from August,
