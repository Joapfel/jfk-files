[rn May, 1961 Fidel Castro offered to exchange a number of 
Cuban prisoners taken during the 4/17/61 invasion attempt, for US 
tractors and spare parts for same. Eliminated from the proposed 
tractor exchange deal were the three leaders of the invasion -
Manuel Artime, Jose San Roman and Rafael Bolivar Fuentes. The 
Cuban Government proposed the exchange of Artime for Francisco 
"The Hook" Molina, a pro-Castro Cuban who had been convicted of 
second-degree murder in NYC. However, this proposed exchange failed 
to materialize and in late March - early April 1962, in Havana, Cuba, 
the prisoners were tried before a 5-man military tribunal and con­
victed. The verdict involved heavy ransoms with the ransom for • 
Artime set at $500,000. Subsequently, the US carried out negotiations 
for release of the prisoners and on 12/23-24/62 they all were air­
lifted to Miami. Artime, the civil representative of the CRC, re­
portedly had emerged as a focal figure in the exile community. At 
a press conference on 12/25/62, he emphasized that all the returned 
prisoners regarded themselves as the "troops of the Revolutionary 
Council." Artime declined to discuss the military aspects of the 
abortive invasion. He said that_.b;e ;ind the other ransomed prisoners V1fu)
