J •• GENERAL FINDINGS 
The study conducted by the Commi±t0a has 
pi-oduced the following significant :findings: 
·(1) There definitely is a -vast potential 
:for collection of foreign intelligence in the u. s. 
available through overt and clandestine channels. 
Even with the available capabilities of existing 
agenc_ies, there is a large reservoir of untapped \. · · 
sourceso "'--
(2) CIA has been authorized by statute 
~nd implementing directives to collect foreign 
intelligence in the U. S.o -'chrough overt methods and 
has been involved in such collection since the 
establishment of the Agency. This includes-review 
of foreign language press and interviews with 
selected individuals such as American b~sinessmen, 
aliens, and students. In addition, CIA has established 
an elaborate system of processing, storing 1 evaluating, 
and disseminating this information. ~ 
. 
(3) Such overt collection by CIA does not 
_present any threat or infringement on FBI jurisdiction 
or operations. The pr.?sent Bureau controls fpr such/ 
CIA activity are satisfacto:ry_o_ : 
(4) We concluded that it would be highly 
undesirable for the Bureau to become responsible for 
• overt collection of foreign intelligence in the U. s. 
The necessary reorganization, expansion of facilities 
and manpower, and heavy task of information collection 
and processing could place a damaging burden on the 
Bureauo 
(5) There has never been.any statutory or 
similar provision for the clandestine development by 
CIA of foreign intelligence in the United States.
