- By memorandum dated 10-4-72, attached, it was • .. 
i~dicated that Fletcher D. Thompson, SAC, Omaha, has suggested 
a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office 
of Public Information or some other more meaningful design~tion.

It was pointed out that Mr. Thompson's suggestion 
was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop) 
NW38608 
have had with members of your staff concerning a possible 
name change for the Division. 
In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that 
he "can think of many reasons for changing the name. 
What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?!' 
With the formation of the Computer systems Division· 
and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and 
the work of the Uniform Crime Reporting Section, including 
the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal 
Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems, 
the title "Crime Records," as Mr. Thompson has indicated, 
is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this 
Di vision is concerned. •, ' 
"Office of ~ubiic Info~mation,
11 
which was 
suggested by Mr. Thompson, would inaccurately reflect 
the activities and responsibilities of this Division 
and could result in confusion with the Office of Public 
Information in the Department of Justice. This, of 
course, would be undesirable.
