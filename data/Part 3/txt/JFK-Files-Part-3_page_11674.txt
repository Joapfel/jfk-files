CONGRESS OF AFRICAN PEOPLES (CAP) 
157-16554 
CAP was formed as an international black separatist 
organization as the result of the convening of the fourth 
annual gathering of black power advocates in the United States 
and Atlanta, Georgia, during September, 1970. The organization, 
which is heavily infiltrated at the leadership level by black 
extremists, advocates the unity of blacks and the .establishment 
of a black nation via the revolutionary ideology of Pan­
Africanism as espoused by CAP supporter and well-known black 
revolutionary, Stokely Carmichael.

CAP is now active in 15 cities across the Nation and 
is vigorously pursuing its objectives in this country as well 
as establishing rapport and lines of communication with black 
groups and individuals abroad. Recent information indicates 
two United States CAP representatives plan a trip in the future 
to Tanzania for the purpose of establishing a CAP organization 
in that ccuntry. 
CAP's domestic extremist element, headed by black 
revolutionaries Haiward Henr~ and LeR~i Jope~~ call for the 
extensive use· of =d1s'fupt:f.onand vi~Fen~f"'necessary, by 
blacks in order to create Independent Black Institutions as 
are necessary to accomplish CAP's revolutionary objectives by 
mass action programs utilizing "direction, dedication, and 
discipline~" 
CAP held a Western Regional Conference in San Diego, 
California, during June, 1971, during which it was recommended 
a national committee be established to consider the possibility 
of establishing a black paramilitary organiza~ion which would 
furnish support in the form of a united front action with all 
"liberation struggles" in the Un·i ted States and_ internationally. 
CAP is currently engaged in efforts at forming an 
all-black political party in the United States to nominate and 
elect black officials at local, state, and, national levels 
who, it is felt, will support CAP's plans at establishing a 
separate black nation. The organization has planned an 
Eastern Regional Conference in Newark, New Jersey, for 
September, 1971, and has tentatively scheduled another inter­
national meeting in early 1972.
