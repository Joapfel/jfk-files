President Kennedy ·wrote a letter to all Ambassadors 
on that particular subject. Now, as I checked around among 
different Ambassadors, a good many of them exercised that 
right under that letter. There were others who simply didn't 
because they didn't think it was worthwhile or necessary, or 
things of that sort. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
MR. GRAY: Now, when the CIA has agents or sources 
I 
of information in this country, whether because they are, let 
us say foreign diplomats, or in situations such as you had in 
the Miami area with the Cuban emigre community, is there 
anyone in a position comparable to that of the Ambassador 
overseas who is outside of CIA and can monitor this day to day 
activity, to your knowledge? 
MR. RUSK: I think not in detail. 
.MR. GRAY: Would you think that there should be? 
MR. RUSK: No more than anyone outside of the 
Department monitored these thousands of cables a day that go 
out of the Department of State. 
MR. GRAY: Would you think that there should be some 
need for supervision of that kind of activity? 
MR. RUSK: Well, it would require one man couldn't 
do it. It would require substantial staff and, well, who is 
that staff? To whom is he going to report? I just don't 
think that is too much of a problem, actually .
