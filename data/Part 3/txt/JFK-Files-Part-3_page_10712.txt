Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups 
\
One of the prime factors in the ~ecision to transfer these r sponsibilities from the 
DID in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communis~ Party activity in the 
, racial area although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such 
incidents after their occurrence. I \ I _ 
Mr. Rosen was opposed to the transfer of the functions in questicn to the 
General Investigative Division in 19 58 and his present position is consistent in that 
he maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan ' and other hate groups are primarily intelligence functions ivhich should be handled 
by tl1e DID as SiJ~':;~~~tBC: !J~:,-I~ I:r. S!.:.l!i-r_r2.!1~ ? !."7 ~ ~cs J:: f s2ls{ ~1,::-t t:-:~ -:,_:.~:?:' .. ~1 :::. ... n

in one division as suggested by Mr. Sullivano Mr. Rosen points out that the

Mr. Rosen and Mr. Sullivan both agree that the investigation of individual 
cases, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the 
General Investigative Division. Mr. Rosen feels that whether subject or victims 
· 1 are Klan members, Communist Party members or completely without organizational 
affiliation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights 
violation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment, 
Bank Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act. . -
Mr. Belmont disagrees with Messrs. Rosen and Sullivan and feels 
that while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative 
to the Domestic Intelligence Divis,ion _is theoretically appealing, it is not a 
practical answer to our problem~. He states that at the tin1e of the 1958 transfer 
of functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the 
activities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire· civil rights field of investigation. 
He feels this argument has even more strength today than ~n 1958, because, over­
whelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with

\ create an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance
