threatened destructive acts might involve solely local offenses, 
e.l., murders of policemen. Title IIi provides for.local 
authorities to use electronic surveillances in such cases. 
Even assuming that there was a case falling outside of 
Title III, but within FRCrP 41, the FBI is still limited t6 
using.search warrants obtained thereunder to seize evidence of 
Federal crimes; if the threatened act is a local violation only 
FRCrP 41 is of no value to the FBI. 
Without a showing of prQbable cause of an ongoing or 
imminent crime, it is doubtful if either Title III or·FRCrP 41 
could be used to secure an ilectronic surveillance. It is belie~e~ 
an ongoing intelligence-gathering electronic surveillance based 
on indications but DOt probable cause, that the target might 
engage in purely domestic criminal activity, for the purpose o= 
thwarting that activity, no matter how potentially destructive, 
-will require enabling legislation. M~. Maroney in his testimony 
before t_he Senate Subcom.mi ttee on Admi:qistrati ve Practice and 
Procedure stated that the Department of Justice was not requesti~~ 
such legislation at that time, but that if it became evident tha~ 
a void clearly detrimental to United States security interests 
had been created by Keith, the Department of Justice will seek 
new.·legislation. 
. Chance for passage of such legislation at thi~ time 
is probably nil.-
