Since 1967 this program has been significantly 
modified in that this vast network of informants have been 
changed from listening posts to individuals who are actively 
seeking extremist information as well as information concerning 
violations of Federal and local statutes. 
' 
We have noted numerous incidents where ghetto 
informants are being converted by the field to regular 
extremist informants in that they have been graduated into 
positions where they can report on a regular basis concerning 
the activities of individual extremists and/or extremist 
organizations. As a valuable by"product we are also achieving 
criminal statistics through contacts with our ghetto informants. 
This program was justified by memorandum dated 7/4/71 from 
G. C. Moore to Mr. C. D. Brennan captioned "Ghetto Informant 
Program, Racial Matters" and is scheduled to be rejustified 
in July, 1972.
