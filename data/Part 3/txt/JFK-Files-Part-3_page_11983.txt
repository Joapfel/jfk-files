3. Since April, 1970, Program has disclosed continuing 
purchases by Soviet nationals of Grundig Satellite Multiband 
portable radios. During 9/70 one KGB officer in Washington 
purchased 30 of these radios at one time. Soviet husband 
and wife illegal team recently in u. s. used one of these 
radios to receive clandestine broadcasts from USSR which con­
tained their operating instructions. Program made it possible 
to secure serial numbers for possible future identification~ 
Analysis of purchase·s enables Laboratory to make reasonable 
estimate of internal communications used at Soviet establishments 
~nd security devices being operated. Program also disclosed type 
of transmitting equipment and antenna system purchased by 
Soviets, apparently for installation at CorailamGeneral in 
San Francisco when that establishment becomes operational. This 
information is of interest not only to FBI Laboratory but to 
State Department and National Security Agency in connection with 
,i~s worldwide coverage of Soviet communications capabilities.
