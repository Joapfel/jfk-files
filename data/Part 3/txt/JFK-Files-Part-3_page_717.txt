After thought, no. Because the paper itself ,vas 
so vile and anti-white that the odor would never 
stop BPP members from reading same. I've ahmys 
hoped that a large segment of the population, 
especially the 11do-goodersrr could or would experience 
the nauseous reaction I have felt after reading the 
illiterate, foul-mouthed, anti-white, anti-Government, 
BPP paper. I think everybody should read a copy of 
the BPP paper s.o that they w·ill know the type and 
character of BPP members. 
What do you think about anonymous letters sent to 
spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping 
with a ,vhite girl, et cetera? 
Most wives of the m·embers I recall were also BPP 
members and/or com1:1on-law-'i.·1ives. Many BPP members 
di.d have liaison with white: girls but I doubt if 
such a letter would bother most spouses of BPP members. 
However, such a letter might be of value under certain 
circumstances, example: the storieq that ·were spread 
during Uorld W2.r II which were not necessarily all true 
regarding Hitler, t1ussolini, General Patton and.others. 
In your opinion ·was the COINTELPRO of any value? 
Should it be changed? _Do you have any suggestions 
for changes, or should it be eliminated completely? 
Yes, as I recall, it acted as a progress letter of the 
BPP, its direction, its dissension, its change in 
leadership, and indications ·of its slow local demise 
because of the character of the local BPP members, and 
as a summary of its activities for.FBIHQ. I recall that
