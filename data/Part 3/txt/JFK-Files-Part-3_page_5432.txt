ANSWER: 
Mr. Kelley, were any of these done in conjunction 
with the CIA? With their knowledge? 
I know of none. Now,· subsequently, perhaps there 
may have been information which did go to them 
but, not insofar as the origin of the information, 
I'm confident of that. We were not in partner­
ship with CIA. 
How about the NSA? Were there any of these break­
ins done to help benefit the NSA in its code­
breaking programs? 
That is a matter which will be developed and will 
be presented and, it's better for them to comment 
then I. 
Mr. Kelley, the Rockefeller Commission report 
said that, in discussing the CIA's mail cover 
operations, said the FBI only learned about this 
about five years after it was in the works. In 
1958, I believe. Mr. Colby's report to the 
President said the FBI knew about it from its 
conception. Which is correct? 
It is my understanding it w~s 1968. 
1958? 
1968. Wait a minute, 1958, 1958. That's right, 
1958. 
Mr. Kelley, in the last 50 years, as I understand 
it from FBI officials, there has never been an 
FBI Agent prosecuted for any kind of corruption 
or crime in connection with his official duties. 
Is there any agreement with the Justice Department 
either in writing or any other kind of agreement 
not to prosecute people who may stray from or • 
commit crimes but, rather to handle it with 
internal discipline? 
Mr. Kelly, spelled K-E-L-L-Y, there .is no such 
agreement. I would .not abide by such an agreement. 
I vehemently oppose any such arrangement and would 
not operate under such arrangement. No, there is 
none. Yes, anyone that, within the FBI, will be 
prosecuted if there is evidence leading to that
