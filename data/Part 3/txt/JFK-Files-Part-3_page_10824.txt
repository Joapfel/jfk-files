a former employee of the Nati'onn.1 Security Agency who was 
a Soviet espionage agent, was thoroughly rovicwod by the 
prcsent.PFIAB in view of the most serious ramifications it 
presented. This case concerned the penetration by the 
Soviets of the National Security Agency. Yhe report which 
emanated from the PFXAB study included proposals which affect 
the responsibilities and activities of several agencies within

were approved by the President and three of these related 
directly to Bureau activity.· They are as follows:
