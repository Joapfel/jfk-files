1 date stamp on the· reverse of the cover sheet indicates it was 
logged in to the Agency on 12 November 1963. The DDP Counter-
intelligence Staff ·liaison office ·received it on 15 November 
1963. The report then went to the counterintelligence office 
of the DDP Special Activities Staff which was then concerned with 
Cuban matters {no date indicated). The registry for the Speci~l 
Activities Staff counterintelligence office handled the· report 
on 21 November 1963. On 22 November 1963, the report was 
ti received by the DDP Counterintelligence Staff special investi­
gations office, presumably because it concerned a former defector 
to the Soviet Union. Apparently it was being processed by that 
office when President Kennedy was assassinated._ Prior to the 
assassination, CIA had no information concerning Oswald's 
activities in New Orleans beyond this report.
