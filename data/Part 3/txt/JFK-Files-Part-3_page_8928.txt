• 
After the completion of the interview, Mrs. Skillman 
advised Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz that the interviewers had 
asked her a great number of questions concerning her knowledge 
of the OC files which she said was very limited, the layout 
of Mr. Hoover's house and the work that Mrs. Skillman and 
Miss Gandy had done at the residence subsequent to Mr. Hoover's 
death. She stated that the interviewers were quite courteous 
and in no way antagonistic. Mr. Mohr requested Mrs. Skillman 
to type up an informal memorandum concerning the interview 
and he indicated that when this was done, he would provide 
a copy to the Bureau. 
ACTION: 
For information.
