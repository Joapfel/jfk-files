In talking with the Attorney General and Assistant AG I; ___. 
r.farshall, ·of the Civil Rights Division, reference was made to our 
earlier conversation concerning/Congressional_requ~sts which had been 
received by the. Director, relating to· all'egecl communist influence in 
~1~.:~·acJ,.?-J-demons..tra:tio_1::1P..•-,rlie-Departi11eut·1·1r original -pos1·t1on was· i n that there was no immediate urgency in i·econtacting .::ienator Honroney, 
/in view of recent contacts had with him by Departmental representatives. 
1Today, I pointed out that these requests should not be allowed to 
t:remain unresolved too long. 
Assistant AG ;,iarshall advised that he had drafted a propose cl 
letter to be used in replying to these Congressional requests, since . 
he had ascertained that a written reply is desired, particularly by· 
Senator Uonrouey. In his letter Marshall proposes to paraphrase the I 
'!President's statement at his press conference on 7/17/63. ?,Iarshall's 
{ letter will, of course, make no reference to the Prenident's state-
i ment, but merely indicate that this is the conclusion, predicated 
» ·upon reports and other information supplied to the Department. 
In those instances where the Department is dealing with a 
. Member of Congress believed to be trustworthy, Marshall plans to 
I 
deliver his letters personally and to explain that the classified 
nature of the reports precludes the furnishing of specific informa­
tion in writing or in testimony. Marshall feels that he can talk 
confidentially in this way to Senator r.Iagnuson and thus forestall any 
·• requests for further information. It was noted that, as a result of 
i/1 the Director's conversation with the Attorney General, Marshall had 
f spoken with Martin Luther King about the clangers of his associating 
• with Stanley Levison and accepting assistance from him. It was, 
·, therefore, believed that since this may get back to I\Iembers of 
if Congress, Marshall should talk with the individual Senators, where 
ll this can be done on a confidential basis:· 
Marshall said he would, of course, keep us ad~i:.e_d ~-f--... the./ .{•.-.-· results of his contacts in this regard. ___ .J:,__ __ _
