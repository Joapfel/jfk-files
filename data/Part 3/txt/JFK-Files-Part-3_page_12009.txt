Reports submitted by the field are"thoroughly 
reviewed at the Seat of Government to insure that essential 
information is being obtained on a timely basis and that 
it is being promptly disseminated in the field, as well as 
at the Seat of Government. 
The Director on 11/27/70 in testimony before the 
Senate Appropriation Committee for the purpose of securing 
additional Special Agents emphasized again the violent and 
revolutionary nature of the Black Panther Party (BPP). He 
testified there has been an alarming increase in the number 
of black extremist attacks against law enforcement officers; 
BPP publications consistently advocate violence, including 
assassination and kidnapings, to achieve overthrow of the 
Establishment; BPP leaders have participa~ed in crimes of 
violence; and Black Panthers have substantial connections 
with hostile foreign elements, notably the communist 
'regime in North Korea and Arab terrorists in Algeria. 
Increas·ing ties between Arab terrorists and Black Panthers, 
according to the Director, raise the ominous possibility 
that militants may seek to ape Arab tactics, including air­
plane hijackings, to gain the release of jailed Panther 
members.
