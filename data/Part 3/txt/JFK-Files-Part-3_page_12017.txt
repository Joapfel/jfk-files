CONGRESS OF AFRICAN PEOPLES (CAP) 
157-16554 
The CAP was formed as an international revolutionary 
organization as the result of the convening of the fourth 
annual gathering of black power advocates in the United States 
in Atlanta, Georgia, September 3-7, 1970. This gathering 
was unique in that it was attended by approximately 2,500 
blacks of so-called moderate and militant persuasion, as well 
as a large number of extremists. Representatives attended 
from 35 states and 21 different nations, including Canada, 
Australia, various independent nations of Africa, and t~e 
Caribbean area. 
A number of the workshops at the CAP were dominated 
by extremist elements who urged thecr-eation of massive coopera­
tive programs and institutions designed to destroy any progress 
made toward integration of the races by complete rejection 
of white society, the formation of a separatist black nation, 
national African parties, and, ultimately, a World African 
Party. 
These objectives are to be achieved through the 
unification, cooperation, and interdependence of blacks. 
wherever they reside, regardless of their "imposedu nationali­
ties, and under the revolutionary ideological banner of 
Pan-Africanism of the well-known black extremist Stokely

tactics against all segments of white-dominated institutions 
and organizations, _including the police and the military. 
Since its founding in Atlanta, CAP has held a 
number of regional meetings in various sections of the 
United States for the purpose of setting up its-national 
organization and in furtherance of its revolutionary programs. 
As a result, CAP is currently activating in at least 17 
different cities with its national headquarters and Chairman
