Senator Huddlesto~. If you found it had b~en taken 
improperly or if some improper action had been taken, would 
it be.put in the files? 
' 
Mr·. Adams ; - If he violated the law, we would have an 
op;en _investiga~ion if it were within our jur~sdication. 
Senator Huddl,eston. .Now the Bureau disseminates this 
information on individuals that is collected in ·various 
ways-1.n-the.various other agencies. 
How ~any other agencies can request, for instance, an 
individual check that. would result iri you~ supplying to him 
information from these -personal-. intelligence files? 
M~. Adams. Every agent in the F~qeral Government under 
the employee security progrcµn there·is an ORligation on the 
part of every government agency to ch-eek with the FBI doing 
name check ?earch qf our files to see if there is any subversiv 
derrogatory inf~rmation which might militate against appointing 
that inqividual to a F~deral position. 
Senator Huddleston. Do.you take any precautions as to 
how they will use that information once it--is SUJ?plied to 
them by your agents~. 
Mr. Adams. All we do is indicate to them on the 
report that it is the property of the FBI and is not to be 
disseminated outside their agency. 
Senator Huddleston. You .. have no way of knowing whether 
or not indeed .it is?
