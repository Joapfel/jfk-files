-Mr. Clifford asked why.·~nd fr6m where was there concern 
over a possible u~2 incident involving Cuba. Mr. McCone sa1d 
that this . vie1,r was held ~\·1 thin the NSC 51+ 12 Grot1p '1i1d in CIA 
Rs well. Mr. McCone said ·that,·,he held 8. ;J:tffercnt vr'e-i-'i but 
he. was ,::11,ray at the time. He.cited as a current example of 
concern attachine, to the possibility qf. U-2 incident~ the fr.1ct 
that today the Sp~cial Group considered a U-2 fltght over the· 
China-India border,. and great concern was expres~icd in tne 
Group because the mission would hav~ ·to inc1ude an overflight 
of Bur~a, ind the prospect of the Burma overflight creating 
a.nether U-2 incident was a matter of cons:tderable sensitivity 
within the Gro~p. 
Mr. ·c•lifford observed that wl1ile this .concern might well 
be underst2.ndable in the case of Burm¥-, he was nev~heless 
unable to understand why ther:e should be a sim11a~-6ncern 
about re2.ction to a U-2 incident 111hich .m:tght arise with respect 
to Cuba. Mr. McCone said th~t such concern with respect to 
C0ba does not exist today_and, as a m~tter of f~ct, on that 
very de.y there were being·conducted ten low-level and 3 U-2 
missions against Cuba. ·'i:: · • • •
