Mr. Seidel: 
J 
NW 313'600 Docld:32989640 271 
other intelligence agencies. I 
like to work within the law and 
to be guided by legislation in 
rriy work. I would, however, hate 
to see such restrictive legislation 
passed that at some time in the 
future when we might be faced 
with violence-prone .organizations 
trying to take control of the 
government 1 we would be unable to 
properly handle our responsibility 
for the internal security of the 
United States. 
T'nank you for your cooperation.
