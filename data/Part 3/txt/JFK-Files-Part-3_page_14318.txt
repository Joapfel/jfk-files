During a, report given at this Boa~d ~eetirig by the 
DCI, Mr. McCqhe urged that the Board urge President Kenne.dy 
to take a6tions (public statem~nts, for example) to correct 
the bad pub.lie image which CIA was acquiring as the result of. 
ch~rg~s that CIA had· engineered the anti-Diem coup in South 
Vie.tnam, and was acting as a "Third .Gpvernment" in t}1a t 
l country .. The DCI asse~ted that the CIA role in Vietnam was 
. not to qverthrow governmerits, but to carry out other tasks. 
Referring to paramilitary operations in Vietnam, the DCI 
, said. that- there were problems involving the question as to 
whether CIA or Special Forces should have the responsibility for 
such activities (Mr. Colby of CIA later told the Board that
