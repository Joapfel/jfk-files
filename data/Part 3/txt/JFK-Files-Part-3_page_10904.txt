National Security Council Intelligence Directive 
No. 1, originally issued 12/12/47, defines the various types 
of intelligence in Section 4. 
(a) National Intelligence is that intelligence 
which is required for the formulation of national security 
policy, concerns more than one department or agency, 
and transcends the exclusive competence of a single 
department or agency. The Director of Central Intelli­
gence shall produce* national intelligence with ·the 
support of the U.S. Intelligence Board. 
(b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence 
_ · .-··which any department or agency requires to execute its own 
~.i_si:; :ion~ 
(c) Interdepartmental Intelligence is integrated 
departmental intelligence which is required by departments 
and agencies of the Government for the execution of their 
missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence 
of a single department or agency to produce. The 
·subcommittee structure of the U. S. Intelligence Board 
m.ay be utilized for the production and dissemination of 
interdepartmental intelligence. 
Director of Central Intelligence is then authorized 
to disseminate national intelligence and interdepartmental 
intelligence provided it is done consistent with statutes and 
Presidential policy, and provided further "that any disclosure 
··of FBI intelligence information shall be cleared with that 
. agency pr.ior to dissemination." .
