question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting that 
information needed for the prevention of violence can be 
acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations. 
As a practical matter, the line between intelligence 
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult 
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may 
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there 
are some fundamental differences between these investigations 
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective 
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a 
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to 
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence 
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows 
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is 
limited and fairly well defined. 
By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of 
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well b 
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the 
Government· has enough information to meet any future crisis 
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it 
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also wheth r 
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the 
means by which the threat will be ca·rried out. The ability 
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on· 
our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,
