The Department of Justice has advised that 
informants may be utilized in furnishing information 
concerning the location of fugitives or the location of 
otheJ:- New Left activists even though such utilization may 
result in the informant inadvertently learning of defense 
plans or strategy. The field has been instructed that when 
an informant is present in a conversation between an attorney 
and an individual under indictment he should, if possible, 
leave, or if this is not possible, he is not to report the 
substance of any such conversation to the FBI. Since radical 
attorneys are deeply involved with New Left extremists, not 
only in their legal defens~ but in their other activities, the 
above procedures are most helpful in extremist investigations. 
Intensified investigation of New Left extremists 
has severely disrupted their operations and limited their 
influence. Numerous Weatherman leaders have been indicted 
and sqQ~eqqently_arrested or remain in fugitive status. 
The Weatherman organization has gone underground and is 
isolated from contact with the mass of American youth. The 
number of adherents to Weatherman is significantly less as a 
result of these prosecutions and investigations. The 
Weatherman group continues to be most dangerous in view of 
its adherence to violent tactics and continuous effort is 
being made to develop new approaches and techniques to 
~acilitate this investigation. 
• Key Activists 
By airtel to all offices dated 10/23/68, the Key 
Activist program was intensified and expanded. The field 
was instructed to maintain high-level informant coverage on 
individuals designated as key activists in the New Left 
movement. At the present time there are 73 key activists 
under investigation.
