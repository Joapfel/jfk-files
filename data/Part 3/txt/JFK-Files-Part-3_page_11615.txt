with State Department, we received concurrence of Secretary 
General U Thant of the United Nations to bar two strong-arm-type 
Cuban intelligence officials from United States territory even 
though neither had ever been in the United States or performed 
any knmvn acts of violence against United States property or 
citizens. Mr. U' Thant pointed out that this was a landmark 
action, as the United States had never before presented a case 
which warranted entry denials in the history of the United Nations.

over 40 in the New York City area since 1967,' is a _very-real
