Council Eor Statehood 
West Palm Beach, Florida 
The Council for Statehood has been found to 
be not an action group but rather a mailing facility 
for the writings o± ~..§=-Wh~W~ON. These writings 
2re disseminated to local and national legislators and 
all are filed with the LibFary of Congress in Washington. 
The dissemi:rr:3:tion of writings by this group has now become 
practically negligible. ·The group is said. to have 
politie;al overtones as:.a republican group. 
It is not recommended that·any positive~ 
harassment activit-ies be undertaken with regard to this 
group at _this time, since such action, in all probability, 
would. enhance the activities of this group rather than 
accomplish t~e d~sired- effect.
