Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
RE: CEN'rRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) EMPLOYEE 
SECRECY AGREEMENTS 
of Sections 793, 794, 798, and 1001. Both Secrecy Agree­
ments also state that the conditions and obligations with 
respect to the protection of classified information con­
tinue after Agency employment has terminated. 
rrhe FBI, of course, utilizes Form FD-291 uEmploy­
ment Agreement,n which has been executed by all current 
employees and must be signed by all new personnel entering 
on duty, to cover the foregoing situation. The "Employment 
Agreement" (copy attached) covers essentially the same 
points noted in the attached CIA Secrecy Agreements. While 
we do not have an exit secrecy agreement signed by the 
terminating employee, Form li'D-193 "Report of Exit and 
Separation" requires (under Paragraph D1 Page 2) that the 
exiting employee be cautioned regarding divulging con­
fidential information and reminded that such improper action 
may violate Department of Justice regulations as well as 
Federal statutes providing for substantial f~nes and lengthy 
imprisonment or both.
