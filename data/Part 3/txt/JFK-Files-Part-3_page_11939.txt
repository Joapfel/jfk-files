Racial intelligence gathered thr ugh our informants 
and investigations makes up a major portion of the Bureau's 
sophisticated document which is disseminated to the • 
White House and other high level Government agencies. This 
document captioned- 11FBI Summary of Extremist Activities" 
furnishes the White House and other agencies with a digest 
of the racial picture. 
The quality of our racial informants can also be 
judged by the fact that since the last Ins·pection, 26 Special 
Agents in various field divisions were recommended for incentive 
awards for their work in developing informat1ts and 15 racial 
informants were given bonus awards for valuable information 
they furnished and.services performed.
