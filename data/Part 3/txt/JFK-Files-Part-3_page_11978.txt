EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM 
Bufile: 105-42300 
This Program originated in 1955 to provide 
internal security safeguards regarding the admission 
of Soviet and satellite nationals. Soviet intelligence 
regards visits of the East-West Exchange Agreement 
participants as opportunities to promote intelligence 
activity.

As a result of the last inspection SAC Letter 70-25 
was prepared which set forth revisions of our investigative 
action in the field. This change was made as a result of 
other manpower commitments. The instructions in that SAC 
Letter provided that no investigations will be conducted 
of groups or individuals participating in the East-West 
Exchange Program in the absence of any information indicating 
affiliation with Soviet intelligence. Bufiles are checked on 
all Soviet participants and where information is developed 
showing intelligence affiliation, cases are then opened and 
the :field is instru~t~d "!:~ C!)nd1-1ct the necessary investigation.

With regard to Soviet exchange students there are 
currently 31 in the United States. Based on information 
furnished by defector sources and investigations of Soviet 
students previously in the United.States,we have determined 
that the Soviet Intelligence Services utilizes these students 
in an intelligence capacity, principally as "spotters." In 
view of this, we afford these students active investigation. 
We have also found that a number of these students return to 
the United States for assignment at one of the Soviet establish­
~ents and in most iµstances, contacts which they made while in 
the United States as students are generally reactivated. For 
example, Mikhail Fomichev, currently assigned to the Soviet 
Mission to the uiiitec1'Nai1ons as a Third Secretary, was in the 
United States as an exchange student tn 1966. Through a defector
