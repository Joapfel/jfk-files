Reference is made to the memorandum of.Mr. Walters to Mr. Felt; 
dated 12/14/72, in captioned mai-ter. A review has been made of the units assigned 
to the Training Division from the former Crime Research Division, particularly 
the Research and Service Section. As you know, the Section Chief of that Section, 
Milton A. Jones, has retired. I believe we can consolidate the Training Programs 
Processing Section and the Research and Service Section at FBI Headquarters 
into one section, calling it the Training Programs Processing and Research Section. 
This would eliminate one section chief. 
As you know, we have recommended and it has been approved that the 
Library in the Crime Research Section be moved to Quantico. It is my proposal 
tl:i.a.t .G1e .::0.1. 11.1.t::.1: Llbi·a.1.·y Unit, wi.1it.L lb 10.ft v.f li. i1c:.n:: ~l FBI Iieadqua1 Le.1.·6, uc: 1ut::.1. bt::"-~ 
with the Research Unit leavi.T1g three units from the for1ner Research and Service 
Section; namely, the Research Unit; Special Productions Unit and Publications 
Unit. • 
I have discussed with Mr. Callahai., the transferring of the Suggestions, 
Forms, Reports Management, 1'Ianuals and Chief Clerk Matters to the Administrative 
Division, and he is agreeable. This would mean an addition to his division of pne 
Special Agent and seven clerical staff. The remainL7.g units presently in the Training 
Division would remain as is. 
This would give the Section Chief of the. Training Division stationed 
at FBI Headquarters a total of 18 Agents and 53 clerks under his supervision. I 
believe that current Section Chief, T. J. Brownfield, is capable of handling this 
assignment as Section Chief, particularly if Mr. Lawrence J. Heim is retained as 
Number One 1'Ian of the Section. Mr. Heim has served as Number One Man in the 
former Research and Service Section of the Crime Rese::).rch DivistQn.
