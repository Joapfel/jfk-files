When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address 
the AFL- O convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad­
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH., 
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the 
matter, might have felt that KINGts making a speech at the 
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH I s pres t:;ige. 
KING delivered a remarkably effective sp~~ech at the 
AFL-CIO convention, and, asa result, received invitations 
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel," 
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding 
·champion of negro rights in the country, KING :is a powerful 
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons 
• of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General 
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need 
KING, particularly in the south, where in cities like Atlanta 
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of 
power, and where KING controls the negro vote. 
JAMES EOFFA~ Teamsters Union 11boss 11 apprecia.teB 
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING 
can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters 
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union, 
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING :l.s being 
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KEJ\11-l"EDY, 
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General :in an 
effort to influence the latter 11to lay off'" HOFFA. IUNG was 
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convir,ced him 
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient., and 
likely to be a 11boomerang, 11 since the Attorney General would 
never accede to such a request, particularly in the •:!ase of 
HOFFA. • 
LEVISON had to steer KING away from anothe'.r politi­
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREJ'IINGER, 
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a 
KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture 
which PREMINGER wouJd direct. Al though PREMINGER' s offer was 
11tempting, 11 since it meant 11fast, easy money" for KING's 
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the 
offer would lower the latter~ prestige. After convincing 
KING of this fact, LEVISON persona~lyjtelephoned to PREMINGER, telling him that 11the deal was off."
