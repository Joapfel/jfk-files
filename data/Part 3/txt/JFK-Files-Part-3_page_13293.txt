544 Camp Street: Is there a CIA connection with Guy Banister? 
With David Ferrie? With other associates of Banister? 
Answer: 
According to CIA records, during 1960 Guy Banister operated a 
private detective agency in New Orleans called Banister and 
Associates. CIA considered contacting him for use as a foreign 
0 
intelligence source and for possible use of his firm for cover 
purposes. However, security investigation revealed derogatory 
information about his professional conduct, and he was not 
contacted. With regard to Mr. Ferrie, Agency files indicate that 
CIA never considered contacting him for any purpose at any time. 
Our record search to date has not revealed any contacts with 
other associates of Guy Banister.
