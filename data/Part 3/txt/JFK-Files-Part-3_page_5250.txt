The whereabouts of the Subject have been unknown since 3/16/67, 
and considerable investigati()n has been conducted to locate 
him. Information was developed in March, 1970, that Subject 
was possibly in Canada and a friend of Subject's mother adv d 
in September, 1970, that the Subject is in Canada, but that his 
mother does not have an address for him. The Subject is re­
ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors 
·-and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present 
• time. 
In view of the above, the following action should be 
promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of 
the Subject: 
1. Prepare a letterhead memorandum, in accordance 
with instructions set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regu­
lations, Part II, Section 4, page 14 (2) (a) I and SAC letter 
#70-27, dated 5/19/70, in order that information regax•ding 
the Subject may be furnished to the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police.
