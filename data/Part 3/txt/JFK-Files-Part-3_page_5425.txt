ANSWER: 
Is that in the foreign field, Mr. Kelley. Is that 
limited to the foreign field when you say such 
activity? 
Yes, sir. Foreign intelligence, counterintelli­
gence, national security, whatever terminology 
you want to use. 
Back prior to 1966, were any of those in say 
organized crime investigations? 
I know of none. 
Would you characterize, Mr. Kelley, what areas they 
were in, please. What areas the pre-1966 burglaries 
took place? Characterize the kinds of investiga­

I can not at this point characterize them because I 
just don't know how they were to be characterized. 
But, it could be that, I would guess, that the 
great majority of them are what we now term counter­
foreign, counterintelligence, or national security. 
I would say that in all probability the geat majority 
of them were in that area. That's where the grave

Have you reviewed them from a legal point of view 
to determine whether any of them at all were con­

a review. 
I wanted to ask you if this goes back to World War

or all of them? 
They will go back to World War II, I'm confident. 
Is it possible to get court authorization by warrant 
or whatever means for surreptitious entry as dis­
tinguished from an ordinary search warrant? 
Inherent in t~e request for a microphone installation 
there is a matter of surreptitious entry. So, therein 
you have a natural concomitant. You do have that
