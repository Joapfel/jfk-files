MR. ADAMS: 
for Boston, for instance, took·place a year in advance, with 
state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice 
and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to 
protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a 
lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government 
had no mechanics which protected people at that- time. 
Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during 
the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it 
a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that 
we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another 
infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member­
ship. 
That's right. 
I believe these are FBI figures or estimates.· That would 
mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point 
was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the 
figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members 
in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an 
awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such 
as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants 
in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it 
just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For 
example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants, 
both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here 
we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone. 
Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters 
and informants at that particular time and I think the figures
