with Jack Mccloy and me and had one or two

briefly when-we visited Dallas. (b) Lewis Nichols, 
former President of the Dallas Bar Association, 
. who called on Oswald in connection with the question ..

Manager 0£ Dallas, who, as such, was in direct over­
all conunand of the police. 
2. Carr also mentioned a black notebook
