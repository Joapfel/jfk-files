in Mexico City under surveillance and pulling the records, and I 
don't w11nt to re11d this into the record bec11use it uses a 
true n4me. 
Let's go off the record. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
Mr. Johnston. Let me read it, except for the true nMle, 
It says "Provided ·-below sufficiently definitive summary 
of local cont11cts of Iv11n Gavrilovich Alferiev.• It gives his 
11 
contacts, it says 23 December 1961 with the Third Secretary of 
,, 
Cuban Cultural Attache, naming her, and arranging a press 
conference for AMLASII, It's a very tangential relationship 
with the AMLASH operation, but again, on November 24th, 1963, 
Mexico City is reporting KGB ••• or·· Alferiev's contacts, and 
it includes a contact in '61 with AMLASH, 
So I have difficulty believing that they are, in hindsight, 
not related, and that on November 24th or November 25th no 
one at CIA related the two events. 
AMLASH Case Officer. What I'm telling you is -- I'm not 
telling you that no one at CIA relates the two events. You 
asked me the specific question, did you and FitzgeraldC::discuss 
any relationship. My answer to you was that Fitzgerald and I 
did not specifically discuss that. 
Mr. Johnston. Do you know of anyone who discussed it? 
AMLASH Case Officer.· No.
