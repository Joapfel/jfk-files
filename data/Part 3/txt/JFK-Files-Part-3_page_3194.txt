that the Bureau in March of 1968 developed information to 
be. given to the press criticizing Dr. King for staying in 
ia.05 
a white-o~med and 9perated hotel, the Holiday Inn in Memphis, 
instead -of the Lorraine. 
At some point during Dr. King's stay in Memphis, he 
moved from the Holiday Inn to Lorraine. 
To your knowledge, Hr. Adams, was that information ever 
given to the press? 
, 
Mr. Adams. I have been unable to determine that. This 
question was raised of me by the Civil Rights .Division of the 
Department. Apparently, they had had some inquiry along 
the same lines several months ago. But my recoll~ction of ~t 
at th: time, we saw that this action had been proposed and 
the memorandum bore the initials, I believe it was the 
initials, statement handled, and the initials of the agent 
in the External Affairs Division who assumed the responsibility 
of saying handle it and initiated it .. 
They cont~cted him and he said that he had no recollectio 
of the matter but the fact that he did say handled didn't 
mean that he was able to do anything with-it. He was just 
. . 
clearing :that memorandum so· it would show action was taken, 
and he doesn't know if he gave it to anyone or not . 
-s~iator.Hart of Colorado . Well, suffice it to say that . . . 
the facts are that subsequent to the time the Bureau d-eveloped 
this information to pass on to the press, it did appear in the
