QUESTION: 
MR. KELLEY: 
• 
You say that it was a matter which was then a violation of the 
law. Within the warrantless wiretaps under ordinary circum­
stances they cpuld conceivably be construed as a violation, but 
under the umbrella of the protection of the country .they have 
been authorized, so I don't subscribe to the _feeling that they 
knowingly, in such an installation, vilated the law with the 
·-
intent to violate the law. 
Mr. Kelley, do you still--does the FBI still--compile personal 
information on the personal behavior of Members of Congress, 
members of the press, and other people? 
The FBI receives a great deal of information from time to time. <.s?- 5? 
We are charged when we have a complaint to write up that 
complaint. We feel that not only are we following the archiva~ 
rules that such must be recorded, but also we feel in discharge 
of our duties we should record it because such information might 
well dovetail wit;ti some investigation that we are condu,cting. 
People come to us to tell about these things for reasons--not 
just to spill out gossip and rumor and to possibly put someone 
on the spot. We inform them, for example, at the time they 
submit this information a record will be made· of this but if it is 
outside the jurisdiction of the FBI we so state. They know before 
they leave, for example, that nothing will be done about it other 
than to record it.
