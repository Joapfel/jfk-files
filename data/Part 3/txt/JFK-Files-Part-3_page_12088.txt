During the reorganization all work as well as cases formerly 
handled in three sections in the Espionage Branch was consolidated into 
two sections. All cases and work formerly handled in two operational 
sections in the Internal Security Branch were spread among three sections 
with the creation of the New Left Section as a separate entity. This 
resulted in additional Agents for New Left work. 
Since 10/31/70 (caseload figures utilized for reorganization 
purposes) Gaseloads in each section have changed as follows: 
Current 
Section 10/31/70 Inspection Net Change 
Espionage 5099 5038 -61 
Racial Intelligence 4948 6642 +1694 
Nationalities Intelligence 3692 3620 -28 
Internal Security 3627 5318 +1691 
New Left 5491 6421 +930

The slight reductions in caseloads in the Espionage and 
Nationalities Intelligence Sections have left the average cases per Agent 
at 280 and 278, respectively, both above the norm of 275 established for 
reorganizational purposes.
