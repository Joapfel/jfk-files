Reporting Procedures 
This program will not require any basic departure 
from our present reporting procedures. The.Bureau should 
not become involved in evaluating, estimating, etc. We 
should endeavor to adhere to our traditional position of 
reporting the facts ~s collected. We may wish to give 
consideration to adding one feature to our regular reporting 
on individuals. This could be an annex for upersonality 
Data." The objective would be to maintain an up-to-date 
book on everything collected relating to the subject's

Language Capabilities 
; 
An expanded program fox collection of foreign 
intelligence would require increased capability to handle 
foreign languages. As explained above, the material 
collected through technical surveillances should be handled 
as communications intelligence, and the major translating 
responsibility woulq, therefore, be placed on NSAo . . -
We do, however, recognize that it is necessary to 
maintain a strong foreign language capability in the field 
wherever it may be useful to develop live sourceso In 
offices such as New _·ork City and Washington, D. C., we 
should expand the number of Agents who are fluent in French, 
Russian, Polish, Czech, German, Chinese; and Spanisho An 
office which is·well equipped with a capability in the 
foregoing is generally able to handl~ most situations which 
arise.
