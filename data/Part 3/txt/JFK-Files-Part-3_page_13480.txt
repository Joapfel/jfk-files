MR. GR.'i\Y: Well, I can speak very frankly. I think th t 
it was more difficult at the beginning of the Nixon Administrati• n 
than it had been in earlier days in having the reports, the 
4 written reports get to the ·Boatd, although I think it fair to

say also that Mr. -Nixon met fairly frequently with the Board. 
MR. BELIN: Did Mr. Johnson meet fairly frequently 
( 
with the Board? 
MRo GRAY: Mr. Johnson, as I recall it, and I am going 
back some years now, and I have not checked the records, I think 
I 
Mr. Johnson met twice with the Board, once for ceremonial 
purposes; that is, picture-taking, and·once for substance. And 
,[ 
General Eisenhower, for whom I was a liaison to the Board, met 
I 
with the Board every three months for two or three hours. 
President Kennedy met almost every time the Board met, which 
was every other month. President Johnson practically not at 
all, and President Nixon quite a good deal.

And we have had 
I 
understandably only one with a President trying to get on top, 
a new President trying to get on top of his job. We did meet 
with him once or twice, I think, as Vice President. 
Well, back to the Board. I think it is true, I think 
it is fair to say that either the Board or the members of the 
Board have been responsible for many of the innovations in the 
Intelligence field which have been vital to our national securit. 
I have in mind the U-2, the reconnaissance satellite program, 
and at least the members of the Board had a good deal to do
