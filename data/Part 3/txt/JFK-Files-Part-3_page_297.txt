SELECT COMMITTEE ON 
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
(SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT 
( SA) LAWRENCE F. WIRICK BY 
SSC STAFF MEMBER 
Seidel: 
Wirick: 
What type of illegal activities and did your program 
in any way instigate iilegal activities on the part 
of the BPPZ 
Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP 
are what I 'Was referring to. I don't believe it was 
ever necessary to instigate. any illegal acts or in 
any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The 
majority of local BPP members were thieves, narcotics 
addicts, lazy, unemployed and were hero worshipers of 
the BPP in Oakland, California. They wanted to emulate 
the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty, 
et cetera, was a constant source of turmoil amongst 
the local group. 
I recall, date unknown, information was received 
regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denman), one time 
head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit 
cards. 
Information was received that Walter Wallace 
(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that 
he and his wife, Velma, were stealing to get money 
for narcotics and that Velma's ~other was also involved 
in local thefts. 
All above information was furnished local law agencies 
and local arrests were made. Furnishing the 
above type of information is a function and responsibility 
of the FBI.
