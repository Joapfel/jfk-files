])ear Sir: 
The Bureau has received inquiries recently concerning ihe 
reliability of the so-called truth serums. The Burea~ is not in 
pos-sess7;on, of any information concerning the use of drugs or 
chemicals which -will compel a person to speak only the truth. The 
Bureau, however, will not tolercte any experiments or participation 
on the part ~fits personnel in the utilization of the so-called 
truth serums or other chemicals alleged to have a similar effect. 
All employees are accordingly cautioned against any participation 
whatsoever in the utilization of truth.serums o~ similar drugs 
in connection ~ith any cases. 
Obviously, great c~iticism would be directed at the Bureau 
if it utilized any element oj'_ this kind in connection witn its 
investigations. ~ly, ¢he Bureau cannot jeopardize its good 
reputation by even considering the utili2ation of such an investiga-
,tive procedure and, consequently, in the event any Bureau agent 
violates these instructions, drastic administrative action will be 
taken. , . . . 
·very truly yours,
