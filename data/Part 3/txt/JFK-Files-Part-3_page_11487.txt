It may be argued that we should concentrate on the reform 
of the intelligence agencies for the future, not on the punish­
ment of individuals for misdeeds of the past. This is a be­
guiling argument. But the truth is that we can ill-afford to 
overlook the lawlessness of the past if we wish to avoid a 
repetition in the future. As two scholars from the Center for 
National Security Studies, Jerry J. Berman and Morton H. Halperin, 
noted in a recent New York Times article: 
One key element in bringing the intelligence 
agencies under democratic control is to insure 
that officials of intelligence agencies are 
prosecuted when ·they viofate the law. Unless 
there is a thorough investigation by an impar­
~ial prosecutor followed by indictments and a 
report, the threat of criminal penalties will 
not deter future abuses. 
I find it utterly deplorable that the President in his 
State of the Union message failed complitely to say even a word 
about the need to make our intelligence agencies obey the law. 
As the journalist Anthony Lewis has commented, 11It is easy to 
denounce priv~~e crime, as Mr. Ford did. But it is more important, 
now, for Government to commit itself to law. 11 
And so I must conclude that, in the present situation, 
resort to a temporary special prosecute~ is both proper and 
necessary. Leon Jaworski, a former Special Prosecutor himself, 
and others in the legal community agree with this conclusion.
