•ork who should be shifted to other work to b~labce your 
assignments. I do not feel that you need two blore men in the 
Special Coordination Unit at this time since increased work 
load considerations due to the additional Legats has not yet 
happened. When and if it does, you should make necessary 
intra-Branch transfers. • 
I agree with your recommended replacements for SAs .Jllf i[ht 
and Quinn; however, replacement for Quin~ should be assigned to 
theRaciai Section and not the Espiona~Section. I am submitting 
separate recommendations regarding this. 
Any further additions to the Racial Intelligence Section 
should be made from within the Espionage Branch from the 
pertinent Sections. 
To recap, I feel as a result of this inspection that your 
present quota of 116 men is adequate. I feel the replacements 
requested are justified but I do not agree with your request 
for 4 additional Agents.

The reorganization was based on memorandum 10/9/70,Sizoo 
·to Brennan, requesting 6 additional Agent Supervisors and 
memorandum 10/14/70, Mr. Felt to Mr. Tolson, denying this 
request. Mr. Felt's memorandum noted there were 18921 cases 
(excludinglarge volume of informants and Communist Party, USA, 
matters) and based on our set up at that time the average case 
load per Agent was 305 in the Internal Security Branch and 225 
in the Espionage Branch. 
Details. of the approach utilized in our reorganization, 
12/16/70, are set for.th in the attachment. With 116 Di vision 
Agent complement and 83 desk agents (same figures utilized 
during current inspectiod we distributed the Division case­
load (22,857 as of 10/31/70, or an average of 275 per desk 
agent) as equitably as possible. This resulted in apportion­
ment of caseload among the six present sections as follows:
