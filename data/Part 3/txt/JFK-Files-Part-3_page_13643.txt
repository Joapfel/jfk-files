Now, I guess my question to you is, how, as case officer, 
did you evaluate his capability? Did you evaluate him as 
someone who could lead a coup and who would, that our government 
could put trust in, faith in in terms of his ability to carry i 
out or not? 
AMLASH Case Officer. At that time we did not evaluate 
him as the leader of a coup. Ha was not our candidate to be 
the next ruler of Cuba. He was only evaluated in our dealings 
with him on the basis of what he and his group could contribute 
to a coup inside Cuba. 
So I don't recall at any time that he was selected or that I 
anybody ever talked of him as the next leader in Cuba. 
Mr. Baron. Wasn't there some thought that he would be a 
good rallying point for strong leaders of a new government in 
I Cuba, that he had an ability to attract good people to work 
him? 
J\MLJ\S11 Case Officer. He had proven this because he had 
with 
I 
I 
been one of the two leaders, or the two top leaders of the i 
Directorado Revolutionario, which is the Revolutionary DirectorJtc 
which is a group not part of the 26th of July Movement, but a I 
separate group, which is he was one of the leaders, and 
i 
25 became a military commander of that group, separate from the 26 :
