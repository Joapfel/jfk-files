MR. BELIN: Secretary Rusk, I want to turn to another 
area now concerning the allegations of assa~ination of foreign 
leaders. 
Were you ever aware of any plans or proposals to 
assassinate any foreign leaders? 
MR. RUSK: No proposal ever came to me seeking my 
approval for a plan to kill anybody. Now, those are not chosen 
words. I mean, no proposal ever came before me, period, 
involving the assassination of a foreign leader, period. Excuse 
me. 
MR. BELIN: Go ahead. 
MR. RUSK: On . the late great Ambassador one occasion, 
Llewellyn Thompson, who ·was then, I believe our representative

16 he had heard that somebody down the line, and he had not 
17 identified the person or the agency, was talking about the 
18 possible assassination effort, and I made it absolutely clear 
19 to him, and he fully agreed, that political assassination was 
20 contrary to the·most elementary notions of American foreign 
21 policy, and that if we go down that trail, we are in the law 
22 of the jungle, and it would be out of control. That was my 
23 personal attitude throughout the period . 
24 On one,other occasion the matter came up in an 
25 indirect form ·which could be, I think, covert.ea by gossip into
