Re: U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO S'IUDY 
GOVE~1EifrAL OPERATIONS UITH RESPECT 
TO IHTELLIGEt;CE ACTIVITIES {SSC) 
The disclosure of the identity of FBI info+mants 
places these informants• lives in serious jeopardy as weil 
as subjecting them and their families to the likelihood of 
embarrassment !Uld harassment within their communities. 
Such disclosures have a most serious and detrimental effect 
on other informants, who have just cause to question the . 
security of their past or present association with the FBI. 
Persons who might otherwise be inclined to furnish information 
to the FB.I, expecting their cooperation to be kept in: 
confidence, are reluctant to do so when they see such 
violations of the sanctity of FBI files and information. 
The FBI has endeavored to cooperate fully and 
candidly in making available to the Committee the documents 
and information requested by the Committee. We have 
insisted that the confidentiality of informants be 
maintained. In viel-t of this most serious breach of the 
confidentiality of information furnished by the FBI to the 
Committee and in an effort to determine the nature of it, 
you are requested to advise whether the U. s. Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence or any member or staff member thereof, 
is responsible for the public disclosure of former FBI 
informc.nt George F. Dorsett as alleged and if so, the b~sis for 
such disclosure. •
