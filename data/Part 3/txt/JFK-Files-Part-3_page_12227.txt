MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING • , 
Pursuant to Director's request Denver District Attorney 
James "Mike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of 
Riha, Czechoslovak-born, naturalized, former professor of Russian 
history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69 
without notifying friends, associates or estranged wife. His 
disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in newspaper 
\ articles by references to Gal ya Tannenbaum, his paramour. McKevi tt 
l stated investigation at standstill, all leads being exhaustedo He 
\ feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed 
j between them prior to his disappearance due to her forging checks . 
J
, l on his account. Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphoma.niac who 
had constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over 
his head to prevent disclosure of ·forgeries. In McKevi tt 1 s opinion 
Riha- is dead since he was close to his friends and if al-:i..ve would 
l contact them. Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual ..
