Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75

• 
SA Andrew J. Duffin, through Mr. Walter Elder, 
CIA Review Staff, on 2/10/76, determined that CIA was 
in fact to participate in an interview of Bauman with 
an SSC Staff Member in the near future. He is to be 
interviewed regarding his prior contact with E. Howard 
Hunt and Project Merry Mack, acronym for CIA's efforts 
to prevent any electronic penetration of their building 
during its construction. CIA hopes that interview will 
negate the necessity of Bauman having to answer SSC 
subpoena, as they feel it will show he will no.t ·il:5e-J the 
"hot" witness that SSC anticipates. 
Subsequently, Hagerty was advised of above and 
that Roberts should not participate in interv·iew, as it 
was an SSC interview and only concerned them and CIA. 
ACTION: 
None. For information.
