WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF fBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) 
EDWARD A: SHEA BY SSC STAFF ME"MBERS 
SA Shea was then asked by Mr. Epstein about a re­
view project he had handled earlier in the year pertaining 
to the Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) in the 
Atlanta Division and what it involved. 
SA Shea mentioned that in approximately the latter 
part of December, 1974, or early January, 1975, he had been 
assigned to handle a project dealing with COINTELPRO in the 
Atlanta Office. 
FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) had sent out communications 
to various field offices around the latter part of December, 
1974, or early January, 1975, relative to the COINTELPRO-Hate 
Groups, Black Nationalist Hate Groups, New Left, and Communist 
Party, U. S. of America (CP,USA). In these communications 
FBIHQ had indicated it was in receipt of a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for documents relating to 
the COINTELPRO. As a result, FBIHQ had reviewed its files 
on COINTELPRO and classified various documents. FBIHQ listed 
these documents tn work papers which were sent out to the 
various field offices, including Atlanta, as enclosures to 
the FBIHQ communications. These work papers listed documents 
that were to be clas-sified in each office and recipients 
were instructed to review the work papers to make sure all 
copies of·these documents classified by FBIHQ were so classi­
fied in the field office files on COINTELPRO. These work 
papers showed the classification assigned to the particular 
document, the identifying number of the classifying officer, 
the exemption category and the date it was classified by 
FBIHQ. 
In addition, these FBIHQ communications instructed 
the recipient field offices to review its various COINTELPRO 
files, such as the ones on the Hate Groups, Black Nationalist 
Hate Groups, etc. to insure that all other documents in these 
files which were classifiable were so classified. These 
were to include memoranda and letters to other offices, etc. 
The office that originated the communication had the re­
sponsibility of notifying other recipients of these 
communications so their copies could also be classified.
