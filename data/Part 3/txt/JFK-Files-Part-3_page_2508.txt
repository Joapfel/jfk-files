Martin then asked whether Joe Purvis was at one 
time the SAC in WFO. This being a matter of public record, 
Moore said that Purvis had peen SAC in WFO. Martin attempted 
to determine Purvis' current whereabouts and Moore could be 
of no assistance as he actually does not know. Moore was 
asked whether Bob Kunkel had replaced Purvis and Moore said 
that he thought he had. Martin then wanted to know who Purvis' 
predecessor was in WFO. ~oore referred Martin to the FBI. 
Accordi~g to Moore, their conversation was cordial but he 
sensed that Martin hung up rather abruptly. Moore indicated 
that he thought that the Bureau would be interested in the. 
foregoing and he said that ~ny similar further inquiries mad~ 
of him would be'similarly reported to us. Moore was thanked 
for br'inging this matter to our attention.
