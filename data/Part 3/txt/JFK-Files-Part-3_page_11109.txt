Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
• 
Because of the White House insistence that all requests 
l
and responses be completely coordinated and available for review 
by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project 
have a se-lf-sustained records facility to insure immediate access 
to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select 
Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI 
documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized 
(excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain 
copies of the sanitized documents but also copies o'f the original 
text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been 
requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project. 
In addition to the above, there will be stenographic 
}
and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the 
work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more 
personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the 
present time. Should the requests of the Select Committees 
require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda wi11 be 
submitted with a complete justification for additional personnel 
ass~gned to the Project. 
Although the physical space for the Project is 
limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75 
will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This 
space is physically located within the Intelligence Division. 
As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter, 
Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should 
any member of the intelligence community get requests from other 
Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence 
community; could be of interest to_ the White House;or are of such 
sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the 
requests and an abstract of the responses should be made 
available to the Interagency Registry. 
ACTION:• 
For information and record purposes.
