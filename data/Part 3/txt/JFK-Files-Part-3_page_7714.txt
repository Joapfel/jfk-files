On 6-10-75, K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Director Sec'y_ 
Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney General, furnished 
Inspector John B. Hotis a copy of a letter from Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) 
to the Attorney General dated 5-28-75, requesting any files or documents' 
in the Department or the FBI concerning five members of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence Activities. The files requested pertain to Senators 
Gary Hart (D-Colo.), Walter D. Huqdleston (D-Ky.), Charles McC. Mathias 
(R-Md.), Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), and Robert Morgan (D-N.C.). 
Senator Church emphasized that the request is made pursuant to Senate 
Resolution 21, which established the Select Committee and not under the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
Mr. O'Connor also provided a draft of a proposed response 
to the Senator's letter by the Attorney General. General Levi pledges 
~ . cooperation in this matter and suggests that the scope of the request should 
~ be clarified. He also states that while the request is not made l'!-nder FOIA, _; 
t § exemptions in the Act indicate the kind of concerns the Committee might 
g ~ ~ want the Department to bring to its attention before disclosure is made. 
iz ~ l;Sl~he implication is that certain information in the files, particularly materials 
8 j~ which would violate individual privacy may be withheld.

It should also be noted that the Attorney General intends to 
advise Senator Church that he is preparing the necessary materials and 
asks for early discussions to determine how best to proceed. Accordingly, 
it is felt that we should pr:omptly review any files that might exist concerning 
each of the above-named Senators and be prepared to furnish appropriate 
information to the Attorney General upon request. /// .., c _,.,.... ~ <-z O tf t~, . "/j "cr/'o.f
