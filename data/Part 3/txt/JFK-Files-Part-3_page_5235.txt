Investigations have developed s~rorig 
indications that there is a loosely • : 
~ Qrganized. movement by registrants, 
to deliberately crowd the court calendars 
in San Francisco to make the reaching 
of any one man as slow as possible. 
This will also give the violator the 
opportunity of getting the indictment 
against him dismissed alleging that 
the defendent cannot receive a speedy 
trial. 
6. The former United States Attorney had 
on his staff an assistant handling 25 
cases who had never served in the Armed 
Forces and was outwardly sympathetic 
towards the Selective Service Act 
violators. The new United States Attorney 
has a gooa·attitude towards the prosecu­
tion of these violators, however,'he·has 
not completely replaced the staff of the 
old United States Attorney. 
A major portion of the Selective 
Service Act violations in the San Francisco Division pertains 
to the inductees failing to step forward to be sworn into 
.the Armed Forces, thereby refusing induction. The Armed 
Forces Examining and Entrance Station located in Oakland, 
•California handles all inductions for Northern California 
.and part of Nevada and handles approximately five per cent 
of all inductions in the United States. 
Approximately 38 per cent of 
all refusals £or induction into the Armed Forces arise at 
Oakland, according to the Department of the Army statistics. 
Mahy registrants £torn all over the United States come to the 
rsan Francisco area for the specific purpose of having their 
:local draft board changed to this area, and after meeting 
all other requirements for induction,.refuse to step forward 
to be inducted knowing that they will have two years or longer 
of freedom due to the slow handling of these cases by the 
Selective Service Board, United States Attorney's Office 
and the courts. San Francisco has several cases where the 
violations are over two years old in which no prosecutive 
action has been taken.
