Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE 
62-116395 
.. 
\
With regard to the origin and disposition of the "Huston Plan," 
we anticipate having an initial paper ready for discuss•ion 
with representatives of the National Security Agency (NSA), 
CIA. and the Department of Justice by Wednesday, 2/5/75. This 
coordination is necessary inasmuch as both CIA and NSA were 
actively involved in the development of the Plan. The 
Department's participation is necessary inasmuch as the Intel-
ligence Evaluation Committee (IEC), chaired by the Department, •· 
evolved from one of the recommendations set out in the "Huston 
Plan." Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney General, 
\
is a member of the Ad Hoc Coorqinating Group for Congressional 
Inquiry and is preparing an input to the "Huston Plan" annex, 
which input will describe the origin, function and disposition 
of the IEC. 
l 
Prior to releasing these two annexes for Mr. Colby's 
use, they will be submitted to the Director for his approval. 
ACTION: 
For information.
