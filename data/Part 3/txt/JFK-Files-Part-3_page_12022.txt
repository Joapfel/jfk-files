charges of inciting to riot and arson, SNCC is presently 
under the titular leadership of William Edward Hunt. 
Hunt also serves as head of the organizatlon'' s Revolutionary 
-Poll'"tical Council. 
H~n¼ has successfully directed the opening of a 
"coffeehousett known as the Third Eye Lounge in Augusta, 
Georgia. This facility, in line with SNCC's historical 
anti-Vietnam War posture, is to serve as a propaganda center 
from which to foment anti-Vietnam War sentiments among black 
military personnel at Fort Gordon, Georgia, as well as among 
the black civilian population in that area. In addition, 
Hunt has initiated publication and distribution of a 
revolutionary news organ known as "National SNCC." Aggressive 
programs are underway to obtain new SNCC activists, and in an 
effort to capture the support of black females, the organization 
recently formed The Third World Women's Alliance under the 
leadership of Fran Beal, a member of SNCC's Revolutionary 
Po~itic~l Council. 
Strong evidence of progress in.connection with the 
organization's plans to initiate guerrilla warfare tactics 
is given by development of recent information indicating Hunt 
and other SNCC leaders are in the process of selecting a 
number of candidates to receive such training in North Korea. 
These individuals, on completion of training, will serve as 
instructors in various parts of the country, thus providing 
·sNCC with a well-trained, hard-core cadre of personnel capable 
of initiating acts of terror against individuals and institu­
tions of Government in furtherance of their revolutionary 
objectives. 
Investigations of SNCC, its leaders, affiliates, 
and their activities continue to receive close supervision. 
Information of pertinence concerning the organization 
continues to be disseminated to the Department and other 
interested Government agencies and officials.
