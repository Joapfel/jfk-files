NW 38608 Docld:32989640 Page 201 
other intelligence agencies. I 
like to work within the law and 
to be guided by legislation in 
my work. I would, however, hate 
to see such restrictive legislation 
passed that at some time in the 
future when we might be faced 
with violence-prone organizations 
trying to take control of the 
government, we would be unable to 
properly handle our responsibility 
for the internal security of the 
United States. 
Thank you for your cooperation.
