Reference is made to my memorandum dated 5/19/75/)/oa~ 
which attached a copy of a letter to the Attorney General , 
dated 5/14/75, from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, 
United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) with appendices 
A thru D. The memorandum noted the ambiguous nature of some 
of the SSC requests and that Mr. K. William O'Conner, Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General, who is the Department of Justice 
coordinator for SSC matters, is presently negotiating the 5/14/75 
requests with the SSC Staff. 
Even though the negotiations are still under way, we :1, 
believe that ultimately we will be required to provide su.bstantia\\~ 
response-s to the 5/14/75 requests. To this end we l':l,s;!,.VE; ):;>E,=ggn J 
to <;rathe:i;.--t;ogethe:i;.-the nece$Sary data-from our. files in anticipa- H 
tion of the substant,ictl responses we will be required to prepcJ,re. i, 
The various requests set forth in the May 14, letter have been 
analyzed and specific assignments made -to prepare responses. The 
primary assignments have been made to representatives of several 
Sections of .. the INTD. It is anticipated that in some circumstances 
it will be necessary for these INTD representatives to convey 
requests for information and material to other Divisions. When 
such action is necessary contact will be effected through the 
designated representatives of the other Headquarters Divisions. 
A list of such other Divisional representatives is maintained 
by the SENSTUDY .Staff on the basis of designations made to assist 
in previous SSC requests, and is set forth below.
