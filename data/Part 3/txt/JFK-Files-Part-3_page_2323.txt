Ml;:)morandum to Mr. Ad.ams 
Re: Senate Select Committee 
t 
Mr. Conrad was cordial and said he understood fully that 
I was not in a position to furnish him legal advice. I suggested that he 
contact the Bureau prior to his appearance for the interview in order to be 
advised formally as to his release from the Bureau employment agreement 
concerning secrecy and he agreed. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
For information.
