that our record in this regard has been outstanding over· 
the years .. 
Any efficient investigative agency needs sources 
of al_l categories ~'"ld we a.re no ei.:ception.. Therefore, we 
should continue our present program of general source 
development, and this would include contacts who can 
produce information on an occasional basis or who-might 
be in a position to be of assistance in a particular 
investigation. In diplo~atic establishments the reception 
clerk,. chauffeur, the maid, _can always be of assistance~ 
However, the prinary emphasis of this new program. 
·would be directed toward high quality sources, such as: 
1) Code clerks 
2) Officials uho have access to files, records, 
or communications 
3) Officials or employees who are in·a position 
to penetrate communist-bloc circles or establishments 
4) Members of foreign intelligence and security 
services. 
Our existing programs of seeking penetrations in
