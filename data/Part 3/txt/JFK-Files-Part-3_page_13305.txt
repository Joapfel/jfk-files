Does CIA have files with references to Oswald or his family 
other than CD692? 
Answer: 
CIA had only one general file on Oswald at the time of the 
assassination. That file had been opened as a result of 
Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union. At the time of the 
• assassination the Warren Commission reviewed and received a 
copy of that file in its entirety. As the Agency continued 
to cooperate with the Commission, the Oswald file grew. It 
numbers 58 volumes now and contains all information in 
possession of the Agency on Oswald_ or his family. 
The single exception to the above ~tatement concerns one 
HTLINGUAL document dated 8 July 1961 but discovered only on 
review triggered by press publicity following the Oswalds' 
return to the U. S. in June 1962. The sensitivity of this 
intelligence precluded its inclusion in the Oswald file in 
general circulation. However, a copy of the document was 
forwarded to the FBI immediately upon discovery. (Also see 
question concerning Marina Oswald keyed top. 14 of Mr. Hoch's 
memorandum.)
