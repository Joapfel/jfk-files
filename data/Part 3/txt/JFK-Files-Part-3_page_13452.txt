very hard to find it, and it is entirely possible that whatever 
the instructions might have been -_.that there might have been 
something lying around and somebody didn't transmit it. ·, ··,-, :,,_::·: 
Whether this was simply through bureauciatic clumsiness or 
whether it was through indiscipline, I just can't say~ 
.MR. GRAY: Mr. Secretary, one point that came up last 
riight was the question of oversight df CIA.coll~ctiorifefforts. 
Now, the covert action is supervised by what was then the 303 
Committee, and you testified that some sensitive or potentially 
risky types of collections were presented to you and o.ther 
members of the Administration. 
What about the day to day overseas collection by 
clandestine techniques, is there any supervision outside of the 
CIA of that? 
MR. RUSK: I don't believe that it is necessary for 
the President and Cabinet officers to get into the details of 
J 
collection, unless they involve methods and techniques which 
could raise major issues of policy. 
In other words, I don't think we need to know who are 
the agents and things of that sort. I do think that the 
Director of the CIA ought to be in charge of his own shop, and 
I ought to think that each one of our Arabassadors abroad ought 
to have complete access to whatever is being done in the country 
to which they are assigned by any representative of the United 
States government.
