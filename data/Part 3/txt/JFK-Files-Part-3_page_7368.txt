A: I cannot actually recall. 
Q: Was it still going on when you left the Bureau?

or Levison? 
A: No.

what electronic surveillance did it have of King, SCLC, or Levison? 
A: Throughtout my entire period as agent in Atlanta I never had any informa­
tion as to what electronic surveillance may have been conducted by the Atlanta 
Police Department. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC, 
Levison there was no discussion to my knowledge of these matters with the 
Atlanta Police Department. Gene~ally speaking the rapport with the police 
department was good.

A: No. 
Q: What squad were you assigned to in the Atlanta Office?
