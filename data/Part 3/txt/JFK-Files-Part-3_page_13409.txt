gathering has to do with getting materials that ·:are in the 
public sector, publications from all over the world including 
the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the 
sheer management analysis of the information· that is available 
in the public sector is a massive problem. 
Now, the processes by which that mass is reduced to 
some estimates or.·• judgments are very important. To some extent, 
policy officers.are the prisoners of the information they have

1968, Russian forces went into Czechoslovakia. We thought later 
that we had lea~ned that the Russians had made that decision on 
-
the preceeding Saturday night, three days earlier, Sunday, 
Monday, Tuesday. 
Now, if we had asked our intelligence community before 
that Saturday night whether or not the Russians were going into 
c~echoslovakia, there is no way they could know, because the 
Russians didn't know. I mean, I used to smile occasionally at 
the enormous effort made by foreign people, foreign governments,
