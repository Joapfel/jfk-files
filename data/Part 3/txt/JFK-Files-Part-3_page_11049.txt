\ ., 
Referring to our holding in Davis that the 
"sour~e of the chill" is important in dctern1ining whether 
there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First 
Amendment rights, ·we think :hat there is a significant 
difference betwe~n investigative actions taken by a 
military agency in reference to civilin.ns and similar 
• 17-1-vestigati ve actions taken by a regular investigative 
agency of a civilian bran~h of the Government. . .... • .. 
·--:. 
One of the functions of a civilian investigative 
agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is 
to compile information onrlaw violators, agitators of 
violen·ce, and possible ·subversives. It has always been 
recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is 
exercised lm.der the direction of the Attorney General.

As·to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of 
1nfor1nants 1 it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionab-le. 
See Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E. D. Va.. 1971) "(police 
surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment 
rights). 
The Si1preme Court in Hoffa v. U.S .. 385 U.S. 293 (19GG), held. 
. that the use of secret informants is "not per sc unconstitutional", and docs 
not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against· scJ£-i11crimination, nor 
the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable uriclcr the Fom·th Amendment, 
admission nt trial of cvic!cncc oVainecl by an undercover informant to whom 
a defendant spoke without knowlcclµ;c that he was in the employ of the police. 
385 U.S. at 300-303. Sec also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 20G (lDGG) and 
Lopez v. U.S., 373 U.S. 427 (18G3) .•
