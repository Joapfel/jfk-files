Polish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovakian nnd other communist-bloc 
countries. For instance, it the Cuban field on several occasions, 
FBI informants have been abl'0 to develop high-level or current • 
intelligence regarding conditions in Cuba, and policies of the 
Castro regime through personal contacts with ranking __ Cuban officials 
both in the u.s. and abroad. ,. 
. . , . 
Through our coverage of the Cor,,.munist Party, USA, and 
related organizations v,e have also frequently _produced foreign 
intelligence, ~lthough to~ lessor extent than in our operations in 
the foreign nationality field. One of our best sources of foreign 
intelligence in.th0 domestic area is our so-caUed ~~ __ 
wherein we have info:.:-raants acting in a 'capa-city between the 
Communist Party, USA, and fo:.:-eign COilli7.Unist groups, i:1.cluding thG 
Co:m.munist ~Pa1 .. ty of the Soviet Union. '\'le have developed information 
through this operation regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute, social 
a,nd politic::i.l conditions in various countries, both in and outside 
the Soviet bloc, and tactics of the international communist movement. 
6. Additional Potential 
, As indicated in the foregoini subsections, the Bureau is 
currently p:-od1.:cing a considor~bJ.e v~')li..11;1e, of foreign intelligence 
through cover·t t.10:..:.:s, tiuch of it of a significant nature. Most of 
'tnis an."Ca is an ou·i;g: .. eowi:n ui: .i.H.tvJ.·iuct.ui..::., t~cli;.•,i.:,;:;,,l {:.0v~zz..r;o ;:;,nd 
investig~tive prograns tn.rgcted. prirnax·ily to fulfill our internal 
security and cou~te=intellige~ce objectives and relatively speaking 9 
we have co:ru..":li tted only a small perc0:.~-'.:r:g0 of our assets cxclusi vcly 
in the direction of foreign intellige~ce. 
It is believed that the Burc~u possesses considerable 
potential for the development of fo~eign intelligence which could 
be realized wi ~h a fairly modest e:-:pendi tur0 of manpower and costs 
if we were to m:i.ke foreign intelligc.1ce collection a primn.ry aim~ 
For e:-::aL>ple, with existing eq_u:Lpracnt: and facilities, we could 
·expand our technical cover~ge of foreign cstablish;~ents to includ0 
additional 30 to 40 foreign ostablishments provided we could assign 
about 25 additional personnel to this field. With the assignocnt 
of an additional 75 to 100 Agents, ~e could greatly intensify our 
, foreign intelligence collection through live informants, prim~rily
