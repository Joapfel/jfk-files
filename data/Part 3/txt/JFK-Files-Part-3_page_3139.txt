evidence, and I have no reason to believe that there would be 
any evidence that the Bureau initiated these programs other than 
as an internal decision. 
Senator Tower. Well, were reports on these programs made 
to the Attor~ey General? Was he informed of them? Was he kept 
informed on a continuing basis? 
Mr. Adams. He was kept informed by letters, which again 
the staff·has alluded to, letters reporting certain developments 
For instance, one of them that went to one Attorney General, 
lO reading of that letter outlined almost in complete detail Klan 
11 activities~ .activities taken to disrupt the Klan. It used

Senator Tower. How is it that you came to believe that yo 
had the authority to neutralize or disrupt these organizations 
rather than proceed against them frontally through p~osecuting 
them for law violations? 
Mr. Adams. I.guess you would have to say, in a position 
,like this, that it is just like the Smith Act of 1940, which is 
designed to prevent revolutiona;y groups .from advocating the 
overthrow of the Government, and.then subsequent.interpretations 
as .to the constitutionality of .it.leaves .us with a statute 
still .on the books .that proscribes .certain actions, but yet the 
degree of proof necessary to operate under the few remaining· 
areas is such that there was no satisfactory way to proceed,
