most part concerned itself with administrative matters affecting 
CIA and the necessity for reorgan~zation within that Agency. It 
notes, however, that the National Security Act, as implemented 
,by directives of the NSC, imposed upon CIA respon~ibility for 
carrying o~t three essential functions: 
(l) The coordination of intelligence activities. 
(2) The correlation and evaluation of intelligence 
relating to the national security, which has been interpreted 
by directive as meaning the production* of national intelligence.
