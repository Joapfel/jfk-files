On October 3, 1969, the Salt Lake City Office sent an 
anonymous letter to,James Lucien Bever, President of the University 
of Utah chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) 
alleging that Larry Hammel, a Unhrersity of Utah stud~nt leader 
devoted to SDS, was an info1"mant. On October 1, 11}69, Bever 
appearoo at an SDS rneeting and confronted Ha;mmel. Bever announced 
that he received information that Hammel was a traitor to :SOS prin­
ciples and an informant for the "Feds. tt 
The above resulted in considerable dissension among 
SDS adherents at that meeting and in future meetings. Hammel's 
loyalty to ros remained in doubt even though he attempted to refute 
the attack. Shortly after the above action SDS became totally 
inactive at the University of Utah.
