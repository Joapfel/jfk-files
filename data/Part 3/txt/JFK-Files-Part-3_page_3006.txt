Senator Huddleston~ Now, the Committee has received 
documents which indicated that in one situation the- f'.BI assi.ste 
an informant who had been established in a white hate group 
to es~ablish a rival white hate group, and that the Bureau paid 
his expenses in setting u~ t~is rival organization. 
Now, does.this not put the Bureau in a position of bei~g 
responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might 
have undertaken? 
Mr. Adams. I'd like to see if qne of the other gentlemen 
knows that specific case, because I don't think we set up a 
spec,~fic group. 
This is Joe Deegan. 
Mr. Deegan. Senator, it's my understanding that the 
informant we're talking about decided to break off from the 
group he was with. He was with t};)e Macon Klan group ot 
the United Klans of America, and he decided.to break off. This 
was in compliance with our regulations_. His breaking off, 
we did not pay him to set up the organization. He did it 
on his own .. We paid him for the information he furnished 
us concerning the operat~on. We did not sponsor the organiza­
tion. 
Senator Huddleston. Concerning the new organization that 
he set up, he continued to advise you o: the activities of that 
organization? 
Mr. Deegan .. He continued to advj,:~ us of that organizatio
