United Florida Ku Klux Klan 
Sebring Klave:rn 
Through recent infor~ation f~rnished by M!14'=8;2..;;.R, 
it is nqted that the Sebring Klavern is apparently dying 
out. .f1.ttendance at the:.weekly r.1eetings has .been very poor 
with a maximum of 3 to 4 in attendance. On the last two 
scneduled meeting dates, ;ch,e only ones presen·t were the 
Exalted fycJ:ops,,, -CHitRLES~FR-lTZ•·. ·and llfM 842-R"'. 
. /,\ . 
In vievi · of the above, the Seb:r~ing Klav-ern w-1·11 
probably beco:me·inactive in the very near future. It is 
felt that any counterintelligence move at the present time 
~ould possibly result in a renewed interest and regrouping 
by the members rather than the-desired results. 
Should the Sebring Klavern not disband in the near 
futu?e, it is then felt that information could be confi­
dentially furnished to Highlands County Sh-er-iff -BROii--ARD=. COKER."' 
Sebri~g, as to time, -date and location of the Ku Klux Klan 
mee~1ngs. Sheriff~s Department patrol cars could patrol the 
area in an obvious fashion in.order to disrupt the meetings 
and c;J.use concern among those in attendance. 
Sh-~l•lff· C-01£:E;l has been very cooperative and has 
reflected a distaste for any Ku Klux Klan activity in his 
county. It'is not felt that &he~~G0~ER---would in any 
way reveal the Bureau"s interest or betray our confidence. 
It is felt that counterintelligence contact w~~~ 
the S~~ring press would be unwise.
