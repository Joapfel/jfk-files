SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
~ MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF GHETTO INFORMANTS 
~l} 
lffJ.f]b_1_0R EDWARDS. MILLER: Since the implementation 
w.Y I of the Ghetto Informant 
P gram in 1967, it has developed into a productive so~rce of 
accomplishments for the Bureau. Experience has shown that.in 
addition to being mere listening posts for black extremist 
action, these informants, when motivated by specific assign­
ments, also furnish valuable criminal information~ As a 
result of conferences held at the Seat of Government, ·the 
field was instructed in March, 1970, to give more positive 
assignments to ghetto informants. The Director noted, "This 
is most important." 
. The number of ghetto·informants now stands at more 
than p .. ,.2PPai and it is essential that we continually make certain 
we are achieving maximum results from this vast reservoir of 
information. It is believed one additional step toward this 
goal would be the giving of more specific assignments to these 
ghe:~:::tv iilfOl"illauts, ~speci~lly cc~~a~r;.i~g ~:!.~~!: o~~trc:~ist-s ~. -· 
living in their locality, such as subjects on the Security 
Index and selected Agitator Index subjects with extremist 
tendencies. Such assignments would include the development 
of detailed information concerning black extremist targets 
such as data relating to their daily activities, sources of income, 
and information as to whether the black extremi~ts are operating 
,in violation of Federal or local statutes~ Ghetto informants 
would be assigned to black extremist targets with whom they are 
acquainted or who reside or work in the same area. It is also 
probable that in many instances ghetto informants could also 
be targeted against similar subjects of interest to the New 
Left Program. 
Based on our experience to date, there appears to 
be little doubt but what these additional specific assignments, 
if fully implemented throughout the field, would not only 
increase our intelli_gence coverage of black extremists, but 
could also be the vehicle for putting more of these militants 
in jai·l on criminal charges. The success of this approach 
would, of course, be commensurate with the enthusiasm of the 
individual Agents in the field and it is necessary that pressure 
be kept on it. A suggested means for checking on the Program's 
progress at the Seat of Government would be to amend Form 
FD-405 under the heading "Racial Informant Accomplishments" 
to require the field to specifically list major accomplishments 
attributable to ghetto informants during the previous month.
