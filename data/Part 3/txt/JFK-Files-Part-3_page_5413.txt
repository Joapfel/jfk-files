QUESTION: 
NEWS' CONFERENCE OF CLARENCE M. KELL~Y 
DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
JULY 14, 1975 
Good morning. a I have very few statements to make as. 
an opening. I just want to say that this is a further 
attempt on my part to be a little more available. 
Frankly, it is something which I hope we can continue 
and I.have not in the past been premeqitatively evasive 
nor reluctant to appear before you. But, frankly, I've 
been pretty busy with a number of other things. I want to 
let you know that we're continuing our efforts to try to 
improve the rapport petween us. We will continue to do 
some things and hopefully, in the future we can get together 
more frequently on the basis of some of our past meetings 
which I think have been very fruitful. So now I'll throw 
it open for questions and these lights are a little.bit 
strong but I'll try to be able to identify you. Do you 
\ 
have any questions? 
Do you have any evidence, Sir, or an~ information leading 
you to suspect any CIA Agents have been planted in any man­
ner or form in any executive ag~ncies for the purpose of 
... transmitting· evidence back to the CIA about that agency? 
I have no evidence whatsoever brought to my attention 
and I certainly know of none. 
Sir, do you have ongoing programs trying to check out 
that sort of thing? Do you look for it?
