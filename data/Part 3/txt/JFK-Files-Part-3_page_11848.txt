I Research Branch are accepted to meet an emergency situation 
(McLek case) but these reductions are not considered consistent 
with adequate supervision nor offer necessary flexibility within 
Sections tq meet emergencies and specials as they arise when 
viewed in terms of an extended period of time. It is expected 
the Mc~ek case, as with all specials, will ultimately wind down. 
At that time and as personnel are available for reallocation, 
appropriate recommendations will be made and considered within 
the Division as to their commitment based on work loads at the 
time consistent with the overall needs of the Division. 
Supervisory case Load Averages

It must be borne in mind the "Add or Delete·" column 
pertains only to supervisors now included in case count 
computations as being assigned to regular case load duties and 
does not i;:o-ntray total movement as recommended. Some of those 
included in the recommendations are already on special assignment 
(McLek, etc.).· For example, Extremist Intelligence and New Left 
S~ctions will merely make permanent the personnel on loan to 
McLek and, therefore, are listed as zero. Espionage will get a 
man back and is listed as +l.
