not been located for interview, you should consider placing 
name stops in the Identification Division so that if these 
persons are arrested or an inquiry is made by local law 
enforcement authorities this fact will be immediately brought 
to the attention of the Bureau. In addition, a stop file is 
now being set up by the NCIC Unit for persons other than 
fugitives concerning whom the Bureau has an interest. This 
file will require, in addition to the name and birth date of 
the individual, as many other items of identification as

the Identification Division and the NCIC Unit on these persons.
