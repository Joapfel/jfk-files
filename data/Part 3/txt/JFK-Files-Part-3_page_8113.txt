_ -· ✓- My -memorandum of March 19, 1975, reported discussions Cl l 
with the attorney for the estate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , who "'' 
also represents Mrs. Coretta King and her children.' ·It was clearly t \\ 
indicated that Mrs. King and her children were concerned about invasion \.\ 
~ I of personal privacy_ that might occur should there be disclosure of inquiries ~. 
~ concerning the FBI investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the 
~: • ·----~[ conclusion of our confereD;ce with the King representatives, Assistant • -~ 
wJ El Attorney General Scalia asked me whether I would be willing to agree to 
~ ~ have Mr. Wachtel notified in the event a congressional committee requested 
~ t:.:.. ~ access to such material in Bureau files. I told him that I saw no difficulty ~ 
~ ~ ~ in the Department advising Mr. Wachtel in the event such a request is made ~ 
c.., U:: ... _ by a committee of the Congress. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
~ ~ i<:.: Activities has initiated inquiries concerning the Bureau's inv_estigation of ~ 
.= c:.5 Dr. King and though they have not as yet requested material from our files ~ 
~ ~- ~which niay contain tapes of electrunic surveillance of Dr. -King, it is likely ~~ 
2L~ -:' ~, that tb.eir inquiry will reach the stage where such demands will be made. ~
