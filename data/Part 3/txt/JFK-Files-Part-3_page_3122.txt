has repond~d to public expectations and from pressure_ from 
~ ~igher authority in government. 
While thts does-nqt excuse what happened, we should 
temper our ·criticism ~f the FB~'s excesses by unders~anding tha 
in large part it was only the instrument of our own intolerance 
Indeed, _I b~lieve tjlat is _why our laws and the· cha1:ter of the 
FBI_ must·be carefully redrawn to protect the FBI's integrity 
from political pressures and hysteria. 
Finally, it would be a mistake to rE:-_gard the abuses 
. . 
of the-FBI as those of evil .men. The FBI has always been 
composed of dedicated and hard-working public servants who 
seek to do their jobs as best they -can. The 1-es~on w-e learn 
from this history is that we cannot keep our libarty secure. 
by relying alone .. on the good faith of men with great powei::. 
As . Mr. Justice.· Brandeis once wrote: 
11Expe~~ence should teach us to be mos1: on guard to 
protect liber.ty when government's purposes are beneficient. 
The greatest dang~rs to liberty lurk in the insidious 
encroacru~ent of men of zeal, well~meaning bu~ without 
unders'!:andinga" 
It is· _my hope that the FBI wi·tnesses we- will hear today 
can enlighten us as to how it can conduct.internal security 
survsillance programs which do no.t infringe on our 
constitutional liberties. I- hope they can suggest iron-clad 
assurances that the abus~s of the past will not be repeated.
