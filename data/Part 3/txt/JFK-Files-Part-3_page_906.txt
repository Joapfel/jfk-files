"T.he_ Attorney General 
A major thrust of Professor Elliff's p1.1per concerned FBI :mthority 
derived froin legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Prosidential 
directives. beginning with a directive issued by President Roosevelt in 
September. 1939. Profossor Elliff is of the opinion that the 1939 directive. 
which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions., was magnified by the 
FBI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type 
investigatio115. 
Senator Sam J. Ervin~ as you know. had been probing into the 
nature and extent of FBI intelligence-type investigations. Senator Ervin had 
even announced that he intended to pi-opoae legislation to prohibit the FBI 
from investigating any person without that individual's consent, unless the 
Government has reason to believe that person .has committed a. c1•ime or is 
about to commit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar interest 
in FBI investigative activ"ities. 
Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly ove1~ a 
long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field 
are authorized under legislative enactments, Presidentio.l directives , and 
instructions of the Attorney Genei•al. The Presidential directives are obviously 
the 1) directive dated September 6, 1939, filld reiterated January 8, 1943; 
July 24, 1950; and December 15, 1953, and 2) Executive Order 10450 dated 
Ap1·il 27. 1953 (and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order 
11605 dated July 2, 1971). 
In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated 
September 6. 1939, and considering that the subsequent directives are all 
hinged on that one~ we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent 
of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the .FBI by these directives. It 
appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FBI to handle 
espionage. sabotage. and neutrality matters. it did not convey any authority 
or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already have from legislative enactments. 
It is difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which follovrnd any 
authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations which would o:;.-could 
not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.
