I says, "Well, there are several ways; No. 1, the person would eventually 
be reported mis-s~ing; No. 2, I will cut off his ear or his- finger and give 
it to you." I says, "because there won't be no body to recover." r told 
him -- he says how would you do it? T says "well, I could go the 
Everglades;:I could dig a hole and put lye in it--th_e lye will eat up his 
body; I could take an airplane and fly over the gulfstream and r could 
dump him in the gulfstream weighted down -- l would have to cut his 
stomach and his- intestines so that he wouldn 1t float. Even weighted 
down, a body will float unless you cut open the insides of his stomach 
and intestines'.' " Or, t says, "I could go with a boat out into the guif­
stream and use explosives in order to destroy the body- completely-." 
OLSEN: Did you know. at that time where this assassination attempt 
was to be tmdertaken in Florida? 
STURGIS: No, sir; r again --knowing how agents work because I 
in turn have trained some people as far as intelligence was concerned; 
there is such a thing called compartmentation, and even though r was willing 
to go on this assas-sinati_on,at that time I did not want to know who the 
person was in case if l did not do the assassination and someone else did 
the assassination, at least if it was uncovered that I would not be brought 
in as some on~h~new of the conspiracy to assassinate someone here if it was 
in the United States or a foreign country-. 
OLSEN: Frank, did anything further transpire about this assassination? 
Other than this second conversation with Barker? 
STURGIS: No, sir. Nothing came about because I nailed him to the 
wall, telling Barker that l would want someone much higher than he who would 
identify himself, his position with the company, and then I would do the 
operation.
