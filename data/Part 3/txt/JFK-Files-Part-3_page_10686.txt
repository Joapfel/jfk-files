sideration be given to contacting officials of the Arlington

ment for an official investigation of ANP premises .. 
Furthermore., in this regard it is believed that if

there •,.;ould be an expose of. the true· conditions of the ANP., 
resulting in public criticism of -BGU-h~J§'hk Also., the publicity
