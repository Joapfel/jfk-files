haven't covered with you, I could call you and give you that information.

OLSEN: Good. I want you to know that we appreciate very much 
; 
your willingness to come up here to Washington from Florida and to spend 
the time that you have with us. I have given you a letter, I think 
already, the original of which was sent to your address in Miami, 
covering the matter of reimbursement of your travel expenses and per diem 
for the time that you have been with us. If there is nothing else on 
the subject now, let's conclude the interview at this point. And I want 
to assure you again that if you wish, you will have an opportunity to 
read the transcript of this interview and to make any corrections that 
you feel should be made, either because the thing has not been transcribed 
correctly or because you may have made a mistake in your recollection and 
you want to correct the record on that score. YOu \·ill be given a chance 
to do that. We will not, however, be able to send the transcript to 
Miami to you because of the fact that much of the information that you 
have talked about is almost certain to be classifed. You will not be 
given a copy of the transcript. But as I say, you will be given an 
opportunity to read it and to make any corrections. Is there anythlng 
else that you would like to ask us, or that you would like to offer at 
this time? 
STURGIS: Well, thank you. I believe we have covered a good period 
of my life and my association with the company; and I want to thank you 
for being so kind·both to my friend and myself. And anything I can du 
now or in the future, I'm at your disposal.
