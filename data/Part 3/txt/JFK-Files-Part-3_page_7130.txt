Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
I have attempted to reconstruct the events in 
my own mind as well as to view other activities that 
tr.anspired during the approximately eight years of my 
liaison assignment. In all honesty I cannot recall any 
case wherein I was requested or instructed to make an 
arrangement with CIA without making a specific record of 
it in Bureau files. 
ACTION: 
For information and record purposes.
