contacted Jack Fuller, supra, concerning this matter and 
.. 
Mr. Fuller requested that we select six individuals who had

information for possible use at an Ex~cutive Session of the 
SSC. On 10/20/75, Mr .. Dave Lohman, NSA, advised Stiperv,isor 
J. P. Thomas, 11ITD, that NSA was aware that we were going 
to receive this request; that there was no need, from NSA1 s 
standpoint, for classification of response merely becaus~ 
it stated that certain persons ·were on the Watch List. He 
stated NSA intended to tell the SSC the number of requests 
it had1received from other agencies, including FBI, to put 
... 
names on the Watch List but that NSA had told Jack Marsh, supra, 
that specific names would have to be furnished by the agencies
