think it might be well --
MR. KIRKLAND: It is true that it is a very important 
operation. 
MR. 'RUSK: It is, and I tried to strengthen it in 
some respects when I was there. I think also the ·Inspector 
( 
General of it or the Inspectors of the State Department ought 
to check when they make their visits to Embassies, check with 
the Ambassadors on the extent to which he is fully in charge 
of all activities by all officials of the American government, 
whatever their agency or department in his own Embassy in.the 
country.to which he is assigned, and that this letter of 
President Kennedy's, which is a matter of public record, should 
be emphasized so that if anything does go wrong, it is the­
Ambassador who is held responsible in the first instance. 
MR. BELIN: That assumes the Ambassador will be 
tight-lipped on all occasions, I assume? 
MR. RUSK: Would be what? 
.... 
MR. BELIN: Tight-lipped at all times? 
MR. RUSK: Yes, but I think on matters of this 
20 sort he is likely to be, because of the consequences of his 
21 not being, at least· in the country where he is assigned. 
22 MR. BELIN: Any other comments1that you would like 
23 to make for the Commission, sir?

MR. RUSK: I don't think so. 
MR. BELIN: Thank you very much for coming up here
