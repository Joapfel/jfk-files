[ f. These investigations must be both vigorous and incisive. -The 
[ fundamental objective is to identify those who may be engaged or 
[ responsible for acts of violence, and oare must be taken to avoid 
[ becoming involved in widespread, nebulous investigation which does 
[ not go to the heart of the problem at hand. When a case is opened, 
[ it should receive immediate continuous attention until the initial 
[ allegation is resolved. The case should be promptly closed if it is 
[ qefinitely determined that it does not fall within the criteria set 
[ out in item 3a above. •

[ workers in these organizations to~deter·mine whether they have been 
[ involved-in acts of ~iolence or have a definite potential for future 
[ acts of violence. Good judgment and discretion must be exercised in 
[ the, -cas.e of prominent individuals .who may be dupes of such orga.niza-
[ tions and who may hold nominal office. Immediately advise the Bureau 
[ when investigation of a prominent person is contemplated; and if 
[ • there is any question as to whether there is s·ufficient probable 
[ Ii cause to fully justify investigation, no investigation should be 
[ conducted without Bureau approval.

[ investigative repcr~s but should b~ inae~ed from informant reports. 
[ Names of new members should be furnished the Bureau by letter for 
[ indexing purposes. •

[. mandatory that information be obtained regarding al1 pertinent Klan 
[ ~- or hate organization activities. In this regard it is necessary 
[ th~ informants be developed in all such organizations which meet 
[ the criteria set forth in 3a above. Efforts in this regard must be 
[ discreet. 
[ b. Preliminary interviews with rank-and-file members of an organization 
[ and other individuals not connected with such·organiza.tions conducted 
[ solely for the purpose of determining the attitude of the individual 
[ may be authorized by the SAC. To obtain authority from the SAC, 
[ ' credit, arrest, informant, and indices checks shottld be made and a -
[ memotandum prepared for the SAC setting forth this information so 
[ that he may make a. decision regarding the propriety of the interview.

[ viewed without prior Bureau authority. Likewise where a greater than
