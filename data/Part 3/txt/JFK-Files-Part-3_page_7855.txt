A: Yes. 
Q: Is this the only 111onitoring T,,.ork you have done 
outside of the T?ashington Field O~fice7 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you recall ,,then this occurred 7· 
A: I seem to think it ,.,,.as shortly before President 
KENNEDY's assAssination in 19f3. 
(There follor,,.ed at this p<;>int and at later times 
during the intervier~ questions in an attempt to jo~ my 
memory as to the exact date of the monitoring. I apnealed 
to my recollection that ROBERT KENNEDY's tenure as Attorney 
General T,,.as from 19f 1 to 19E4, and I had to admit the 
monitoring of Dr. KING might have occurred sometime after 
President KENNEDY's death. I nointed out that I had 
nothing T,Tith r-rhich to refresh my memory and only the incident 
of President KENN£DY1 s untimely death tended to fix the date 
of our activities as taking place close to the time of that 
death.) 
Q: Have you ever ,.,,.orked on cases related to demonstrations'? 
(It T,,.as ex-plained that this question ,.,,.as asked in 
order to help me try to fix the date of our monitoring by 
relating it to deinonstrations and the date of their occurrence.) 
A: I have never ,.,,.orked matters relating to demonstrations. 
Furthermore, I had had no special interest in the ~ c. 
activities of Dr. KING or the S.L.C. Since I have 
little or no recollection of deinonstrations in T,,.hich 
Dr. KING might have been involved, this method of 
trying to jog my memory ,.,,.ould seem to be of little 
help.
