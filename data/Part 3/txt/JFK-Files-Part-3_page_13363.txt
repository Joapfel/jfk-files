with, was friendly to, or attempted to penetrate any anti-Castro group?

OLSEN: What is your information on that? 
STURGIS: I'm not sure of the group; but there is a group called 
the "DR" -- the student directorate, which was being financed by CIA, 
and l believe one of the top officials of that group whom I was in touch 
with,both the president and lesser officialgf/that group, supposedly--
they told me--that Oswald was in the Miami area, tried to penetrate their 
organization or some of the other Cuban organizations and possibly that he
