best. I am not pleading, as does a defense attorney. I am 
only putting in your thinking my objective observations as 
a citizen who is somewhat concerned about the future of this 
organization. It is too precious for us to have it in 
a condition of jeopardy. 
Thank you very much. 
The Chairman. Thank you, Director Kelley. 
I want to turn first to Senator Hart who won't be able 
to remain through the whole morning. I think he has one 
qµestion he would like to ask.
