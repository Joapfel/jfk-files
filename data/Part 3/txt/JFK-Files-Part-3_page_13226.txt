The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964) • 
contained the following: [OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup) 
"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve 
the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders. 
Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported _plots and 
stated that he would like to go into the matter further. 
Others, including .Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was 
/ being put on notice and should do everything in its power to 
asceitain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under­
_-take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the 
matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law 
enforcement." 
Mr. McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this 
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same 
information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA 
memorandum "reporting plans-of Cuban exiles to assassinate 
leading Cuban government leaders." This memo apparently had 
been sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General. 
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's memo contains the following: 
"ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we 
should take to establish the credibility of the_ report; also 
com_rnunica te with the FBI through Mr. Papich-. Also I should 
call the Attorney General personally." 
The official minutes of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee 
meeting (dated July 31, 1964) (referred to in 1967 IG report) 
contain no mention of assassination or even of Cuba. 
Mr. McCone's personal memorandum (dated July 31, 1964) had 
only the following reference_ to Cuba: 
"Proposed infiltration/exfiltration operations into Cuba for 
August were approved and the July operations were noted."
