violence", 11intelligence activities by hostile nations 11, 
"domestic extremist activities", and use of the FBI to 
gather political intelligence. 
Furthermore, at the same time, Director KeTley 
suggested that materials from the 110fficial and Confiden­
tial 11 files were taken to Director Hoover's home. He 
stated: 
Immediately after his death /Mr. Hoover's/ 
Eome of his employees, including his personal -
secretary, went through his files and completed 
the destruction of the remainder of the files 
that were purely personal. ·These were destroyed 
by shredding. Some I understand were taken but 
to his home and placed in his home, they being 
historical I presume to some extent. There is 
no indication that they were other than personal 
files. 
Please determine for the Select Committee whether 
any documents were removed from Mr. Tolson's or Mr. Hoover's 
residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after 
Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI did go to 
Mr. Hoover 1's or Mr. Tolson' s· residence to remove files, 
please provide the Select Committee with a complete des­
cription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI. 
Were any such documents copies or originals of documents 
relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des­
cribe the subject matter of each such document. Also 
indicate the individual within the FBI who has custody 
over· these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request on 
behalf of the Select Committee that such files not be des­
troyed or removed from the FBI's custody until further 
notice. } ,
