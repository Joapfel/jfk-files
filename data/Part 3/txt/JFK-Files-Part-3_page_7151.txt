Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
62-116395 
Beljlin's memorandum also noted that the thrust of 
the SSC's investigation will include the whole range of 
intelligence gathering agencies; will delve into the basic 
matters of policy, including whether or not there is a need 
for all of the agencies; what the results are; related public 
policy matters, as well as rights of privacy. 
Miller also advised Bellin that the SSC would operate 
out of a room referred to as "the auditorium," which Miller 
thought gave the best security. He said there would be rigid 
standards imposed to seal off any leaks. These standards would 
include having everything.in a central filing area with a specific 
check-out system permitted:t> particular people so that if leaks 
occurred the source of such leaks could be readily ascertained. 
Xeroxing would be severely limited. In response to a question 
from Bellin to Miller as to why the Senate and House did not 
create a joint Senate/House committee as opposed to individual 
Senate and House Select Committees, Miller advised that it was too 
difficult to arrange because of matters of protocol. 
It is noted that although a House Select Committee 
l
is being formed with basically the same charter as the SSC, no 
chairman of the House Select Committee has been designated and 
the Group estimates that it will be a month before the House 
Select Committee can get started. 
ACTION: 
For information.
