SELECT CO'MlYIITTEE ON 
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) • 
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT 
( SA) LAWRENCE F. ~JIRICK BY 
SSC STAFF MEMBER 
On July 31, 1975, at 11:45 a.m. Mr. Lester Seidel 
of the United States Senate Select Com~ittee (SSC) interviewed 
SA Law-rence F. Wirick at the San Diego Of £ice of the FBI. 
No Advice of Rights was furnished SA Wirick and it was not 
necessary for the interviewee to consult with an FBI representative. 
The interview was terminated at 12:50 p.m. and as·best recalled 
included the following discussion in the form of questions and 
answers:

Seidel: 
Wirick: 
You understand that this is an informal interview 
and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO 
as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP? 
Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting 
this survey? 
To aid in formation of new legislation so that the 
FBI and other Government agencies will have more 
definite guidelines to follow. 
I believe the Congress already through lack of 
information, isolated instances and some hysteria 
has.'·, enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent 
the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting 
the law abiding element of our society from the 
"bad guysu. 
(He was in general agreement) Did you handle the 
COINTELPRO from 1970 through ~larch, 1971? 
Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function locally 
about Nove~ber or December, 1970. As I recall my 
function was to write a progress type letter regarding 
progress which described the illegal activities of 
members of the BPP and to report that this information 
had been furnished local police agencies but information 
generally emanated from confidential informants.
