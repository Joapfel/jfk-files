WASHINGON, Nov. 19-0r: Oct. 10, 
1963, the then-Attorney General of the 
United States put his per.,onal signa­
ture on a document that launched and 
legitimatized one of the most horren­
dous abuses of Federal police power in 
this century. 
In Senator Frank Church's subcom­
mittee hr:aring roClm this week. the 
authorized wiretapping and subse­
quent unauthorized bugging and at­
tempted blackmaiiing of MarHn Luther 
King Jr. is being gingerly examined, 
with the "investigation" conducted in 
such a way as not to unduiv em­
barrass officiais of the Kennedv or 
Johnson Administrations. • 
With great care, the committee has 
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when~ 
the .::ommittee counsel flrst set forth 
the result of- sh':.!ffling through press 
clips, it seemed as !f no justice De­
partment had exi~ted in 1962; today,· 
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it 
was Robert Kennedv who authorized 
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that "the 
President of th!' United States and the 
l:.torney Genera1 specificaiiy discussed 
Ui~ir conc-crn of Communist influence 
wi~h Dr. King." 
nut the Church committee showed 
no zest for getting further to the Ken­
nedy root of t::is precedent to Water­
ga tc eavesdrnpping. If Senator Church 
" ••:ere will:ng to let the chips fall where 
they may, he would call some know!­
edge3ble witness·es into the glare of 
the camera lights and ask them some 
questions that have gone unasked for 
thirl:.:en years. 
Fo:-examp!,::, he could call Nicholas 
Katz:.:·1bach, Attorney Genc:ral Ken­
redy's deputy and successor, and a:;k 
1. what roe knows of the Ke1mcdy de-· 
ci.,ion to wicetap Dr. King. Who at 
j'ustic,• concurred in the recommenda­
tion? Hew docs lhe F.B.:r. know the , 
!>resident was consulted o;- informed? • 
• The committee is not asking embar­
rassing questions even when answers 
are readily available. , A couple of 
.. weeks ago, at an open •hearing, .an 
F.B.I. man inadvertentlv started to 
blurt out an--€pisode about newsmen 
who were weritapping in 1962 witbi 
the apparent knowlcage of Attornej! 
General Kennedy. The too-willing witll 
ness was promptly shooshed into si;. 
lence, and told that such informatioif 
would be deve:loped only in executive 
• session. Nobody raised an eyebrow. 
That pattern ot containment by the 
Church committee ls vividly shown by 
the handling of the huggings at the 
1964 Republican and Democratic con-
..-,m:,_ JI' Zn~

ventions which ,were ordered by Lyn­
don ·.Johnson. Such invasions of politi­
cal headquarters were worse than the 
crime committed at Watergate, since 
they involved the use of the ·F.B.I., 
but the Church investigators seem to 
be detcrminetl not to probe too deeply. 
If F.B.I. documents say that reports 
were made to specific Johnson aides, 
why are those men not given the 
same opportunity to publicly tell their 
story so avidly given the next Presi­
dent's men? If Lyndon Johnson com­
mitted this impeachable high crime of 
using . th~ F.B.L to spy ?n politica_l 1-
opponents, who can be brought for­
ward to teU us all about it? 
Aft~r lifr. Katzenbach assumed of­
fice, and the ·,i:rretapp!ng continued, . 
h~ \-;as t<,ld by angry newsmen lbat 1 
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in­
for.1rntion ~ho11t Dr. King. Whv did he 
wait for four months, and for· a thou­
sand telephonic interccpt10ns. to dis~ 
continue the officially approved rap? 
But that would cause embarrass- : 
ment to Democrats, and Senator J 
Church wants to embarrass profes­
sional employees of investigatory 
agencies only. .A: new sense of Con­
gressional decorum exists, far from 
the sense of outrage expressed in the 
Senate Watergate committee's hear­
ing room. When it. is revealed that the 
management of NBC News gave pre,;;s 
credentials to L.B.J.'s spies at the 1964 
convention, everybody blushes demure-,.f 
Jy-and nohody demands to know: 
which network executive made what! 
decision 1m<ler what pressure. ,j 
I have been haranguing patient! 
readers for years about the double 
standard appiied to DC>mo,raUc and 
Republican political crimes, and kd
