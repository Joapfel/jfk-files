(Chairm!An Clifford thought .it re.mar.-.ka'ble th.at such precautions woulci have 
been consistently niaintained over such a· long period ·0.f 11 years.) 
In answer to Mr. Coyne's inquiry, Mr. Bannerman 81.\id that th·e Security 
Committee's preliminary assessment had bee,n "noted 11 by the US:u and USIB lu .. d 
approved the z:ec0tm1endations, •.1ith the request that the Security Committee 
complete a final assessment. 
• Mr. Bannerman said that it is most difficult to attempt to assess the 
' . • . ' 
damage to u. S. interests resulting irom the Moscow penetration. ~irst is tne 
task of identify-ing information to "Wh.i-ch the Soviets may have obtained access. 
The next task is to try and find .instai:ices in which Soviet react ion provides 
evidence that a compromise of infornLation was effected. Horcov.ert since this 
was a Soviet intelligence operation, the informat:L.1n ob.taine<l by the •intelligence 
operators would not be paaa~d on to Soviet political desks cir to Soviet bloc 
allil'.!s without attributing to some sou;rce other than the technical penetra~ion. 
Dr, Langer thought that, nevertheless, all ;such. information ob.tained· by· technical 
penetration of -the U. • s. Embassy woulc( be r.eviewed and utilized ~ere possible by the . 
Soviet gove~nt. Mr. Bannerman acknowledged that this would be. the case~ but .he 
~mp'has i.ied the d if f icul•ty in observing• and identifying Soviet react ions and nc t ions 
as being b·aaed on compromised u. s. information or c.ommunicationa. Dr.- Land 
expressed the view that it is dangerous t.:) assume that ,our information' .;as not 
compromised·becaµsewe cannot observe specific Soviet reactions to such inform.a-
t ion. Dr. Baker wondered whether the ass es sment ,of the 3 U. S. Ambassadors 
that no daµiage was done is iri essence a find~ng that' intelli8enc~ is worthless, 
is not'needed, or is riot used when it is obtained, J 
Chairm&1 Clifford asked whether it is possible to relate compt·omised 
U. S. ,inform.at ion to Soviet act ions with resrttct to Cuba. Mr. Bannerman ref erred 
to the usiB Security 'committee ass.essment on that point. ML Ge~tile pointed 
out that ·by 1962 an acoustically shielded conference roO'ill. and an electronically 
shielded co9e room had. been ins:.:alJ.ed in the Embassy, and in addition the' 
practice has always been follo....,ed of writing O\.\t.sensitive information. Mr. Gray 
thought that the State Department; a_ssess:nent. referre~ to in the Conclusions· of 
. . . '-, ' ' 
the USIB Security C~ittee report· should be amended by adding to. the ,effect . • 
that "or, if the information was compromise:d,' it 'Wll.S used by the Soviets with 
such skill as to • conceal whethP.r in fact the in format ion :-,;as comprc;:>mised 11 • 
' ' ' 
Mr. Pace ~~nciered whether· in format ion. obtained by the -Soviets .. through 
this technical penetration ·of our Embassy ·might not h:ive, resulted irt the 
Soviet identific.ad.on: of any de.f~ctors serving as. intelligenc~ agents for the 
U. S. Mr.· Bannerman SA.id that· this is a pos·s.ibility in the Penkovsky case, 
and CIA is awaiting the a.Liaessme.nt reports of other agencies in orde:- to study 
this possibility further. • •
