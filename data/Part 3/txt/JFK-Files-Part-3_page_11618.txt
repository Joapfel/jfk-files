We have on a cont~~uing basilbeen able t~ 
provide the President and other responsible officials 
with, information of the type needed. With increasing 
frequency our Legal Attaches have been able to provide 
high level intelligence information which has been given 
exclusively to the White House and the Attorney General. 
Qne such item, for example, provided by the Legal Attache 
".in-La Paz on 5/20/71 and disseminated on the same date to 
the White House and the Attorney General dealt with plans 
of the Bolivian Government to request the withdrawal of 
the Peace Corps from that country. Subsequently on 
5/22/71, the Bolivian Government did request the withdrawal 
of this group from the country. A representative of the 
National Security Council.commented favorably concerning 
···this data and the Legal A ttache was commended by the 
.. :. Director for developing the source who was able to produce 
. • this type of information. 
. • •• • • The Unit continues to be successful in thwarting 
the ·plans of militant anti-Qastro groups which have sought 
. -to infiltrate Cuba and to attack ships and property of 
foreign nations engaged in trade with Cuba. Successful 
development of key informants who have infiltrated an~i­
Castro groups under Bureau direction has enabled the 
.Bureau to keep abreast of their activities. Cuban exile 
·activities are embarrassing to the u. s. Government and 
·could lead to a major confrontation between the U. s. and 
the Soviet Union which has assumed· the role of Cuba's 
• protector. An example of our success in this area was the 
·; .: -arrest by appropriate authorities of four members of 
. · : ... •• ~ . • .Alpha 66, militant anti-Castro groupi on 7/11/71 and the 
• -_.·· • : • f· :seizure of machine guns,· ammunition, explosives, hand 
• • • grenades, other weapons and a boat. Seizure of° this 
material has hurt Alpha 66 1 s capability to conduct raids 
on Cuba. Action taken in this instance was based on data 
·furnished. by FBI informant. . . A' ._ •• , ._. ..,
