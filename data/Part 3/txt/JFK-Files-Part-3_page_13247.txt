General Bayo. And I felt that· if I would get the nod to assas­
sinate them, I could do it within 30 ~econds, high tail it and 
everything. 
MR. OLSEN: Was there something that you had drawn 
up in the way of exercise as the result of the discussions with 
the other Air Force officials? 
MR. STURGIS: The Air Force and Army officials. This 
information was given·to ·the American Embassy. I again did -
these exercises to try to get a diversion that if I would get 
the nod to do the execution, that 'r would have some means of 
diversionary tactics to draw attention away from the people who 
did the execution, and that I was, there with my people to preve t 
it because of the security. 
MR.· OLSEN: Did you discuss these plans in advance wi h 
Colonel Nichols? 
MR. STURGIS: 'No sir. At the very I would say abo t 
six weeks of the revolution was over with there was a great dea 
of discontent among many of the top ranking military officers. 
I knew these people personally, I was in with them at those 
meetings and various places, and that they discussed, we all 
discussed the assassination then. And some said, well, there 
are some officers that will be *ith the group, Fidel and Raoul 
and Che, that were not really with then. So they were split 
on the idea of assassinating them. So they asked my opinion.
