The Dulles Commission recommended that the FBI 
should.be made a member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee 
to improve coordination of domestic·intelligonce and counter­
intelligence insofar as these matters related to the national 
security. 
While discuss:tng the production o:f National. 
Intelligence Estimates by CIA, the report noted, "There is 
no systematic way of tapping that domestic intelligence 
information, which should be chiefly in the hands of the FBI; 
having a bearing on broader intelligence issues· and there 
is no regular and agreed arrangement for participation by the 
FBI and for the use of intelligence from domestic sources in 
a national estimate." 
National Security Council Intelligence Directive 
Number 7 provided that CIA shall be responsible for the 
exploitation, on a highly selective basis, within the United 
~ States of business concerns, other non-Governmental organizations 
and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence information. 
Th0. ~A~ort concluded the amount of foreign intelligence which 
can be obtained through the exploitation of non-Gvvt:L"l1J,i.6i.1t;:;.l 
·sources in the United States is considerable and its quality 
• could be very high if appropriate arrangements were made and 
discrimination was employed. It was felt the vast number of 
organ~zations, institutions and individuals having foreign 
interests and knowledge represented a potential source of. 
intelligence that in many ways was superior to any other, 
'as it was felt that they were in a· position to provide 
information obtained from their foreign contacts and from the 
findings on their own p7ople abroad ... 
A further important source of information, the 
exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign individuals 
.'and groups in the United States was also being developed.· The 
report noted that these individuals and groups as well as 
.. •political refugees and former foreign government officials 
.·, .. , .. ~ ......... were often engaged in political activity with significant 
international implications.
