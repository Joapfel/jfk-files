MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE,, 
SUBJECT: Covert Action P el Meeting 6/5/64 
(Discussion With Secretary, Sp~cial Group, et al.) 
On 6/5/64, at the Board's offices, Mr. Murphy held a meeting of the 
Board's Covert Action Panel (Messrs. Murphy, Gray and Langer) also attended 
by General Doolittle; J. Patrick Coyne; and A. R. Ash. 
I 
At the invitation of Chairman Murphy the meeting 
Jessup who since January 20, 1964, has been serving a·s 
NSC 5412/2 Group. 
. 
was joined by Mr. Peter 
Secretary of the Special 
In answer to questions asked by Panel members, Mr. Jessup provided a 
description of the Special Group and its activities, as follows: 
I 
! 
The Special Group is chaired by Mr. McGeorge Bundy; Mr. Alexis Johnson 
represents the State Department; Mr. Cyrus Vance represents the Secretary of 
Defense; and Mr. McCone the CIA. These Group members are back-stopped by 
small staffs in their respective agencies. 
Meetings of the Special Group are held once each week. They are "action" 
meetings not talk-fests, and the members have done their homework beforehand. 
The Chairman of the JCS attends when the agenda includes subjects of particul~r 
JCS interest (since January he has attended two meetings for discussion of Cuba 
matters). 
Most of the covert actions considered by the Special Group are CIA pro-­
posals, although other members suggest actions (for example, State Department 
brought up for discussion the matter of supplying arms in Ta~gayika). The State 
Department is considered to serve as the "conscience" of the Special Group in its 
consideratio13-0£ proposed covert actions. During the current year some 23 of 
39 proposals were favorably considered by the Group. 
About 50 per cent of the covert actions coming before·the Special Group 
are carried out by the Joint Reconnaissance Center (JRC) of the JCS, in. the 
aerial reconnaissance field. Since January 1, the Group has approved actions 
with respect to Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Panama, Chile, Congo, Angola, 
Tibet, Zanzibar, and China, among others. For example, the April 29·, 1964, 
meeting included discussions of the Chilean elections; Cuba; a JRC forecast of 
peripheral missions; and reconnaissance coverage from India of a Chinese Communist 
test range.
