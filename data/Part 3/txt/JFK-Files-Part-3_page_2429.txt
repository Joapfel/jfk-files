I have received your memorandum of June 20, 1969, 
requesting a report on foreign communist support of 
revolutionary protest movements in the United States. 
In compliance with your request, a comprehensive, 
in-depth review of our coverage in this field is presently 
being conducted and you will be furnished the results on 
June 30, 1969. This analysis will cover foreign support of 
.revolutionary youth activities in the United States emanating 
from all strata of international communism, whether they be 
pro-Russian. pro-Chinese or pro-Cuban oriented. 
When you have had sufficient opportunity to 
evaluate this material, I will be happy to make a membe_r 
of my staff available to you for £urther discussion at • your convenience. • - -
