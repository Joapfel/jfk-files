STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY, 
DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and 
gentlemen. 
2451 
I welcome the interest which ±his_Committee has shown in 
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli 
gence and internal security fields. 
I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my 
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis 
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs 
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with 
law. 
I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative 
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of 
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of 
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight. 
This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study 
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been 
I 
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present 
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest 
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as 
possible in respqnding to your questions and complying with yo r 
requests.
