We have learned through defector lources that in 
instances such as described above, the entire activity of 
the KGB officers involved as well as the Residency as a 
whole are subjected to most careful scrutiny to determine 
if there has been a penetration; if the operation was 
mishandled and what, if anything, can be salvaged from 
other operations which were being run by the officers 
involved. Such a review may take many months. No doubt 
.Az~¼:,YJ;J.?,~.9,.. contacts with ... N~.J,.$A_~ have been the subject of 
such careful study. Inasmuch as we did not involve Nelson 
in our approach to Mar~a1.1, there is no reason to believe 
that the KGB does not still considerJwlson_ as a potential, 
.agento 
It would be logical fqr the Soviets to have 
Nelson's development continued by AzatY,an'~rep~acement, 
who would by how have been in the u. s. for a relatively 
short period of timeo Historically, a newly arrived KGB 
operative takes some months to get acclimated to the

The .N,_e).p,g~case has been maintained in a pending 
status as it was felt he still possesses potential as a 
source against the Soviets. At this point the only ones 
who know if this is true are the KGB. If we were to 
a.ttempt to initiate contact between NelsQn and the Soviets, 
-they would be convinced he is a plant and lose all interest 
in him. The only course of action we can pursue at this 
time is to wait for the Soviets to make a move. 
. Newark's most recent communication in this 
matter advised that Nelson is alert to our interests and 
they are maintaining contact with him. This is essential 
to insure we have full knowledge and control of any future 
Soviet initiatives. Experience has shown the Soviets will 
allow situations such as this to remain dormant for as 
• long as ~ight years.· It is not &'Uggested that this matter 
will be kept pending-for this length of time; however, 
for reasons indicated it is incumbent upon us to continue 
t~·follow this _matter for-~ reasonable period of time.

supervision by Seat of Government supervisors, including 
specific instructions to the field. As a prime defection
