In short, if we learn a murder or bombing•is to be carried 
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by inves~igatin 
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the 
ability to prevent? I refer to those instanc~s where there is 
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to 
human life. 
Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt, 
the Congress must consider th~ question of whether or not such 
preventive action should be available to the FBI. 
These matters are currently being addressed by a task 
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI, 
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls ca 
be developed in cooperation with pertinent Committees of Congre s 
to insure.that such measures are used in an entirely responsibl 
manner. 
Probably the most important· question here today is what· 
assurances I can give that the errors and abuses which arose 
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again? 
First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub­
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's 
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as 
Director on July 9, 1973. 
Today we place a high premium on openness, openness 
both within and without the service. 
I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion
