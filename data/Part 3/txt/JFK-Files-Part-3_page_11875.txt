SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
PR.EPARATION OF INTERVIEW REPORTS (FD-3O2) 
IN SECURITY TYPE INVESTIGATIONS 
EDWARDS. MILLER: From a review of the FBI 
. Handbook, Manual of Rules 
and Regulations, and Manual of Instructions provisions 
in regard to security typ~ investigations, more particularly 
espionage matters, Registration Act, security investigations, 
internal security - nationalistic tendencies matters, 
·security informants, and racial matters, it was noted that· 
no mention is made that information which may be the 
subject of later testimony in judicial or administrative 
·type hearings must be made a matter of record on an . 
_interview report (FD-3O2). • 
. -.,. ' : 
· In this connection the ·Manual ~f Rule·s -and. ~ 
P..egu.l~.t:t0n~; Part II: Section 4. page 4a, makes ·reference 
• to the preparation of interview reports in security type 
cases. Due to the discovery procedures existent in our 
_judicial system, the preparation of these interview reports 
is most necessary particularly when dealing with information 
of a testimonial nature received from security informants. 
It" is felt that quite possibly the seeming reluctance on the 
part of investigative agents handling security matters to 
. prepare FD-3O2's may be due to the lack of mention of this 
in the Manual and Handbook proyisions dealing with security 
'. • investigations. • . .. . • ,._ . . • .•_.·.. . . . ~-: .• . -.

• In.view.of the above, it is ·suggested that those 
. • • provisions of the Manual and Handbook having to do with 
secur~ty type investigations be thoroughly reviewed and 
.• :_amended where necessary to-set forth the fact that when 
information is received from security subjects, security 
in,ormants, or other individuals which may become the 
.subj~ct o~ later testimony, ~n FD-~O2 should be p~epa~ed.
