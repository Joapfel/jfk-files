SUGGESTION :r-vIBMORANDUM 
RE: AUTOMATION OF INTELLIGENCE DATA 
RE NEW LEFT AND EXTREMIST INDIVIDUALS 
111 ll _. &PEPTOR E: S. MILLER: The Espionage Sectim in close cooperation with 
t~ __ jj the Voucher-Statistical Section - Administrative 
~sion, has designed and implemented an automated system known as the Soviet 
Information Collation System. It is essentially a repository of pertinent data on 
Soviet officials assigned to the U. S. Through the fast and easy manipulation of 
this data by the computer, outputs arranged by important elements of information 
can be readily and reliably obtained for Bureau 1:188 or dissemination to outside 
agencies. The Espionage Section attests to the fact it has "streamlined our 
operations, promoted uniformity and assured the highest level of accuracy. At 
the same time, it has resulted in a substantial savings in time, money and man­
power, both in the field and at SOG." 
It would seem reasonable a similar repository of information could be 
collected regarding New Left and Extremist individualS. This would parallel 
the SICS operation. 
Various reports could be selected from this data such as an alphabetical 
listing of Key Activist, New Left, and Extremist individuals. Other alternatives 
would include listings by phone number according to geographical areas, listings 
by addresses according to geographical areas, or listings by demonstrations in 
which certain individuals have participated. Summary reports or listings, if 
required for dissemination to the field offices or other interested agencies, could 
be efficiently prepared under such a system. There a:re numerous other alternativ 
that come to mind; however, any consideration for such a program must clearly 
take into account the need and benefit for such automation.
