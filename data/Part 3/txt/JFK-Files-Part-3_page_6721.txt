Memorandum from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. J. B. Adams 
Re: Senstudy 
At the conclusion of the hearing, considerable 
questions were asked concerning legislation or direction which 
would be necessary from The Congress to permit the Bureau to 
carry out mail opening programs which were productive in their 
results and which would not at the same time invade the privacy 
of innocent American citizens. 
ACTION: 
This is submitted for your information. 
ADDENDUM BY LEGAL COUNSEL 10/23/75, JAM:mfd • j 
1r['. 
I answered the Committee's questions described in the last 
paragraph of this memorandum by explaining to them that in a security 
case we would find it most difficult to meet the 4th Amendment standard 
of probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant. fdr mail. If we 
are to be required to obtain warrants prior to obtaining mail and if we 
are to be successful, a lower standard of probable cause such as is 
permissible in administrative searches such as those conducted by 
Health Inspectors wouid be necessary. In answer to a specific question 
I explained that the Supreme Court has ruled that mail is protected absolutely 
by the 4th Amendment. ~
