The language of Executive Order 116d5 is very 
broad and generally coincides with the basis for our 
investigation of extremist groups. Conceivably, consistent 
with manpower available, proceedings could be initiated on 
most of the organizations we have under investigation although 
the Department has not indicated at this time that they will 
undertake any wholesale action. 
For additional observations concerning the 
anticipated impact of Executive Order 11605 on the work 
of this Division, see the Adequacy of Personnel write-ups 
of the New Left Section, Extremist Intelligence Section 
and the Internal Security Section.
