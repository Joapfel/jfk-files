The most prominent artist on The Black Panther staff is Minister of Culture 
Emory Douglas. Although he prepares a large number of cartoons, other Panther 
artists are also represented. These cartoons characterize the Government and

and the killing·of Government officials, as well as police officers.

When the Black revolutionary 
artist starts a still life painting,

and unrelated to his revolutlona>y 
people. So he seeks, and finds 
what our Minister of Defense Huey

the people's revolution. 
He knows that only because of

for freedom Will be replaced with 
the BLOOD OF nm OPPRESSOR.
