(In·answer to a specific question from Mr. Murphy, Mr. Jessup said that to I 
.. his knowledge there has been no systematic review ·by ."the Special Group con­
cer~ing the results of actions taken pursuant to previous.· G~oup approvals.) 
The Group follows the policy of referring to the President those pro-
posed actions as to which Group members have_differences of opinion regarding 
the probability and acc~ptability of "noise levels" which would result from the 
actions. Since January, the subject of Cuba has been taken up with' the President 
with a view to obtaining guidance on the level of covert action activity desired 
during this election year. 
Mr. Jessup concluded his visit with the Board Panel and departed the r·•·v"'b 
meeting· at this point. . 1,., .-:, .... (,. :.-· .. ·" ,,: .. /\

Next, the Board Panel meeting was joined by Messrs. Dick Helms and ~\ .·,.·•·/•'~ ., 
Cord Meyer of CIA. ( (~-~~. ·::,-_)'A .. ·i 
Mr. Helms said that with regard to Cuba there ·has been an effective st~-:~- . \ 
down in externally-mounted sabotage operations- since Febr~ry. Policy approvals 
have been given only to oddments of "passiye··sabotage", such as supplying agen.ts 
1 with incendiary pencils, etc.; a mattres~···f!ct~f..Y..-and a plastic works were ~urned 
,...d.Q~) __ but CIA does not consi_der that .such operations are enough and they are--'iior-­
the wfiole program that CIA wants to conduct. The "Track II" paper in the State 
Department calls for CIA support of Cuban exile group activity, but no CIA 
direction and controlr and few results are possible from such an approach, with 
Artime burning down a sugar mill, but Manolo Ray getting· arreste,d by the British. 
·There have been acts of sabotage performed on tractors carried b'y vessels en route 
. . 
to Cuba. On the economic front, after Castro had put out false rumors of an 
expected short sugar crop, in order to run up the world market price, the CIA 
countered by assembling correct information which when Jublished brought the 
price down again. 
With regard to Soviet personnel in Cuba, Mr. Helms estimated that there are 
from 15,000 to 18,000 on.the Island, 1 although u. s. intelligence community 
estimators place the figure at fr.om 4,000 to 5,000. 
Concerning Chile, Mr. Helms said that the coming Presidential elections 
there on September 13 are vieweft with serious concern. The Socialists there are 
more radical than the Communists, and candidate Allende (backed by the FRAP 
party) may have a strong chance of winning~ Moreover, the constitutional-minded 
Chileans would accept a regularly-elected COtinnunist as President and would not take 
coup action to put him out of office. Allende is being supported by the USSR at 
the rate of about one-quarter miilion dollars a month, and his su~cess at the polls 
is important to the Soviets who can then point to the election as an example of a 
-"peaceful" Communist victory. 
I 
, CIA:.support of Chilean Christian ~emocrat candidate Frei included $750,000 
in March; and on May 14, another $1.25 million was added following the urgings of 
major business elements in Chile and the U. s. Some support is also being given 
I 
to anti-Communist candidate Edwards; to Protestants; and to poll-taking groups.
