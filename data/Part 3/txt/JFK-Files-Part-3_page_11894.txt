East Coast Conspiracy 
Because of the basic re~ponsibility of this Division 
for investigations involving subversive antiwar groups, over~ll 
responsibility for this investigation was assumed by memorandum 
dated September 10, 1970. This, of course, did not inclu_de 
individual Selective Service violations existing in various 
stages of prosecution or subsequent substantive violations in 
which affiliates of this group were suspected of being involved. 
This investigation has been specifically targeted to 
two areas of prosecutive potential. First, to develop suffici~nt 
evidence to prosecute leadership of this broad conspiracy to 
impede the Government's functioning and conduct of the Vietnam 
war. In this vein, a comprehensive revie~ of pertinent material 
discloses 16 related incidents from October 27, 1967, at Baltimore, 
Maryland, to Rochester, New York, on September 6, 1970. Of 97 
individuals involved in 16 incidents during this period, 25 
persons have been established as being involved in three or more 
of thARe incidents. This particular phase of the investigatioh 
is most detailed and complex; however, in terms of far-reachi~g 
damage to the movement, it is most significant. For example, 
we have set up an extensive Automatic Data Processing (ADP) 
project whicµ resulted in a print-out showing over 300 telephone 
calls of interest between telephone numbers utilized by these 
conspirators and which corroborate information from the informant 
regarding calls he received from principal conspirators_., 
Second, we are developing sufficient evidence to prosecute 
the perpetrators of the plots to kidnap Presidential advisor 
Henry A. Kissinger and to blow up the tunnels which contain steam 
and electrical conduits between Government buildings in Wash:ington, D~C. 
Because of publicity given the plots.to kidnap Kissinger 
and to blow up the tunnels in Washington, D. C., it is imperative 
this phase of the investigation be vigorously pre~sed toward 
prosecutive action. C9nsistent with this objective the Federal 
Grand Jury has been hearing evidence in this matter ?ince December l~~
