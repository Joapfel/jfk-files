to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the· only time I 
ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his 
badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr. 
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office. 
And we have a very brief conversation in which ·I tell him that 
as far ns I know, he's a loyal and patriotic ~itizen, and that 
is about the extent of it. 
Then when this file is completed and the person involved 
is either .appointed or not appointed, what happens to that 
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is 
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old 
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him. 
What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever? 
Hr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some 
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. vle 
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial 
and is· developed in cases involving certain members of the 
Executive Branch of the government. 
I see no reason why this would not be a proper area 
for consideration of legislation. 
The Chairman. Can·you give me any idea of how much --
do you have records that ,;muld tell us hm·1 much tiE1e and money 
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands 
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments 
to Federal offices?
