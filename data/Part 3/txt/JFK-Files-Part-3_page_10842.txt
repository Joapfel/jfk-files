It is Significant that wo have been ablo to operate for 
many years in the development of live sources in foreign diplomatic 
estcllishmonts, both Soviet bloc and non-bloc, without encountering 
any serio1.1-s i.ncidcnts embarrassin·g to the FBI or the United States 
Government.• 
Xn assessing tho product o~ such live sources in a number 
of instances .in tho non-Sov .. et field; 1 State Department has 
requested that we restrict ou~ efforts to Amorican citizens. To 
a considerable de~reo, this bas limited the effectiveness of our 
program in "the m;;i--Soviet field since U. So employees of foreign 
establishments will normally hot have access to top-grade data. 
Thus, especially.in the non-Soviet bloc field we are not tapping 
the full potential which exists for high-level foreign intelligence. 
This can only be realiied througb the development of high quality 
sources.

developed to assist us in connection with our internal security and 
counterintelligence responsibilities, have been. able to provide 
significant high-level infor~ation of foreign intelligence value.

For example, in the Soviet field, we have developed a 
number of top-level sources such as· _ ·who have 
provided current intelligence regarding the organizational structure,
