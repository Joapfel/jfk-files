0 Q - A general question on the problem oaf handling a Klan 
informant as opposed to a criminal informant with 
Kelley setting an example of an :f.nfnrmant in a bank 
rl.)bbery? 
1.i - I did not see any particular difference f:t:"nm his 
example and that nf a Klansman planning to bomb a 
building. 
0 1bese were the only quostinns I rec'l-rded in 
n.-,'te f"rm as he asked thera. 1here r.ny have been a few 
~thers, but n~ne of any significance end Kelley cppeared 
very coo-perative and matter of fact thr'lught')ut the 
deposition. Ward and Kelley escGrted me back t~ U~om G-308 
where I was asked to ~wear to the depositi~n,by, a 
nir,tary public, mdrey llatry. u 
Nf1TE: 
W. o. Cregar to Mr. W.R. Hannall memorandum 
11/11/75 captioned "Senstudy 75" recommended releasing 
Blake from his confidentiality agreement for purposes of 
the interview, which was tn be confined to Blake's 
handling of former informant Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr. 
Mr. Blake's account of the interview was set out in his 
personal letter to Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the 
Senstudy 75 Project. The letter was edited to omit 
comments irrelevant to the interview or of a personal 
nature.
