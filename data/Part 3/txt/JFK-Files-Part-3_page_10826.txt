. or.rather their expansion into it on intelligence 
matters. It ought not occur but this new memo 
nf CIG shows how greedy it is. It. is tho 
Donoyan plan almost in toto & is being slyly 
put over. It means we must ~ealously guard our

On March 27, 1953, the Director testified before the 
Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations. In response to a q~cstion 
fro111: Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA, 
the Director stated: "There ·is close liaison. CIA has 
exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have 
exclusive jurisdiction within the United States. -We maintain 
continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters .in Washington through 
a liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate 
the transmission of material from them to us and from our 
service to them."

noted: "This. is an understatement particularly if we are

CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that one of its

requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage 
including technical surveillance. ·rt was recommended we stay 
out of this matter and inform CIA that this ·was not to be 
.. ,., . construed as a precedent for approval of future ClA counter-
-1ntelligence activity in the United States .. The Director 
c·ommented on the memorandum: "The trend has gone so far we

operational ones. ,t . .-· .·., ...
