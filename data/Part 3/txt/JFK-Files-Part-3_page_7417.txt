Mr. Armstrong Inquired as to whether the Bureau has any objections to 
his discussing the two subject areas previously described by Mr. Gitenstein. 
Those areas were Armstrong's knowledge of the Bureau's Intelligence 
Division activities as a result of his employment in the FBI, and his 
lmowledge of the possibility of the Bureau getting an Executive Order 
establishing the FBI''s authority in security matters. 
I advised Mr. Armstrong that to the extent that the interview 
would concern those two subjects, the Bureau would have no objection 
and he could consider his secrecy agreement waived, but only to that 
extent. Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether there were any particula '"\ 
problems with inform~tion he furnished to me on May 28, 1975. I told ) • 
him that the waiver of the agreement was conditioned on the one limitati / 
that he would not furnish information that would identify informan,ts, . ..-,.,, 
compromise current investigations, or on-going programs, or reveal 
other sensitive matters which should be reserved for the information of . 
members of the Committee or the Chairman of the Committee. 
I told Mr. Armstrong that the Bl.reau would have available 
during bis interview, though not present at the interview, a representative 
who would provide him with counsel as to any problems concerning subjects 
he may be reluctant to discuss with the Committee representative. I 
explained that the FBI represe~tive was not intended to inhibit any~-- ,-
