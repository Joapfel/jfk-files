Do.you object to that definition? 
Mr. Kelley. I think that life has become much more 
sophisticated and we have added to the· so-called policeman's 
area of concern some matters which were probably not as importa t 
at that time. I think that the fact that the FBI has been in 
touch with the security investigations and the gathering of 
intelligence is something which has proved to be at times 
troublesome and given us great concern, but it is a viable, 
productive procedure. 
I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking of entirely 
of this course, but I can tell you about the procedure today~ 
Senator Mondale. You see, I think you recognize, if 
that further step is taken, as you're recommending here, that 
at that point it becomes so difficult to guarantee, and in 
fact, in my opinion, impossible to guarantee that we won't 
see a recurrence of some of the abuses that we've seen in 
the past, and I don't know how you establish any kind of 
meaningful oversight on a function as nebulous as the one 
you've just defined. 
If the FBI possesses the authority.to investigate 
ideas that they consider to be threats to.this nation's 
security, particularly in the light of the record that we have 
seen how that definition can be stretched to include practi­
cally everybody, including moderate civil rights leaders, 
war dissenters and so on, how on earth can standards be develo ed
