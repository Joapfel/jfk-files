The suggestion made by ,the Inspector will definitely 
enable the Racial Intelligence Section to afford closer 
supervision to the important task of developing quality 
racial informants especially member informants in extremist 
organizations. 
Our present practice of reviewing the FD-405 and 
then communicating to the field when it is noted there is 
no member informant in extremist organizations will be 
streamlined by the suggestion made by the Inspector. In 
view of the above, appropriate instruc.tions will be issued 
to comply with the Inspector's suggestion.

will be issued to comply with the Inspector's suggestion.
