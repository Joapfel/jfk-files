On 7/22/75, Mr. Ulman called Assistant Director -
Legal Counsel J.A. Mintz "to request assistance concerning 
an assignment he had been given by the Attorney General (AG) 
relating to the current investigation being conducted by the 
Senate Select Connnittee (SSC). In accordance with Mr. Mintz' 
referral to our Senstudy project group, Mr. Ulman was contacted 
7/22/75 by Supervisor J.P. Thomas. Mr. Ulman said that the 
AG had requested his office to prepare, by 7/25/75, the fullest 
posijible response to the question, "To what extent has the AG 
been involved in consideration or approval of policies and 
activities of U.S. foreign and military intelligence agencies?" 
Mr. Ulman said that he had requested the Criminal Division 
of the Department to conduct research on this matter but, being~ 
unfamiliar with foreign intelligence matters, desired to know ~­
whethe~ we could in any way assist him. He was informed that ,,,,,,....--
'the FBI is basically not a U.S. foreign intelligence agency. 
He responded that some of our operations involve foreign 
intelligence and again asked if we could assist. He was told 
that we certainly could not furnish any full answer, but would 
attempt to see if we could contribute something to his assi~-
ment. It was also suggested to Mr. . t at ~ ~ , ~ der . • •. ---, 
contacting Mr. K. William O• Connor,~ ~"c,oiJ,_,fa_~ many;'l a 7 
aspects of the SSC investigation for the Department, and mig t 
be able to clarify the request or contribute to the respm_.1r:u r~ 
and that he consider contacting CIA. He indicated hed:11a not· • 
feel that contact with CIA would be productive. It waSSaglt)t.eflS 197S 
that the inquiry appears to relate to the AG institutionaily 
rather than to any involvement of the incumbent, Mr. Lev!.- - J
