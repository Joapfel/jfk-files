Memorandum to Mr. Adams 
• 
Re: SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE 
intelligence agencies are exposed to audit-type functions exercised 
by the Office of Management and Budget, internal audit systems, the 
General Accounting Office, and the Director of Central Intelligence.(5) 
On page 14, after referring to the manner in which the 
Intelligence Conununity functions through a series of committees 
and boards, Mr. Colby states that the work of such committees and 
boards is limited to foreign intelligence,"as internal security 
falls solely within the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI participates 
in the Intelligence Community effort, however, so that any contribu­
tions that foreign int~ligence might make to internal security can 
be properly handled." (j} 
On page 17, Mr. Colby expresses confidence that the American 
people not only support but insist upon an effective intelligence 
apparatus to protect their security and intelligence. Thereafter, 
referring to Congress, on page 17, he states "Just tell us in the 
intelligence business what the Nation wants and does not want, and 
we will do our best to satisfy it. But also give us a way openly 
to change these rules when the Nation expects them to be changed." 
He then calls upon Congress to organize itself to protect the 
necessary secrecy of our intellige~e operations while exercising 
its responsibility for oversight.~) 
A review of Mr. Colby's proposed statement has revealed 
no information which I feel would be objectionable from the Bureau's 
standpoint. 
ACTION: 
For the Director's information.
