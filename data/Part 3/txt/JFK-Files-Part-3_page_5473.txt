Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall 
Re: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
Bureau file 100-446080 contains numerous communications 
from CIA concerning Stokely Carmichael's activities and travel 
during late 1967 and early 1968. These memo~anda included 
data concerning Cuban Intelligence Service ~ontacts with 
Carmichael and his travel, including trips to North Vietnam 
and Algeria. 
It is probable these memoranda were furnished FBI 
due to our interest in establishing the degree of foreign 
influence or funding in relation to Carmichael's activities 
in the U.S. 
Data on page 189 and in the memoranda furnished by CIA 
concerning Carmichael's whereabouts during this p~riod does 
not compromise or damage FBI operations or informants. 
Re page 283 
This page noted under date of 12/10/70 that "DDI" 
noted press accounts of Director Hoover's 11/19/70 statement 
reported that the Black Panthers are supported by terrorist 
organizations. This page reveals· that someone! with CIA had 
examined FBI's related files and also those of CIA and could 
locate no indication of any relationship between FEDAYEEN and 
the Black Panthers. This page revealed a CIA employee provided 
"Director," probably the CIA Director, with a memorandu.gi,-.on 
this topic. 
FBI Annual Report for the Fiscal Year 1970 released 
10/30/70 revealed the Black Panther Party (BPP) ideology showed 
an increasing emphasis on the teachings and writings of the 
Premier of North Korea; that BPP spokesmen repeatedly 
confirmed their.belief in Marxism-Leninism; that the inter­
national influence of BPP grew with support groups being organized 
in foreign countries; .and a BPP international staff was 
operating in Algeria. The Annual Report revealed the head of the 
BPP International Staff had established a relationship with 
Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla organization, which relationship 
had manifested an outpouring of anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist 
propaganda in the BPP newspaper ..
