Black Nationalist - South and Racial Informant Unit 
5 Supervisors including Supervisor in Charge 
5 clerical personnel 
1) There are no clerical vacancies in the 
Section; however, as it was noted previously, a request 
has been submitted for an additional clerk for the Black 
Nationalist - South and Racial Informant Unit which would 
·increase our complement to 23 if approved. 
' 2) Special Agent Supervisor C. ¥~~U¼.-~~ight, 
is under transfer to the Inspection Division, transfer 
letter dated January 8, 1971. A i•epl&(;0"T1E:1Tt. is bei~g 
requested. 
3)· With the transfer of Special Agent EnrigQt_ 
there will exist a shortage of o~e Supervisor in the 
Black Nationalist Unit - Central. 
4) The clerical personnel complement is inade­
quate and will be barely adequate if the request for one 
additional clerk is approved. The workload of the Secti9n 
continues to increase and shows no signs of tapering off. 
We will continue to closely watch the clerical situation 
and make appropriate recommendations as req\1.ired by any 
substantial change in the clerical workload~ 
5) The streamlining of our operations· wherever 
possible t9 effect manpower savings is under continual 
evaluation. Examples of streamlining measures taken since 
the last Inspection include: 1) The discontinuance by each 
field division of semiannual reports concer~ing the black 
nationalist movement (Bureau file 157-8415). This was accom­
plished July 6, 1970. 2) On November 3~ 1970; the Agitator 
Index was revised to delete those who were also included on 
the Security Index. 3) On November 5~ 1970, existing
