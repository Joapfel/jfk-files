; '£i ·; The· Attorney General called on 'the morning of ._/._~~-
~ -~ , February 27, 1965, to.advise he wanted to cons~lt with the ' 
' S @; ._. / Bureau on certain problems raised by the Long Committee r which 
; . '.§ f:':' ,' 4 is exploring the use of mail covers, et cetera. He noted there 
tfSi?i ~ ' was a possible problem concerning Chief Inspector Montague• s 
.... 
testimony and whether it was necessary for Montague to change 
his testimony. Also, he felt that Internal Revenue Service had' 
been using investigative techniques which they should not use· 
and this could pose a problem. He said that the President had 
asked him to coordinate with all executive agencies concerning .. 
the problems raised by the Long Committee. 
.-: 
Inspector Moore and.I met with the 'Attorney General in 
I his office this afternoon. Mr. Courtney Evans was present a I 
a\ told the Attorney General that 'in :Montague's testimony he was ., 
told by Attorney Fensterwald that if any of the questions had /i 
national security im_plications Montague should not answer them. 
\consequently, Montague was estopped from doing other th~n answer 
\in the negative when asked questions touching on national 
\security~ With this interpretation, it was questionable whether 
an attempt should be made to change or explain Montague's 
testimony, particularly in view of the obvious lack of judgment 
-:;6n the part of Fensterwald and the desire of !.ong for publicity. 
I made it clear to the Attorney General that from our dealings 
wi~h Montague, he was a man of integrity andS:l.crificed his 
personal desires for the welfare of the country and had cooperat 
~, lf~Jly witti us. The Attorney General said he had no intention 
. . , of :·_changing one word of 1!ontague • s testimony, but he was 
•• • considering advisiµg Long and Fensterwald that there were 
ex1reme delicate national security matters touching on the areas 
being ccvered by the .committee and there could be exceptions to 
the answers given in the testimony when they touched on such 
\
sensitive security matters. He said further that he contemplate 
seeing Senator Long and .,impressing on him that -che corn.mi t tee 
would not want to stumble by mistake into an area of extreme 
interest to the national security as they nearly did in a matter
