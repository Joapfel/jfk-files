or rather their expansion into it on intelligence 
matters. It ought not occur but this new memo 
of CIG shows how greedy it is. It is the 
Donovan plan almost in toto & is being slyly 
put over. It means we must zealously guard our 
domestic jurisdiction & ~ot yield an inch & be I 
ever alert ·t.Q resist any encroachment." 
On March 27, 1953, the Director testified before the 
Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations. In respon~e to a question 
from_ Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA, 
the Director stated: 0 There is close liaison. CIA has 
exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have 
exclusive jurisdiction within the United States. We maintain 
continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters in Wash:i.ngton through 
a liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate 
the transmission of material from them to us and from our 
.... service to them." 
• In October, 1958, CIA approached us requesting 
o~r con.c'-lrre:1.ce i.n CIA' s A~tabl.ishing physical and technical 
-surveillance in the United States on the[lirother of the then 
current-ruler of Yeme'"'fil CIA had an operational interest in 
this individual. By memorandum it was recommended that the 
Bureau not.become involved in this CIA operation and that CIA 
be informed that this would not establish a precedent for 
approval of future CIA activities in the United States. 
, Responsive to continuing to present problems, the Director 
noted: "This is an understatement particularcly if we are 
going to adopt a macaroni backbone attitude instead of standing 
up forthrightly for our rights and jurisdiction.!' 
f.:_ CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that ·one of its 
L.:Q;YPtian]sources would be visiting the United States, and 
requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage 
including technical surveillance. It was recommended we stay 1 • out of this matter and inform CIA that this ·was not to be 
......... construed as a precedent for approval of future CIA counter­
intelligence activity in the United States .. The Director 
commented on the memorandum: "The trend has gone so far we 
have become nothing but a rubber stamp for CIA yet they won't 
even allow us to perform liaison functions abroad much less 
.. operational ones . ,t
