to Jim Adams about the. remarks made by Senator :Morgan. _ • "·~ 
I have seen him briefly since he made these ~marks and _ • 
plan-ic;, _see him. next week again t.o talk over the reason for • 
these remarks at some length. As noted in hls·reaponse to 
you, apparently he bas. come to-this feeling as a result of the r 
so-called .. !'uncbaJlengec:f 1, matters which he has had reported . ·: • _-__ 
to him as a member of the Senate Select-Committee.- It is 
true that some mistakes _of the Bureau weN brought out, :hut· 
the over-all performance of the Bureau bas, as you said, -been 
well above that which could even be expected of us and cer- -
taialy- bu, _been most. contributory to the safety of this nati011· 
thTOUghout.-tbe years.( .To categorize-us as "rotten to the core" 
and to._indicate that we are a great threat to the United states -
miss the mark.tremendously and an completely without foun­
dati~:'\ I will-so· inform him, bat apparently he bas made up 
his mind and there is little- likelihood that we will have a 
convert.·
