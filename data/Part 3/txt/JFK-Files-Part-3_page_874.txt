murders of officials or police, etc) . A restrictive enumeration of spe~ific 
~ _acts which if threatened, but not to t~e extent of producing probable 
cause, would justify appeal to a court or magistrate for an intelligence 
electronic surveillance, might have some chance for passage. The 
judicial review would satisfy the 4th Amendment requirements; and a 
specific list of acts limited to major contemporary concerns would allow 
for item deletions and additions as conditions change. Such a specific 
.. - ., section to the bill would allow for not only effective judicial review, 
· • .but also effective Congressional review. 
Such a bill, in our opinion, should avoid mention of contro­
versial and difficult to define terms such as "domestic national security, 11 
11internal security, 11 "threats to the existence or structure of the Govern­
ment," and all terms with political connotations; and should use terms 
• emphasizing the aim of preventing serious crim~nal acts which threaten· 
... _ •• • life and limb (without mention of motivation, whether polit~cal or otherwise) . 
In ou:r opinion, such a bill should make intelligence elec-
• tronic surveillance available to both local and Federal agencies. It is 
envisioned that such a bill would cover purely local groups which, e.g. , 
threaten murder of local police officers, and groups national in scope, 
~. g. , Black Liberation Army. 
As discussed in the attached study, Title III and FRCrP 41 
do not seem to offer practical alternatives for this type of coverage.
