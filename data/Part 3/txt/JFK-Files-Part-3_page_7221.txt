flatly, as I have already, that CIA conducted a "massive 
illegal domestic intelligence operation." 
I have also submitted for the record a number ·of annexes 
to th.is statement, mostly in classified form, in order to set 
out fur the use of the Committee and its staff some further 
detail about our intelligence apparatus and its work. I am, 
of course, available for.further questioning here today and 
to cover classfied questions in Executive Session when this 
may prove to be necessary. I hope that out of -the Committee's 
work will come a better public understanding of the role 
and functionin9 of American intelligence today and that the 
Committee's recommendations for improvements in our authority, 
procedures, and protection may indeed be looked back on in the 
future as the initiation of a new era in American intelligence. 
Ne in American intelligence are proud ·to be of service 
·to our country, and we firmly believe that the personnel of 
American intelligence, and my predecessors in this post, have 
served their country well over the years. We are equally con­
vinced that our intelligence profession will serve the country 
well in the new era of Ame:(.ican intelligence being launched by
