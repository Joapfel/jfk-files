producing the best results. In our opinion this C be 
removed by the President's advising the S0cretary of 
State that the FBI is being authorized to develop 
penetrations in foreign diplom~tic establishments without 
obtaining; clc"-.ru.nccs :i:ro1n Stntc. It t✓0uld be und0i·stood 
that the Bureau uould proceed in a discreet and s0cure 
manner. Periodic contact with the Secretary of State or 
other top State offici~ls to discuss goncr~1 dovolop~cnts 
and any potential problems will pxovid0 a mechanism for 
heal thy coordination with State. \'le recogniz~ that a 
source can turn "sour" and, therefore, there is the danger

th~t our record in this regard has been outstanding over· 
the years. / 
Any efficient investigative agency needs sources 
. of all c::itegories ai.'1.d we are no e,cception. Therefore, we 
• should continue our present program of general source 
development, and this would include contacts who can 
produce information on an occasional basis or who-might 
be in a position to be of assistance in a particular 
investigation. In diplomatic establishments the reception 
clerk 1 . chauffeur, the m2.idj) _can always be of assistance. 
However, the prinary emphasis of this new program 
·would be directed toward high quality sources, such as: 
l) Code clerks 
2) Officials uho have access to files, records, 
or communications 
3) Officials or employees who are in·a position 
to penetrate communist-bloc circles or establishments 
4) Members of foreign intelligence and security 
services. 
Our existing programs of seeking penetrations in 
contJ~unist-bloc installations naturally must continue but 
will require an increased effort toward production of-
