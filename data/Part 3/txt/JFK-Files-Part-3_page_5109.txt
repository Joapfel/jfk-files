There was some question under Section 12 dealing with transfers to 
foreign assignments wherein it is set out that Chief Clerks should be afforded 
training in m.aintenance, consolidation, and destruction of files, whether this 
inform.ation should be furnished. This was discussed with Deputy Assistant 
Director, Hom.er R. Hauer, Files and Communications Division, who advised 
there is nothing objectionable to this reference regarding destruction of files 
and the reference of same need not be excised. 
Under Section 12, dealing with foreign assignments, information is 
set out regarding people being transferred to such assignments receiving 
training on coding equipm.ent, the AFSAM-7. This was questioned as to 
whether it should be excised. Alvin C. Frank, Section Chief, Comm.uni cations
