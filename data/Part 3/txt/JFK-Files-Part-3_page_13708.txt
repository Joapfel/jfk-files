Mr. Johnston.· And ·he told you before the 29th meeting that 
the first step would probably have to be the assassination of 
the Castros? 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. He never told me assassination becausj 
he didn't even like to use the word "assassination.• 
Mr. Johnston. What word did he like to use? 
AMLASH Case Officer. The neutralization, the elimination 
if you will, of the leadership. 
The first move in any coup attempt,· in order for the 
other officers to fall in line, would have to be the removal, 
the removal of Fidel Castro, because of the loyalties that!-e 
still had personally with some of the officers. 
Mr. Johnston. And after he told you that on October 
29th, you gave him an assurance that Robert Kennedy backed his 
proposal generally. 
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, the U.S. Government and 
Fitzgerald as ·the representative of Robert Kennedy, supported 
a coup against Castro. 
Mr. Johnston. On the very day of the assassination, you 
referenced the speechOf President Kennedy's talking about 
an ouster of the current regime in Cuba. 
l\MLJ\SH Case Officer. That's right. 
Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of the September 7th 
statement of Fidel Castro's, threatening the lives of U.S. 
TOP SECRET
