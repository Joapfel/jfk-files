TOP SECRET 2302 
is that correct? 
MR. BISSELL: That is correct. You should, the 
Commission should also understand that this would have been a 
very different kind of an operation than anything that the Agenc 
normally undertook in-that it would not have been carried out 
through DDP: that is, Agency operational.channels, or through an 
case officer in the blandestine service.· The possi&ility that 
seemed to exist was that through several intermediaries, the 
Office of Security or the Director of Secu~ity could be, and 
indeed, was in touch with individuals in Las Vegas, who claimed 
they, could make such an attempt using their own personnel. 
This possibility was discussed by me, again I think probably 
with Walt Rostow. It may possibly hav~ been discussed directly 
with.McGeorge Bundy, but I suspect that it was through Rostow 
who was then Bundy's assistant and.on his staff. My impression, 
but again I must emphasize that this is .an uncertain impression, 
is that I was encouraged .. :tq go ahead with. the investigation and 
planning of this operation, and by investigation I mean 
simply to find out what would be involvea·to make some asszssmen 
of the likelihood of success, and other aspects of the matter~ 
Under the circumstances, this had to be and was the 
respo~sibility of Shef Edwards.
