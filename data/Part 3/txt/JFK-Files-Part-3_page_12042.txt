c. Generally a thorough background investigation is completed on each 
individual selected to be a potential double agent before the Bureau authorizes 
him to be interviewed to determine if he is receptive and willing to assist 
and cooperate with the Bureau. These investigations are not completed wit½in a 
specified period. Several instances were noted wherein the national returned 
to his native country before the informant could develop suitable rapport. Review 
indicated several of these cases remain active although the national returned to 
his native country. 
d. After the Bureau has authorized the field office to develop the potential 
double agent, the field office sends in progress reports each 6 months (FD -401). 
In most instances only a slight social acquaintanceship is established over an 
extensive period. Field and SOG supervision of these cases appears to be 
mechanical and perfunctory and lacmimaginative, aggressive and timely 
direction. 
e. During the year 1970 there was an average of three communications 
per file received from the field. Most of these were semiannual reports. 
Communications from SOG to the field averaged less than one letter per 
file and in almost all instances this was a very short letter authorizing in -
vestigation and development of potential double agent. There were less than 10 
.cases noted where specific instructions, directions or other guidance was 
furnished to the field in developing these potential double agents. 
f. J!Q.. of the cases were reviewed at random for the specific purpose of 
• determining generally how long they had been pending. 4 cases had been pending 
prior to 1960;2_.were open in 196l;~in 1962; 1.in 1963;£in 1964;..§_in 1965;.lQ.. 
in l966; ,!!in 1967;1Q..in 1968;~in 1969; and~in 1970. The average case has 
been opened 3 1/2 years and there has been an average of one piece of outgoing 
correspondence from the Bureau in each file. 
. . 
Very little outgoing correspondence concerning instructions or directions 
were noted in theseJJJ1iiles. For example,2,..of the files reviewed had no out­
going correspondence in them since 1967. One file was reviewed in which the 
last outgoing correspondence was. in 1962. ·65 of these 110 files did not have any . .._ .......... outgoing correspondence in the last 12 -month period (1970). • 
Review of this program as indicated by the above observations, reveals 
that virtually no direction is given the program. Separate write -ups have 
been prepared on two individual cases where supervision has been most inadequate.
