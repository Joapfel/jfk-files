BLACK P .ANTHER PARTY 4H 
The Black Panther Party (BPP), a black extremist 
organization, continues to be extremely active throughout 
the country. Formed during late 1966 in Oakland, California, 
for the obstensible purpose of patrolling the black community 
to prevent alleged police brutality, it was originally known 
as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. 
_ It expanded rapidly throughout the United States 
during 1967w68,then suffered a gradual decline during 1969. 
Revitalized in December, 1969, and throughout the 1970s it 
hasc:gain currently expanded until today there are approximately 
48 branches of the BPP with an estimated 1,000 hard ... core 
members supported by many thousands of sympathizers. It also

include 17 chapters and 31 affiliated groups that masquerade 
under. the names of National Committee to Combat Fascism or 
Black Community Information Center. 
The ultimate goal of the BPP is the violent overthrow 
of the United States Government-and its replacement with a 
·Marxist .. i,eninist system. The BPP openly advocates urban 
guerrilla warfare, assassination of Government leaders and 
other forms of violent terrorism. Since its inception, the 
BPP has aimed its most vicious invectives against law 
enforcement and particularly local police. 0 0ff the pigs, ii 
·BPP jargon for "kill the cop" is the battle cry of the 
organization. The weekly Panther newspape~ 11The Black Panthe-r;'' 
and its other publications and propaganda paraphe-r·nalia are 
abound with articles and cartoons encouraging lethal attacks 
against police and other forms_of authority. 
Our investigation of the BPP was instituted in 1967 
and since that.time has expanded as the organization-itself 
expanded.
