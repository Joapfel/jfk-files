Other Factors on Which Castro's Subversive Capa.bility Will Depend 
17. If the US and USSR reach and implement the agreement stated -
in the problem Castro will gain an immunity which he lacked before the , 
missile _base crisis. He will, furthermore, still have most of the arms 
and equipment which were delivered in the post-July buildup, as well -
as enhanced capabilities provided by accelerated training. Presumably 
his enemies will have about the same, or less, freedom to engage in 
propaganda, sabotage, support for resistance activities, and other actions 
designed to overthrow Castro than _ they had before the crisis-almost 
certainly not more. Unless Castro is gravely endangered by internal 
political and economi~. problems, there is no reason to believe that anti­
Castro activities-are"any more likely to jeopardize his position than they 
did b~tore-th·e crisis. • • • -----
~-18. Situation in Cuba. Castro's ability to engage in sub;ersive activ-
__..---------- ities will be influenced significantly by the strength and stability of his 
position at home. Heightened political and economic difficulties in 
Cuba would restrict Castro's subversive effort, while the more secure 
he is at home, the more freedom and strength he is likely to have for 
subverting other governments an_d re-establishing his prestige and in­
fluence. Castro's position in Cuba will depend in part on his own 
policies, but is likely to depend even more upon those of the Soviets. 
19. Alternative Soviet policies. There are several courses of action 
with respect to Cuba which the ,Soviets are likely to consider. Some 
leaders may argue that the whole policy of economic and military 
support for Castro should be abandoned along with the plan for the 
deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. We believe, however, that 
the Soviet stake in Cuba as an ally and as a Soviet center in Latin 
America is still too high to abandon. The stake in Castro as a person, 
however, is questionable. If the Soviets did make a decision to with-

tro's stocks of small arms would not in themselves change his capa­
bility for subv~rsive activity, as he already has supplies of surplus arms. 
However, if the Soviets were to· provide substantial additional air and
