In November, 1970, as a result of counterintelli­
gence measures taken, we were successful in causing the 
resignation of ~.. Me~l.X.lP.....§..~t-~~~~...J_mn..E1.~i .. a,l_KJJ..,gu1lP·:

in that he actua,1,ly.,..J;.~~c during the time Shelton was 
in prison. •

The 1970 National Klonvokation of the UKA was held 
at the Ramada Inn, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on November 28-29 1 
1970. At this Klonvokation, Rober..t M.10 S .. h~l""t~qn{ was again 
elected J;!!t,,12.eri~!J.t~z~d_to serve for three years. During a 
speech he macte at the Klonvokation, Shelto.n. stated (and has 
since reiterated his feelings to high-ranking members of the 
UKA who are racial informants of this Bureau) that he 
definitely plans to use a polygraph machine and possibly 
to utilize sodium peritothal (truth serum) on all Klan officials 
and members in order to ferret out FBI informants. Sh~l~~­
in 1967, also had plans to utilize a polygraph machine and 
truth serum on Klan members in order to learn the identity of 
FBI informants. At that time, we used counterintelligence 
techniques.in various forms incluuing a pres~ ~elease in o~d~~ 
to discourage&u~lta~in this regard. It is to be noted that 
many of our sensitive racial informants are in high-rankiJ~g l:ilfr: ? r ~ .,._,,~· •.-~~,re;s:Cf½~

In order to again discourage Shelton in his 
desires in this regard, it was recommended oni/5/71 that 
a press release be provided to reliable news sources through 
Assistant Director Bishop's office. Our desire is that we 
will discredit .§<b.~lt_on. .. and frustrate his attempts by exposing 
his desires to thegiare of publicity. The news release 
pointed out that~JJ,.,~AtB&is losing control ~~-8~....§....,§UP.f>~~­
and ib,.4.;t_fil},e.1:1.2.n,is attempting to maintain control of ~he_ 
KJan_by threats against anyone who criticizes him. The news 
release also pointed out that the Klan, which expresses 
patriotism and democratic ideals, must resort to gestapo-like 
tactics to hold ,its members in line. 
The above are highlights of results of Bureau 
investigations into these matters. Many other disseminations 
made throughout 1970 have resulted in the curtailment of 
activity and disenchantment with the Klan and other white hate 
group organizations.
