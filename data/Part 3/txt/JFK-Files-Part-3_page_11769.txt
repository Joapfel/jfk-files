(classification J.76) and certain types o.f. bombi.ng matter cases he transferred frv!'r.:. 
GID to DID.. \Vith resped to the new FBI jud.sdiction in Antiriot Laws, it ·\i.'as p::;i.:: 
out in this memorandum that -extremist organbations and individuals ·who ,vill liks~:

of ;,vork handled in DID such as bombing of diplomatic esta.blishments and bombin;s 
ad sing out oI activiij,es of groups in the rr:.cial field and internal security· field. 
Following submission of this· memorandum, Assistant to the Directo::..~ DeLoach 
proposed and· it ,vas Rpproved that Inspection Division thoroughlir survey the entire 
question in order to dra,v appropriate gujd?l.in.es and clearly define r.esponsihUitie.s

bili~y in these matterso 
Thorough analysis ha.s been rn.acle b}7 Inspection Staff of aJl aspects of fo.e 
proi,osal and 1ncans to accomplish it in the most practicRble manner~ including 
reviews of representative ca.ses that have been handled under these cate~ories ?.r:d 
the overall voJume and "l.vork load represented. The logic of the proposed re­
assigmnents appears unassailable. In both m:i~tegories of. cases the principle in.,;cl-;· 
is the same, namely; that inclividu8.l vioia.tioris of applicable sta.tutcs arising fron'l 
the activities of subversive or·g::tnizations 01~ groups should be supervised ,vithin th-_ 
san1e di\:Ision (DID) that has the basic and continuing responsibility for st:.pGrvisio:1 
of the overall investigations of these organizations and groups as well as of the 
me111bers thereof and ihe development of j_nfonn:.:uts within the groups_., The obvio:..: 
benefit to he derived from the reassigrn11cnt of these cater;ories is the Rvoidan.ce o'i 
duplication of supervisory reviews of these interrelated matters and the ready 
identific:1tion of incU.viduats who may be involved in a ·specific violation v.1ilh pc1·so:i. 
already under investigation :(.1:0111· an intelligence standpoirit. Informants who m2.y­
be utilized jn specific vlolatimis or who arc clev~lopcd in the course of investig,,.tio: 
of such violations must of necessity be closely correlated with the supcrvi~:ion c,f 
these informant programs wh:lch now rests \'lith DID. Furthermore, violations of 
the new Antiriot Lavis may well be revealed in the course of general supervision 
of ~·acial intelligence malte;·s .. • •
