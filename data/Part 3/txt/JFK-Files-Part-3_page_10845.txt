with the Bureau during World War II. It was during 
these years that an atmosphere of mistrust and lack of 
confidence was createdo 
3) CIA was G~tablished as our first over-all, 
worldwide intelligence ~gency. The events and the 
maneuvering which led to this certainly.did not bring 
with -'chem a harmonious relationship. 
4) Unfortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast, 
particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and 
developments such as the Korean War. The Agency did not 
jell effectively as an organization, and with this came 
numerous difficulties, many of which exist to this day& 
5) Each organization has lacked adequate 
knowledge of the other's operational machinery,· objectives, 
and "ways and means of doing things." 
6) An element of rivalry actually developed over 
the years, and this, when not ~empered with prudence and 
sound judgment, creates unhealthy situationso 
7) A growing tendency on the part of CIA to 
expand its operational activities not originally contemplated 
• in the formation of that agency. 
It can be recognized that with this background it 
has not been an easy matter to establish a good working 
relationship with CIA without frequent conflicts, and 
sometimes agonizing negotiations. It could be suggested 
that the ideal situation would be to remove CIA from the· 
U.S. with the understanding that we would assume respon­
sibility for any and all activity in the intelligence field. 
As described in another section of this report, such a 
move would be highly infeasible for the Bureau.
