ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
The key to developing racial information on a regular 
and current basis is the operation and develo·pment of quality 
informants along with intensified investigation. In this 
regard we have increased the number of our racial informants 
since the last Inspection by 1., 699,. which brings our total 
number of informants to 7,184. In addition, we are continually 
intensifying our investigations and in line witb our need for

Racial informants have been furnishing a steady flow 
0£ valuable racial information which information has brought 
about the apprehension of badly wanted extremist fugitives, 
the confiscation of explosives and firearms in the possession of 
extremists, the prevention of violence and the saving of lives. 
In addition, these informants furnished valuable racial 
intelligence on a regular basis which intelligence included 
information concerning foreign influence, the Black Panther Party 
(BPP) underground as well as discussions by extremists as to 
South .American style kidnapping of government officials and threats 
to kill the President. 
It is significant to note that since the last Inspection 
racial informants have been responsible for bringing about the 
arrest of 510 individuals, 342 of which were local arrests and 
168 Federal arrests as well as being responsible for the recovery 
of $330,179.03. 
In order to improve our investigations and racial 
informant coverage in addition to our .regular supervision 
furnished from the Seat of Government we held a two-day conference 
with racial supervisors from 39 field offices plus two legal 
attaches. The topics discussed at the conference covered the
