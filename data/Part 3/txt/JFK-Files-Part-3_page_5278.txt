Item (F) is accurate and, although its disclosure is 
confirmatory no serious technical damage would result from its 
disclosure. To our lmowledge, there has been no diplomatic 
protest, disclosure could precipitate such protest. Intelligence 
Division may wish to comment regarding this possibility. 
Item (G) asserts that in one case it is lmown that CIA 
equipment was used against a "domestic target. " This is insufficient 
information to identify this matter.
