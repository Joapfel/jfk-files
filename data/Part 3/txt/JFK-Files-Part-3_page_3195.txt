·Inn Hotel. But it· didn't have any, at least the newspaper 
article itseif didn't have any direct. relation to acts taken.

was critical of him during that period for staying in the 
white hotel, but I don't want to make a big issue out of 
that.

name to ~s, I would appreciate.it .

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Adamp, was any effort .. 
made during this entire·coINTELPRO period to objectively 
define what the New Le·ft I)leant? What was your understanding
