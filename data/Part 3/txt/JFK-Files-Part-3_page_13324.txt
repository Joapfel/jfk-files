commented on the fact that Os\vald had obt~ined employment in this 
country in a photographic firm through a Russian friend. He thought 
· this might have a possible bearing on any cl~ndestine communications 
systems he might have received from the Soviets. 
5. Ivlembers of :rv1r. Rankin's staff then commented on the testi­
mony of l\1rs. Os\vald to the effect that the letters from her son regard­
ing his desire to return to the United States had the appearance of being 
dictated since they cont~ined none of his usu2.l grammatical er·rors and 
used legal language ,vith ,vhich he ,voulcl not have been familiar.. In this 
connection, the fact that Lee Os\vald .... vrote to the En1bassy requesting 
• 
help in arranging his return to the U.S. soon after receipt by the Embassy 
of a telegram from the Department reporting on correspondence ,vith. 
Oswald's mother seemed to indicate to members-of Mr. Ran!dn's staff 
that the Soviets might have had access in some fashion to the contents 
of the telegram .. They did not believe it \Vas coincidental that Os,vald 7 s 
letter to the Embassy came i1nmediately on the heels of the telegram 
from the Department. This led to a discussion of the 2ppearance in the 
press of another telegram or report, from the Embassy in J\1osco\v to 
the Department. Mr. Ra11-1dn said h~ _,vould underta!-ce to clarify this. 
6. Mr. Willems noted that Mrs. Os\vald had introduced a state­
ment to the effect that she suspected her son to be a CIA agent. 1vlr. 
\Ville ms asked. ,vhether in fact Os\vald had been a CIA agent.. _ Wrr., Helms 
replied that he had not been. :tvir. "\Villems then asked if. there ,vere any~

interjected the vie\v that the Commission had not.adopted this procedure 
,vith other agencies and v1ondered ,vhether there \Vas not some \Vay to 
clarify this point more effectively ior the Commission. One suggestion·

7. A considerable part of the meeting from this point for,vard 
consisted· of a revie,v by :rvir. Rankin and his staff of the gaps in their 
investigation to date. They noted that the most significant gap appeared
