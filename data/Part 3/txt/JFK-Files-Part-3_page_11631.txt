SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM 
• I 
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY AND NEW LEFT ORGANIZATIONS 
At the time of the last inspection in January, 
1971, the Internal Security Section handled informants 
only in the basic revolutionary organizations and related 
groups. There was no Security Informant Unit as such, 
informants being handled on subversive organization 
desks. On June 16, 1971, a Security Informant Unit was 
formed and this Unit now handles informants in the 
New Left field as well as in basic revolutionary 
organizations and related groups.

At last insoection there were 264 member informants 
in the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA); at present there aTe 
226, a ctecrease of 38. At last inspection there were 31 
member.informants in the Socialist Workers Party (SwPr;--
at present there are 48, an increase of 17. As of 
July 31, 1971, date of latest monthly tabulation, the 
Secur1:ty 'Informant uni i:; hancileci a ·i,o ca.i U.L 795 secui: i i.y 
informants and 671 potential security informants, a total 
of 1,466. This iri:::ilildes 630 informant cases transferred 
from"lhe New Left Sectiori'""to the Security Informant Unit 
in the Internal Security Section on June 16, 1971. 
There has been continuing recognition of the 
, fact th~re must be no letdown in maint~ining adequate 
informant coverage. However, economy has increasingly 
become a primary factor. In line with the President's 
message on August 15., 1971, tightening economic contro]s 
and our continuing efforts to hold down expenditures, the 
field is being instructed by letter to all offices to cut 
down payments to security and extremist informants and 
sources by five percent. To assure uniformity and fairness 
in the application of thiscutback throughout the field, 
·each office was instructed to follow this formula: 
Total expenditures.for all such informants and sources 
rfor the six month period ending July 31, 1971; reduce 
'this total by five percent; divide the resulting figure 
by six (months). The resulting figur~ ts to be the 
guideline for each office.
