MR. KELLEY: 
QUESTION: 
MR. KELLEY: 
No sir, he does not have to have but we inform him that­
he may have ·if he so desires. 
During your -confirmation hearings two years ago., 
you advocated or said that you would like to see 
more Congressional oversight of the FBI. You think now 
that there's too much, just about right, or not en?ugh 
oversight? 
It is true that I said during my confirmation that I do 
not object to FBI Congressional oversight. One has been 
established and I have met with them on several occasions 
to set an oversight committee. There is also a House 
so-called oversight committee--it's the House Judiciary 
Committee--there are others who may by virtue of their 
jurisdiction feel that they, too, have oversight. We do 
no oppose House oversight. Frankly, I would like to have 
a joint committee of oversight so that we can know 
precisely to whom we should report and they, in turn, know 
precisely to whom any oversight problems can be referred. 
Basically, in other words, I do not object to oversight--
I do think that it would be much better if we could have 
it well-structured so t4at it will be clearly understood 
by all parties concerned as to what they are going to do 
and-how they are to do it.
