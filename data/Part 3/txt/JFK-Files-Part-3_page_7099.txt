The Honorable Frank Church 
Chairman 
Select Committee to Study 
Operations with Respect 
Activities 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 20510 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
Governmental 
to Intelligence 
This letter will confirm and reduce to writing some 
of the matters agreed upon at our recent meeting. 
At the outset, I should like to express my deep 
personal appreciation for the candor and helpfulness of 
you and Senator Tower in that meeting and for your 
sensitivity to the respective responsibilities under our 
Constitutional framework of the Select Committee and the 
Central Intelligence Agency in the area of your review. 
For my part, I should like to renew again, for myself and 
the CIA, my promise of cooperation with respect to the 
important work of the Select Committee. In my judgment, 
a spirit of good faith and cooperative effort is not only 
necessary to enable your Committee to discharge its 
responsibilities fully and expeditiously, but is indeed in 
the best interests of the intelligence community as well. 
I am convinced that a responsible and thorough review of 
U.S. intelligence activities will serve to vindicate the 
CIA and enhance the public's understanding of the important 
contribution that the intelligence efforts of this nation 
can make toward the goal of preserving and strengthening 
our democracy.
