Memorandum. c. D,, Brennan to lfti c. Sullivan 
no: ADEQUACY OF PEllSOH1IBL 
l!r. Felt's memorandum 8/4/71 indicates be -discussed the manpower 
.. problem on the leak ca·s-es with Wannall :i1ho said his ,pr,obleras had now 
become so grent he would need 2 more meu for a total of 7 . 
.. !a line with Mr. Felt's stated intention to init-iata e.n overall 
study of the matter, I had Mr. Wanuall submit to me• an ovorall analysis 
o-f his manpower and rork load aa it relates to t,he le11:k cases in his 
section. Set forth are the case load .i±gm.!etl ,fbr Mr. -Waunall r a section 
from March l - August l, 1971:

When tho Ells~..E,K case first broke, Wannall assured. me _he was 
using his existing. manpo1!•er to the fullest exte11t possible and needed 
temporarily assistance from other sections to carry on the other heavy 
burdens of his section, but the case lo.ad figul"0.S now availa.ble for the 
six-week period 1'rom fi/l5iJ1 ~o B/1/71 sim ... -i' tha:t. ali Viitv.nall •did was pi,;;_ 
his own .roan on the special (5 men) and borrow manpower ).(5 men) from othe.::­
eections to keep 'his ··oth~:r problel'JS • iY1 hand at the sacrifice of other 
sections with equally or even more burden...~mo p~oblerus. 
This is ·shown by the fact that for June s.nd .• July the case load 
average in Wann.all's sect.ion while handl:i.ng the Ells berg case was 292 
and .294 respectively as contrast.ed to n: Division case foad average fer 
a11 sections during ~he same period of 339 and 335. This does not eve2 
talte .into consideration that he has 5 highly axperienced and qualified 
•Supervisors in the Special Coordination Unit whom he does not include i]! 
his case load count. He could l1ave ili .. awn on at least one of these men 
for special assignment in an emm. .. gency . but did not-. 
Actually, it ~snow clear that Wannall responded in the initial 
stage of. his problem with a panicky, premature request for additional 
manpower ;,.s he subsequently did through his observation to Ur. Felt that 
he needed still 2 more men. In effect, Wanuall put DID in the untenable 
position of giving Mr. Felt an off-the-cuff assesst'lentof what he 
considered to be an "enormous" problem. and a need tor still 2 mere men 
unsupported by facts and oblivious to the problems of the Division as 
a who1e. As a matter of fact, one. of the leak cases which caused Wann.all 
_.great alarm was referred to us by the Depart~ent on 8/2/71~ By letter 
dated 8/9/71 Wann.all advised tho Department thn.t we had condticted ona 
interview which showed that prosecution could not be entertained and 
accordingly woul.d condt..•\1t no further investigation in the absence of
