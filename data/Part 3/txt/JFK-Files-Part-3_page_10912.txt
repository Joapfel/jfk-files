I The report noted another broad field requiring 
coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived from 
domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter­
intelligence, This includes the oxploi ta tion of in tolligonce 
from United States business firms, travellers, etc,, exploitation 
of the intelligence possibilities of groups and indj_viduals of • 
foreign nationality in the United Sta tos, tho :i::olating o:C 
domestic counterintelligence to foreign intelligence and the 
coordination of domestic counterespionage with counterespionage 
abroad, Except for the exploitation of private sources of 
foreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized 
in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for·other 
activitj_es is scattered among the State Department, the armed • 
services, the FBI and CIA. 
The FBI, which has primary security and law enforce­
ment responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important 
area of intelligence. This includes domestic counterespionage 
.,and countersabotage, control of conununist and other subversive 
activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups.

manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence 
were related to overall national intelligence in.order to serve

of national secui .. i ty." 
It was the opinion of the authors of the Dulles Report· 
that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the 
problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence 
and counterintelligence which relate to the national security.· 
and CIA should subroi t recommendations on this·. subject to the
