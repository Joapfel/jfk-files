OLSEN: Now let\s move on to what the relationship is between 
the Cuban crime syndicate and it.s relation. to the American crime syndicate, the 
anti-Castro movement in south. Florida, and the assassination of the Presi-
dent. What is the connection? Do I understand from you, Frank, that after 
the Bay of Pigs operation that there was a great deal of hostility to 
President Kennedy· and Senator Robert Kennedy on the paTt of th.e anti-Castro 
Cubans in south Florida. 
STURGIS: Righ-t. Yes, sir, there was. 
OLSEN: ·And do r understand further that it is your thought that 
because this anti-Castro movement in south Florida also included a lot of 
th.e crime syndicate people from both the United States and Cuba -­
STURGIS: Yes, sir. (_interrupting) 
OLSEN: -that therefore th.ere was a capability as well as motivation 
for killing President Kennedy. 
STURGIS: r believe from the infonnation and discussions that I have 
had in th.e Cuban colony that the thing was more against Bobby Kennedy because 
he was th.e top law enforcement official in this country, that if --you know 
like "Hey, if you get rid of Bobby· Kennedy., you still got his brother which 
is PresideRt Kennedy·." So the thing was to -- the hostility was then put 
off against President Kennedy. 
OLSEN: So assuming that there was both a strong enough motivation 
on the part of these elements, crime elements within the anti-Castro group., 
to kill the President and that there was the capability also to do it, do 
you have any evidence indicating that the killing of President Kennedy 
in Dallas was actually carried out by people who were involved in this 
anti-Castro movement in Florida?
