Mr.~ M1.irphy wondered what spee:i.fically ho.d caused. the d.'.cision 
• to be made to transfer from CIA to Sti.C the respon3Jb:Ll.i ty' for re­
conna.:Lssance of· Cuba. Mr. Ml :phy thought th_at a.n unc.•.)rstanding of 
the reasons for· this shift of resiionG:i. bill ty is, lmpor tan t b~c 2.use 
the Boari itself seemed to have been obliv10us t.o de·1elopments 
which were of such a nature. as to \·rarrant- the steoped-up· cover2ge 
by SAC. Mr. Gray's comment on this was to the effect that he hacl 
noted nn uncertainty in the pa.st.,.with regard to \·rheth0r the problem 
of Cuba had been removed from the Board I s area of responsibility. 
Mr. Gray re 1~alled r.ema:i:iks by. the Chair-,nan at a Boa.rd meeting last 
oummer ind}_cating that the Cuba situation v·1as being looked at els~­
\.•.'he~e .ih Government. Therefore, Mr.· Gray thought the_t .if in fac~ 
the Board's responsibil1 ty extends to Cuba. th:ts should be ri·1acle clear 
for the benefit of the Buard. In Mr. Gray 1 s opinion j_f the Board 
in fact had ~uch a responsibility, then the 1 Board should have been 
addressing -its elf to the Jmplications of public statement3 such as 1 
those being made by Senator Keating an}. ot-hers., Rnd particularly 
the Gtaternent by Senator Keating· on October .10-, 1962, that ballistic 
missile Jnstall,ations _were being constructed In Cuba. 
• Ac ting Chairman Baker informed the Boar'J that he had confirmed 
wl th the ChaJ.rman that the Chairman I s rP.mark.s , at the la.st su1rJT1er 's 
Baird rn~eting were intended, io convPy that it ,~as only in the 
NSC. 5412/2 area that Cuba matter8 where being handled outside the 
purview of the Board. 
. Continui1:r-:;, Mr. Gray said tha.t it ~,as a matter of personal 
reg~et to him that the;public statements ~y Senators Keating, 
Hu.tnphry and others had riot served to flag the situat:lon.
