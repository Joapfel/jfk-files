FBI has ever had an opportunity to know and appreciate the 
full extent of tile domestic. surveillance program that was 
then being conducted. 
Thus we see t-~at just ~s·in the case of the CIA the 
key issue was accountapiiity: How we ·can assure that the 
secret instruments ot government are accountable to the 
people,.the Congress and.the law. 
It is clear that the FBI's authority for these programs 
is essentially non-existento I~ no~ persuaded that the 
secret Presidential orders of.President Roosevelt support the 
, 
Domestic Intelligence program, and even if it did, I do 
not believe that -any President has the authority to order the 
FBI or anyone else to spy· on Americans, to burgle their homes, 
to wiretap them, to open their mail or to blackmail them. 
One of the most disturbing aspects of this. affair is 
that t-~e FBI never paid .very much attention to whether their 
activities w-ere authorized or not or whether they were legal 
and constitutional. One former· senior intel·ligence offict!.:r 
has testified that he never once heard a discussion about 
legality· ~r constitutionality. Most governments in history 
have relied on some form 0£ police p~wer to determine what 
views would prevail in their society~ However,·Ame.rica was 
• ba·sed on the. rev0lutionary "c:oncept that the people should 
decid·e what is right and what is wrong, what .is acceptable 
and what is not.
