Mr. Johnson.said that·as State Department representative·on the 
Sp~cial G~oup ha tries t6 do the difficult job of viewing the risks against 
the gains 1.nvolvedin proposed covert actions. Issues rarely·arise in the 
Sp,ecial Group: ·because problems are first staffed in the member agencies. 
Irt State Mr. Johnson is staffed by Mr. Scqtt of INR who maintains contacts 
with FBI and CIA ~- the. relation with FBI having been recently regularized 
as· had been done-earlier in the case of CIA. _Mro Scott consults Mr. Johnson 
on all covert operations and any issues, and also focuses on NRO matters 
for Mro Johnson. In. all, Mr. Johnson .feels ·that the Special Group system is sa~i .. 
factory. He acknowledged~ however, that the Special Group does not have a pro- 1/

As for State's relations with the P~esident's Foreign Int~lligence 
Advisory Board, Mr. Johnson recalled that one problem arose with the Board's 
November 22-·report on the Dunlap case, which caused him considerable concern -­
particularly the discussion language supporting the Board's recommendations on 
subjects involving State, CIA and FBI. Mr~ Johnson thought that he should 
have been given an opportunity to comment to the Boar.d concerning the FBI and 
CIA complaints which were reflected in the tecommendations·. • 
Mr. ,Coyne then gave Mr. Johnson sofu.e of the background of one of the 
Board's -recommendations which involved State~.CIA--FBI and which pertained to, a 
• development of such serisit:ivity as to closely restrict the Board's disclosure 
of.·it. (Mr. Coyne took th~ initiative, after the Panel meeting, to suggest to 
FBI that Mr. Johnson be briefed on this sensitive item, in order.that State 
Department might be in a position to assist, and not unwittingly hinder, 
related operations of FBI and CIA interest abroad. FBI did this soo·n afterward, a d 
Mro _Johnson expressed to Mro Coyne his satisfaction at this handling of the 
mattero) 
Mr. Murphy next brought up the subject of the recently discovered audio 
penetration.of·the U.S. Embassy., Moscow.· Mro Murphy noted that the preliminary 
USIB damage assessment contained State Department comments to the effect that I . . 
the comprom~e was not too serious, and he wondered if this accurately re--
fleeted the State Depart;:ment v,iew ·9f the matter. Mr. Johnson said that during 
the audio p_enetration p.eriod the State Department senJ many messages to our 
Ambassador in-Moscow, telling him to make certain representations to the Soviets; 
and in turn the Ambassador sent messages to Washington report~ng on what he had 
said to .the Sov-iets and what they said to him; .[O, M:r_ ... '""'Johns.on_felt ... that ... no
