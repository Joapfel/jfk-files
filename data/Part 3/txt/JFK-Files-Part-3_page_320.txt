Attached New York teletype advises of infornia tion i l 
from former Bureau Agent, who is a curr.ent informative ass0t,' '"\,,,. •• 
L, i-,r.4 
that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Operations 
(SSCIO) has become a .. vare of Jaffe's allegatj_ons that tl1e FBI 
has taken actions which have prevented hi1r.. from obt2,ining 01· 
keeping a job in the news media field. Jaffe claims th~~t his 
association with Bureau Agents with regard to Soviet intel­
ligence 1,1a tters cooled off after he was identified by a Soviet 
efecto~ as cooperating with Soviet Intelligence and that the 
FBI has since deprived him from making a living in his profes­
sion. The SSCIO is looking :into Jaffe' s situation to determine 
if his allegations are true and if the FDI can be prEv8nted 
from takine such actions in other similar situations. C.
