Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
that the Bureau had furnished former SA Sentinella a detailed briefing of his 
rights and a briefing as to what was contained in the Rules of the Committee 
prior to his interview. Mr. 0 'Conner again requested that we prepare a letter 
protesting this matter. 
It is not felt that a letter concerning this particular matter should 
be directed to Senator Church in view of Mr. Elliff' s statement that this 
incident will not be repeated in the future. It is felt that our oral protest to the 
Committee is sufficient at this point, especially inasmuch as they accepted the 
limitations placed on the testimony of former SA Sentinella by the Department. 
It would appear we could expect to achieve very little by sending such a letter 
at this time ..
