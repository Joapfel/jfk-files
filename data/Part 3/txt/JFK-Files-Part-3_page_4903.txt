MM 92-1870 
HACKER said he listened to the proposition only 
to ascertain the extent of ROTHMAN's interest in muscltng 
in on the Hotel Workers Union. He said he then presented 
this proposition to JACK WEINBURGER, formerly Organizational 
Secretary, now General Secretary of the Union. WEINBURGER, 
stated that this must be discussed with ED MILLER, who . 
agreed with the proposal, except the appointment of ROTHMAN 
as International Representative. MILLER indicated he would 
get around this somehow. In December, 1954, HACKER was 
telephonically contacted by ED MILLER and im,tructed to tuim 
over the affairs of Local 255 to one ALBERT BERLIN, a former 
associate of the gangster element. This appointment in 
HACKER's opinion indicated ROTHMAN had gotten to MILLER, 
apparently through ROGER LEBENNER, Business Agent for Local 
133 of the Hotel Workers Union, and that MILLER was working 
with ROTHMAN. HACKER stated he could nev~r work with 
MILLER and resigned on December 13, 1954. HACKER stated 
that in April, 1955, the first hotel in Miami Beach .was 
struck by the Hotel Workers Union, and the strike which 
presently involves 22 hotels is still going on. The Hotel 
Workers Union is pouring $120,000 a month into this strike. 
He can only conclude the hotel operators did not accede to 
ROTHMAN's shakedown. He is convinced, however, that ROTHMAN 
made the attempt, and that MILLER is cooperating with him. 
On July 30, 1956, AL MANHEIM advised that ABE 
GOODMAN was in the bolita business in Cuba with ELI QUAIN 
and NORMAN ROTHMAN • 
On July 30, 1956, NORMAN ROTHMAN, Chicago, 
Illinois, shipped 32,800 pounds of gambling equipment 
to NORMAN ROTHMAN, Miami, Florida. The equipment arrived 
in Miami, Florida, on August 3~ 1956, and was located at 
Tamiami Tours, Inc., Transport Copany. The U. S. Attorney, 
Miami, Florida, authorized the seizure of this equipment; 
and the equipment was seized on August 6, 1956, and turned 
over to the US Marshal on August 7, 1956. Prosecution of 
ROTHMAN was declined by the US Attorney 9 s Office, Miami, 
Florida, and the gambling equipment was destroyed.
