GOVEP.NMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
nFBI documents obtained by_ the committee indicate 
that Dorsett, who was disenchanted with KKK Grand Dragon 
J. Robert Jones of Granite Quarry and with Imperiel Wizard 
Robert Shelton of Tuscaloosa, Ala., was encouraged by the FBI 
to leave·the Klan in the summer of 1967' and form the 
Confederate Knights of-the Ku Klux Klan. The FBI helped 
Dorsett draft.letters recruiting for the new group, according 
to the committee source. 
"According to the documents, the FBI's plan was to 
harass the KKK a.nd to dilute the ·influence of the United Klans 
and to keep closer tabs on the new group. 
"Sen. Robert Morgan, D. N.C., a member of the 
committee said last week that charters for some 41 new Klaverns 
or chapters of the Confederate Klan were issued, but that not 
all charters resulted in active new Klan groups."
