"Detailed study of organization and activities of 
intelligence divisions of the Government, including CIA, is 
being made by a committee consisting of Messrs. Allen Dulles, 
William H. Jaclcson, and Mathi::ts Correa, assisted by a staff 
of .four directed by Mr. Robert Blum of the Office of 
Secretary of Defense. 11 With this statement it may be assumed 
the Task Force excused omissions it may have made with the 
observation that the Dulles group was conducting almost the 
same survey carried on in the Hoover Commission sb far as 
.CIA was involved. 
(lb) Clarlc Task Force Report 
The Task Force headed by General Mark Clark 
submitted a Top Secret report dated in May, 1955, setting 
forth results of the second Hoover Commission survey of the 
organization of CIA. The report pointed out the survey 
was of departments and agencies with entire or prime 
~ responsibility in the field of positive foreign intelligence 
as it pertains to national defense and security. It

Again the Hoover Commission through its 'fask 
Force pinned CIA jurisdiction down to the areas defined by statute, 
and emphasized the Agency was subordinate only to the National 
.. Security Council in its coordination, correlation, dissemination 
'and·collection of intelligence data. The Task Force noted 
that since CIA is charged with the over-all responsibility 
for coordinating the output of all intelligence forces, the 
Task Force was giving special attention to the work of that 
Agencyo 
In the Task Force Report a review of the FBI 
functions in the intelligence comi.~unity was set forth. The 
committee noted that the FBI had only limited activities in the 
pos:i,tive intelligence field but noted additionally that FBI 
functions in the current intelligence effort were of .interest ., •.• ,
