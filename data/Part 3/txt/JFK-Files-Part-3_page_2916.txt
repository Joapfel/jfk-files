your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this 
basic charter that we write. 
Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one 
or two of mine. I would like your response. 
If we were to write into the law that any order.given you 
either by the President or by the Attorney General should be 
transmitted in Hriting and should clearly state the objective 
and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain 
those written orders and that furthermore they would be 
available-to any oversight co:mraittee of the Congress. If the 
joint coE1TI1ittee on intelligence is established, that committee 
would have acc"ess to such a file. 
So that the committee itself would be satisfied that 
orders were not being given to the FBI that were improper or 
unlawful. 
~-?hat ·would you think of writing a provision of that kind 
into a charter for the FBI? 
Hr. Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order 
issued by_ the President that is a request for action by the 
Attorney General should. be in ·writing, is certainly, in my 
-opinion, is a very plausible solution. I'm sure that in
