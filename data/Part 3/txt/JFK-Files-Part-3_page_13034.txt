realize that If these two pieces 
of paper were Implemented they 
woUld be In their rraves toolght 
because the constltutloo and the

Impetus necessary to brlnr this

tem to Its doom. 
U S,A. fascl•ts have compiled 
and are sUII evaluating Informa­
tion received from SOUtb Amer­
ican satelllte states who are being 
beset by courageous urban guer­
rillas waging relentless struggle 
with amazlng(to fa•clsts)and stun­
ning success. Eldridge Cleaver, 
Minister of Information ol the 
Black Panther Party, has said that 
we still have a little time left 
because the U,S.A fascist ruling 
clique hasn't programmed all of 
the people to accept the genocide 
ol the Party and our people yet. 
For at least a year oow, there 
have appeared In every major 
newspaper. seemingly innocent 
space llllers. Articles from UPI• 
API dealing with the deployment 
of fascist death squads against 
the revolutionary forces In South 
America. 
These fillers had the sinister 
purpose of preparing Amerlca for 
the advent of death squads now In 
operation In every maJor urban 
center. The-searttclesweretopre-­
pare the people to accept the first 
overt actions of the Chicago loUI 
fascist gestapo kll!er unit. Their 
objective was to evaluate the re­
sponse of tbe people to 
above ground counter-Insurgency 
killer groups--to see If the P.OOPI• 
were condltlooed to accepttbeoUI• 
right fascist terror tactics direc­
ted ottlclally by the fascist rUl!ng 
clique. 
our Party has been and Is still 
the main target of a national dehu, 
manlzlng campaign. The fascist 
controlled news medJa has con ... 
slstenl!y maligned, viciously at­
tacked and branded our Party as a 
racist band of blood-thirsty mur­
derers out for their own personal 
gain. The fasclstnewsmedlaseeks 
to Justify the fascist's program of 
destroying our people's first line 
or defense, the Party, and all other 
organizations which re!Use to be 
either bought of! with blood money 
or Intimidated by the repressive 
fascist forces. The fascist at­
tempts to Isolate our Party from 
the people has been a dismal fail­
ure. The liquidation of Deputy 
Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark 
Clark had top priority on the fas­
cist's plg list. However, neither 
the people nor our Party were 
cowed or Intimidated by the 
bestial slaying of these two rev­
lutlonarles. The fascist ruling 
cllque made a graveerrortnunder 
estimating the will of the people 
and our Party. People from all 
walks or life and every progres­
sive organization saw through the 
fascist attempts tolsolateanddes­
troy th~lr Party. The p,opJe mo-
Ance!es, Southern California, 
Chapter of our Party, came under 
attack by fascist killer grcups. 
Allhoa&b outnumbered and ualllC 
inferior weapons, our Party ·re .. 
l'Olled and held at hl.Y the fascist 
shock troaps and sounded the end 
of Chlcago tn,e operations In a 
fuselage of bullets. We learned 
valuable lessons paid for with tbe 
blood of our revolutionary com­
rades. The fascist ruling clique 
has seen the support, that their 
homicidal raids have generated 
for the Party. They now know that 
II conditions are favorable, they 
will receive tit for tat and then 
some. They now know that Black 
and all progressive people wlll 
not sit Idly by and pacify the •~­
Uon of above ground killer groups 
Fascists have tried to rally the 
support of the American people 
to their avowed alms and failed. 
Now begins, the phase of under­
groW1d, clandesUne operation of 
fascist directed killer groups. 
This Is all part or the nature of 
the fascist rUl!ng cllque. The fas­
cists wl11 no doubt expand the tech­
niques of their South American 
lackeys who operate Wlrestrlc.ted, 
unswayed by either democratic In• 
stltutlons or public opinion. As 
the tempo of the struggle Increases 
so will the fascist acts of reac­
tionary terror and vtolence in­
crease. The primary target of 
forming clandestine klll groups 
will be both our people and our 
Party. If we are to survive as a 
people, this next phase of attacks, 
and pave the way to victory, II ls 
Imperative that our people be 
•. ,1 armed with the Ideology or the 
", Party. For only then wlll our peo­
ple be able to cope with, both, 
Ideological and physical attacks 
Initiated by the Insane fascist rul­
ing clique. Huey P. Newton, Min• 
lster ot Detense, said that our 
Party must be a living shleld that 
stands between our people and the 
fascist pigs and that our paper 
should serve to educate our peo .. 
pie so that they wlll survive. 
As the attacks against the Party 
escalate, so must the awareness

acceptance and even more, acU ve 
participation In urban guerrllla

plans wlll surely ~nd soundly be 
defeated. The lasclsts wlll awake 
to find themselves bogged down 
on that last front. They will be 
swallowed up In the mor:rss of 
a people's war. Their graves wlll

This Is the logic of fascists the
