U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
This is in response to the SSC letter dated 
December 18, 1975, wherein Senators Mondale and Baker 
requested rather detailed information to be made available 
during the last week of December,. 1975, and the first week 
of January, 1976. 
It is noted that most of the requests in this 
letter are so ambiguous that they require clarification 
from the SSC before the FBI can logically respond. In one 
instance, there is no way this Bureau could respond short 
of obtaining the recollections of Bureau Supervisors who 
worked in the lntelligence Division extending back almost 
20 years. Because of this, we are attaching for your 
approval and forwarding to the SSC the original of a 
memorandum which delineates the problems attendant to the 
request of December 18., 1975, and, in most instances, requests 
a meeting. between Mr. John Elliff, Domestic Task Force 
Director, SSC, and representatives of this Bureau in the 
hope that some alternatives or clarifications can be developed. 
A copy of the memorandum is furnished for your records •
