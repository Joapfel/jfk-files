TP 92-1 
In addition, records airport parking, Miami 
Airport, indicate that TRAFFICANTE's automobile was not 
on the parking lot during the period of 5/27/66 to 6/4/66, 
which would suggest from past ·experience that TRAFFICANTE 
was actually present in the Miami, Florida area from 
5/27/66 to 6/4/660 Likewise, records indicate that 
TRAFFICANTE1 s automobile was on the parking lot from 6/4/66 
until 6/10/66 which would suggest that TRAFFICANTE was n.ot 
in Miami. Possibility therefore exists that MARCELLO's 
visit mentioned in referenced airtel would have been to 
TRAFFICANTE's Miami residence instead of his Tampa residenceo 
Furthermore, TP 120-C on 7/6/66 indicated that 
TRAFFICANTE, his wife, their daughter, and her family had 
spent some of the July 4th weekend at least at TRAFFICANTEis 
Sta Petersburg Beach residenqe located at 3610 El Centro. 
Likewise, records of the airport parking lot 1 Miami, in-
dicate that TRAFFICANTEis automobile was parked on the airport 
parking lot from 6/27/66 to 7/2/66 at which time it was 
removed from.the lot at 12:52 Pom. Records further re-
flect that the car again appeared on the parking lot at 6:07 
7/2/66 and remained on .the parking lot until 11:22 Pom., . 
7/6/660 From TRAFFICANTE's habit pattern, it thus appears 
that he was out of the Miami area from 6/27/66 to the after­
noon of 7/2/66 and then from evening of 7/2/66 to 7/6/66.
