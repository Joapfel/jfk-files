summary, several of the FBI mail opening programs utilized, as 
selection criteria, various 
II 
indic•ators '.' which, with some accuracy, 
identified letters sent by or addressed to foreign ill~gal agents. 
The facto+ these indicators has been made public by FBI officials 
in recentweeks. But: these indicatqrs are still-felt to be 
valid and, the FBI·has no reason -to believe that they are not still 
being m;,ed. It is recommended, therefore, that the Committee 
avoid questions·which would require in response an elaboration of 
the natu~e of these indicators.
