• :~ SECRET 
The F. B. I., by purchase order #1793 
dated 1/20/72, contracted for the purchase of 10 Tessina 
cameras on a transfer of funds basis arranged as a result 
of our liaison with the Technical Services Division of CIA. 
Cost of these cameras amounted to $7, 000. 
The Tessina camera is a small, sophisticated 
camera which is employed in concealment devices needed 
for photographic surveillances. 
Although the exact nature of the concealment 
devices we employ is not publicized, the disclosure of the 
fact that we purchased cameras suitable for this use is not 
-considered inimical to our operations.
