action taken, two of our racial informants in the Little Rock

percentage of the Negro vote in his area. Our informants had 
discreetly spread the truth through the Negro community that 
Calvert was actually an active Klansman. As a result of.this

In September, 1970, we advised the President, the 
Vice President and the Attorney General of current information 
concerning Klan activity in the-u.s.; the decline in Klan 
membership; techniques the Klan was instituting to attempt 
to increase its income and the fact that a black box, 
resembling a coffin, was being· shipped to the President by 
&. gi~vap called nuni ted Pare,r,t~ of Duval Countv. 11 Florida. 
This was being sent to the President in connection·with a, 
protest against school integration in Jacksonville, Florida. 
In furnishing this information, we advised that the individual 
who paid for ·the shipping was identified as a member of the 
u·.s.- Klans, Knights of the KKK, Inc. • 
In September, 1970, we advised the President, 
the Vice President and the Attorney General of the fact

the latest interpretations of civil rights laws. We further 
advised that Shelton was preparing copies of a "night letter 11

Washington, D. c., area to publicize the fact he desired an 
appointment. This information was learned from~ top lex,e1

equal opportunity, treatment and courtesy, on behalf of the 
white people of his community. Our informant also revealed

the Attorney General but was doing this merely to .receive 
publicity as a result of this action. The appointment never 
came about.
