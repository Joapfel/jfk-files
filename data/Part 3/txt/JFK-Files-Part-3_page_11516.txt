This is a sincere and searching question. 
· Isn't our ma.in paradox perhaps ·t;hat of the imperfection of.· 
human beings- and, there.fore, human instituions which means that 
we never get the choice between pure virtue and pure vice? 
This is. particularly true in the intelligence fieldo The 
system must be realistically viewed as a proximate solution to 
an insoluble problem. 
There has always-been and.there always wi11 be some sin~ 
some wrongdoing and some errors:3 of judgement in high places·, 
including intelligence agencies. But it follows that the same 
imper£eotions exist and will continue to exist in the remainder 
of society. It is :illusory to wait for a perfect· solution~ There

Once wa can agree on this, those 0£ us 0£ goodwill and 
persave~ence can !ight £or the better cause lest it lose out to

tmpe:r:i'ections will not occasion the cynicism and self .flagellation 
o:f our society that e,dsts today •. 
With this in mind let us assume that the FBI and CT~ did,

can rest assured that neither the Russians nor the Chinese will 
join us in this quest £or a Utopian and nobler less secretive

of-so-called purification on our part will not insure freedom in 
the u.s.~ or stability abroad. • • · 
In closj.ng, while you and I do .not currently see eye to eye 
on this issue, • we can, by confining our thoughts and statements: 
to the basic issues·., as contrast;ed to denouncing personalities:t
