Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
• 
attempt to get some clarification and hopefully be in a 
position to provide some information as to how the White House, 
Mr. Silberman and Mr. Wilderotter wanted to proceed. 
It is the opinion of both Mr. Mintz and Mr. Wannall 
l
that the Bureau must immediately set up a Task Force to handle 
-the tremendous amount of information that will be required 
from the FBI, including the coordination of our responses with 
other agencies who might be involved in such an answer, as well 
as to insure that both the Department of Justice and the White 
House are fully informed. We can anticipate very short deadlines 
and requests for information that ~re not readily retrievable 
from Bureau records without considerable research involving 
several divisions ;1~· the Bureau.
