Briefly referring to his visit to the NPIC quarters at the Navnl Gun Factory, 
Q.:!neral Doolittle noted that the fe.ctlity has. consider'tible room· for expansion and 
the activity is being carried on there under g:-eatly .. improved conditions. The \' 
Department of Defense personnel contingent which ls houned at the .facility operates 
a,s .c.i. self-i:ontained unit. Mr. Lundahl, Direc_,..tor of the NPIC, reports th.a:. althoug,h 
' I 
~ ' 
t.he facility does not p<:>sse:Js _y·sfficient manpower to handle a. double load which might 
be imposed should two .emergency situations.· occur simultaneously, he nevertheless 
feels that the. space .and equipment e~nsion now u.rtder way at the riew quarters would 
\ ' 
accommodate the additional personnel who would be requi.re1 in such a situation. • 
At the Chs.irma.n's request, M.'t'- Mllri:'!tY hriefly informed the Bc:1.rd concerning 
the meeting which he and Mr. Gray and Mr. Coyne had recently with- Mr. Cord.Meyer 
' ' 
. of CIA on the subject of covert e,ction programs. Mr ... Murphy poir1t.ed · out that 
Mr. Meyer's briefing covered operations in· La.tin American countries, but the subje~t 
1· ' ' \ of Cuba ",,"8,S excluded ina'smuch :1.s that subject was to be covered at today's Board 
meeting. Mr. Murphy said the briefing consisted primarily cf light touches in- .' 
.. 1 
clt'.ding informa. tion on the China frontie"C' situation. Nothing new vas brought up 
with re5;:pect to Europe or the Middle East, Mr. Murphy said~ The CIA briefing 
reflected the exis~ence of positive evid'2!nce that t.he entourage of the Brazilian 
" .. // 
Pre.sident Goulart is communist-penetrated. Mr. Murphy observed that.this briefing 
r-
had been presented by CIA at the reqvest of Mr. Murphy £Lnd Mr. Gray, and it wao 
, 
Mr. Murphy I s impression that the· brief,ing was rathe_r routine in nature~ and the·refore 
seemed to downgrade the importance which the Board a.ttAches.to the subject of covert 
action operat~ons and requiremer..te: 
Dr. land obser'led that from his. experi~nce,. every time that secrecy is w,;ed 
• • ' ' as a c1oak for an assumed efficient but senslt.ive operation, one may well later ·, 
fir:. on removal of the cloak that th~te was ric.thillg tpere .. Dr. Lll.nd thought that
