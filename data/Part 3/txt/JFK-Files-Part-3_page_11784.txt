since last inspection. At the time of last inspection of 237 files reviewed, less than 
!P t...,~!:s,1":!, contained such outgoing co1n:munications. ~ 
Also during this inspection 62 closed files on PDAs were 
reviewed at random. Of these, 12 or 19%, contained outgoing communications 
of the type described above since last inspection. It was observed that since 
last inspection a majority of the closed files contained only the six-month 
justification letter and were closed in accordance with Division instructions 
described above. 
Due to current Division instructions, only those PDAs 
requiring day-to-day supervision or those on whom six-month justifications 
are due are considered pending at any given time. Hence, it is logical that a 
larger percentage of the closed PDA files will contain only the justification 
letters and no outgoing correspondence since last inspection. 
It is well recognized that the field of DAs is a highly specialized 
one. Its success, both at the Seat of Government and in the field, requires

PDA files, it was observed that many excellent candidates, with varying back­
grounds, have reached various stages of development with excellent potential for 
use as actual DAs. • Specifically, these cases are: 
105-113525 
105-141001 
105-201286 
105-207600 
105-26896 
134-11898 
134-15414 
134-18458 
134-19684 
134-19961 
134-20321 
134-20912 
The quality of these PDAs would, in itself, suggest substantial 
potential and, in turn, need for greater supervision. The above -listed cases 
should be kept in a pending s.tatus, carefully reviewed, with guidance and instructions 
furnished to the field. The field should be instructed to assume a more aggressive· 
position in these cases and followed closely to insure prope_r attention is given to 
development of these persons as PDAs. 
Review of PDA files shows evidence of closer supervision 
since last inspection. The percentage of files, including irE tructions and guidance 
to the field, rose from 4% to 38%. However, to realize greater accomplishments 
in this area of responsibility and to use our PDAs to the fullest extent, there is 
still need for improvement in supervision of these cases.
