157-15276 
The Black Revolutionary Party is an all black 
revolutionary, political organization which was formed in 
April, 1971, at an internal meeting of the pro-Red China 
·communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) (CP of C-ML). 
Among 16 people present were four Americans including 
well-known black extremist, Charles Knox, former Black Panther 
Party leader in Des Moines~ "I_~w~-~ i,u.., . 
The BRP was formed within the CP of C-ML to 
organize blacks in the United States and Canada operating 
from headquarters in Detr9it, Michigan. The BRP follows 
the political line of communist Chinese leader MAO Tse-tung 
and publishes a newspaper which serves as its vehicle for 
disseminating its revolutionary dogma known as the 11Black 
Revolutionary," the first issue of which appeared in May, 1971. 
The BRP intends to maintain its existence secret 
until firmly established which is estimated at taking from 
one and one-half to two years. It intends to draw recruits 
from both sides of the current Black Panther Party factionalism 
and its proposed revolutionary program will reportedly be 
based on.the issue of racial suppression. This is to be 
accomplished by the formation of armed self-defense units to 
"fight against the barbarous rule of the monopoly, capitalist.

On July 12, 1971, Charles Knox and an additional 
Omaha black extremist were detaine"d"=temp"'orarily by United States
