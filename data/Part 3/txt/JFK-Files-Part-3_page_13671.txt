you said, well, the ~hole Cuban operation, the way I int~rpreted 
it, was being called on." 
Did you receive a c~ble to that effect? 
AMI.ASH Case _Officer. It was,_.a-very cryptic cable saying, 
you know, return to Washington, which~ was going to do anyway, 
so this is why --
Mr. Johnston. Did it say to break off contact with 
Nil.ASH? 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. I don't recall that it did but 
it didn't make any difference because headquarters knew that 
that was the last meeting with him before he was returning to 
Cuba anyway. 
So there was no reason to tell me to break off contact 
with hir:l. This is what I'm trying to say. 
Mr. Johnston. Supposedly the 1967 IG report, and I 
don't know where they got their information, said that wau an 
OPI!t cable. 
N-11.ASH Case Officer. That's Operation I1mnediate. In 
other words, it's an immediate cable. That set precedence 
on the ca!.Jlc. 
Mr. Johnston. And what does that mean for transmittin~ 
AMLASII Case Officer. It was transmitted before a 
cable or a priority cable. It's just the precedence --
