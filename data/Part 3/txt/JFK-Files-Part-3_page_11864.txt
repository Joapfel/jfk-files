G. C • M90RE, BRANIGAN AND WAl.'fNALL: The Security Informant 
Index contains certain data concerning present and former 
informants and sourceso This data basically consists of 
the identity of the informant with limited background 
information. The primary reason for such an index is·to 
have a central repository containing the number and 
identities of informants. This information is readily 
accessible. Informal discussions have been held in the 
past concerning feasibility of computerizing the Security 
Informant Index as well as the Extremist Informant Index. 
During course of these discussions, there were two prime 
considerations; namely, the ready accessibility of 
information on the indexes as well as the saving of 
manpower and cost to the Bureau. Previous discussions 
did not result in a ·positive recommendation to computerizing 
the above indexes. It is noted that the present indexes 
are serving the Bureau's purpose. In order to insure that 
all avenues of savings are considered, the Inspector's 
suggestion will be carried out.

field will be conducted to determine if such an operation 
is feasible, practical and economical, keeping in mind 
the accessibility of the information and the security of 
informants. It is proposed, therefore, that this 
s~ggestion 'be immediately acted u?(o. 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNAN I agree that it would 
(JAS:cb - 9/7/71) be desirable to carry 
out this suggestion. 
I will follow this matter closely to determine if such an 
operation is feasible .
