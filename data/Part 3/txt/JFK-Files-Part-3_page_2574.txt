July 9, 1975 
As has already been made clear to members of your staff, 
the failure of the Justice Department and the FBI to 
respond fully to the Committee's request has severely ham­
pered our investigative work. Since the Committee is now 
receiving excellent cooperation from the White House and 
other agencies on highly sensitive matters, and indeed 
from the Justice Department and the FBI on assassination 
matters, we are at a loss to understand what special diffi­
culties are presented by the May 14 request. 
The Committee has concluded that these issues cannot ade­
quately be resolved by further staff discussions and, 
accordingly, that the only responsible- way to proceed is 
for the Committee itself to take up the problem with you 
and the Director of the FBI. Therefore, we are pleased 
that FBI Director Kelley's request for a meeting gives us 
an opportunity to .invite you and Mr. Kelley to appear be­
fore the Committee in executive session during the week of 
July 14, 1975. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss 
the matters of concern to Mr. Kelley and the steps which 
might be taken to expedite response to requests for docu­
ments essential to the Committee's inquiry. 
The members of the Committee look forward to this meeting 
as a way to resolve issues of commo7oncern in a spirit 
of comity between the Executive an1 gislative Branches .
