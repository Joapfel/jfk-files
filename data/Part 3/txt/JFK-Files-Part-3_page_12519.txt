Platform and Program 
What We Want 
What We Believe 
~ 
~ 
1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of GIii' I 
Blatk Community. 
We believe that black people will not be free until we are able to deter- s 
mine our destiny. ~ 
2. We want full employment for our people. 
We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to 
gi\'e en~ry man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if 
the white American businessmen will not gi\"e full employment. then the 
means of production should be taken from the businessmen and plated in 
the community so that the people of the <.·ommunity can organize and em­
ploy all of its peopl<.• and give a high standard of living.
