RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) 
O. RICHARD HAMILTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS 
upon the retirement of former SA Alan Sentinella in 
approximately 1970. The Staff Members inquired as to the 
period of time thereafter that SCLC remained under inves­
tigation and what basis if any there was for closing 
the case. SA Hamilton pointed out that since the re­
assignment of the case to him occurred after the death 
of King, he felt that question did not directly relate 
to the investigation of King· and that prior to fur­
nishing an answer to that question, he felt he should 
confer with a FBI Headquarters representative who was 
then present in the Atlanta Office of the FBI. The 
Staff Members advised they ·did desire an answer to that 
question and approved of a consultation between SA 
Hamilton and the FBI Headquarters representative. SA 
Hamilton conferred with the FBI Headquarters represen­

was agreed the ques.tion regarding the closing of SCLC 
and the assignment of that case to SA Hamilton was outside 
·the parameter of the authority given to SA Hamilton by 
FBI Headquarters regarding discussion of Doctor Martin 
Luther King, Jr. However, in the spirit of cooperation, 
it was agreed that SA Hamilton would answer the question 
of the Staff Members in this regard. Thereafter, SA 
Hamilton advised the FBI investigation regarding SCLC 
was closed about 1972 or 1973 since a review of the 
case file failed to reflect any influence by individuals 
or organizations having affiliations. with communist 
background. In view of that, it was felt the SCLC case 
should be closed. 
The Staff Members inquired as to who made the 
decision regarding closing of SCLC and whether the matter 
was first discussed with FBI Headquarters or other indi­
viduals within the Atlanta Office of the FBI or if it 
was a decision made by S,A Hamilton alone. Hamilton 
advised that as he recalled, he reviewed the SCLC case 
file from ~hat time to a substantial period in the past 
and that he re·c.<i>rrimended to the • supervisor of the Security
