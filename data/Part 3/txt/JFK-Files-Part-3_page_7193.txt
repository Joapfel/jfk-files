FACT SHEET 
COMMUNIST-BLOC INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATION 
There are presently 667 intelligence and security 
services operating throughout the world. 
The 13 countries comprising the Soviet Union and 
other communist states, including Cuba, operate 52 services 
of domestic and foreign intelligence and security. Some 
23 of these work outside their own frontiers. The principal 
service in action throughout the ·world against the 
United States and Americans--which our highest grade 
documentary sources confirm are termed "The Ma in Enemy" 
(Glavny Vrag)--is the Sov.iet State Security Service (KGB), 
together.with Soviet milit~ry intelligence, the GRU, headed 
by a senior KGB officer.

19 years, as the following data show:

the Soviet Union and the Soviet intelligence services also 
direct communist parties--or, more accurately, certain 
sections of and individuals tn such parties--for purposes 
of espionage and subversion abroad. During the period 
1969-73, Soviet funding of non-bloc communist parties showed 
a·ctua 1 and estimated annua 1 costs to be almost $17 million. 
But we do not have the quality of sourc.es t.hat would guarantee 
this as anything but a minimal figure • 
The scope of the clandestine attack upon the 
United States is suggested by the number of identifiable 
recruitment approaches made to Americans by Soviet, bloc, 
Cuban, and Chinese services durin~ the 9 years from 1965
