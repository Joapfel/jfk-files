The Select Committee is presently investigating the 
activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried 
on as part of the COINTELPRO program. We appreciate the 
cooperation of the FBI and the JustiGe Department in 
making materials available to us in this area. However, 
one problem remains to be resolved. T4e Committee believes

"source", but rather as a recipient of information from 
the FBI. ·rndeed, in many instances we would not have been 
aware that the· individual was a "source" had not the FRI 
excised the name from the materials delivered to us. 
Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental deleterio~s effects 
on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected a 
very limited number of persons whom we desire to contact 
and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

example, our inquiry into the relationships between the 
FBI anq the Internal Revenue Service clearly showed the
