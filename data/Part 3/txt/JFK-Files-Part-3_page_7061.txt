This morning, in accordance with the request of the Presi~ent 
conveyed to me personally- by him last Wednesday in New York City, I called 
at the Ylhite House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15. 
• .• He.was cesirous ot discussing the question of the subversivs 
activities in t!le United States, particularly- Fas"a.s:n a!ld Comnniitisi.3. Ho 
had previously- received the me:raorandum which I had prepared covering my 
• conversation with Ge.."'leral Smedley Butler and the effort o£ FatherYcouzhli:n 
·tn hRVA ~P.nP.~R.l~ButlP.r head an exoedition to Mexico. I informed t~e P:-eside~t 
concernj.ng certrln recent developments in the Com.'11Ullist activities i:i the 
· ·country, particularly the e.f'forts 0£ the Bridges organization in Sen Fran­
cisco and their progressive control or the shipping on the Pacific Coast, 
the Gu~t· Coast and t."1;eir • recent expansj;on to shippi•r..g operations on the 
Atlo.r.:.t.io· :.:;aat. · I tole! 11.i.n that wailele--tlleir cvntr1:f-Jt wi:(.L er.t?ire o:i 
Septe,,iber 30, .1936, they are endeavori+1g to have it temporll!"ili ·extended 
until April l, 19.37, in order to conform.to the same date that t.i.e 'ITrJ.ted 
'Mina Workers' contract expires, which ·orzanization is·headed by John L. 
Lewis. I told-him that·tha Bridges organization was practically controlled 
by C~mmuni~ts and that the Com.'lnlllists had· now decided to make very darini ta 
plans ~o_get ~ntrol of the Lewis organization. • 
I called his attention to the activities of the Newspaper Guild 
headed by HeY\vood Broun, which has strong Communistic leanings, and vthich 
has been responsible for putting out of operation the Ses.t-µe Post Intel-·· 
lig~~cer. I told him that 'llf3' inf'orr..ation was that the Comrnu."'lists had plar.r.&d 
to get control of these three groups and by doing so thEq would be able at 
any time to paraly.ze tb.s-.. country in that they could stop_ all shipping in 
and out through the Bridges organization; stop tha operation ot indust.-y 
through the Mining Union or Lewis; Slld stop publication or &:JJY newspapers 
of the country ~ough the Newspaper Guild. 
I also related to him the activities which have recently oc­
curred within Govermnental service ins~ired by- Communists, particularly 
in some of the DepartmGDts and in the National Labor Relations B~ard.
