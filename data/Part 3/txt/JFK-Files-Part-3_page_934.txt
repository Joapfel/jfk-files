FILES AND THEIR DISCLOSURE 
I. Problen1: 
:rvir. \Villiam D. Ruckelshaus, in item #8 of memorandum to the Director 
chted 7 /20/73, stated, "The lvhole question of files and their disclosure must 
be studied •with a view toward understanding why files are kept; 1vvhat categories 
or .files there are, what i!)formation is contained in the files and whether the 
purposes for maintaining files are being met under present policy. In the 
issue of disclosure, when, where: and to who.m must also be thoro~ghly 
examined. ti • 
As problems involved in creation and maintenance of files a."1d disclosure 
of information contained in them are rather complex they are being discussed 
separately. Identification Division records consisting o:f fingerprint cards 
and identification records (Rap Sheets) are not considered to fall in this 
c:-:.tegory of "Files" and their use is not being commented upon.

of violations of law over ·which tt= FBI has jurisdiction has nearly doubled since 
1839, the vast n1ajority of FBI files have been created since ~939.
