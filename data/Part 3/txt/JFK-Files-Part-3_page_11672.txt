By Bureau airtel 11-6-70, all continental offices were 
instructed to submit a biweekly airtel regarding underground BPP 
operations within each field office. This specific requirement 
was removed by Bureau airtel 4-29-71. However, ail offices were 
admonished to keep the Bureau advised of any developments in this 
area. 
"The Black Panther 11 newspaper, official organ of the BPP, 
had been printed in San Francisco sin~e 1967 until recently when 
the printing was changed to New York City. The Bureau receives_ 
a sufficient quantity of the paper from New York to disseminate it 
to interested agencies and all Legal Attaches. New York also 
furnishes one copy of each weekly issue to all field offices. This 
_newspaper in the past has been the best indication of current 
Party line; therefore, this program is essential to our 
intelligence gathering efforts. 
Our u1timate objective is the prosecution of the BPP 
as an organization or by individual members for any violations of 
Federal or State laws. As in the past, we will continue to 
disseminate to local. authorities any informa:i..lo.u wt= may receive. 
concerning possible local violations. A secondary objective:is to 
more completely develop information concerning the activities and 
objectives of ·the BPP for intelligence purposes. 
In July, 1969, the Attorney General established a 
special tas,k force for the specific purpose of developing a 
pr_osecuti ve theory against the BPP. Attorneys of this task force, 
known as the Special Interd.ivisional Unit, have interviewed many 
of our informants in furtherance of this purpose. 
It is recommended. that the intensiv~ investigation 
of the BPP including all surveys and procedures outlined as 
above be continued.
