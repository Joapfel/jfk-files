Memorandum for Lee Rankin • 
. From A. w. Dulles 
• 
-. 
. As a result of my weekend reading which I 
have returned with comments, I have the following 
comments in addition to cormnents noted on the 
material returned. 
1. Where have we dealt with the evidence 
es to Oswald's ability to handle·a rifle? 
2. lihere do you plan to discuss Oswald's 
escape pattern or plans: did he have any - if so, 
why did he leave $170 at th~ Paines and start out 
with less than $20? If h~- killed the President to 
inake. a name, gain notoriety, e.tc. , why did he try to 
escape at all and.then deny the shooting when caught?· 
X feel we must deal with these difficult issues. I 
have some spec~lations on the subject. 
• 3. If Marina had admitted that she had once 
been_.a member of the·Komscrnol, would that have changed 
the decision regarding her vis~? I believe this has 
been considered by the State Department. I feel we 
should look into th·is. 
4. A great deal of the description of the 
motorcade and the shooting will be unclear unless we 
have a street ma? and, if possible, a photo takeri 
from the sixth floor window. Is this possible?
