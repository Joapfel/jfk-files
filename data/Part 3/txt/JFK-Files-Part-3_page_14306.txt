given to Mr. Gray to.present some of the highlights of 
.Mr. Gray.' s and Mr. Coyne' s findings in the course of their 
on-the-scene review of U. s. foreign intelligence activities 
in seven Middle East count·ries. One'of the recommendations 
of_ Mr. Gray's report ·to the Board, which the Board subsequentlf 
adopted and submitted to the President, called for a review, ,\ 
of NSC 5412/2 and related NSC Intelligence. Directives to •1 insure that adequate guidance is given to Ambassadors and 
CIA 1Station Chiefs with resp~ct to covert actions generally; 
and that the station in Cyprus.be reviewed- with a ·view to 
_placing increased emphasis on covert operations~ particularly 
in the newspaper and trade unions fields, with ~ppropriate support 
to be fu~nished by the CIA stations in Athens and Anka~a~ I 
Subsequently, _at the request of General Taylor, Mr. Gray and l 
- Mr. Coyne briefed the Special NSC 5412/2 Group concerning i

Meeting of January 19-20, 1962 • • 
. In the course of this Board meeting discussions were 
had with .the newly-appointed DCI,- Mr. John McCone. During 
. ·a discussion of possible ways to reorganize and strengthen-
the CIA, the DCI said that he might- decide to separate t9e 
functions of the DD/P area within the CIA. Mr. McCone.thought 
that he-might possibly name one assistant who would specialize 
in "conventional covert operations", including the management 
o~ the clandestine services world-wide,and designate anoth~r 
assistant in the DD/P area who·would be in charge of such 
matters as COMINT, ELINT, satellite reconnaissance, etc. 
Mr. McCone added that he thought he would pick a'military 
man to head up covert operations and to handle paramilitary 
activities in order th~t these functions would be conducted 
on an'absolutely professional basis, without disturbing the 
lines running from the DD/P to the CIA\ St,a tion Chiefs. 
Further on in the discussion with the DCI, Mr. McCone 
expressed concern over the fact that in the CIA organizational 
_responsibility for financing was placed at a ~ather low level 
in the headquarters organizational set-up, and therefore the 
DCI desired to place this responsibility upon a higher level 
- official who wo;-11a serve as Comptroller in the Office of the 
DCI. Mr._ Gray asked whether this would increase problems
