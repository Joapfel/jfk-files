MESSRS·• HELMS and MEYER 
British Guiana 
For a·_ 79-day period ending in July, the anti-Jagan Trades 
Union Congress maintained a general strike which was directed 
against the Jagan regime., and had wide support among agrarian 
and industrial workers in protest against an oppressive Labor 
•Bill proposed by Communist~oriented Jagan. CIA worked out 
with George Meany a program of CIA financial support ($435,000) 
to t-he strike under the cover of '!AFL-CIO contributions. 11 
A CIA cover representative ran the strike program~ The _activity 
was tricky because the United States and the British desired 
to avoid violence; -and the situation was complicated by the 
fact that the British Governor-Ge~eral opposed the strike. 
CIA assesses the operation as a success because even though 
Jagan was not unseated, the _oppressive Labor Bill was withdrawn 
and.the TUC survived. 
The strike activity took place against a background of 
agreement between President Kennedy and MacMillan that the 
British will not pull out of Guiana for an indefinite future 
period, in the hope that a Communist government will not fill 
the vacuum when the British do withdraw. 
Cuban influence in the strike was in the form of a 
$1 million advance from Cuba to the Guiana Import-Export 
Corporation {an arm of Jagan 1s East Indian Peoples Progressive 
Party) which in turn was borrowed by the Jagan regime. 
Soviet help was indicated by a rumored transfer of over 
$100,000 to Jagan 1 s Party through banks.
