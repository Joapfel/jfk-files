• • B. INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY 
People who do not speak and understand a common .. 
language have difficulty in communicating their ideas. Even 
in a country such as ours where English is the common language,· 
words take on different meanings in different geographical 
locales and in ~ifforont soainl, politicnlr nnd economic 
environments. Likewise, in professional fields, varying 
~ackgrounds and experiences have conveyed different mennirtgs 
.. to terms in the professional vocabulary. 
. . 
In the field of security, intelligence, and counter-
.•. intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has 
developed ostensibly to assist in the exchange of ideas by 
persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a 
fi~ld or a special segment ·of the field, new horizons devel6.p 
whj.ch require additional terminology or cause an ev:olutiop. ?i'n 
... _ •. existing terminqlogy. This development or evolution in security 
and intelligence terminolog½ coupled with individualistic usage, 
brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the 
broader aspects of the English language. We have all noted 
. • .. ··, that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning 
and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are ·not 
misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.

_ . . used, For example, the term "intelligence·u may be vague and 
··._·: :··confusing without the knowledge of the context in which it is 
used. It can, as a generic term, pertain. to the .whole field 
·.of activities undertaken by a government:m: the collection of
