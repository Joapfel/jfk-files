Justice Vi.nson wrote, "The rule we deduce from these 
cases (a series of earlier Supreme Court decisions - namely the 
'question in every case is whether words used are used in such 
circumstances and are of such nature as to create a clear and 
present danger that they will bring about the substantive 
evils that .Congress h~s a ~ight to prevent.') is that where 
·an:··offense is specified by a statute in nonspeech or nonpress 
terms, a conviction relying upon speech or press as evidence 
of violation may be sustained only when the speech or publication 
created a 'clear and present danger' of attempting or accom­
plishing the prohibited crime." 
In this case, applying this rule, the court said, 
"Obviously, these words cannot mean th at before the Government 
may act, it must wait until the puts·ch is about to be executed, 
the plans have been laid, and the signal is awaited--we must, 
therefore, reject the contention that suricess or probability 
of success is the criterion." 
In addition to the Smith Act of 1940, Congress also 
passed legislation which further increased the authority of 
the FBI to deal with subversive activities. The Voorhis Act 
(superseded in 1948 along with original Smith Act) which is 
now Title !8~ USC 2386, provided for registration of organizations 
subject to Ioreign control which engage in political activity 
among other things. The Internal Security Act of 1950 was 
passed over the veto of President Truman and provided not only 
a prohibition of conspiracies or attempts t~ establish a 
totalitarian dictatorship and a long iist of measu~es having 
to do with Communist organizations (Control of Subversive 
Activities) but also for the emergency detention of suspected 
security risks. Further, in 1954, Congress enacted the Communist 
Control Act to provide additional investigative authority in 
dealing with the communist threat to national security, 
DIRECTIVES VERSUS LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT 
These legislative enactments were unquestionably 
designed to give the FBI a cloak of statutory authority to 
investigate not only the communists, which were a grave concern 
to President Roosevelt when he requested investigations of 
communism by the FBI in 1936, but also any other group which 
engages in activity aimed at overthrow of the Government by 
force or violence. And, whereas President Roosevelt relied 
on the element of foreign relations and the international 
character of the fascist and communist movements to have 
State Deparment make a request for FBI investigation, the 
st~tutes referred to above do not r~quire a dependence on 
foreign elements, notwithstanding the congressional finding 
of necessity in connection with the Internal Security Act of 
1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954.
