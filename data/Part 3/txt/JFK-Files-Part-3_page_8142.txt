This morning the Director asked me to inquire into the sta s 
of our understanding with the Senate Select Committee as to whether FBI 
representatives would or would not be present at interviews of former 
Bureau employees or current :aureau employees. The Director was 
concerned that the presence of a Bureau representative could be criticized 
as an attempt-to interfere with the Committee's inquiries. I assured the 
Director that the purpose of such representatives being present was to 
assist the· interviewer and the witness in determining areas of inquiry 
of particular sensitivity or that might concern a current Bureau operation. 
The Director agreed that such was an appropriate reason for the presence 
of a Bureau representative and asked me to consider preparing a letter 
addressed to Senator Church stating our desire to make available a Bureau 
representative and the reasons forthe presence of such a Bureau representative. 
As a result of a conference with representatives of CIA, 
Roderick Hills of the White House Counsel staff, and others, it was 
determined that Walter Lloyd of the CIA Legal Staff woµld continue 
negotiations with the Committee in behalf of the entire intelligence 
community to develop procedures concerni~ the interview of witnesses 
and the presence of agency representatives at such interviews. Mr. Lloyd 
was scheduled to meet with Frederick Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee, 
on Tuesday, May 6, 1975, to discuss such arran~ements. -. _ J{L/
