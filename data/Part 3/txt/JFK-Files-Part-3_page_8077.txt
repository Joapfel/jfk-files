Epstein first asked Whitson when he entered the Bureau 1 when 
he first arrived for assignment at Headquarters, to what Headquarters 
Division he had been assigned, and when he retired. Epstein then said 
that he knew that Whitson had at one time mailed a package to 
Mrs. Martin Luther King from Tampa, Florida, and asked Whitson to 
relate the details concerning this matter. Whitson thereupon told 
..--\W\ him that in the late Summer of 1964 former Assistant to the Direct,RJi 
\ \~ William c. Sullivan had telephoned Whitson at his home one Sa turda\ltl

I ' Airport to telephone Sullivan for further instructions .. Whitson did

~.~ package to Wir. Martin Luther King. Accordingly, Whitson had the 
~~ package weiglied, put stamps on it, and addressed it to Martm Luther
