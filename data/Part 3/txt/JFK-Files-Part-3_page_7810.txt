to COINTELPRb and when compared to such activity as to the 
Bay of Pigs and the Glomar Explorer, the COINTELPRO was 
"peanuts." 
At'-the conclusion of the conversation, Brennan advised 
that SSC Staff Members indicated they would want him to return 
for ,additional interviews. I advised Brennan that should he 
receive a subpoena to return or should he be invited to return 
to Washington, D. C., to be interviewed under oath, it would be 
wiseffor him to contact the F~I's Legal Counsel Division for 
advice to insure that he was in compliance with the Attorney 
General's order relative to the release of information obtained 
)
while an employee of the FBI. Brennan indicated he would contact 
the Legal Counsel Division should he be contacted by the SSC and 
would probably ask that a Bureau representative be available for 
. consultation during a subsequent interview or testi~ony, 
ACTION: If appr0ved, the attached letter to the Atto:i;ney General 
and its enclosures reflecting the results of the debriefing of 
Brennan, be sent. )
