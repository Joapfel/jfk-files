2. Positive Results Achieved 
This program has enabled us to provide the White House and 
the highest level of fhe intelligence community a continuing flow of valuable 
foreign political information affecting the national and international interests 
of the U.S. The program was particularly productive in our coverage of 
such critical areas of tension as the Middle East crisis, the continuing 
crisis in Panama, and the recurrent political crises created in 
South America through the unseating and establishment of regimes in the 
various countries covered. In the areas mentioned, as well as in other 
fringe nationality areas, this program has served as a basis for obtaining 
information which has provided U.S. Government v.1th current data regarding_ 
the international political scene and has contributed otherwise unobtainable x 
information for the benefit of those responsible for policy decisions at the ... '\--
highest level of our Government. An example of the importance of this ~ 
information is illustrated in the comments of the ~..!F.9,@i§§ft.9.Q&J....Q~J).~dw \}

u. S. United Nations Mission by the Bureau was deeply appreciated by him 
and had afforded him privileged insight and perspective. 
The quality of this program is further attested to by realization 
by the White House of the capabilities of the FBI to produce positive foreign 
political intelligence ·with resulting instructions to the Bureau to expand 
this capability abroad in select liaison positions. As a. result of these 
instructions, our capability in furnishing foreign political information 
was expanded through the opening of six new liaison posts.in Beirut, 
Lebanon; Caracas, Venezuela; La Paz, Bolivia; Copenhagen, Denmark; 
Managua, Nicaragua; and Tel Aviv, Israel. With this expansion, our 
overseas liaison Agents were increased from 28 to 42 with supporting 
clerical personnel being increased in number from 32 to 46. This move 
has increased the number of our foreign posts from 11 to 17. (More 
detailed comment regarding increase in liaison abroad is set forth in the 
work papers of this inspection under Section 4-E, Accomplishments -
Special Coordination Unit.)
