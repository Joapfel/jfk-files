THE ESTIMATE 
I. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE. BASE CRISIS 1 
Aims 
1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to 
gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of 
himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America. 
He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American 
States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-
Soviet Bloc in. the pursuit of these aims. • 
Means 
2. Castro began. his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin 
America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan­
ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful 
and he turned to other means. 
3. From the beginning, propaganda has been one of the prkcip~l in­
struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans­
missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great 
deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised 
to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected 
countries. 2 A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the 
Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda. 
J?rirlteg p~opaga11da. h~s ~lso be~D:_ ~ent from Cuba into most other 
Latin American States, and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel 
have actively disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination 
in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among 
Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets. 
4. Thousands of Latin Americans have been brought to Cuba; about 
1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds 
have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare. 
Cuba has been made a main transit point for travel between Latin 
America and the Bloc. ---------/.
