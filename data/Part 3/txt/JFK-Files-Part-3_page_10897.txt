In discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired 
issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform 
with the original plan proposed by the President or which was

Government agencies. The memorandum noted that "undoubtedly ~:r

ins·ofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the 
domestic field ... It is inevitable that the Central Intelli­
gence Group must enter into the domestic field picture in?ofar 
as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign 
intelligence existing in that field. Also, it is impossible to 
sepa:rate entirely foreign intelligence and the domestic function~ 
performed by the Bureau."*
