16 movement and that s~ep1? should be taken to get him out of 
17 th?tt. -- ~1hat the reason for it was or the motivation, I" am 
18 _ju~t not in a position to say.

20 type of activity, but I don't know what the real motive was.

influence upon him? 
Mr. Adams. Y~s-. 
·senator·Mpndale. Is ·that a proper basis for investigati.n.
