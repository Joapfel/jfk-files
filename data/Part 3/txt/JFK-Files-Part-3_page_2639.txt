Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect 
of it bec~use even though you have a charter which gives broad 
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects 
that.·enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such 
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence 
is to be colle·cted, what is done after it is collected, this 
type of thing, it seems to me we are leaving a wide gap 
again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction 
and total permission to move in a certain direction and go 
beyond what is intended or what was authorized. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director. 
The Chairman. Senator Goldwater? 
Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI 
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of 
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were 
produced. 
Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI? 
Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir. 
Senator Golqwater. Have they been reviewed by you? 
Mr. Kelley. No, sir. 
Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by any of you
