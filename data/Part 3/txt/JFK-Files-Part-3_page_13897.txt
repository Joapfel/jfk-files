With regard to the Cyprus situation, Mr. Cline noted 
that although fighting has stopped neither side is backing 
down. The Cypriot leader will not agree to the Turks' pro­
posal to ~otate 1/3 of their troops on Cyprus unless the 
Turk Cypriots, ·w1 thdraw from posi tiohs along the coast. The 
USSR wants an independent Cyprus.with a _Communist-influenced 
government. Nasser wants an independent Cyprus subject to 
_· Egyptian influence. In reply to a question from. Mr .. Coyne, 
Mr. Cline stated that· the Navy SIGINT installation has been 
scaled down so as to be ready for quick evacuation. This 
cut-do~n in U.S. ~IGINT coverage has been replaced somewhat 
by installations in some Middle East capital cities. 
Concerning South VietncJ11, Mr. Cline said tha.t the past 
60 days have witnessed increased we~cening of the political 
fabric of the government of that country. Khanh's inability 
to meet challenges is appar·ent, and his authority bas 
steadily eroded._ Khanh is trying to build 3Upport from the 
young officers and Bhuddists.. (Mr. William Sullivan has 
just returned to the U.S. and says that the SVN people 
generally feE.:lthat:the U.S. will pul:!. out after the 
November· elections); There is no change in the milita:ry 
situation, Mr. Cline said, but there is a creeping paralysis 
in the SVN' army. Tne Viet Cong is shifting from terrorism 
and fighting to all-out political activity. In the USIE 
yesterday CIA expressed the vfew that there will be further 
political decay in SVN, increased friction \·11th the U.S., 
and a petering·out of the war effort. 
• • In Guba, tnere ·are signs_ that· .either the Soviets or ... ~ 
Cubans will begin shooting at·our-U-2 1 s after the November V 
elections, and the "303 Committee" is studying courses of 
action which mir .1t be taken by the U.S. in such an event. 
One objective of the DCI's recent European trip was to 
emphasize to NATO commanders that U.S. U~2 missions over 
Cuba are not mere whimsy, but are necessary for intelligence 
coverage which cannot be provided by satellite overflights . 
. At 11:00 a.m., Mr. Cline left the Board meeting which 
was then joined- by _Under Secre.~ary of._: the Air Force Brockway 
McMillan '. (Di:rec to~" of the. NRO) '.'accompanied by General Stewart 
_the new Staff Director ··at :the Nao· (previously attached to 
the Air Force Systems Command_and-theAir Staff).
