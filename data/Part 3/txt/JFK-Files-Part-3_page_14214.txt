need for clandestine agent·penetration or Cuba, said that the 
Board had concludedthat the absence.of clandestine coverage 
is attributable to a lack or .. imagination on the part CJf our

we. enjoyed close :relations with the Cuban Government •.. • There­

adequacy of such coverage at the present time in places like 
Brazil and Argentina •. Mr. Murphy obse·rved that originally the 
CIA set out to use}U. s. diplomatic establishments as a cover 
£or CIA tntelligence,.operations on_ly for an 1Qitial period, • 
•. but these cover arrangements became permanent. Mr. Murphy •• 
noted that in discussionwith theBo&rd the Director or Central 
!n~elligence has saiq:t.hatit is difficult to·achteve deep 
cover for clandestine\agent operationt5, and while Mr. Murphy 
agrees that this ta~.k./is<of course difficult; he ha,s seen no 
evidence that _concerted errorts have been made, for. example, -
to penetrate the Ca.st~o regime. ~..r. Clif'f'ord recalled that
