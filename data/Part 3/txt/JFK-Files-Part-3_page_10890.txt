and Chief of United Stntcs Secret Service to deal with 
the problem of growth of fascist organizations in the 
United States. The conference agreed that thorc should be 
an investigation of these groups and their activities for 
intelligence purposes. Since the only Federal law believed

personnel to conduct an intensive and confidential~investi­
gation of the Nazi movement. This was the first general 
intelligence investigation made by the Government into 
fascist activities in this country.
