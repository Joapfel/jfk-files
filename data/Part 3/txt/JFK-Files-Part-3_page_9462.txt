= Mr. Adams memorandum to Mr. Callahan dated 3 /7 /7 5, , lj l 
captioned as above, copy attached, ~eported our conversation with \ 
Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi. ~ 
~ As indicated in Mr. Adams' memorandum, Congressman 
Nedzi asked that we ~:iprepare a memorandum of understanding to be ~ 
approved by CIA, FBI, and the House Committee concerning .......,___ 
investigative and clearance procedures for members of the Committee's ~ 
staff. It appeared appropriate to us to coordinate a memorandum' \ 
of understanding to be drafted for the House Committee with that to be . • 
drafted for the Senate Cemmittee. Therefore, following our return from 'a 
the meeting with Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi, I called Bill ~ 
Miller and advised him of the request made by Congressman Nedzi fo~ us ...,,, 
to prepare a proposed memorandum of understanding. I asked him whether~ 
it would be possible for us to coordinate the language of that memorandum ~ 
with the understanding that it will be drafted for use by the CIA, other f'-4 
members of the intelligence community, and the Church Committee. Mr. ~ 
Miller said that the proposal to coordinate the memorandum was complete!£ 
acceptable to him and he requested that the draft memorandum being a' 
prepared for Congressman Nedzi be furnished him for review and possible {i}" 
adoption as the memorandum to be used by the Senate Committee. tfl ~ 
RECOMMENDATION: ~ § 
• \ ~-o That the Intelligence Division discuss this matter with 
, • ~ • ✓ representatives of CIA and other appropriate members of the intelligence 
~ ~ community and prepare a draft memorandum of understancllilg th t may be
