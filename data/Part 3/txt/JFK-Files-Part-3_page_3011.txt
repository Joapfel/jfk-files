I would like .to come back very briefly to the Fourth 
Amendment consider~tions in connection with the use of informan s 
and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one 
time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have 
a,story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you 
may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which 
there is a more extended relationship which coul~ be of varying 
degrees. It might be in one case that the same individual 
will' have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when 
the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first ,, 
test is a judicial warrant, and what I would liketto explore 
with you is the difference between a one time search which 
requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that 
search, and a continuous search which uses an inform~nt, or 
the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover 
agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is in a 
slightly different category than an informant. 
Mr. Adams. Well, we get the_re in to the fact that the 
Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does· 
not irivade ~ny of these constitutionally protected areas, ,and.
