problem. 
The present "Defector Program" operates as follows: 
"Defector committees" consisting of Espionage desk Supervisors 
in both the New York and Washington Field Offices select 
five Soviet intelligence officers (with Bureau approval) as 
defection targets. This selection is based on a variety of 
reasons which indicate the Soviets have defection potential. 
These Soviets are then marked for priority attention and 
"defection teams" consisting of four men in each office are 
~;:o!~si·.-~~.:r :!:Jsi;;~e~ to assist th~ fi ,rc:1 CT~~A Ag:Ant!=:: in con-: .. ~. 
ducting physical surveillances and to apply increased 
investigative attention to these Soviet targets which will 
hopefully lead towards a successful defection approach. 
It is unlikely that only four men and five case 
Agents would be able to obtain complete information relating 
to the daylight, evening and weekend activitiesj contacts 
and behavior of the five Soviet targets to present a true 
picture of their character and psychological makeup essential 
to a successful defection approach.
