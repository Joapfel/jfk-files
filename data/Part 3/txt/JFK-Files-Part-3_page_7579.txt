FORMER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR 
The April 28, 1975, issue of 11Newsweek 11 magazine 
Tei9:,hol")-"1 Rm._ 
Oire~tof' See•y _ 
on page 15 under its "Periscope" section, referred to Mr. 
Tolson's death and claimed that 2 Agents reportedly removed 
documents from Hoover's residence irhere Tolson had been 
living. The article, captioned "Hoover's Secrets," carried 
the FBI '.s denial of such action and also stated that a friend 
of Tolson's said the only Hoover documents Tolson had were l 
old cancelled checks and tax returns. However, the article 
added that "Newsweek" had reported earlier that some of Hoov r's 
private dossiers, including information "very, very damaging" 
to persons in the Nixon White House, were left in Tolson's 
custody. "Newsweek" further claimed that a source·advised that 
the materials w~re carted away'in a truck. 
Mr .. Kell.ey .4as asked of Messrs. Callahan, Jenkins, 
Adams and Moore, "Do you have any id·ea where such a story got 
started? Ky." 
My memorandum to you of 4/17/75 captioned as above 
(copy attached) pointed out that Tony Marro, 11Newsweek 11 reporter, 
contacted my office that date advising he had heard from a 
source to the effect that 2 Agents were sent to Tolson's residence 
"the day of his death with a truck and carted away some files 
which were subsequently brought to the home of Mr. John P. 
Mohr, former Assistant to the Director. Upon checking with 
Mr. Mohr, Marro was advised there was absolutely no truth 
to the story. It should be noted that Mr. Mohr also· advised 
at that time that most of the furnishings at Mr.·Tolson's 
home have been removed over -the past several months and that 
there were some associates nf the family and Annie, the housekee?er 
who had stopped by the house on the day of- the death ,vith 
some empty boxes to help r~move additional furnishings.
