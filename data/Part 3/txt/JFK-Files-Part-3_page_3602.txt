During a conference on 7/16/75 between the Assistant 
Attorney General, J. Stanley Pottinger, and his staff and the 
Director of the FBI and his staff, a question arose concerning 
Martin Luther King's alleged moving from one hotel or motel to 
another hotel or motel in Memphis, Tennessee, prior to his murder 
on 4/4/68. 
Attached is a letterhead memorandum (LHM) setting forth 
an inquiry including a review of all appropriate Bureau files 
regarding a proposal made in memorandum G. c. Moore to Mr. W. c. 
Sullivan dated 3/29/68· in connection with the counterintelligence 
program wherein it was recommended that information be made 
available to a cooperative news media source showing King to be 
a hypocrite. This was to be based on the fact that when violence 
broke out during a march led by King in Memphis, Tennessee, on 
3/28/68, he disappeared. There was a first class Negro hotel 
in Memphis, the Hotel Lorraine, but King chose to hide out in --7 
a white owned and operated Holiday Inn Motel (also lmovm as the . .;--:.0-'.:..::..­
Ri vermont Motel). The LHM will reflect and document the fact • 
that although a notation appears on the memorandum,, that it was 
"handled" there.is no information available to reflect that it 
was ever actually given to a cooperative news source. Mr. Harold 
P. Leinbaugh (retired), who placed the notation 11handled 11 on the 
document, absolutely has no recollection of this matter nor can 
he state whether or not the information was dissemi:p.~teci. --O) _ _;.~ •

The time elements as documented in this LHM would 
preclude the proposal contained in the 3/29/6a memorandum of 
having any affect upon King's cnoice of a mo[~.r~n··which.._t_o reside) •.
