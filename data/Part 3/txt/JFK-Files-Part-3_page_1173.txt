After thought, no. Because the paper itself was 
so vile and anti-white that the odor would never 
stop BPP members from reading same. I've always 
hoped that a large segment of the population, 
especially the "do-gooders" could or would experience 
the nauseous reaction I have felt after reading the 
illiterate, foul-mouthed, anti-white, anti-Governi"llent, 
BPP paper. I think everybody should read a copy of 
the BPP paper so that they will know the type and 
character of BPP members. 
What do you think about anonymous letters sent to 
spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping 
with a white girl, et cetera? 
Most wives of the m·embers I recall were als·o BPP 
members and/or common-law-wives. Many BPP members 
did have liaison ·with white girls but I doubt if 
such a letter would bother most spouses of BPP members. 
However, such a letter might be of value under certain 
circumstances, example: the stories that were spread 
during ilorld War II which were not necessarily all true 
regarding Hitler, Mussolini, General Patton and others. 
In your opinion was the COINTELPRO of any value? 
Should it be changed? Do you have any suggestions 
for changes, or should it be eliminated completely? 
Yes, as I recall, it acted as~ progress letter of the 
BPP, its direction, its dissen~ion, its change in 
leadership, and indications of its slow local demise 
because of the character of the local BPP members, and 
as a summary of its activities for FBIHQ. I recall that
