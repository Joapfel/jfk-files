This instruction is not a mandate td reduce 
payments across the board on all informants and sources. 
, Offices are to evalu~te expenditures within the 
'determined guideline amount and adjust individual 
payments accordingly. 
These instructions do not mean the Bureau will 
cease authorizing payments where new informants·, are 
developed and fully justified. It is incumbent on all 
offices to evaluate these matters within the guideline 
figure. There are to be no increases in payments to 
informants and sources for the next 90 days, in line 
with the Director's instructions. 
• Each office was instructed to advise the Bureau 
by return airtel of the guideline figure determined. By 
close of bu~i.ness Si;;,p+.Pmber 30, l9?l 7 tr..~ B~::-c!!.~ is to be· 
advised by each office that these instructions have been 
complied with and that expenditures have been reduced by 
the five percent factor. On the basis of our expenditures 
during the past fiscal year, the five percent reduction 
will result in an annual saving of approximately $129,000. 
Security informant development receives continuous 
·supervisi~n. It is not technically a program justified 
semiannually or annually but rather a fundamental procedure 
in our investigative operations that requires and receives 
vigorous day to day attention. 
The Security Informant Unit main ta.ins an up-to-date 
index of Security Informants and potential security informants. 
It correlates personal and operating data (sue~ as name, 
address, code, file and symbol number) concerning these 
informants, which it receives from the Division's investigative 
se·ctions, and places such material on FD-348s, three by five 
cards .that constitute the index. This index is maintained 
on discontinued as well as current informants.
