of the Central Intelligence Agency~ and of course, every meeting 
of the NSC began with a briefing by the DCI, which necessarily 
kept the members informed about certain or many aspects of

takes the press a little longer to catch on after you have given 
it a brand new name. Call it the Cavinaugh club or anything you 
like .
