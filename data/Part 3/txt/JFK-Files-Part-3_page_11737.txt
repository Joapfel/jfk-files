committee any increase in these ceilings must be either 
(a) a result of "special studies" or at White House direction; 
or (b) by a request for a ceiling increase by proposal to 
,the committee explaining the requirement and demonstrating 
its consistency with national policy and approved program 
plans. The present FBI ceiling is 88, and regular reports 
• 'concerning our overseas positions are made to the committee 
·through the Department by the Administrative Division. 
The above has been set forth in some detail in 
response to the Inspector's request. The Director has stated 
that any expansion will be discussed with Dr. Kissinger at 
the White House before any action is taken. White House 
approval supersedes red-tape developed by other agencies. 
We are confident that the President's desires can be rapidly and 
efficiently satisfied onces he gives the word.
