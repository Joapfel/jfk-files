U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS 
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) 
EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS 
Based on these FBIHQ communications, SA Shea, 
who handled this project by himself, located all the documents 
listed in the FBIHQ work papers and classified them according 
to the information set out in the work papers. 
In addition, SA Shea also reviewed each of the 
Atlanta COINTELPRO files on the categories previously mentioned, 
for any further documents that should be classified. 
SA Shea recalled that in this part of the review he 
did locate various documents in these files which he felt re­
quired classification. 
SA Shea could not recall any specific documents 
that he so classified but did remember classifying a number 
of documents in the COINTELPRO-Hate Group file and COINTELPRO­
CP,USA file. These documents selected by SA Shea were then 
classified, and copies designated for any other Atlanta files 
were then located and classified; in addition, FBIHQ and other 
field offices that had been furnished copies of these documents 
were then notified by Atlanta to locate their copies of these 
documents and classify them according to information furnished 
by Atlanta. 
SA Shea pointed out to the SSC Staff Members that 
he recalled that subsequently FBIHQ had sent back communi­
cations to Atlanta relative to documents SA Shea had classified 
in both the COINTELPRO-Hate Group and COINTELPRO-CP,USA files. 
FBIHQ instructed that all those classified by SA Shea in the 
COINTELPRO-Hate Group file be declassifi~d as they did not 
warrant classification and also a number in the COINTELPRO­
CP,USA file also were to be declassified, which was done by 
SA Shea. 
The SSC Staff Members then inquired if during this 
review of the COINTELPRO files, whether SA Shea had noted any 
COINTELPRO actions, any recommended actions, or any COINTELPRO 
suggestions which were directed against Reverend Martin Luther 
King, Jr., Coretta King or the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference (SCLC). SA Shea indicated that in carrying out 
this project, his purpose was first to locate the COINTELPRO 
documents listed by FBIHQ in their work papers and classify 
them; next he was also to review the Atlanta COINTELPRO files 
to see if any other COINTELPRO documents prepared by Atlanta 
required classification.
