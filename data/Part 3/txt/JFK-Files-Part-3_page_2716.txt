Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all 
groups organizing or parti~ipating in such a meeting because

Mr. Adams. No, sir. 
Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn '·t that how yo.u. justify 
spying on almost every a:spect of· the. peace movement? 
Mr. Adams. No, sir. ·when we monitor demons·tra tion 9 , we 
monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the 
demonstration itself is sponsor_ed ·by a group that we have an 
investigative interest in, a valid investigative interest in, 
or where member's of one of these groups are participating where· 
there is a ·potential that they might change the peaceful 
nature of the demonstration. 
But this is our closest question of trying to draw 
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of.infringing on the 
First Amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being 
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the 
past than we do·at the present time. But we have had periods 
where the demonstrations have been rather severe, an~ the 
courts have said that the FBI has ·a right, and indeed a duty, 
to keep itself informed with respect to the possible commission 
of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be 
too late for prevention. 
And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut
