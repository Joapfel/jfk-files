why I reached the conclusion I did .. 
'\ 
Mr. Adams. The-wording of that memorandum 
Senator Hart of Michigan. And why I continue to hold to 
that conclusion. 
On January 30th, 1969, the Bureau headquarters in Washingto 
approved sending an anonymous letter to the leader of the 
Blackstone Rangers, Jeff Fbrky, which indicated that th~ Black 
Panthers had p~t a contract out on his- life as a result of 
conflicts between the two organizations.. Now, you. s_ay that was 
10 . to warn him.

I. ask, wasn't the principal purpose of the letter to 
encourage the Rangers to shoot some or all of the leadership 
of the Panthers? Otherwise, what does this quote mean, and I 
wil::J_ read it,. .It is from a memorandum from the ·.Chicago office 
of the Bureau asking approval to undertake this. Here is the 
16 way it reads:· "It is believed that the above'! this anonymous 
17 tip that a contract .is .out -<?n you, 
1
!It is .believe_d that ·the· 
. ·18 above may. intensify the degree o~ animosi i:y between the two 
. 19· groups ,and occasion.Forky to.take retaliatory actions which 
20 could disrupt· ·the-BPP, the Black. Panthers, or iead to 
21· reprisals against its . leadership. . Consideration has .been 
·22 given to a simil~r letter to th~_Panthers alleging a Ranger 
.. 23 plot against Panther leadership. However, it is not felt that 
24 this will be productive, principally because the Panthers at 
25 present is not believed as violence prone as the Rangers,
