kill me, that just means one thing. 
Mr. Schwarz. But I'm not disagreeing with you . 
Mr. Kelley. But you are disagreeing with me. You're sayin 
on the basis of experience that you cannot detect a possible 
threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, 
we don't lqse the capability of doing something. We don't 
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to 
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that 
we should act independently because maybe we don't ha~e the 
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do 
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can 
be done. 
Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you changed in the course of 
our discussion the standard on page 5. 
On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat. 
Mr. Kelley. Yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as sa¥ing a possible 
threat. 
Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat. 
Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right. 
Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than 
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to 
prevent the person from carrying out· his activit·_ies, other 
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have 
in mind?
