While there is no objection to the Inspector's 
suggestion that all communications approving initial payments 
on a regular basis to these informants be routed through 
Mr .. Tolson's o£fice for review and approval it must be pointed 
out, of course, that this creates a substantial increase in the 
preparation and review of related correspondence, not previously 
required. In view of this forseeable increase in work load, 
it is respectfully suggested tha,t we continue to handle initial 
payment correspondence under existing regulations.
