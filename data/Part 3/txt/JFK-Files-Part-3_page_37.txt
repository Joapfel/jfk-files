ACTION 
ADEX should 'ue e;l1nng,ed to include the new ali&~ &nd 
subject's position ma staff writer for the Times. Also, 
since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym, 
for the Monterey Park ProGress newspapers, it is suggested 
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue 
Serv:lce that she may be receivin~ payroll checks under ti1ese 
pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro­
priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's 
use of the add:i-tional pseudonym ..
