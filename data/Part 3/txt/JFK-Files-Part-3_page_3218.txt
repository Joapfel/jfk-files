The Chairman. Do you have .any id:ea of ho.w many names of 
Americans you ke-ep in you~ files all as a result of the 
cu.rnulative effect of all of these surveillances in all of 
these cases? 
Mr. Adams. No, I don't. 
The Chairman. It's in the millions, isn't it? 
Mr. Adams. We have 6 1/2 million .files. 
The Chairman. You have 6 1/2 million files? 
·Mr. Adams. Yes, sir. 
The Chairman. And there are surely names of more than 
one person typically in a file, aren't they? 
Mr. Adams. But it is a rather large country. 
The Chairman. That's a large number of files to start. 
with, and if you have multiple names in them, you are quic~ly 
up in to the, you know, 20·, 30, 40 million. 
Mr. Adams. Right. But many of these files are 
applicant files. They are not all subversive files. They are 
not all criminal files. We have a million crimes of violence 
each year. 
There is a million people. 
The Chairman. Sure, and I wish you had more time to 
spend on b.~ose crimes of violence. 
Mr. Adams. I do too. 
h l-! • r. h T • e c.~airman. T -ere we a.gree . 
Mr. Adams. Right.
