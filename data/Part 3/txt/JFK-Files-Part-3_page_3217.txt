won't you? 
Mr. Adams. Well, I would say as part of a normal bus'iness 
record, when we do make a judgment that an organization should 
be investigated and we investigate it, and then we find activiti s 
but we make a conclusion that there is no additional problem 
here, this is a record of our official action. Now, if we 
destroy it, at what point do we get into a situation of being 
accused of doing things and then destroying things to keep from 
showing what we do? 
The critical thing on this is whether we are able, and we 
do set up safeguards, where information in our files is not 
misused at a later date, and that is what these guideline. 
committees are all about.
