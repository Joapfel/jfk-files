TOP SECRET 2293 
were had to work with the internal dissident·s and exiles, and 
also to furnish arms to the internal __ dissidents? 
Do you recall those meetings particularly? 
MR. GRAY: I don't recall those meetings particularly, 
but if you say that the Special Group did indeed do this, I will 
not say it didn't. I just don't remember this specific instance 
MR. MARVIN GRAY: If ·you can recall, who would it have 
I 
been, or if you can speculate any, would it have been your 
understanding that such arms which were furnish.ed were -for the 
10 purposes of an internal uprising and something of that nature 
11 and·not speciflcally for doing away with the leadership? 
12 MR. GRAY: Well, as far as I am concerned, I would be 
13 shocked to be reminded of anything that had to do with doing 
, 
14 away with the leadership. No, I'would think our concern was, 
15 if we had that kind·of concern, was with being of assistance 
16 to the dissidents, and not assassination, or that kind of 
17 activity. 
18 MR . .MARVIN GRAY: Thank you. 
19 MR. BELIN: Any other comments that you want to make 
20 to the Commission, sir? 
' 
21 HR. GR2\Y: No. You have been very patient, and I 
22 am afraid that I have been somewhat longwinded. 
23 MR. BELIN: You were patiant to wait, and we are 
24 sorry you had to wait so long. 
25 Any other questions by the Commission?
