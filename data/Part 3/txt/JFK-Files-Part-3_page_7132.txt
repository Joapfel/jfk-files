This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

Director Sec'y_ 
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of~ 
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the 
Group) held o~ 2/27/75 at CIA Headquarters.. 1'.J~ 
The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate 
Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made 
up of representatives of agencies and departments having 
membership on the U.S. Intelligence Board. Its purpose is 
to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future testimony 
before various Congressional committees. 
At the meeting of the Group on 2/27/75 several 
items of interest were discussed, which items are set fort~-
hereinafter. ~ ) / 
Mr. Colby, in his role as Director of Central ~ficr-· 
Intelligence, and Mr. Clarke met with Senator Frank Church 
on the morning of 2/27/75. Church advised that it is not 
his intention to harass the intelligence community and he 
hopes to reaffirm to both the Congress and the people of the 
United States that there is a valid and critical need for 
intelligence. Church is concerned th~t no inadvertent dis­
closures result from these heari@ij~):lfch could prejudice 
sensitive intelligence communityl.4b~~st. He assured 
:Mr. Colby that he would continue to consB/I(J; .tmim ,on B.IJ¥ ,,.,. 3' fi 
sensitive matters that come before the Conunfttee~o/iv~ar-L; 
such inadvertencies. Senator Church was appreciative of 
the security guidelines furnished to him for the handling 
of sensitive information and documents and assured Mr. ColkJ ~ 
that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) would abide by tliese = •~ ~ 
guidelines. With regard to the Secrecy Agreement, which , , , .1 t.: 
- heretofor Senator Church has been somewhat reluctant to'i!ha~ 121975 1~:~ 
his staff personnel complete, it is now acceptable to the e-------=~--
Senator. However, he does want to have the Chief Counsff'<>f • 
the SSC review the Secrecy Agreement and will probably propose 
certain changes in its wording. (A Secrecy Agr.eanent was 
developed by a subcommittee of the Group in concert with the 
Justic~. Department.)
