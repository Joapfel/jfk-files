I. Background 
HEREIN~~ UNtlJISSIFILLA1id DATE J'f!>l,fO<:?-B-Y.:::::~=----r;t" 
In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee 
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's 
internal security intelligence program: 
A. The program is massive, involving the collection of 
information on the activities of thousa~ds of innocent, 
law-abidin~ American citizens. 
B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but 
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of 
"subversion" and 11extremism 11 -- purely'homegrown "threats 
to the national security". 
C. That FBI policy on "suoversive" and "extremist" inv~s­
•tigations was vague and subject to t~e following abuses: 
1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated 
whose threats to the national securtty were tenuous, 
if not non-existent. 
2. collection of information on the personal liie and 
political views of subjects unrelated to the national 
security. 
3. _the continuance of investigations well after it 
should have become obvious that there was no legiti­
mate predicate. 
,• .;: 
D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used, 
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur­
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated, 
the predominan.t and perhaps most· insidious continues 
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source 
network. • 
E. Information collected in the course of these investiga­
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal 
government and to local law enforcement. 
F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi­
gations was di.sseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro­
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and 
others in an effort to c:5.iscredit or "neutralize" alleged 
"subversives" o·r "extremists" .. / / . ,I
