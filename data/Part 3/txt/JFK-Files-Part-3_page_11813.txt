seven Special Agents. The greatest majority of our double agent 
cases are assigned in these Units and these are among the most 
complex investigations. The operation of a double agent requires 
minute supervision to insure that the objectives of the investi­
gation are achieved. The Soviet Unit - Washington also supervises 
two illegal agent cases, and the Soviet Unit - New York has the 
overall supervision of the Ironclad source. 
The Satellite Unit, which supervises the investigations 
in the Polish, Romanian, Czechoslovakian, and Yugoslav nationality 
fields, has a total of 1,408 investigations, including the informants 
and double agents that are being directed against the Soviet-bloc 
establishments and personnel. There is, therefore, an average of 
352 investigations in this Unit. 
The Coordination Unit is currently handling 1,226 
investigations, of which 178 are assigned to a Clerk in lieu of 
an Agent. Considering that this Unit has the responsibility for

Ag~nts. The figure of 751 compares favorably with the total of 
768 at the tlme of the last inspection, which number was divided
