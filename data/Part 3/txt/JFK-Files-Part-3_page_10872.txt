th~ intelligence agencies. Here again, the Bureau can 
be tho dominant and pushing source. 
It is believed that if we moved along the lines 
describ0d above, ·ci:l.0 Bu:rcau, over u ;period of time, would 
have collected valu~ble information regarding numerous 
personalities ind the inner workings of the many diplomatic 
.. establishme~1ts o The 2.cquirement: of data of this type 
creates operational strength. It places us in a position 
to exploit the development of neu sources, bearing in mind 
that in planning our a.pproaches we will be equipped with. 
ammunition not gained through casual surveillances and 
observations. 'With the knowledge that we gain, we can 
plan high quality op0rations. It is interesting to.note 
that during the past two years the information received 
f:l"om. CIA' s sources in the United States hz.s been fairly 
voluminous and ve?y definitely valuable. It is a good

Undoubtedly rel2.ted ·to the utilization of other 
agencies' resouTces is'the considerably vast potential 
offered by friendly foreign security services. If the 
services of Great Britain, Germany, France, Holland, Italy, 
Australia and Canada provided us intormation collected in 
Washington, D. c. and New York resulting from contacts with 
·communist-bloc officials, we would have another valuable 
source of information. We should be2.r in mind that ·we do 
spend hundreds and thousands of man-nouTs seeking such 
information through other difficult ch~nnels. •• 
We should utilize the friendly liaison services 
along the lines described above.
