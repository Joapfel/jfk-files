.. There was also an October 12, 1962 addendum to the above--
• ··mentioned October 11 memorandum from Mr. ·Parrott to rv-ir. Bundy, 
stating: "Later." The memorandum related that~ according to 
· Mr. Knocke, Mr. McCone had decided the day before (October 11) 
that these flights must be either entirely overt or entirely 
covert, and he didn't part,icularly ca:re which so long as they 
were accomplished as soon as possible. In Mr. McCone•s absence, 
General Carter had come to an agreement with General McKee, 
Vice-Chief of Staff of the Air Force, along those lines on 
October 11; later, however, Mr. Gilpatric said that this was 
not his understanding of the terms of authorization from higher 
authority. Mr. Gilpatric felt that the idea was that a uniformed 
pilot should operate the Agency's vehicle. 
On October 12 at 12:45, General Carter had a meeting with 
Mr. Bundy and at that time General Carter stated that the Agency 
operation was ready to go except for weather, and that this 
would hold it up until at least Sunday, and meantime the SAC 
pilot would have received the necessary training. It was agreed 
that if the pilot was sufficiently trained by the earliest time 
the mission could be mounted, the flight would go, with all 
other arrangements within .the Agency framework. If the pilpt 
were not ready by the time the vehicle was ready, the mi~sion • 
would be mounted as a completely Agency operation, i.e., with 
a civilian pilot. According-to Mr. Lay, the USIB had taken 
the following actions a·t its October 10, 1962 meeting with 
respect to the targets listed in the CQMOR paper of October 6: 
(1) The Group I targets were not discussed by USIB, the impli­
cation being that there was no problem from the point of view 
of USIB I s jurisd;iction. (2) Groups II and III should be 
covered as rapidly as po"ssible ·initially, and after that the 
frequency of coverage would.be frirther examined. (3) COMOR 
was to re-do the section of.the October 6 paper dealing with 
Group IV, with targets to be broken out in categories of p~iorty, 
and_ USIB would consider this new paper on October 17. USIB 
did not consider any operational ~spects, but confined them­
selves to the importance of the targets and the frequency 
of coverage.
