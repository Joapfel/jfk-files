-~hotograph some things that were in my files from the past regi e • 
that was there, but also of other officers that were there that 
I could not trust, I-wanted to see what kind of reports and 
things that were made. So I did photograph those. So I did 
make a bre~kin. 
. MR. OLSEN: What I am trying to do, Frank, is to draw 
a distinction, if I can, _between some plans for, some setting u 
.qf exercises that would be.preparatory to an attempt to assassi 
nate Premier Castro, Che Guevara and Raoul Castro and others th t 
might be with them. I-am trying to distinguish that kind of 
planning and preparation for an actual attempt to carry it out. 
MR. ROETHE: Were there any shots ever fired? 
MR. STURGIS: .No sir~ As a matter of fact, in order 
to avoid that, because my people wanted to do it• so badly, I ha 
to take the-·ammunition away from them just to contain them. 
MR .. ROETHE: Was this an exercise that was going to b 
-- was this going to be a shooting? 
MR. STURGIS: Oh, yes. 
MR. ROETHE: So it was not a bombing or anything of 
this sort,· strictly a shooting? 
MR. STURGIS: A shooting. 
MR. OLSEN: How soon before you left.Cuba did this 
setting up of the exercises take place? 
MR. STURGIS: ·rt was within, I would say, four to six 
weeks.
