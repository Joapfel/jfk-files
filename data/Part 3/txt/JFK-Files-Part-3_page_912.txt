. For your information• ou1• own investigative guidelines as con-
tained in our Manual of Insu•uctions relating to domestic subversive investiga­
tions have been completely rewritten to conform with the concept that our 
domestic intelligence-type investigations are based on Federal statutes. These 
·guidelines provide that in each instance• the domestic intelligence investigation 
must be predicated on information indicating that the org·anization or individual 
is engaged in activity which could involve a violation of specific statutes relating 
to the national security. A copy of the new guidelines was pi•eviously provided 
to the Department of Justice in connection with the request of Senator Edward M. 
Kennedy td obtain a copy of the FBI's Section 8'7 of the Manual of Instructions. 
The effective date of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.
