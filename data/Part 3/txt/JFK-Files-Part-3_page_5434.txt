QUESTION: 
MR. KELLEY: 
Mr. Kelley, earlier you spoke of the advantages and limitations 
of hindsight. After having examined the records of the break-ins 
and other surreptit~ous activity, you observed that you thought it 
was well inten~ioned, I believe, in most cases. Did you also 
observe that there was any gross misuse _of ·authority in the 
process of that? 
I do not note in these activities any gross misuse of authority. 
I see a consistent thread of well-intentioned a~tivities. Perhaps 
now in the present society, and in the context of now and in those 
times, I do not feel that it was a corruption of the trust that 
• has been placed in us. As now we have determined a valuati<:m 
that perhaps could be wrong, but in those days there was no 
intention to engage in activities which were prohibited, illegal, 
or otherwise wrong. 
Mr. Kelley, why wouldn't an act like the bugging of Martin Luther 
King's hotel room have been a betrayal of trust? These Agents 
. 
took an oath under the Constitution and th~t was prohibited by 
Federal law at that time. 
There have been a number of articles written about this situation. 
In reviewing this situation, I feel that the authority stemmed from • 
the proper source. It was a matter which was construed in those 
times as of considerable concern to the country, and the FBI acted 
in accordance with the request which was made that it be installed.
