Memorandum to Mr. Walsh 
Re: Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence Activities 
• 
~ 
ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, .. WOC:aso, 4/4/75 
The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures 
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current 
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these 
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a 
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability 
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign 
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Pivision strongly recommends 
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate 
Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment 
in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as m C.
