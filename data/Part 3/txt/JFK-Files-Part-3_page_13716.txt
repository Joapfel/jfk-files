Mr. Johnston. What suddenly required that order to be 
given? 
AMLASH Case Officer. Well, nothing specific except that 
10 by December of '63, the man with whom we were dealing, AMI.ASH I, 
11 was going back, or was probably back by that time already in 
12 Cuba. It was primarily probably I would say as much to protect 
13 his security as anything else . 
14 Mr. Johnston. So that nobody else -- did this have the 
15 effect of blocking knowledge of the AMI.ASH operation from other 
16 people within the Agency? 
17 AMLASH Case Officer. Probably from my office down. Certai 
18 not Fitzgerald, not the Director or not anybody else who needed 
19 to know ab.out the operation, absolutely not. This was just 
20 circulation within other components of SAS. That would not 
21 in other words, a note of this type would only mean that I 
22 would be, or whoever would clear the order would be asked 
23 before this file was allowed to circulate or was given to 
24 anybody. 
25 Mr. Johnston. And I don't want to indicate -- my question
