Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operati~ns,: 
62-56866 
In his afternoon testimony , Mr. Staats will make the following 
observations and recommendations: 
1. Few would deny the necess~ty for the FBI to conduct domestic 
security intelligence investigations , but there should be clearer guidelines 
governing their- purpose and scope . 
2. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General should be charged 
with the responsibility for ensuring that the FBI complies with g·uidelines 
which mi-ght be issued by the Attorney General rather than diffusing this . 
responsibility among various divisions of the Department of Justice. 
3 . As suggested by the Rockefeller Commission, there should 
be a mechanism created either in the FBI or in the Department of Justice to 
evaluate and analyze the rE?sults of the FBI' s domestic ~ecurity intelligence 
investigations. 
4. Although only 16 of the 676 cases· reviewed by G ... 1.0 (3 percent) 
were referred to a United States Attorney for prosecutive opinion, in 43 percent 
of the cases (291), the FBI was able to establish that the subject was a leader 
or a member of a subversive orga..---iization or was.prone w violence. 
5 . FBI field offices are not fully consistent m the manner in 
which they conduct preliminary inquiries and frequent-ly, •do not conclude 
the inquiry within the allotted 90 days. 
FBIHQ personnel are continuing to review tlm,e attachment, and 
we anticipate consulting with GA0 1s staff on Monday moE111ing, 9/22/75, to 
disquss any changes deemed necessary. ~
