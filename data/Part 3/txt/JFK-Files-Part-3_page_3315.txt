·Martin Luther King, Jr.~ President of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference~ injected himself into the 
sanitation workers' strike in Memphis, Tennessee, and the . 
result of King's famous espous.:;.l c.i nonviolence was vandalism, 
looting, and riot. 
. . 
Previously, King involved himself in this strike, 
called for a general strike, and called for a·mass march. 
Today he led the mass march in an automobile at the head of 
the line. Negroes began shouting "black power" and trouble 
began. King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the 
marchers, absented himself from the scene; window breaking·and 
looting broke o~t. 
Police officers were forced to use gas to brea~ up 
the march and to control the crowd. It was necessary to 
activate the National Guard. Martin Luther.-I<fig claims his
