General Doolittle asked whether there has also been a st~nd~do~ri in 
~la~destinc intelligence collection efforts with respect to Cuba, and 
General Carter answered in the negative. Mr. Fitzgerald st~tcrl that the 
volativity of the Cuban people is a factor, arid over the long run the ~apability 
of CIA to infiltrate inte\ligcnce agents into Cuba is affected by the morale 
of the Cuban people which in turn is affected by the su~cess of sabotage nets 
directed against Cuba. 
In answer to a question from Chairman Clifford,-Mr. Fitzgerald said 
that no hard facts had been obtained concerning the purpos~ and subject 
matter of Castro's recent talks ,dth K_hru~hchcv in Moscow, although the 
Panama and Cuban 2conomic si~uations may have b~e~ discu~sed -- Hr. Fitzgerald 
agreeing with Murphy that this is all specL"'ation on CIA' s part. 
rGenetal Carter said that our Government's economic denial program 
against Cuba is also falling by the wayside, as r~flec\t~d by the actions 6f 
Britain and Spain in· trading with. Cuba. :r~1ere -is a vi!ew; ·General.Carter
