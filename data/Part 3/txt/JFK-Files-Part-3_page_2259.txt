1\ilemorandum to Mr. W. R. W annall 
Re: General Accounting Office (G_AO) Review of __ FBI Operations 
62-56866 
2. GA.O's staff which reviewed FBI-prepared case summaries 
concluded that the use of summaries, supplemented by follow-up interviews 
with FBI Special Agents, provided n ..• a good understanding of what occurred 
in each investigation." 
3. Because GAO's verification proposal was not adopted, it 
/ was unable to provide Congress with full assurance of the accuracy and 
completeness of summary information that the FBI provided. 
4. The legal authority upon whicp. FBI domestic intelligence 
I 
operations are based is ambiguous , and it would be appropriate for Congress 
to specify such authority. 
5. Legislation specifying FBI authority in the dop:)estic security 
area should address the issue of what role GAO should play in assisting 
the Congress to carry out its oversight functioit. 
The material described aoove comprises GAO's opening testimony 
-for the morning of 9/24/75. GAO has indicated that it will furni~h the FBI 
material prepared for delivery in the afternoon on that date when it is completed. 
We expect that GAO's afternoon testimony will be considerably more detailed 
and that the draft submitted to us will be more critical of FBI domestic intel­
ligence policies and practices. We will evaluate this material upon receipt. 
ACTION: 
None. For information of the Director.
