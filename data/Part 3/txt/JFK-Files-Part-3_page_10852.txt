I; EFFECT ON THE FBI OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION

l. Overt Collection Activities 
It is evident from the National Security Act of 
1947 and th0 succeeding National Security Council Xntelligonce 
Directives as we11 as the directives of the Director of 
Central Intelligence that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection 
of foreign intelligence in the United States. In pursuit C\f 
this, CIA exploits non-governmental organizations and . .\ . • 
individuals, foreign language publications and aliens. Although 
CIA claims to have contacts with about 7,200 organizations· 
and businesses as -well as about 60,000 sources of information 
as a result of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA 
estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign 
intelligence information available in this country. 
The question we must consider here is whether the 
FBI should take over the overt collection of foreign intelligence 
in the Uni tect 8ta-ces, tnere'i)ylac:.W.'>-il.'Lf; CIA 0pG:r~.:t~.~r.::.l only in 
( ·\i areas outside the limits of FBI's jurisdiction. In this 
j connection, the following .would have to be considered:

(a) Reporting: 
The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has 
,traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings 
1
, 
without bias or conclusions. This would not change. . 
Intelligence developed by the FBI would be evaluated by the l 
usei~s in the intelligence community. Our report writing l 
format might have to be geared to the needs and established j 
procedures of the United States intelligence community. I
