Director Sec'y_ 
Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. 
t
Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is 
reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is Jf·fl 
accepting nothing with 12 strings attached. 11 •. 
. ~I, 
Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the 1 \ 
FBI is furnishing information to~, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's 
statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate 
Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as 
classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp. 
Section Chief William 0. Cregar advised that he had contacted 
Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee 
concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA 
Director William E. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that 
this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting 
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of 
4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O. 
Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position_ 
l
that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House 
should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared 
to ~e\nd a letter over his signature to Senator Church to obbµ.n such clarificatio~. 1).:
