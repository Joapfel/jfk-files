• You were previously advised by my letter dated

j 
Janua:cy- 23, 1976, of recent allegations against the FBI 
relating to the Secret Army Organization {SAO) that 
appeared in a series of articles beginning JMuary 11, 
1976,. in the 11San Diego Union" Nawspaper. These articles 
alleged the FBI created and financed the SAO and controlled ,1 
the activities of this group through an informant, Howard Barry 1 \' 
Godfrey, who was a leader of this organization. You were ' 1 also advised the inquiry being conducted concerning these allega~ 
tions had thus· far indicated they were unfounded. 
This is to advise you that our inquiry into 
this matter has been completed. This inquiry which 
included a review of all pertinent court records and 
FBI Headquarters and San Diego Field Office files reveals 
allegations against the FBI, concerning our investigation 
of the SAOt are without merit and .clearly shows the FBI 
did not organize, control,. or finance the SAO. Information 
we received concerning illegal activities conducted or 
planned by the SAO was immediately disseminated to 
appropriate law enforcement agencies. 
In the above-mentioned series of articles 
there were certain allegations made by former SAO members 
and associates when interviewed by newspaper reporter Patrick 
Dillon. These individuals previously expressed a desire 
to the news media to discredit Godfrey, or had been found 
guilty following legal proceedings in which Godfrey was 
an important witness.. Allegations made by them to Ur. Dillon 
included: ~~ ___ . {_, ,,<_~,:,. /,:!.·:,.:.!';:;.,._:-:'
