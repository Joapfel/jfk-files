On December 6, 1962,- you were furnished information 
indicating that despite the Reverend }fartin Luther King's 
statcm~nt of October 31, 1962 11 that Kunter Pitts O'Dell '}. 
had resigned his position with the Southern Christian 
Lea6.ership Conference (SCLC)p O'Dell had continued to 
rGpresen.t himself as being affiliated with the Neu York 
Office of the SCLC and, during late :November and early 
Ik~c0mbcr.1) 1962 • was actively engaged in the work of 
this or£nmiza.tion. Reverend King 5 s public statement 
of ,ctobf;?T 31, 1962, was occasio.ned by an editorial in 
th~.:, -"r-tohe.r 25 1 1962, edition of the uAugusta Ch.ronicle/~ 
l!...1.1[:;r-ctc .. , Geor.gia. 0 which i<lentified O'Dell as a concealed 
::.ember of the national Committee~ Communist Pa:rty, USA. 
who was employed by the SCLC under the alias Jack H. O'Dell.

/ that on three occasions during early January• 1963, O'Dell 
' registered at an apartment in Atlantap Georgia, as J~ H. 
/ ~ , • 0 1 Dell. On each occasion# O'Dell represented himself as
