under guise of employment by an organization doing business 
in South America. 
A closing paragraph of Colonel Park's report 
commented on observations made by an official of OSS as

"This official of OSS added that it was the policy 
of his agency not to give any more information than necessary 
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He pointed out that

discussed the FBI in an unfavorable light and had painted

Investigation not only outside the United States but in 
the domestic field. The publicity campaign referred tQ 
was to be one of the means adopted·to accomplish this 
purpose," .. . • ;:: , ;: ':}} .·,
