I 
~& there any CIA connection with an anti-Castro group which 
held meetings at 3126 Hollandale Street in Dallas or with 
a Cuban group which allegedly held meetings attended by Oswald 
at 3128 Harlendale Street in Dallas? 
Answer: 
Our file search to date has revealed no information concerning 
these two addresses. However, we are not satisfied that all 
possible CIA records have been consulted. A final report 
concerning this question will be forwarded to the Commission 
by 2 May 1975.
