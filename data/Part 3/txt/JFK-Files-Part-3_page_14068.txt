r.oncerning the recent release of the CIA estimate on the Soviet economy,. 
Mr. Cline said that despite the welter of denials and counterattacks by the 
USSR, the CIA has ind1.caticns that its est1.m~te w;:is .correct. The first "Pravda'' 
blast contained statistics confirming the CIA's estimate of a J per cent gain 
in the SoviP.t GNP. The next issue of Pravda omitted· these statistics. 
As for the Sino-Sovie~·, co~flict, Mr. Cline stated that this deep ana 
bitter struggle reflects oppqsing national interests and policy views, and is 
a contest for dominance ~..,htch is. nearing the breaking point. The anti-Soviet 
vituperation coming out of.Communist China is unprecedented. CIA's clandestine 
reporting indicates that the Chicoms are attemRting to subvert Soviet leadership 
around the world, an<l to discredit Khrushchev in the USSR. Exchanges of- secr,?t 
Party letters indic..1ce that a Sino-Soviet break must com~. The, basis of the 
dispute seems to be the failure of the USSR to provide the economic and military 
support which China needed in crder ~o enlarge its industrial capacity. Pubil~ 
' exchanges of insults,. and intellig~nce from various sources, shows that the 
breach began in 1960 from differen~es of policy with regard to degree o.~ rtsk 
of war which should be acceptable to Communism in its actions affecting the W,~st. 
Also there is a· lot of prejud:fce against China in the Soviet military. Mr. t:line 
does not think that Sino-Soviet differences can be resolved so long as Ma6 and 
i:hrusl1chev a.re in posit ions of leadership.
