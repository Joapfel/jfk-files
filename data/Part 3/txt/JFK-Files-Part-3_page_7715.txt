Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, we write to 
re4uest the delivery forthwith to the members whose names are listed 
in the attach..~ent hereto of any files on.them or documents concern­
_ing them that are in the possession, custody or control of ·the 
.Department ·of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation . 
. This request is made pursuant to the mandate of the Senate, 
contained in S. Res. 21. That Resolution re4uires us to investigate 
the 11conduct o.L domestic intelligence or counterintelligence opera­
•tions against United States citizens by·the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation or any other Federa;I. agency 11 • 
One means of accomplishing this objective is to review the 
material, if any, which the Department of Justice has gathered on 
members of the United States Senate. 
This re4uest is made pursuant to the Com.mittee's mandate and 
not under the Freedom of Information Act. The exemptions to that 
Act are designed to allow federal agencies and departments the 
degree of confidentiality necessary to conduct the ongoing.activities 
of the Executive Branch, not to prevent a duly constituted Congres­
sional Committee from understanding the nature, legality, and 
propriety of some of those activities. Whether as a matter of agree­
ment between the Committee and the Department some material that may 
be in any such files should be withheld depends upon an analysis of 
the weight of the particular reason put forward for the proposed ~ }'2 y 
withholding balanced against the Committee's need to exercise its T /;) _/,./ -
