for purposes ·of identification of what you looked like in those days?

tween your appearance at that time and the appearance of certain persons 
who were taken into custody in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963?

on the print its-elf, where you have separately identified the year in which 
th.~ photograph was taken on the back of the photograph. Is that correct?
