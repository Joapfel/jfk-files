A majo1• thrust of Profe:ssor Elliff'H piipcr concerned FBI authority 
derived from le~islativc cnnctmonts ns opposed to thut d(:rivcd from P,;.•cddential 
clirectivct1. bcgir...p.ing w 1th a directive iHsued by President l~ooscvcJ.t in 
ffoptember, 1930. Profr.snor Elliff is of tho opinion iho.t the 1839 directive, 
which was rdte1'atcd 0~1 il11·ce subsequent occasions, wns rnngnificd by the 
FBI from il~ .. original purpose to a definitive order to conduet intellil;'oncc-type 
:investig·utio1"!s. 
, Sena.tor Sam J. Ei•vin, ns you knm.•1. had beon p1°cbing' fritO the 
nature nn.d r.:)xtcnt of FBI intr-:llig0nco-typ0 investigations. S=::nntor Ervin had 
even unnounci::d that he intended to propoa0 lq;.isfotion to p2.·ohibit the :..-BI 
from invc.rnti2;ating any p~:i:t;on withuut that i11dlvidu~l 1 s conr.\E:nt, u11li.:::3a the

Our stud.y rcvGalod that the FBI h~d declared publicly o·v ffi? a

In carefully unulyziJ:.r; the lnng1.1.urre of the fir:rt directive j d£?ted 
September 6, 1939, nnd. considering· that tho subsequent directives ore f.lJl 
hinged on that one, we bd.ieve that there is o. rnisconccpi.ion as to the extent 
of jurisdiction or authorH:y c.-onve:ycd to the I•LH by these dlrcctiv<~s. ft 
cppoa1·s th,tt while ti10 103G directive fixed rc:;ponsibility on the· FDJ. to ht,ndlc 
espionage, sabotage, o.n<l ncutl'illHy mutters. it did not e:o:tT'lC!}r r.m.y tmtl1ority 
or jurisdiction which t110 FDI did not olreudy have from lc.>pJslative onl\ctl1:.ent1;;. 
It is difficult to r(!ad into this directive or in uny of 1.ho~c which f.ollortC!d. nny
