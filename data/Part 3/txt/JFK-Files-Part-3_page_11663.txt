The activities of black extremists continue to place 
a heavy demand upon the Bureau's manpower and resources. 
. There are numerous black extremist groups throughout 
the nation, the majority of which are local in nature and 
relatively small in membership. These groups, however, either 
directly or indirectly, advocate defiance of the law, hostility 
toward constituted authority and, in some instances, advocate • 
outright destruction of Government and establishment of a 
Marxist-Leninist form of Government. The activities of these 
groups constitute a constant threat to the internal security 
·of the country through their propensity for violence, hatred 
of anq outright opposition to our form of.Government .
