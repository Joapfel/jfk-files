SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM 
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS 4-H 
BACKGROUND AND DATE OF INCEPTION 
Studies pertaining to the handling of individuals 
who in time of an emergency would represent a potential threat 
to the national security began prior to World War II. The 
actual program began in June, 1940, and dealt mainly with 
lists of individuals considered for detention in the event of 
a threat to the national security. 
SCOPE AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES 
This program is field-wide in scope. The goal of the 
Security Index (SI) Program is the identification of individuals 
who because of their membership and activity and/or association 
with subversive organizations are dangerous or potentially 
d~ngero.us .. to tbP- in.tP-:rnal security of the country. The prog:ram 
includes the collection of sufficient information relating to 
the activities of such individuals to justify their apprehension 
and detention in the event of a national emergency. Another 
g6al of the SI is to maintain it in a current status in the 
event immediate implementation is necessary to minimize 
possibilities of espionage, sabotage and subversion. The SI is 
broken down into three Priority groupings, the cards being tabbed 
either Pr:i:ority I, II or III in accordance with the .. relative 
factor of dangerousness. Most dangerous individuals are tabbed 
Priority I. 
POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED SINCE LAST INSPECTION 
By way of background, in February, 1969, as a matter of 
temporary expediency, the Executives Conference approved a 
moratorium on certain Security Matter - Communist investigations 
and periodic report writing in Priority.II and Priority III 
Security Index cases; moratorium later extended to January 1, 1971. 
By memorandum October 29, 1970, from the Executives Conference 
to Mr. Tolson, approved by the Director, the moratorium was 
lifted. At the time there were approximately 10,690 individuals 
on the SI who were of the Priority II and III types. Virtually 
no investigation had been conducted regarding approximately 7,000 
of these individuals since the imposition of the moratorium in
