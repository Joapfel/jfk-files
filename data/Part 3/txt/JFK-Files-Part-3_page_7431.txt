Memorandum to Mr. Adams 
Re: Senate Select Committee 
• 
questions to be asked Mr. Papich. He said that Elliff was agreeable to 
an informal arrangement under which the FBI would not require the 
presence of a Bureau representative at such interviews, but would expect 
to receive the identity of persons to be interviewed plus a statement as to 
the subject matter of the interview. Elliff then proceeded to identify as 
those persons scheduled for interview as William Turner, who will be 
interviewed today or this weekend by Mike Epstein at San Francisco, and 
"Chick" Brennan, who was interviewed yesterday, May 22, 1975, by Mark 
Gitenstein and who may be interviewed again today. 
As to the interview of Sam Papich, Elliff said that the interview 
would concern: 
1. A liaison agreement between the FBI and CIA; 
2. The abolition of Papich's liaison responsibilities in 1970; 
3. Dissatisfaction by the FBI with the Huston Plan; 
4. The views in the White House regarding the intelligence 
community and the FBI with reference to a conversation Elliff had with 
Mr. Wannall and Mr. Cregan on May 22, 1975; 
5. A detailed follow-up on the discussions with Mr. Wanna!];. 
6. A copy of the Huston Plan and certain minutes taken of 
meetings at which the Huston Plan was discussed. These minutes allegedly 
were made by William Cregar; 
7. The matter raised with Paul Daly on May 22, 1975. (Mr. Daly 
recalled that Mr. Elliff discussed an incident concerning the CIA and the 
FBI which occurred at Denver, ·Colorado.) 
Mr. O'Connor said that an interview proposed with former 
SA Nichols has been postponed indefinitely according to Elliff because 
of Nichols' unavailability.
