Senator Hart of Hichi.gan. Let's assume that the rule 
for open.ing an investiga ti6n on a group is narrowly drawn. 'rhe 
Bureau manual states that•informants investigating a subversive 
o.rga)1izat'ion shou}d _not •only report on what that gro':).p is 
doing but should look at and report on a_ctiviti.es in which 
the group is participating. 
There is· a Section -8783 dealing with reporting~on 
connections with other groups. 'l'hat section says -that the 
field office shall •11determirie and report on any significant 
connection or cooperation with 11on-subversive groups." Any 
significc1nt connection or cooperation with non-subversive 
groups. 
Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of 
1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the 
installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us 
remember that. An FBI informant and two Fl3I confidential 
sources ;eported on the plan's participants and activities 
of the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Against the l\.BM, 
particularly in open public debate in·a high school auditorium, 
which included speakers from the Defense Department for the 
ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the l\.DM. 
The informants reported on the planning fo~ the meeting, 
the distribution of materials to chur.cheG and schools, 
participation by local clergy, plane to seek resolution on t·, • 
ADM from noarby town councils. There wns also informal·'· :.,n
