.Na tionali ties Intelligence Section . posed by the 
GAD:hc 8/20/71 . Inspector could be 
.'Vt'ITized by our foreign offices in those cases where they 
recognize that an-investigative report must be prepared 
and where the information developed abroad is suitable 
for inclusion in such a report. We do not believe, howeyer, 
that across-the-board instructions should be issued requiring 
this procedure in all instances, nor do we believe that such 
a requirement-was visualized by the Inspector inasmuch as 
he· suggests amendment of the Foreign Operations Policy 
Manual to include inserts as one of four means of reporting 
.. inve~tiga.tive results by the Legal Attaches. In fact, 
.. • . Legal Attaches now prepare FD-302s in certain cases when 
~- ipecifically requested bv the field. These a~e, of course,
