beyond that, would you give me any suggestions.'you have on 
how you would provide the methods!- the access, the documents, 
the records, the authority, for the Congress to perform its 
essential, I believe, essential oversight responsibility to 
see that these functions, these delicate functions are being 
undertaken_properly2 
And.before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing 
I am concerned about. 
It hasn't been long ago that the FBI Director was not 
even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe 
you are the first one to be confirmed by the Senate of the 
United States. I think that is a movement in the right 
direction. I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an 
additional importance that requires it to have closer supervisi n 
and scrutiny by us. 
At the same time I rather doubt that we can become 
involved in the daily relatianship between you and the Attorney 
General. 
Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General 
needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the 
FBI. 
I would appreciate any comments on that. 
Second, I rather believe that major decisions of the 
intelligence cor!li,mni ty and the FBI ought to be in writing, so 
that the Congress can, if it needs to in the future, take a 
NW 38601! Docld:329 1!20
