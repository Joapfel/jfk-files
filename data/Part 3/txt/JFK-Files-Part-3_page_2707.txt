Senator Tower. \·lhat criteria do you use in the selection 
of informants? 
Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In 
our cases relating to extremist matter~, surely in. ·order to get 
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a 
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set 
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security 
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require 
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which ~ould consist 
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field 
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating 
in the same area, and in various established sources such as 
local police departments. 
Following this, if it appears that the person is the type 
who has credibility, can be depended.upon to be reliable, we 
wquld interview the individual in order to make a determination 
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI 
in discharging its responsibilities. in that field. 
Fol.lowing that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we 
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for the. purpose 
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability. 
Senator.Tower .. How. does the-Bureau. distinguish between 
the. use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to 
intelligence. collection? 
Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?
