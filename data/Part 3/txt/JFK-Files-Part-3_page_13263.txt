• Wait just a minute. I am sorry.~_ I could be wrong 
there. I said the w~ong thing. 
If I am going after the Bay of.Pigs invasion, if 
this did happen, as .. far as the date is concernedt after the­
Bay of Pigs invasion, Edwardo did quit the operation and go 
on some other assignment or what have you. So. that means 
he was no longer in the Miami area. So this part I had to 
get a new case officer. 
MR~ OLSEN: Edwardo left Miami before the B'ay 
of Pigs, didn't he? 
.MR. STURGIS: He left after -- well, I don't know 
I am sorry. Because there is a possibility that he.may have 
been either in ·Miami or he may have been in the. Headquarters 
in Washington. But I can't pin it down because I ·aon't know 
exactly where he was at. 
MR. OLSEN: Did he eve~ make contacts with this man's 
case officer? 
MR. STURGIS: No, sir, because-it had to be one of 
two people, it either had to be Edwardo, whom I had never met, 
. 0.) 
or it had to be possibly e,_im Knowles) after Edwardo left. 
MR. OLSEN: Did@._,im Kno~ies)take his place, then? 
0) 
MR. STURGIS:. I believe so, I believe~m Knowles] 
. . 
did take his place as this party's case officer. 
MR. OLSEN: And then, you did not actually have any 
contc:tct with his case officer?
