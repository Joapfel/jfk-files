Council For Statehood 
Tlest Palm Be2.ch, Florida 
The Council fo::::- Statehood has been found to 
be not an action group but rather a mailing facility 
for the writings o:f ~~0-:R.Y_3J,XD:W:-J...SON. These writings 
are disse~inated to local-and national legislators and 
all are filed with the Li·brary o:f Congress in Washington. 
The dissesirration of writings by this group has now become 
practically negligible. ·The group is said to have 
political overtones as .2. republican group. 
It is not reco::un.ended that·any positive~ 
harassEent activit1es be underta..~en with regard to this 
group at this time, since such action, in all probability, 
would enhance the activities of this group rather than 
accoillplish the desired· effect.
