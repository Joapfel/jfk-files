A Key Activist album containing photographs and 
biographical data on each key activist has be~n furnished to 
all offices. This album is maintained in a current status 
and has proved invaluable in following activities and travel 
of New Left key activists. By airtel dated 3/10/69 to all 
offices the field was instructed to submit reports each 
three months on key activists. The field was also instructed 
to prepare communications suitable for dissemination when 
these key activists filled a speaking engagement and whenever 
_they made statements indicating a propensity for violence or 
urging student agitation. The purpose of this program is to 
secure testimony and evidence concerning violations of 
statutes particularly where these key activists are involved 
in campus disorders. The field has also been instructed to 
develop detailed information on sources of funds used by 
key activists and to closely follow their travel. Handwriting 
specimens of each key activist must be obtained and placed 
in the ""National Secnri ty £ile maintained by -che laborai:01:y. 
i The key activist program has been most successful. 
We have been enabled to closely follow the activities of 
these individuals and to provide other interested agencies 
with pertinent information. It is noted that more than half 
~f the individuals designated as key activists are subjects 
of some tY,pe of prosecutive action .
