UNITED STATES SENATE 
Washington, Do-C,, 20510 
January 30,1976 
Mr. William H. Lawrence 
314- Swiss Pine Lake Drive· 
S~ruce Pine, North Carolina 28?77 
Dear Mr. Lawrence:. 
• 
Thank you :for your letter of JanuaTy 26 regard­
ing the unfair treatment being received by the -F ~B.I ...... 
Rest assured, this is one Senator who has not b~en 
fooled by all this nonsense .. We haYe had experience 
enough with so-called ad hoc committees which tend 
toward sensationalizing of their subject matter, and 
cater to a press hungry for lea~s of sensitive inform­
ation ... 
Of course 1 I'm sure the F,B,I~ has made 
mistakes--who hasn't? What is important is nhat 
these mistakes have been few and far between, and the 
F...B.I .. was and is the most honest and efficient law 
enforcement agency in the world. 
When the country is faced with c!l?i tical problems· 
of inflation, people out of work, and the price of energy 
going out of sight, c·ongress do-es not need to be i;:idis­
tracted from these important problems by a sideshow 
run by left-wing columnists and commentators ... 
Thanks again for writing. Please continues to 
share your thoufshts with me o 
JESSE: HELMS.: Jn 
MbR. I~ 
Sincerely 
Jesse Helms
