and to say that the CIA cannot have any personnel, and cannot 
be in vol v,ed in this country, of c9urse, is sort of silly. r am 
speaking now of not the intelligence analysis and publications, 
but I am talking about the acquisition of intelligence and 
counterinte~ligence and count~~espionag2. If you are too precis , 
then some matters are going to get lost between abroad and at 
home. 
-Now, there's got to be some way for the flow and 
transfer back and forth from the CIA and the FBI, so I would 
myself find it yery difficult to see how the Congress could 
precisely define the functions of the Agency. 
But I would see no objection to rnak~ng it clear that 
the American people need not fear that we are going to have a 
' 
national police force under the name of the CIA, and this is 
15 what we are talking about, or the FBI, for that matter.
