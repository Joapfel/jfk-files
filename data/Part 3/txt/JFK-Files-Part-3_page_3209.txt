cases a bank will make available to us reco:r:ds wi tho·ut subpoena. 
When it comes time for utilizing that information we do issue 
a subpoena for the information. 
Senator Tower. Do you have·.legal authority to gain 
access to these reco~ds£ 
Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, we do. 
Senator Tower. Without a subpoena, without a court 
document? 
Mr. Adams. There is no law that I know of that forbids 
10 us access. There have been several court decisions, including 
11 some circuit courts that disagree with each other, but I think

13 of the bank and this does not violate any First Amendment or 
1.4 other Amendments in connection with it. 
15 Senator Tower. Do you make similar requests of S&Ls and 
16 other, and credit unions and other financial institutions?

22 information of the members, that meeting will take place in 
23 room 3110 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building .
