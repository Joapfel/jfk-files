Mr. Adams. No, sir, we do not. 
Senator Huddleston. What internal prec-aµtions do you 
~ - ~ . 
have against the Bureau itself misusing information that it 
.. 
gains from other agencies? 
Mr. Adams. Strong prohibitions. One, we don't allow 
access to files except on a need-to-know basis. Any employee 
of the FBI knows that if he improperly divulges information 
or leaks information out of the. ·files, he will be subj e.ct 
\ 
to administrative action. 
We had a case where_ an agent obtained an identification 
record-and made it out improperly, and I think that agent 
was separated from the roles. But we had asked for, and of 
course we share in CIA's request to-this extent, is that there 
be a criminal penalty attached to misuse of information and 
leaking it or making it a-vailable outside of an agen<?Y. .. 
... •. This is another issue before Congress. 
IRS [JFK Law ll(a)] 
Did this in fact happen to your knowledge_? 
Mr. Adams. I am not familiar with that case. I can.
