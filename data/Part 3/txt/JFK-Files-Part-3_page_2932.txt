Putting aside for one moment the counterespionage 
effort, and looking strictly at what we have ·been calling the 
Domestic Intelligence, is it your view that the retention of 
this function in the Bureau is critical to the Bureau's 
law enforcement position? 
Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that the Bureau does 
a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the backgroun 
of criminal investigatory activities and experiences which 
all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. It is hel -
ful not only in gathering knowledge and experience, it also 
enters into this field, a person with a broad understanding 
of the rights and privileges, and you don't have so much that 
spy type, that cloak and dagger, that very, very secret type 
of an operation. 
I subscribe to the present system heartily. 
Mr. Smothers. Would it be of assistance to your mission 
if within the Bureau guidelines were established that 
effectively limited access or controlled dissemination of 
the intelligence product? In other words, if we had a 
situation where the intelligence product is critical to assist 
the law enforcement effort, I do~•t think there's any question 
that there should be access to it. 
Isn't our problem one of controlling the use of that 
intelligence product and preventing the kind of murky crossing 
of lines there with the information legitimately needed for
