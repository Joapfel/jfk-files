T-lie .(foq:pefative spirit of our relationship with the Committee 
and· its .. ,Sta.ff ·w'µ$t at the same time take account of the rights of 
Agency employees. The Committee Staff has agreed to advise 
employees of their Constitutional rights at the beginning of any 
interview or other appearance. 
When a current Agency employee is selected to be interviewed 
by the Select Committee Staff. the Staff Director or Chief Counsel 
will normally notify Mr. John M. Clarke, who is my principal 
liaison with the Committee and its Staff. Mr. Clarke, in turn, will 
notify the employee. The purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the 
work of the Committee. It is intended to allow time for the employee 
to gain general legal guidance if he wants it. and to obtain security 
guidance from an appropriate senior officer. 
My own belief is that after a careful review of all U.S. intelli­
gence activities. the Committee will address needed legislative 
changes and will reaffirm their confidence in the importance and 
contribution of U.S. intelligence programs.
