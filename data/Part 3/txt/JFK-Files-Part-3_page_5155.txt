Memorandum outlines problem area with respect to o,.,::r•·•~. 
confidentiality of FBI sources which we have encountered in W'i 
the ~enate Select Committee (SSC) investigatio_n. 
• In their investigation of COINTELPRO, SSC has been 
given acc~ss to material from which we excised only informants 
and potential informants as defined in Manual of Instructions. 
When such material was requested for delivery, we have excised 
identities of all individuals to whom we have incurred an 
obligation to protect their identity and relationship with the 
FBI. SSC has objected to these more extensive excisions in 
delivered material, claiming the agreed-upon procedures do 
noftthallow us sucth latitude. This was not our understanding ,c(J

As a result of this impasse, on morning of 8/8/75 f~,., 
the Direc.tor and other FBI representatives met with the 
Attorney General (AG) and the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) 
in an attempt to resolve the question. The AG deferred a 
decis~on a_t that time pending the receipt of certain requested 
information concerning the general COINTELPRO operation. Later 
that date, Mr. John Elliff, SSC, contacted SAs William O. Cregar 
f
and Elmer W. Larson of the Senstudy Project, INTD, and stated 
the DAG had suggested he attempt .to get together with Bureau
