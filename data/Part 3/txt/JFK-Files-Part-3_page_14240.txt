Chairman Clifford expressed the view that there appeared to have been 
raised in this discu11sion a fundamental question to whtch the .Doard might 
well give its attent:lon -- i.e., the overall attitude of the U. S. Government 
toward ~ounterintell:!.gence, intell:f.gence and the security of intelligence 
matters. In this in_stance the Board had raised an important point ,in urging 
that the penetration cables not be cut precipitously when discovered in tl)e 
Embassy, but the Board's utg:!:~g ·~e.! ignol."~d~- !'~. Cliffuru t~·,.;:.!~~t it !lr'!'!''='"?!"!~t'? 
to determine just what for\JDl_does have cogn-izance in such important developments 
as this one, i. eo, whether_ the USIB, ·or the Special 5412 Group, or other group, 
has cognizance in these matters. Mr .. Coyna read from NSC 5618 the policy re­
quirE:ment that ':-POn tiH3 dis~ov~ry o'f lls{ening devices,· u. s .. agencies are 
required to obtain high level .d,etel;lllinations as to whether the devices should 
be left in place for purposes of exploi t·ation s.gainst the foreign intelligence 
service involved. \

Mr. Gray expre;ssed concern about the pdssibility that the Moecow p~netration 
enableq the Soviets to learn what the U~ s. was doing and about to do ~,,ith regard 
to Cuba in the Fall of 1962. 
In answer to the Chairman's inquiry, Mr. Coyne reported that U. s. secu~ity 
technician~ do not today 'have & device capable of detecting a shielded cable 
microphone imbedded 7 inche,s in the wall, as in the case of the 41 microphones 
found in the U. s. r.mbassy, Moscow. 
At 10:30 a.m. the Board ·meeting liias joined by Mr. Bannerman of CIA 
(Chairman of the· USI.B Security Committee); Dr.-_ Tordella, J?eputy Direc~or of NSA; 
and Mr~· Marvin Gentile, since March 196~, D_1,rector of the Offi::e of Security, 
u. s. ·Department of State. Mr. Clifford indicated the. Board's interest in being 
fully informed 011 the facts relat_irig· to 'the recent discovery of th~ penetration 
in Moscow; the effectiveness· of det~ction methods used at the Embassy p1·evioua ly 
and those available at p,:-esent'; and 'the info_rmat:ion which led to the recent 
discoveries. Mr. Brmnermari sai_d that he_ could speak to the asses!\ment of dam.age, 
leaving /to Mr. G-.?ntile the discuss:i.:ori of '·the history and effectiveness of tests 
to detect the presence of listening devices. 
Referring to the USIB Security Conmittee's June l "Preliminary Damage 
Assessment", Mr. Banne~n explained that Army, Navy and Air Force had conducted 
interviews of personnel formerly assigned ·to the Embassy (now scattered) but 
the inquiries were along .the line of possible compromise of military attache type 
of information, exclusive of the compromise of communications. On the other 
hand, State Depu:tment interviews of personnel previously assigned at the Embassy 
were made on th< • assumption t~at the Soviets had_ access to conversations and to 
I communications as vell. (Army, Navy and Air Forc.e are still in the process of 
I 
reviewing their old traffic· in ,m· effort to see wh-ether th~ir. communications 
were compromised~) Mr. Bannerman pointed to the State Department concluaion that 
1. no damage to u·. s. foreign policy can be detected as a result of the buggit.;g of 
our Emb~ssy in Moscow. Mr· .. Bannerman pointed to the conclusion in the· USIB 
assessment to the effect that.the Soviets did, get information on ·operations, 
and on military attache movements, and on. the intelligence targets in which they 
were interested. He pointed· out"that. th~ 'agencies rP.port that important dee is.ions 
were not discussed aloud, -bu:t in whispers, or in ,the .':orm of vritten notes.
