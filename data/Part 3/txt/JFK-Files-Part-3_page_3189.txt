For what purpose have ;they been kept and has the Bureau ever 
undertaken to destroy or prune down any of these records?. 
Mr. Adams. We have a number of records. We are 
a business-like. organization. w~~ record our activities .. ~And 
as the staff knows, they had access to a lot of reco~ded 
material that is the product of what the FBI has done over 
the years. 
When we conduct an investigation, we maintain the 
results. We do have dest~uction proce~ures where after the 
passage of certain time limits approved by the Archives 
authority, we are allowed to destroy certain files. Other 
information we are required to put on microfilm. There is 
a ~egular standard procedure for the destruction of FBI 
14 "files. This has been.suspended, of course, during the

initiation of these hearings and our files probably have 
incr~ased considerably during this period because we are not 
allowed to destroy anything since the Committee commenced 
its hearings. 
But we do have procedures for destroying these that 
are approved by the Archives, and a problem inherent in that 
is ma~ntaining information, what should w~ keep, what shoul~ 
we obtain during an investigation, what should we record? 
In the past we have been pretty consistent in recording 
. . 
everything ·we thought was relevant to the investigation. The 
passage of the Privacy Act put certain restrictions in. 1·7e
