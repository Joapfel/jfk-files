,,, It was potn-ted out to the Conference- that apparently the 
, .~ lhostil~t~ and _criti.<:ism._of the B~reau ste1TL not fr_om our normal ~ay to 
~) day criminal 1,nvest;1,gat-i ve work out to a very slight extent to inves­
, tigations in the In-ternal ~ecurity field and very specifically and 
-~~ jdefinitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations. It was felt that 
if some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuals 
,:) in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile 
t
or critical attitude 'toward the Bureau that much could be accomplished 
to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the pas.t. The Conference 
!felt it would be undesirable to prepare a 1 ist of any ?sort wh i, ch might 
lbe termed a "blacklist" to be distributed to all of'th.e divisional 
of Ji oes. It was proposed that the following pro cedu-r:,.e--be instituted 
immediately at the Seat of Government in order to meet the objectives 
,') ,. desi,red by the Director in connection with this matter: 
"""· 1. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing 
~ and ma in tai n ing in a current status a)-mt of. -those ..J:r-d.i.E. .. id_uaJ..§, known 
o be hostile to the A~,:.e.~. It ts /el~ that tt is i~perative that a 
list be prepared because the judgment of individual Supervisors re-
~ ·ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of 
their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of 
various and sundry periodicals. It would also mean that each 6upervisor 
would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a, 
faulty memory. J!'ur--thermore, an individual may at one time appear to b.e 
hostile to the Bureau and suoseq~ently his attitude may change and it 
may be very desirable to interview him. 4 n ~- • 0 n

Loyalty Section of ~he ~ecurity Division, the Applica~~ Section of the 
Investigative Division and those Su.per·visors in the AaiT[.i n. tstra-ti ve

than 25 Supervisors at most at the Seat of Government will have pos­
session of such a list. These .Supervisors shall check all references
