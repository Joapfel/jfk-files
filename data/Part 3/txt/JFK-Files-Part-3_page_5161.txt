Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75

• 
determine that such material is pertinent to its mandate 
• 
by making a written request for access to it. The criminal 
portions removed are attached to the tickler copies of this 
memorandum designated for Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher, 
as they relate to matters within their Divisions' purview. 
It has been our experience that the SSC generally does request 
to see or obtain mate~ial not furnished during responses to 
an initial request. Therefore, it would be prudent for 
representatives of, the General and.Special Investigative 
Divisions.to, at this time, review the material attached to 
Messrs. Clev~land and Gallagher's ticklers and make a 
determination as to whether any excisions must be made before 
review by the SSC Staff 4 should same be requested. Generally, 
under current ground rules, only material which would identify 
sensitive s0urces, including cooperative foreign agencies, 
or v·iolate the Third .Agency Rule, may be excised. Inquiries 
regarding current ground rules may be made by the Senstudy 
representatives of the General and Special Investigative 
Divisions of Supervisor J.P. Thomas, Room 4063 JEH, 
Extension 4636 .. 
ACTION: 
It is recommended that the material attached to 
the ticklers of Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher be reviewed 
as indicated above ~nd returned to Mr. Thomas with any 
necessary excisions underlined in red by 7/24/75.
