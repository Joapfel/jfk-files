furnished to the Committee. Banoff stated she believed these documents 
had previously been requested but she was unable to locate them in the 
Committee files. She said she· desired to have these documents

effort to prevent the Communist Party from infiltrating legitimate 
mass Qrganizations. As an aside, she stated she thought the FBI was 
successful in this effo.rt, indicating she felt the technique was worthy 
and proper.
