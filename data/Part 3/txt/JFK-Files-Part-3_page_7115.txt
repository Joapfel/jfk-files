Reference McDermott to Jenkins memorandum of 1-31-75 
recommending contact with Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) concerning the 
procedure for clearing staff personnel for captioned Committee. 
Contact was made with the Senator's office on the morning of 
2-6-75 to arrange an appointment. The Senator's secretary advised that his 
schedule was so crowded that it would be impossible for him to discuss this 
matter for several days. She said he requested that we discuss this situation with 
William Miller, who the Senator intends to have head the Select Committee staff. 
Miller was contacted on the morning of 2-6-75 by Inspector 
Bowers, accompanied by Inspector Hotis. It was explained to him that the FBI 
l 
has no authority to issue clearances as such but that in conference with Central 
Intelligence Agency officials it had been agreed that the FBI will investigate 
prospective staff personnel, furnish results of the investigation to Senator Church); . 
as the Select Committee Chairman, and CIA will issue actual clearances based fi· ·; 
on certification from Church. Miller agreed to this procedure. He was furnished { 
a small supply of SF 86, Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position forms. • 
It was pointed out to him these forms should be filled out in complete detail and 
furnished to us along with a current set of fingerprints. It was suggested the 
applicahts for these positi~ .}:)en-fingerprinted by the Capitol Police Depart:qe. nt.

l
soon as possible and after some discussion he agreed t~at a ,two week deadlin~ 
would be reasonable. It was suggested to him that in cases in~olving clerical­
type personnel that perhaps a longer deadline might be in order, and he said he 
would keep this in mind. I~ was pointed out to Miller that results of the investigations

representatives of various intelligence agencies currently are drawing up proposed 
guidelines to suggest to the Committee for use in determining whether or not an
