Elliff advised that the SSC is concerned with how the 
RSC plans to conduct its probe of the intelligence community. 
He anticipates RSC may hold hearings very shortly and possibly 
prior to the time the SSC gets underway. At the present time, 
Elliff knows of no agreement or plans to provide the RSC with copies 
of intelligence community documents the SSC has been furnished. 
Department of Justice ~o~ 
'-"-0 ~ ~ - .. • • According to Elliff, Kevin T. Maroney, Deputy Assistant 
hLL~ • Attorney General, Criminal Division, has agreed to allow Staff 
o~::S- Members of the SSC to review the Department's file on the 
C::_r;, g Intelligence Evaluation Committee (this was a Committee chaired 
•• 3 by the Department and evalv.ed from one of the recommendations set 
out.in the "H<~uston Plan." During its existence the Bureau had 
several representatives assigned to the IEC). 
Mr. Maroney has also advised the SSC Staff that in the 
1966-67 period the Department of Justice did an extensive study 
on the legal authority for the conductaf electronic surveillances. 
Elliff was quite pleased that the Justice Department planned to make 
this study available for review by Staff Members of the SSC in the 
Department's Building ·and expressed the hope that the Bureau would 
also see fit to allow Staff Members to review research and studies 
thet,Bureau might have conducted in the area of sensitive investi-
gative techniques. fltc.~q (o~ ,{ ( (c :,,9 _. -J... 7..J
