It is noted your office has penetrated the LCN 
11families
11 
in both San Jose and San Francisco through the 
qevelopment· of member informants. This is very noteworthy 
and you are encouraged to make certain that your member 
informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau . 
. Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE 
.-· coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection. 
SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau 
rile 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity. 
You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated 
July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four 
months subsequent to the receipt of that letter the informant 
should be closed. 
Although SF_ 2745-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-3456; 
·Bureau file 137-1117~} was rated good, his progress should 
be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member 
informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose· 
veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished 
by this source has been of a nature of past activities and 
little present information is being furnished by him. You 
should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent 
informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more 
producct:i ve :source.
