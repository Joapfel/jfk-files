• 
The intelligence/espionage threat posed by the 
Chicoms, particularly in view of the opening of the Ch~com 
Embassy in Canada during 2/71, is recognized. 
In line with the Inspector's suggestion, we will 
intensify our current efforts aimed at penetration of Chicom 
intelligence through development of methods and techniques 
similar to those utilized in the DESECO Program. We will 
extend this operation on a highly selective basis and will 
strive to come up with sources who will be in a position 
to disrupt or neutralize Chicom intelligence efforts directed 
against the U.S. 
The Inspector's suggestion will certainly be followed. 
In addition, with the strong probability the Chicoms will be 
admitted to the United Nations in the near future, DESECO's 
in the Chinese field will be most useful to target against 
Chicom officia:1s who lTill be assigned to the Chicom United 
Nations Mission and who will be employed in the· Secretariat.
