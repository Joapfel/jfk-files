How long have you been in 
the Bureau? 
Twenty-four years as of 
June 25, 1975. 
Where have you been assigned? 
In Boston, Baltimore, New 
York, Tampa, and San Diego. 
The Bureau has indicated that 
you were a coordinator of the 
COINTELPRO in San Diego. As 
such, what were your duties? 
The duties for the most part 
consisted of preparing letters 
to the Bureau asking for 
authority to take some specific 
action in the program; awaiting 
the reply from the Bureau; and 
then, if any action was taken, 
to advise the Bureau of the 
results of such action. It 
is noted that many of the re­
quests to take specific action 
were turned down by the Bureau. 
Were you the focal point of 
the program? 
Yes, in the sense that any 
idea for action to be taken 
in the program was trans-
mitted to the Bureau for 
approval by me and if approval 
was received, it would be re­
lated to whomever had suggested 
the activity. I would then 
report any results to the Bureau.
