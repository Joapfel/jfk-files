AMI.ASH Case. O~ficer., .;:This ,was. at.:;the meetin9 in October . ' ' '/••.. ' ·, , 
and not at the November meeting because that is correct, 
provided you put it in the right context. 
Mr. Johnston. Nhat about the statement, all the 11:1oney 
he wanted? 
AMLl\SH Case Officer. Inferred. I mean I·don't recall 
that money was ever discussed with this man at any time. In 
fact I was asked this question before and I couldn't really 
recollect:· when I had given him soma money. 
It turns out that the record shows that I did give him 
11 $350 for his expenses. nut money, specifically, again, that 
12 is somebody else interpreting. I don't know of any other 
1~ document or certainly any memorandum for the record that I 
14 prepared in which money specifically was mentioned.

Mr. Johnston. nut would you disagree with the statement 
AMLASII Case Officer. t·Tell, the statement as a whole, 
17 if you leave out the money, wh~ch aga;n, ~nything that he needs. 
18 Mr. Johnston. Nell, that's what we want to leave in, 
19 the money . 
20 N~LJ\SII Case Officer. If he need3 the money, I think it 
21 was not excluded in the offer. nut what I'm saying 
22 Mr. Johnston. This makes a positive statement, him 
23 saying that vou ancl Mr. Fitzgerald assured J\MLASII that the 
24 Agency would give him everything he needed, all the money he 
25 wanted.
