At the outset of the meeti~ today, it Jjecame clear p at 1S .·'w z, 
speaking for the members of the Senate Select Committee and for the staff, 
was opposed to the presence of agency representatives during interviews 
concerning matters which they described as "abuses." Schwarz explained 
that the Committee has a responsibility to look into allegations of misconduct 
~ or abuse in addition to a broader study of the jurisdiction and o:rer~~ions 
.,,.~/t~f) of the intellig~nce community. He said that while there would qe a willingness 
1/ on their part to have agency representatives present duri~ire:rv-:i:ews emic+ern­
ing general inquiries regarding jurisdiction, they felt t~at ff w.oq.ie ~~ . 
improper and would interfere with the integrity of their inv,~~'.i.o'lr':if975
