In a friendly conversation that followed 
for approximately ten to fifteen minutes, SA Ward 
advised Seidel that he had only been assigned the 
Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter for three 
months and had no knowledge that would be of value 
to Seidel. The Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter 
was not further discussed. The rest of the time was 
involved in discussing points of interest in the Los 
Angeles basin of tourist value, such as Marineland~ 
Palos Verdes, and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles. 
SA Ward advises that he is aware that the 
Director waived his employment agreement with certain 
exceptions regarding privileged areas. With this in 
mind, SA Ward reviewed his employment agreement and 
concluded, after noting the following quotation, that 
he could not disclose any information without following 
the prescribed procedure: 
"The burden is on me to determine, prior to 
disclosure, whether info1.--mation may be disclosed, and 
in this regard, I agree to request approval of the 
Director of the FBI in each such instance by presenting 
the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to 
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior 
to disclosure". 
With this in mind, SA Ward answered Mro 
Seidel as noted heretofore.
