CANIL PROGRAM 
Bufile: 65-70719 4-H 
2. Since inception of this program in June, 1966, 35 cases 
were opened. There are 7 cases pending. ~2~~-li~~J!,l~ 
have been uncovered to date. The procedures followed 
'in 'i:ni'.s' .. p'rogram'"cio n'ot'"" require the use of much personnel 
or many man hours by the New York Office. 
,3·. CANIL, is supervised in the Espionage Section, Special 
Cases Unit, ._EX,,,P!} AJZ,,wJ,~Q~™· 
4. The detection of Soviet illegals is one of the most 
difficult problems facing the Bureau in the security 
field. It is felt this p~ogra~ still has a good 
potential in uncovering illegals because-it is logical 
and pas a sound basis. Past experience has shown that 
Soviet intelligence will use the same modus operandi 
continuously, if successful·. 
5. This program was evaluated in February, 1971. Legat, 
Ottawa, has suggested discontinuance of this program 
and New York's comments have been requested by Bulet 8/5/71.
