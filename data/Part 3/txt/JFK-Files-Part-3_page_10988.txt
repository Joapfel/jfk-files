·on Hoover m·emorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference 
Archives , Franklin D . Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New Y ~rk, advised that 
The White House Ushers Appoilitment Book contained entries showing that 
on 'l'hursday, August 24, 1936, from 9: 20 a:.m. to 10: 12 a:.m., President 
Roosevelt met ·with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to

an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry 
on 8/25/36, other than the.President's departure for the Dakotas at 10: 40 p.m.
