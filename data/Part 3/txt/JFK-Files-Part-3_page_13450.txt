MR. BELIN: In your opinion, are they an effective 
oversight agency at the present time? 
MR. RUSX: Oh, I don't think they are effective, 
at least in my experience they have not been effective in the 
kind of oversight that is really needed. And I think the 
oversight should be given by those who are in positions 
established by our Constitution and statutes, the President, 
and the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense. 
MR. BELIN: Secretary Rusk, there have been recent 
allegations that- the CIA was in some way involved with Lee 
Harvey Oswald. There have been also allegations that perhaps 
the State Department did not send over to the Warren Commission 
all of its files concerning Oswald and particularly about his 
trips abroad. 
Do you have any comments concerning either of these 
allegations? 
MR. RUSK: Well I never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald 
until the assassination, and we went through what I thought 
was a very intensive and thorough examination of the question 
as to whether any foreign government might have been involved 
with Lee Harvey Oswald, because that could have been an issue 
of war and peace. 
Now, I personally was convinced that there was no 
indication that any foreign government was involved, and so 
testified to the Warren Commission, and my testimony is 
TOP SECRET
