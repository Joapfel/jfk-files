Page Two ]\~gust 14, 1975 
recently necessary to interview this Spmial Agent to 
determine the nature and extent of his ±involvement in and . 
knowledge of the alleged abuses at the ·I:i:i:me when he served 
as supervisory case agent with respect d:0 the King case. 
During the interview he did provide det:.a:i:led information 
concerning his substantial participation in this matter. 
The Committee in no way intenfu at this juncture 
to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI'sactivities with 
respect to Dr. King, and it would be im:ppropriate to 
characterize the conduct of any of the .fureau 1 s personnel 
regarding this case until all the facts are in. Neverthe­
less, I am concerned that in this kind -mt situation, the 
interests of the FBI and the Department 0f Justice might 
best be served, from the standpoint of 'cppearances, by re­
considering the assignment of this Spec•ial Agent to the 
King matters. It is possible that some may conclude that 
there is a conflict between the SpecialAgent 1 s personal 
interest, and the interests of the FBI md the Justice

Finally, let me assure you that the Committee 
has no evidence that the present arrang.enent has prevented 
the Committee from obtaining the full cr.isclosures sought; 
but it seems to me that it would be mutm.lly beneficial 
for appropriate steps to be taken so.that± we will both be 
able to assure the American people and me Congress that 
our oversight responsibilities were ful-Ii,lled in an objec­
tive and impartial way. 
I hope you will share my view that this course 
will best serve our respective interes1}and, of course, 
the interests of the country. ✓;_
