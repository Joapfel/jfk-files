✓ _•e e The allegations made by Dick Gregory and others connecting 
·me to the murder of President.·,John i(ennedy are- totally without foundati.._ 
Ttey constitute, a false and vicious libel .. 
These charges are bizarre .,. •. products of sick minds~ 
The Political Left has never been able or willing :r.o accept the fact 
that Kennedy's assass"in was a man of the Left; thus the Leftist .._, 
preoccupation with finding an alternate assassin~ 
Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and 
innuendo .qj_stomarily characterized as McCarthyism._ 
The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will 
probably examine Gregory 1 s charges - as indeed they should~ For my 
part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full 
airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have 
any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against 
my life already made by neurotics. 
I was not in Dallas,Texas, on November 22,1963; in fact I 
never visited Dallas until eight years later. I did not meet Frank 
Sturgis until 1972~ nine years after we were allegedly together in 
Dallas. I was not in Hexico in 1963, and I did not meet Lee Harvey 
Oswald there or at any other place or time. Moreover, I shared the 
nation's grief over the murder of our President. These are the facts. 
Until authoritative investigative bodies make kno'l.-m their 
judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I 
will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties 
who repeat the libel. I must take this course because the libels are 
prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my 
Appeal from the Watergate affair. And because the libels threaten my 
only means of livelihood, as a writer. But of even greater concern to 
me is that continued publicity given to these reckless 
charges could. stimulate some yet-unpublicized maniac into violent 
~~t.1nn against me and my family.
