Mr. Adams. That is true . 
Senator Schweiker. ·That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Tower. Mr. Adqms, what use does the Bureau present y 
make of its intelligence informants, and have they ever been 
used as provocateurs or as magnets for action? 
Mr. Adams. No, sir. 
Well, you asked two questions. 
Senator Tower. Yes. 
9 Mr. Adams. Let me-take,the last one first, provocateurs. 
~O Our policy has not -- _or our policy-has been to .discourage any 
11 activitie~:which in any---way-might involye an informant doing 
12 
13 
something that· an agent cannot do, which would be in the area 
of being-a provocateur, ·which basical.ly is entrapment. And 
14 we have had some allegations of entrapment come _up. We feel 
15 we have satisfactorily answered them. This is a very technical 
16 legal field which boils down, of course, to the fact that if a 
17- person·is willing to do something, and the government merely 
18 provides the opportunity, that is not legally entrapment. So 
19 if a person comes .ta._ us_ and says.I have been asked to participat 
20 in a breakin of a Federal building, I would like to help you, 
21 then the law basically would indicate we have the authority 
22 to continue to let him operate. 
23 The question comes up if he assumes the whole direction 
2~ and causes people to do something which they would not otherwise 
25 have done. That is the entrapment issue. So we are very alert
