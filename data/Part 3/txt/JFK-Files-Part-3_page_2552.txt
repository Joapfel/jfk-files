SUBJECT: Additional Requests, SSC (.Amplification of 
-lVJay7.4, and June 2T; Requests) • 
Transmitted herewith are three additional requests from the 
Senate Select Committee, two under date of July 8, and one dated 
June 30, which I received yesterday. 
The four-page, 21 item, statement of additional documenta­
tion requested :in one of the July 8, letters, and the· June 30, let­
ter raise a problem which perta:ins to "abuse" areas of the "notifi­
cation" letter of June 27. This issue is the subject of my previous 
memo to you, and the· considerations which are entailed, insofar as 
witness test:i.mony, should be, I think, observed here. 
The second July 8, request is simply for Manual pages to be 
made available. 
Please arrange for the preparation of appropriate documentary 
responses to the requests attached. In the event that there is a 
serious problem with response to any of the itemized requests, early 
advice to me of that fact would be appreciated, so that I can advise 
the Committee and attempt to resolve the problem. 
Please alert me to any third agency problems which may arise 
with. regard to any of these requests; :in a. cursory examination, no 
such problem was patent to me. However, I realize· that there may be 
latent third agency issues, and I will appreciate,...sour advice to this
