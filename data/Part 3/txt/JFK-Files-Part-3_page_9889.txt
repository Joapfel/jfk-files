This memorandum reports the results of a meeting 
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of 
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the 
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75. 
The study prepared for the President's Foreign 
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel­
ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select 
Committee (SSC). The major contributors to this report were 
the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and 
for that reason any requests from any committees of the 
Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the 
White House. At the present time, the consensus of those
