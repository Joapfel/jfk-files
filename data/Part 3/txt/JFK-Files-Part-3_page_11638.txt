By letter to all field offices dated 2/13/70, 
the field was advised that the violence-prone Weatherman 
group planned to go underground and to direct "strategic 
sabotage" at military and police installations. The field 
was instructed to~gorously investigate the Weatherman group 
and to advise appropriate local police agencies of Weatherman 
plans. By airtel to all ofrices aa~ed 3/l~/70, the ii~ld was -
advised of Weatherman plans for extreme violence. The field 
was instructed to locate and identify Weatherman communes 
and activists. Intensive investigation of Weatherman leaders 
was ordered. 
By airtel to Chicago dated 3/24/70, that office 
-was instructed to initiate investigations and interview all 
individuals arrested in Chicago during a Weatherman rampage 
• in October, 1969, where such investigations had not already 
been undertaken. More than 280 persons had been arrested, 
most of whom were either members of or closely associated 
with the Weatherman group. In connection with cases of 
bombing or arson which appeared to have New Left or black 
extremist connotations, SAC Letter 70-18 (C) 1 dated 4/7/70, 
captioned "New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism - Bombing· 
Matters" provided the field with gu-idance. In those cases 
where no Bureau substantive jurisdiction exists or where the 
Depa~tment has advised that no investigation is wa~ratited, 
the Bureau must be immediately advised concerning involvement 
of subversive groups or individuals suspected in the incident 
and recommendation made concerning atjditional investigation.
