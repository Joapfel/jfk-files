NW 38tiiOB. Docld:3 
• 
has been traditionally some acceptance of the fact that if 
the President wants to see and talk with the Director, he 
may do so, call him directly. 
2472 
It has been my practice in such an event to thereafter 
report to the Attorney General, whoever it might be, that I 
have been called over and I discussed and was told. And this 
·was revealed in full to them. 
Senator Baker. I suppose we could pass a statute that 
says the President has to go through the Attorney General, 
although I rather·suspect it would be a little presumptuous. 
But to go the next step, do you think it is necessary 
for the pursuit of effective oversight on the part of the 
Congress, to have some sort of document written, or at least 
some sort.of account of a Presidential order or an order of 
the Attorney General given to a Director of the FBI? 
Do you think that these things need to be.handled in 
a.more formal way? 
Mr. Kelley. Personally, it would be my practice in 
the event I receive such an order, to request that it be 
documented~ This is a protection as well as a clarification 
as to whether or not it should be placed as part of legislatio 
I frankly would like to reserve that for some more considera­
tion. 
I don't know whether it would be, but I think that it 
can be worked very easily.
