On December 22 ~ 1975, the FBI received a copy of a letter dated 
December 18, 1975~ which Senators r/1.ondale and Bnker sent to the Attorney

responses be provided the ·ssc during the la.st we~.k or December, 1975, 
and the first week of January., 1976 ... 
Item 2 contained a request for any information refuting- -the 
suggestion made on page 34 of the General Accountmg Office ts September 24 
report to the House Judiciary Committee, that cases in which violence ~ 
be predicted probably represent le$s than hvo percent of all FBI domestic 
intelligence investigations .. 
Pn.ge 34 of the September 24 ~ 1975 ~ report of the -Comptroller

Rights concerning FBI domestic intelligence operations contains the following 
statement: "There were only 12 instances--or less than 2 percent--in which
