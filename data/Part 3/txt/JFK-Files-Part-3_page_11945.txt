During the Summer of 1970 a counterintelligence 
program aimed at creating dissension was instituted by our 
San Juan Office against the activist Puerto Rican Socialist 
League (LSP). On October 10, 1970, a high-placed Miami 
security informant reported the LSP was showing signs of 
grinding to a halt and that it recently experienced a severe 
split away from its youth group. Our counterintelligence 
move was directly responsible for the havoc occurring in the 
LSP. 
As a result of disclosures made by+Jennifer Enid

On October 10, 1970, Fi}-.~:P .. <;;:i:-.J;2=Q~.19,P~~, a known 
Cuban espionage agent and a Bureau fugitive, was apprehended 
by FBI agents and the Police of Puerto Rico. ,,Oj.,e,.da.,,. leader of 
the Puerto Rican Armed Revolutionary Independence Movement (MIRA), 
had been the prime mover behind the wave of violence and 
terrorist bombings which has occurred for many months in Puerto 
Rico. Documents found at his hideout definitely confirmed the 
close collaboration between the Cuban Government and Puerto 
Rican terrorist groups. 
On October 19, 1970, an intensification program was 
instituted by our Miami Office based on instructions from the 
Bureau aimed at identifying CuIS agents in the Miami area who are 
believed to be tipping off Castro concerning infiltration 
efforts by anti-Castro refugees in the U.S. A coordinator had 
been made responsible for directing these efforts and progress 
has been made in eliminating certain suspects as well as 
developing valuable background regarding other logical suspects.
