The Klan a~d • ~veath~rma~ ·examples. again il~ustrate the 
point. Once it has been established that a particular Klan· 
group is engaged in or planning violence, it seems reasonable 
to conduct at least preliminary i:qquir~.es to determine whether 
'· 
the members af¢i- supporters of the group are invoived in the 
.. 
violence -or the plans for violence. Similarly, the search for 
W~at.herman fugitives who committ~d bombings· and other· acts of 
violenc~ wou1a· appear reasonably to include preliminary 
. . 
.inquiries to determine whether other Weatherm~n members and 
supporters have harbored the fugitives~ 
& 
On the other hand, it would seem unreasonable to 
inv-estigate mer.ibers and supporters of all Klan groups across 
the co,mtry. • on_ the ground that some I<lan groups have used • 
violence.. Apd it appe§lrs equally unreasonable to investigate 
all-members and supporters of SDS because the Weatherman 
factibn engaged in violence. The scope of the investigation 
must be logically related to its specific purpose, an·d not an 
excuse for wide-ranging collection of intelligence. 
There is one possible exception to the requirement that 
the FBI -only conduct n'!gular criminal investigations. • The 
Attorney General (and the President) do require reports on
