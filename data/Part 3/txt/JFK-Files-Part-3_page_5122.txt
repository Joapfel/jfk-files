At the request of the Senate Select Committee 
(SSC), we recently furnished to it superseded material dated 
back to 1960 and relating to various sections of the Manual 
of Instructions, including Section 87. In furnishing this 
material, we did not furnish the various cover sheets 
relating to the many revisions since 1960. 
We have received a telephonic request from 
~ 
Miss Martha Talley of the SSC Staff for additional infor­
mation which would help her to better understand the various '~ 
'J'~;, revisionsto Section 87. She also specifically desired a ., 
copy of page 1 of that Section as it existed on 1/1/60. ~ 
We have secured the various cover sheets for the ;'\~ 
many revisions, as well as a copy of page 1 which bears \· ( 1 ' 
the revision date of 8/13/56 and which, according to J/ 1'\,.~ 
Mrs. Alene T. Smith of the Training Division, was the page ;i .t- 1\ 
in force as of 1/1/60. ··--·)c-\ 
In order to comply-with the request of Miss Talley, • ~~ 
it is not believed necessary to obtain from the SSC a ]' \ 
formal, written request; neither is it believed necessary \~~~ 
to transmit the requested material by formal correspondence ~~ \,,_ 
to the :S'SC through the Attorney General. I ,~·ur· .. · ~ _\
