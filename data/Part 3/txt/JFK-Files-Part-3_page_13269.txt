SUBJECT: Review of Personal Papers of·Mr. Dulles 
I r~viewed the personal papers of Mr. Dulles cov~ring 
the period after his departure from the_Agency and while he 
was a member of the Warren Commission. I also reviewed Agency 
his~orical documents relating to Cuba. The·review did not 
' ' 
tur~ up anything of special significance or importance. For 
the most part, Mr. Dulles' _papers included corresponderice 
dealing with his book, personal contacts, and social activities. . ·. 
I have attached copies of all.material in his papers that in 
any way dealt with the Kennedy assas$ination or the work of 
the Warren Commission. I have also attached relevant 
individual items culled from his daily diary.
