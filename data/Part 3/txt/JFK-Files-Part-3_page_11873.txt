SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
RE: AUTOMATION OF INTELLIGENCE DATA 
RE NEW LEFT AND EXTREMIST INDIVIDUALS 
~ECTION CHIEFS MOORE and SHACKELForuiV.J As indicated elsewhere 
under Automatic Data 
Processing (ADP), 5-Q, automatic data banks are utilized 
extensively by the Extremist Intelligence and New Left Sections 
in connection with the Computerized Telephone Number File 
(CTNF). CTNF lists telephone numbers known to be utilized by 
black, New Left anq other e-thnic extremist groups and ind iv idunls. 
Telephone numbers included in CTNF are listed according to 
geographic areas. In addition, a special project utllizing ADP 
is being operated in connection with the EASTCON case. In this 
EASTCON project, ADP analyses of telephone calls between EASTCON 
subjects are made and also new subjects are identified through 
~np ?.~2lyses cf EASTCON tall ~~lls. 
At present, over 12,700 individuals making up the 
Security Index (SI) have been incorporated into the Bureau's 
computerized·data bank and this data is available to all offices 
through ADP. In connection with this ADP, SI project-, identifying 
data concerning each subject, as well as his residence and 
business addresses, are included therein along with other pertinent 
'items sucn as his organizational affiliation. Over 20 separate 
print-outs are prepared monthly for administrative and investi­
gative use of the Domestic Intelligence Division and the field. 
The facilities of NCIC have also been utilized to 
aid our investigations of New·Left and extremist individuals. 
"Stop Index" programs for Bureau use only at NCIC have been 
devised which furnish notice of any police inqu,iry concerning 
missing Venceremos Brigade subjects and all Priority I, SI 
subjects who are ext~emists,unless they are already included in 
the NCIC Wanted Persons File. • 
As indicated, much effort has been made to avail our-
·selves of opportunities provided by ADP. The Inspector's 
suggestion that further effort be made to expand our use of ADP 
facilities, tak~ng into consideration the need and benefit for 
such automation, appears to have merit; this will be studied and 
appropriate recommendatioµs made as to its adaptability.
