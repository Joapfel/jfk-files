This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of 
the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordin~ting Group on 
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community, (hereafter 
referred to as the Group), held at CIA.Headquarters on the even­
ing of 3/20/75. 
This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as 
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In attendance were 
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Deputy AG Laurence , 
Silberman; Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; Mr. John J 
Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, as well as officials from {~ 
Defense, Treasury and the Energy R.esearch and Development -· \_,. 
Administration (formerly the Atomic Energy Commission). 
The meeting was called to have all agencies identify 
- (1) Types of information that could not be disclosed to Con­
gressional Committees, (2) Types of information the disclosure 
of which was arguable, and (3) Types of information that could 
be disclosed to Congressional Committees. The FBI was asked to 
lead off the presentation. ~he Group was informed that we were 
reluctant to discuss sensitive matters in such a large group 
,and we asked that the Group be reduced to a select few people 
who would have to have knowledge of sensitive FBI operations. 
After some discussion, the White House agreed this was a good 
procedure and it now appears that Mr. Buchen of the White House, 
one of his associates and probably Mr. Silberman will arrange 
at some future date to discuss the sensitive type information 
embraced in the above three questions. No definite date was 
set for this review and presumably either Mr. Clarke's office 
or.Mr. Silberman will be tn contact with the Bureau regat/·1·1lff
