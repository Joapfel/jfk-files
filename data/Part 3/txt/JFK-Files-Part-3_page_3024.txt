QUESTION: 
MR. ADAMS: 
.... You do use informants and do instruct them to 
spread dissention among certain groups that they are 
informing on, do you not? 
We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were 
discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one 
of the best examples of a situation where the law was 
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights 
used much more than we hear t~day. We saw with the 
Little Rock situation the President of the United States 
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use 
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement 
use the troops. only as a·last resort. When you have a 
situation like this where you do try to preserve the 
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical 
problems. 
With the Klan coming along, we had situations where 
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless 
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some 
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents 
mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the 
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action 
was taken with that ipformation as he pointed out during 
his testimony. Our files show that this information was 
reported to the police departments in every instance. 
We also know that in certain instances the infor­
mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We 
also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead
