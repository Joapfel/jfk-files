You understand that this is an informal interview 
and is in connection ·Nith the Bureau's COIN""'I'ELPRO

this survey?

FBI and other Government agencies will have more 
definite guidelines to follow. 
I•believe the Congress already through lack of 
information; isolated instances. and some hysteria 
have enacted too many restrictive lm·1s that prevent 
the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting 
the lai:•1 abiding element of our society from the 
"bad guys". 
(He ,;•ms in general agreement) Did you handle the 
COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971? 
Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function locally 
about Nover:iber or December, 1970. As I recall my 
function ,,ms to ,,✓rite a progress type letter regarding 
progress which described the illegal activities of 
members of the BPP and to report that this information 
had been furnished local police aGencies but infor□ation 
generally emanated from confidential informants.
