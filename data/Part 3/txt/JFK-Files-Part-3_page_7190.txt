.. ., 
the United States Government. has entrusted its classified 
information. Some of these persons are members in American 
intelligence and counteri~telligence organizations. 1 • 
It must also prevent leakage of sensitive 
United States information from foreign services to whom 
American secrets are necessarily confided as a matter of 
common concer~ but which in turn have been penetrated by 
enemy agents. 
The value of what might be called an anticipatory 
defense is not always evident because when it succeeds, 
nothing happens. It is like preventive medicine. Its 
value becomes dramatically clear only when it fails. 
The second value of counterintelligence is that 
it provides information about hostile clandestine intentions 
and capabilities. This information is the more valuable if 
our adversaries do not know that we have it. 
Fla&lly, the third value-of counterintelligence is 
the large amount of straight intelligence obtained as a by­
product by counterintelligence agents in the normal course 
of their business. 
1some specific and subsequently publicized examples of 
'Soviet success in the recruitment of American officials, in 
most cases exposed and frustrated by the FBI, are: Nelson 
Drummond (1962), Jack Dunlap (1963), William Whelan (1963), 
Robert Johnson (1965), Herbert Boeckenhaupt (1966), and 
Ulysis Harris (1967) •. 
2There may be cited here some of the completed counter­
intelligenpe cases which resulted in the identification and 
suppression of high-level Soviet penetrations of Western 
intelligence services and which were directly attributable 
to.CIA counterintelligence work: George Blake (UK - 1961), 
Heinz Felfe (West Germany - 1961), Harold Adrian Russell 
("Kim") Philby (UK - 1963), George Paques (France - 1964), 
Giorgio Rinaldi Ghislieri (Italy, Spain - 1967), Yuriy 
Loginov (South Africa - 1967), Nahit Imr~ (Turkey - 1968), 
and Francis Roussilhe (France - 1969). ,,.
