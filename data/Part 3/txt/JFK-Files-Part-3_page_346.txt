They featured."cartoons 11 showing the "pigs 11 (police) 
being killed, stabbed, et cetera. I believe I recall 
seeing some 11cartoons 11 showing hmv the BPP ,-muld kill 
the :1honkies 0 ( white people). They ,vere similar to 
the propaganda leaflets used by the Nazis against 
American troops before an attack. The articles in the 
BPP ne,vspaper ·were even more foul. 
Did the COINTELPRO promote dissension between the BPP 
and the US Group ( see Appendix page) ? . 
Not to my kt1m•1ledge. As I recall there was never 
any need to. They were constantly at odds with each 
other and on a gang type basis 1·1ere trying to eliminate 
each other. I believe Sylvester Bell, a SQn Diego BPP 
member ,vas killed by an US Group member and John Savage, 
another local BPP member was killed by an US Group 
member. 
In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not 
recalled, ,-1ere allegedly killed by US Group members. 
I believe this led to the popular saying in Southeast 
San Die80 section 1·1here most blacks live that the score 
(game) was, nus 4 - BPP 011 • 
What do you think of the merits of a proposal to 
spray shipments of the -BPP ne,vspapcr 1·Jith a noxious 
acid so that readers would be confronted ·with a vile 
odor when attempting to read the paper?
