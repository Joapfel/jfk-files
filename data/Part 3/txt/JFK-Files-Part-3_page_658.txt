SA Petersen: 
Do you recall an anonymous letter 
being sent to the Catholic Church 
to have the pr:iest of the church 
where the BPP breakfast program 
was operated removed from his 
office? 
I do not recall such an anonymous 
letter; however, I do recall that 
the priest was transferred by 
the church. 
Knowing that the BPP paper was 
a paper that taught and advocated 
violence and had cartoons in it 
that encouraged the killing of 
police officers by blacks and 
was a violence oriented paper, 
how would you feel about putting 
a corrosive liquid on the paper 
to keep it from being distributed? 
I would not do it as I would feel 
that it was a violation of the law 
and too drastic. I would not do 
it personally or personally approve 
of it. 
You have been very helpful and 
the information you have provided 
will be used in considering new 
legislation at some time in the 
future. 
In these tranquil times, it disturbs 
me greatly to read in the papers 
and to hear news broadcasts con­
taining all kinds of allegations 
against the FBI and the CIA and
