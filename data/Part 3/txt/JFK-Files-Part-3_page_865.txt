IV. VALUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES 
A. Foreign . . -'\ 
Electronic surveillances provide positive intelligence 
regarding the positions and activities of foreign nations, and 
thus are of value to United States Government policymakers and 
diplomats, and also provide information of· assistance in our 
counterintelligence efforts· against foreign intelligence 
.services operating against the United States. 
1.. Positive Intelligence 
Examples of positive intelligence obtained via 
electronic surveillances, not directly related to our counter­
intelligence responsibility, are as .follows: 
At 7:40 p.m. on August 20, 1968, the New York Office 5tus1;ivt 
called Headquarters to inform that our wiretap on the Soviet ~~ft,,~"~t 
Jli,~iqn to the..,_J:1ni ted Natiqns was in~ercepting <;-n inordina t~. ~~~,q,1'"1"AI 
amount of traffic, approximately 40 intercepts in the prececting 
30 minutes. The Soviets were calling representatives of many 
of the delegations to the United Nations stating they had a 
message which they desired to deliver urgently, and would meet 
the representatives anywhere, even on a street corner. 
The Headquarters duty supervisor thought this activity 
might relate to a recently completed full plenum of the Supreme 
Soviet on the Czechoslovakian question, reported on the UPI 
ticker. He relayed th:is information to Mr. Hoover, the White 
House Situation Room, and the State Department.
