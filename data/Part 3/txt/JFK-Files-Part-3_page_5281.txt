DISCUSSIONS ON IMAGERY ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES 
Iterit-:~'.2.(Pg. 00234) 
Current personnel are unable to verify or 
disclaim contact with CIA regarding this photographic technique. 
In all likelihood, this contact was made in 
conjunction with our continuing technical liaison with other Federal 
agencies. 
This consultation was entirely proper and made 
to augment the Bureau's capabilities in this area. No deleterious 
effect can be seen as a result of exposure of this information.
