·entirely wrong, both with respe~t to the activity 
and the coordination and control, and I wish to 
attempt to c:hange this image.· (NOTE: Hundrc·ds 
o·f editorials, and dozens o! speeches oi:: th~ Hill 
have dealt with this thesis in one form or another, 
and there has been no rebuttal at any time to my 
knowledge). 
No authorization was given by me for the ~ricfing of press 
or other columnists (other than Alsop and Murphy) or for attribution 
or for s1;atements or references to ClA's unique capabi~ities in Soviet 
economy or the purpose of l .. ie releases. 
What has h_appened is that tb~J-/:wo stated purposes 11rnerged 11 
a:1d journalists, including TIME, NEWS\l/EEK, HERALD TRIBUNE, 
Charles Bartlett and Mr. Dale of the NEW.YORK TIM~S were bri'e fed 
during late December and early Jam\;f:<y. 
I 
In the case of Charles Bartlett and Mr. Dale, permission Wi\S 
given to attribute the information to CIA by DJ?/1 and PR and app.:i.:rently 
• additional information on the depth of CIA' s work in studying Soviet 
economy was. discussed. 
As a result the CIA role, th,e .':\ttributio_n and the fact that it 
had finally "spoken out" was 6£ far greater significance than. the facts. 
When the NEVf YORK TIMES featured this side of the sfory 1n a front~page 
article, there was a clamour £or like information for othc rs and, as a I 
~esult,· ~lA inv_ited inquiring press m~n· to 1c~me down and receive icientica 
1nformat10n which was then prepared 1n a written 1nemor andum. The 
memorandum .was discu>ssed with them and thi.s was interpreted to be a .' 
11 forrnal press conference'' which is only p~rtially true. /. 
In defense of DDI and PR 1 s acti,-~t.ies, it is to be noted that CIA. 
has £or lQ years issued unclas·sified publicaL-:)ns on the Soviet economy 
·and the method·usad in analyzing it. •. Mr .. Allen Dulle3 used this subject 
as a favor:ite topic f~r his speeches, which were numerous - 'ii{ fact, 
Mr. Elder, my assistant, states he h:is written at leasl 12. speeches on 
this subject for Mr. Dulles. Howuver the. timing and manner of release 
-~as given npecial notice by the press in this instance. 1
