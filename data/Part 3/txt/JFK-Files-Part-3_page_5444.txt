Memorandum to Mr. w. o. Cregar 
Re: Senstudy 75 
• 
Item 6. Three Special Agents, Neil Rice, Larry . 
Mc-Williams, and John Mccaffrey, attended this Soviet Operations 
course at CIA Headquarters. The course ran from May 14 to 
May 25, 1973. Special Agent Mccaffrey only attended one week 
while Rice and McWilliams attended for two weeks. 
The primary reason for FBI inclusion in this course 
was because, at that time, the three Special Agents were 
members of the new Training Unit, INTD, and we were seeking 
educational guidance and ideas for our basic CI courses then 
under development. We benefited from this course because we 
borrowed a few educational ideas and techniques from CIA's 
method of handling its course. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
None. For information.
