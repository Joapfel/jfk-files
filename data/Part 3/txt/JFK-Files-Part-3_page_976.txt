enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a 
scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em­
barrassment to the Department. Tbe attached memorandum was 
prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal 
Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. It represents a careful 
review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is 
pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results 
were not recorded. luso, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro 
actions, results in many areas are not subject to measurement. For 
example, tl1ere is no way of determining llow many individuals left the
