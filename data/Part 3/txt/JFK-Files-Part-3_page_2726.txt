But why would that vary, why would a warrant requirement 
raise a serious constitutional question? 
Mr. Adams. We.11, for one thing it's the practicahili ty 
of ii:. or .·the • .. i:mpacticabili'ty ··of' getting a warrant :which: 
ordinarily involves probable·cause to:-show that a crime has 
been or is about to be committed. 
I~ the intelligence field we are not dealing necessarily, 
with. an imminent criminal action. We're· dealing with activitie 
9 such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have 
10 discussed before, where they say pub_licly we I re not. to engage 
11 'in a-ny violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still 
12 
13 
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time 
is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United 
14 States. 
15 Well, now, you can't show probable cause if· they're about 
:1 
16 to do it because they're telling you they're nol going to do it 
17 ~rnd you know they I re not going to do it at this particu~ar 
18 moment. 
19 It's just·the mixture somewhat of trying to mix in a 
20 criminal procedure with an intelLigence gathering function, and 
21 we can't find any practical way of doing it. \·le have a particul:a. 
22 6rganization. We may have an informant that not only belongs 
23 to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organizatio 
24 and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist 
25 Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.
