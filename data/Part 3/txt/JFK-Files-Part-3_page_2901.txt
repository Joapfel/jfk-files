--crime, investigations of conspiracies to commit crime rather 
than to leave this very difficul~ to define and control area 
of political ideas? 
Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last 
statement of involving the area of political ideas. I·say that 
I feel that certainly we should be vested and should continue 
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory 
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based 
on statutes in the so-called security field, national. or 
foreign. 
These are criminal violations. I feel that they should 
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this 
atmosphere, that you have more ears and eyes and you have 
more personnel working together, covering the same fields .. 
I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligencE 
matters, because it is a concomitant.- It naturally flows 
from the investigation of the security matters and the 
criminal. 
Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what·Mr. Stone·said was· 
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned 
with political or other .. opinions of individuals. It is 
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws 
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond 
these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of 
justice and human liberty.
