even on the Executive level. The Executive orders are numbered, 
whereas the directives usually are not. From information 
available it appears that Presidential directives and Executive 
orders carry equal weight. They take on the force of law if 
acknowledged by resolution of Congress and are published in the 
Federal Register. All this leads up to a very significant 
document which over the years has provided substantial investi­
gative authority to the FBI. It is commonly known as Executive 
Order 10450, although it has been revised and will be known as 
Executive Order 11605 if it is ever implemented. Executive 
Order 10450 is captioned as "Security Requirements for Government 
Employment" and, as the name implies, is related to employment 
by the Government of individuals who might constitute a national 
security risk. _This Executive order grew out of Executive 
Order 9835, dated March 21, 1947, which provided for an 
investigative procedure affecting persons entering competitive 
civil service. The order established a Loyalty Review Board 
and procedures for handling of cases where loyalty of an 
employee was ~uestioned. Executive Order 9835 followed the 
establishment of the President's temporary commission on loyalty 
under Executive Order 9086, dated November 25, 1946. Executive 
Order 10450, dated April 27, 1953, superseded and revoked 
Executive Order 9835. 
The important thing about these two Executive orders is 
that the At to :tney General was required to furnish the Loy al ty 
Review Board current information concerning the subversive nature 
of foreign or domestic organizations, including totalitarian 
groups. Thus, the FBI, acting under 1 awful authority of the 
Attorney General, was bound to conduct the necessary investiga­
tions t6 enable the Attorney General to fulfill his responsibility 
to the Loyalty Review Board. Executive Order 10450, in revoking 
Executive Order 9835, also disbanded the Loyalty Review Board 
and provided that the Attorney General would furnish the same 
information regarding subversive organizations to the head of 
each department and agency. The Attorney General was also 
requested to render to the heads· of· departments and agencies 
such advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and 
maintain an appropriate employee-security program. 
Under Executive Orders 9835 and 10450, the 
Attorney General had the responsibility to designate 
o~ganizations as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive, 
or as having adopted apolicy of advocating or approving th0 
commission of acts of force or violence to deriy others their 
rights under the Constitution of the United States, or.as seeking 
to alter the form of government of the United States by uncon­
stitutional means. Under provisions of Executive Order 11605,
