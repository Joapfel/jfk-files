Ml:•. Gentile informed the Board that the Embas ay i11. Mos ~O'W wad first 
designed and built as an apartment house. Then in 1952 it was made. available. 
to the U. S. for lease and occupancy as ·an Embassy building and apartment 
living .quarters. The U. s.- accepted the building,· and in 1952 the Soviets 
adci'e<l three t~p floors for use a& Embassy offices. Dtrcing the construction 
period ,no U. S. technical inap~ctions were possible be~ause accesEJ to the 
con~struct,ion "1ork was limited to cursory inspections. For a: ·period ·of 3 weeks 
in March 1953 no Americans were given access to_ the bullding, and the con­
struction area on the top three floors was _covered by ply..ood screens said to 
have been (put up to hasten the d:ryirig of plaster. The u·. S. ·occupied .the 
Embassy on May ·1, 1953, under the lease. Since that time there h.irve, bec!n 2} 
irispections in an effort to locate listening devices. Plaster was chipp~~ in 
spots, floors were taken up ill some locat.ions, an_d various searches tM.da short 
of te1ring rocms apart -- all ·.: :thout l9cating any devices. Meanwhile, over 
the years Embauiy personnel have been briefed ~md cautioned on the assurnpt ion, 
. ' . . . . . • 
that the Emb.assy was penetratr::d by_ listening devices. 
On June 20, 1962, Mr. Gentile continued, his predecessors in the State 
( I>epartment_ · Of £ice of Security r.eceived from CIA. the Soviet defector's 1962 
report that the Empassy was bugged. This was made known to the State Department 
\ re.sid'ent security technician who ~H~nt to .Moscow 3 months iater. There ia nothing 
! in the files to indicate if.any in~tructions went out or ~ny action taken on 
1 the bas is of the 19 6 2 defector report. _There. is no ind ir~a t ion that the 
' Amba-13 sad or was. inf_onne<l. 
In February 19 64 the State Department -:.-ecddent security t e chn ic ian in 
the Moscow Embassy returned to Washington and· t_here was J is ct.is sed che q ue at ion 
of the possible total destruction of an Embassy room in lln effori to fiud 
1 is tening devices.· In March 1'964 th_e State. Dep artmen_t Security peep le rec>? 1.ved 
the report given by ·the second Soviet defector; pinpointiug locations of c,rn­
cealed micropho:ies. Accordingly·, the destruction 'of one room was auth.orized 
by the Depattment of State Security Office (Room 10008 on the cop {loor) and 
on April 23, 1964, t~~ firat of the 41 micr6phones wa~ uncovered. 
Ht. Coyne asked about the cutting of the cables. Kr. Gentile said that 
this o::curred two days after the discovery of the fif.!._t__o_microphone on April 23. 
The decision was made in the Security_ Office of State~;:._by. the chi_.ef technician 
in Moscow. Mt:. Clifford asked whether it•had occurred to responpiblc officialri 
to consider the possibility of exploiting th~ ~icrophones fourid. Hr. Geritile 
said that in the first place it was· assumed tha_t the Soviets had spotted the 
technical men who wer& sent in by State Department, and _that the noise of the 
jackhammer and other digging operations had alerted the Soviets that the dis­
coveries had been madeo Moreover, the microphon~s disc.overed were not con-
• t3idered unique finds requiring any unique technicnl etudy. Moreover, as part 
of otanding op~rations proc1!d1.1re, State notified the CIA and other interested 
agencies immediately on ms.king the ffrst find, although this notification was 
not m.ade at the Secrets1-y level. It was decided that exploitation was not 
fea.s ib le. 
C 
l'he decision to cut t:he cab lea, r howe.1,er, .. was made_ by State Department, 
Mr. Gentile said. In answer to Mr. Murphy's question.he sllid that State 
Department desk. officers ··and the Ambassadors .were told, but their Judgments 
were not sought as to tbe matter 'of cutting the ·cables. •
