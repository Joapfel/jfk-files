I. FOUNDING 
The Black Panther Party I with head­
quarters in Oakland, California, was 
founded in 1966 by two Oakland Negroes 
- Huey Percy Newton and Bobby George 
Seale - both at that time at Merritt Col­
lege in Oakland. The name and symbol 
of the new party were taken from the 
Lowndes County Freedom Organization, 
an Alabama political party known infor­
mally in 1965 as the Black Panther Party.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY 
From the writings of communists, 
revolutionaries, and black militants, 
Newton and Seale allegedly selected 
ideas around which they could build a 
revolutionary frame that suited the needs

of their party. Influential writings in-
cluded those of Mao Tse-tung, Chinese Communist 
leader; Frantz Fanon , West Indian psychiatrist who 
advocated violence for Algerian nationalists; 
Ernesto "Che" Guevara, one-time lieutenant of 
Cuba's Fidel Castro and a principal architect of 20th 
century guerrilla warfare; Malcolm X, American black 
nationalist who advocated violence to obtain Negro 
0 freedom"; and W. E. B. DuBois, Negro educator who 
became a member of the Communist Party, USA, at 
the age of 93. 
The organization was at first called the Black 
Panther Party for Self-Defense; however, the "Self­
Defense" was removed in 1968 in an effort to project 
a more politically oriented image to prospective 
sympathizers and supporters.

BOBBY GEORGE SEALE· 
As head of the new Black Panther Party, Newton assumed the title Minister of 
Defense, and Seale was named Chairman. When questioned about the membership 
of their organization, Newton and Seale gave the since oft-repeated reply: "Those 
who know don't say. Those who say don't know." The militancy of the group, 
however, had an immediate appeal to the discontented, restless youth of Oakland's 
ghettos.
