Those files marked with an asterisk indicate that only token amounts 
had been paid under SAC authority ranging from $25 to less than $100. 
This analysis would indicate SAC s are abdicating authority to 
approve paying sources the full amount allowed before seeking Bureau per­
mission to pay on a regular basis. 
In the following 17 instances the Bureau approved the field's com­
munication seeking approval of an individual as a PSi in which i:he same com-· 
munication also asked approval to pay the source on a regular basis: 
134-10532 
134-8857

In the following 19 cases the Bureau approved sources being paid on 
a regular basis within 45 days of their being approved as a PSI: 
134-6201

These 36 cases (17 + 19) represent 45% of those files reviewed and 
indicate the field's undesirable practice of asking approval .to pay sources on 
a regular basis upon obtaining approval to develop tn.e source as a PSI. It 
does not appear that contacts with these individuals are over a sufficient 
period of time to conclude the source is furnishing data on a regular basis 
to justify paying him on a regular basis.
