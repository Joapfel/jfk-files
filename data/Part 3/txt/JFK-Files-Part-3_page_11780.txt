Pursuant to your request, there foilows a tabulation 
of -·the • case load by Unit and by Section as of 7 /31/71 and as 
of 8/20/710 Total case load for the Division decreased from 
2~,565 to 25,417--a decrease of 4,148 cases. Some small 
part of this decrease can be attributed to normal month by 
month fluctuation in case load; most of it is.attributable 
·to.the changed procedures concerning case count as will be 
. readily~evident by the significant decreases in case loads 
·in those Units handling principally informant cases, Klan· 
cases, and organizational-type cases. Th~s reduction in case 
load resulting from the changed case count procedures, of course, 
in no way decreases the work load on.the individual desks. It 
is· believed the current proc~dures for cou~ting cases is more 
~ aricurate and equitable and places the case load figures in 
perspective insofar as these figures are a·factor iri judging 
'.overall work load; -.:. . . .

In the overall, it is directly related to our manpower problems 
and I have included a more-detailed write-up bearing on this 
new system in its relationship to the Division's overall 
capacity and capability to fulfill its responsibilities in the 
!'Adequacy of Personnel" write-up {6-E) which also bears on the 
matter. • . .. ::. ••
