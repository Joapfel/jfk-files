In January, 1960, CIA agreed to comply lith 
conditions imposed by·the Bureau with regard to developing 
positive intelligence information through contacts between 
U. s. residents and visitors from Iron Curtain countries. 
CXA agrood to contact us first before promoting such 
associations. In March, 1960, CIA inquired if it might obtain 
Bureau clearance at the field level for such contacts in the 
intorcst of expodiQncy. Mr. Tolson noted: 11More and more we 
are agreeing to CIA operations in the U. s. I am opposed 
to this relaxation. We can exercise better control here than 
through our field offices." The Director added: "I share 
·Tolson's viewso" CIA was advised clearance was to be obtained 
through Bureau headquarters. , . 
fi\natolf~ a Soviet, defected.in Finland 
in December, 196i7, and furnished information alleging 
penetration of~rican intelligence. One Serge Karlow, a . 
. CIA officer, was developed as a suspect. On 2/9/62, we took 
~ over the investigation. On 2/26/62t Sheffield Edwards, then 
CIA Director of Security, admitted CIA had had technical 
coverage on Karlow from February, 1961 to 2/9/62. Edwards·· 
claimed hi3 r~l~cta~ce t0 t~ll us Df thts situation earlier 
because of obvious possible jeopardy to prosecution, plus 
embarrassment to his Agency should the Bureau raise an 
objection to CIA's maintaining such coverage. The Director 
.noted: ux only wish we would eventually realize CIA can 
never be depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly 
my skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion but on 
specific instances all too many in number. Yet there exists 
. ·wistful belief that rthe leopard has changed his spots'." 
In April, 1962, we received information on a 
strictly confidential basis from Jay Sourwine of the Senate 
Internal Security Subcommittee to the effect that an • 
unidentified CIA represep.tative had talked to Senator Eastland 
concerning an alleged move to place QIA in charge of· all 
intelligence-gathering operations for the Government -- to 
include Soviet espionage in the Uo S. The Director noted: 
"I am not surprised at the above alleged effort. There is no 
doubt in many quarters a desire to eliminate the FBI in 
. .dealing with espionage and subversion for we are a thorn not 
•• ••• only in the side of communists but also the ADA and Fabian 
Socialists. CIA which failed again and again to, know what 
·is actually going on abroad could be counted upon to b~under
