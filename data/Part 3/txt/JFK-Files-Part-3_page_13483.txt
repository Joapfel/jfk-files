During the Eisenhower Administration did you ever hear any 
discussion of what was known as an Executive Action Capability 
which might be defined as a capability to assassinate foreign 
political leaders? 
Have you ever heard that expression? 
MR. GRAY: I don't remember ever hearing that expressi n 
until we talked this morning. I mean, I don't remember while 
I was in government hearing this expression. 
I 
MR. BELIN: You never heard the phrase until I asked 
you the first question in our interview this morning, is that 
correct? 
MR. GRAY: That.is correct . 
MR. BELIN: While you were working with President 
Eisenhower, did you ever hear any discussion of any operational 
plan to try and assassinate any foreign leaders, and specificall 
Castro or Trujillo? 
MR. GRAY: I would like if I may, Mr. Chairman, to not 
answer that yes or no because it is a complicated questionc I 
would suppose if one were serving in government, and he would 
put the national security interests ahead of most everythin9 
else, he would not fail to think about assassination if this 
22 were a vital necessity to the national security. I think you 
23 would consider anything·, . and I have no doubt that at various 
24 times and at all levels, without the knowledge of any President, 
25 people have talked about assassination. But I know of no plan,
