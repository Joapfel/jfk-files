AMI.ASH.Case Of~icer. We? 
Mr. Wallach.· You have told us --
AMIJ\Sil Case Officer.· We were very reluctant to discuss 
the subject. 
Mr. Wallach. Why? 
AMIJ\SH Case Office. I guess we didn't want to get 
in assassinations. 
Mr. Wallach. But you had them before this. 
AMLASII Case Officer. I didn~t know this, and certainly 
in ~his operation the objective of this operation was not to 
go in and assassinate Castro but a much bigger type of program. 
Mr. Wallach. But that was the first step, or at least 
the potential first step. 
AMIJ\SH Case Officer, He was convinced that was the only 
first step. J\MLASII, Ne weren't convinced· thaf it had to be, 
at that t!me 'that it had to be the first step, and that's why 
we didn't want to discuss and we didn't discuss and we were 
reluctant to discuss this subject with him. 
Mr, Wallach. At the late October meeting I think you 
said before that -- what did you request that led to the giving 
him of the pen, the hypodermic needle? 
24 A.~LJ\SH Case Officer. The pen he requested was something 
25 with which to protect himself now.
