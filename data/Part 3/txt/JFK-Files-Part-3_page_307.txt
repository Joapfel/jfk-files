U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT 
ROBERTS. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
Staff Member Seidel identified himself to Mr. 
Baker, stating that the interview would be in the form of 
an informal discussion and that information furnished by 
Mr. Baker would be placed in a memorandum for the SSC. 
Mr. Seidel stated that he did not intend to use the names 
of individuals interviewed in his memorandum. He stated 
that Mr. Baker did not have to talk to him, and that any 
information he furnished would be furnished voluntarily. 
Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker was a supervisor 
with the San Diego Office of the FBI from sometime in 1968 
through April, 1971. 
Mr. Baker advised that he was a supervisor of the 
security squad but could not recall if the dates mentioned 
by Mr. Seidel were correct. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to the nature of matters 
supervised by him, to which Mr. Baker replied that matters 
such as investigation of the Communist Party (see appendix), 
the Socialist Workers Party (see appendix), the Black Panther 
Party, US, Incorporated (see appendix), the Nation of Islam 
(see appendix), Espionage, Sabotage matters, and other investi­
gations were conducted on the squad supervised by him, which 
consisted of from 12 to 15 Special Agents. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker 
supervised the COINTELPRO. 
Mr. Baker advised that he did supervise this pro­
gram which was initiated by FBI Headquarters and not on the 
field office level. He stated that as he recalled, a letter 
was submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. 
The letter was submitted by a Special Agent whose case load 
was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Special Agent 
Roy Burns was more of a young, eager, type Agent.
