The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that 
the Bureau has 1:ieen requested to again make avaiJ,able -,......._,./1~~ 
Newa-rk office secretaries., Mary Ann :Massa and M. Ann f.N lf:l,;,,, •'.: - -
Mierzejewski for interview by cc:i.ptioned Committee--and that • ~ ~­
the Department and White House had instructed that they not 
be made available until such time as the Committee decides 
to allow Bureau representatives to be present during inter-
view. 
By way of background, you will recall that these 
employees were released from the Employment Agreement and 
were made available for interview on May 20, 1975, by 
captioned Committee. However, the Department in objection 
stated that they were desirous that a Bureau representative 
be present during the interview. The topic of the interview 
was to have been their dupies and responsibilities during 
the period of July to September, 1964, in connection with the 
Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
Ultimately, neither the Department nor the White House could 
reach agreement concerning the interviews and the employees 
did not submit to interview. 
On June 3, 1975, Michael Epstein, staff member 
of captioned Committee again requested these employees be 
made available for interview on June 5, 1975, at 10:00 a.m. 
The scope of the interview would be the responpibilities and 
duties performed during the period of July to September, 1964, 
in connection with the Democratic National Convention in 
Atlantic City, New Jersey. it'u·\'v,~ / -/ /' j o/ -fl3 17
