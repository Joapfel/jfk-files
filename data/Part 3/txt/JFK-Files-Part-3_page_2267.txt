Programs , Sources and Techniques 
GAO enumerated the programs , investigative aids, sources, 
and the techniques utilized in FBI investigations . For the most part, 
these elicited no abnormal interest, but it was apparent the Committee will . 
follow this subject in GA0 1s final report and in the event any FB~ offici?.J:~-~e-,.: :_.,,-;;;,_:;,,' 
:mvited to testify, they will be subject to intensive questioning-on COilITELPRO, •• ; ":: 
surreptitious entry, and mail openings . • • 
. Regarding sources, Dr~an critically r~fer~ed to "the Ar.my of 
l 
inforniantsrr and wanted numbers and payment figures which GAO could not 
supply. Drinan also expressed interest in CounteriI>;telligence (Espionage) 
Matters which GAO declined to discuss and stated it was not a part of their 
mandate to review those matters.

He indicated there apparently had been 'no· prior need in the FBI for the 
modern management accounting system, but that one was now under development. 
GAO witnesses followed the prepared text with respect to Depart­
mental guidance, Attorney General I s guidelines, dissemination of information, 
file maintenance and destruction, the Rockefeller Commission's recommendation 
for the development of an analytical capability for domestic intelligence matters.

In the opinion of the writer, the t&ne of questions and statements 
of Messrs. Drinan and Badillo were very critical of the FBI, and on occasion 
that of Mr. Dodd' s. These Congressmen repeatedly attempted to put words 
in the Comptroller General's mouth and to twist his statements to their own 
liking. Basically, Mr. Staats and the GAO witnesses stuck to their prepared 
statement and their amplification was in basic support of this statement.
