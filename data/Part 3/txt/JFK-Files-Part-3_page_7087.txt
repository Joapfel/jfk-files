Select Committee to Study Governmental 
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities

Dear Bill: 
Following up on our brief discussion Tuesday on the clearances of 
Committee Staff, I thought it might be helpful to outline a procedure 
which you may cons"ider reasonable to use. • 
As I understand your current ground rµles, you are submitting your 
staff applicants to the FBI for full field security investigation and on report 
from the Bureau, under the authority of Senate Resolution 21, the Chairman 
and/ or the Committee will take action to grant or deny clearance. 
The next step requires a notification tb the Director of Central 
Intelligence of the Chairman's decision and certification of the clearances 
granted. I've _attached a sug"gested format for this which you could use. 
On receipt of the certification we will advise the USIB security elements 
of the people so certified. 
I also promised to go over with you the range of compartmented 
clearances that exist and I am prepared to do that when we next get 
together. You will recall these are the clearances for which you will 
want to determine the "need-to-know" for selected members of your 
staff. We need to establish agreed procedures here as well. Ac.cess to 
this information requires that an individual meet security standards set 
forth in DCID 1/14, a copy of which is attached.
