indicating that the killing of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, 
was actually an outgrowth. of any planning, conspiracy, or activity of the 
anti-Castro Cubans? 
STURGIS: No, sir, I don't. 
OLSEN: Or any other portion of the Cuban community? 
STIJRGIS: No, sir, I don't have any facts on that. 
OLSEN: It's just kind of your suspicion, like that -- or 
speculation? 
STURGIS: Yes, sir; th.ere is that possibility.

STURGIS: Yes, sir. (interrupting) 
OLSEN: -- that they could have been involved? 
STURGIS-: Yes, sir. That they could have been involved because that 
--they need motive, motivation; and that was the motivation-- that would be 
the motivation. 
OLSEN: Do you have any personal knowledge, or have you ever heard of 
any contacts between the anti-Castro Cuban element any place in the United 
States and Lee Harvey Oswald? 
STURGIS: No, sir.
