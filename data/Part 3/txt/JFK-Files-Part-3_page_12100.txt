It is believed the desired routing could be 
effected by adding a characterization, such as White Hate 
Group (abbreviated WHG), to the caption of correspondence 
concerning informants who are reporting on the activities 
of such·groups. Under existing procedure communications 
concerning racial informants reporting on white hate groups 
are submitted under a caption such as: CO 1234-R. Under 
the suggested procedure the communication would be captioned: 
CO 1234-R 
(WHG). 
Comments of Section Chiefs Gray and Moore and 
Assistant Director Brennan are requested.
