• 
Mr. Chairman, the Intelligence Community has not been idle 
since the development of the U-2, and the improvements that 
have been.made have added a new dimension to the importance 
of intelligence today--its contribution to the maintenance 
of peace in the world. 
As I believe is well known, the breakthrough in the Strategic 
Arms Limitations negotiations followed the development of our 
ability to monitor whether or not the other side is complying 
with the agreements made. To do so with respect to closed and 
suspicious societies, intelligence has had to invest hundreds 
of millions of dollars and heavy doses of imagination and 
technical genius. 
We have not yet convinced all the nations that might 
pose a threat to us that our system of openness is the best 
for them as well as for us, so we must depend _upon our intel­
ligence to give us the means with which to negotiate with 
them and, at least, to limit, if not eliminate, the risks we 
both run in today's world. 
The peace-keeping role of intelligence goes beyond strategic 
' 
arms. There are a number of~situations in which our knowledge 
#' #- .,,,--: ·--t.., '>• 
of some local situation._ around the world was better than that 
of the participants. By ~ringing this knowledge to both sides, 
or to the one about to make a mistaken military move, intel­
ligence has several times assisted in defusing a potential 
,.
