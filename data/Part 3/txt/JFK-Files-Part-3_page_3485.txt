'lie understood I was the Special Agent in Charge of the Birmingham Office 
at the time the bus was burned with the Freedom Riders in Birmingham, 
Alabama, in 1961. He stated that he would like to know if Rowe had fur­
nished us information that the Birmingham Police were going to wait 15 
or 30 minutes to go to the bus station in order to give the Klan an oppor-
tunity to work over the Freedom Riders. I informed Reeves that I recal~e\ll)._...... 
no such information being furnished to us at that time. I told him that afyv 
information we received concerning possible violence was furnished to ,the 
Birmingham Police Department. He wanted to know, if there had been such 
l 
an agreement what action would I take. I told him that if I determined that 
the police departme.,nt ;would not take any action for 15 or 30 minutes I would 
advise the Mayor _Miar1f ~ity and tn~. Police Commissioner and if they felt the

He wanted to know what wo&lat1fthe FBI' s position at that time ·!} 
if the police department refused to take any action. I told him that we did 
not have jurisdiction in matters of this nature, that they were purely local 
and it was the responsibility of the local authorities to handle such matters. 
He desired to know if I would call out the Federal Marshals. I informed him 
that the FBI did not have any authority to call upon the Federal Marshals in 
a situation of this nature but if such a situation arose, I would have imme­
diately notified our headquarters in Washington, who would-nave n~~I 
Department of Justice, who would have such authority. .., :•l
