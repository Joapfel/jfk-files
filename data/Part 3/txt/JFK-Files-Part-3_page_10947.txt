At present we are making active efforts to develop live 
informant coverage in the diplomatic establishments t>f 37 non­
Soviet bloc countries. This list of so-called "target countries" 
varies fro~ _time to time but essentially we are seeking informant 
coverage in countries considered critical from an intelligence 
standpoint such as those leaning towards the Soviet bloc or 
countries in which the United States has paramount political or 
military interests or which·are otherwise of primary concern. The 
current list includes virtually all Latin-American countries~ a 
number of Middle East ·countries, and scattered countries throughout 
Africa and·the Far East. 
Our program was initiated in the early 1950s, and we • 
·are now using some 50 sources -(This number fluctuates due to 
.transfers, resignations, etc.) .. In each case, we clear with 
State Department prio:i;- to designating any country as a "target" 
and we also clear with State prior to conducting interviews with 
employees at the "target" establishment. In a number of. instances, 
including most Latin-American countries, State has asked us to 
restrict our efforts to American citizens. This, of course, is 
a ~highly limiting factor. 
OvAr the vears this live informant coverage bas on many 
occasions produced foreign intelligence of rEal.. valUeo Our sources 
have frequently provided data regarding proposed political, 
diplomatic or economic action by the countries concerned, on 
occasion in advance of other forewarning to U.S. intelligence. 
They have also been able to furnish a considerable amount of 
information regarding the whereabouts, background and general 
activities of individual foreign officials of security interest, 
thereby saving investigative time. These SQYrces have been 
especially valuable in connection with the ~agram Program and 
other sophisticated attacks on foreign establishments, providing 
us with data regarding the pµysical security, location of code 
rooms, ··etc. , of the various foreign establishments. 
In addition to so-called "targettt countries which are 
in the non~Soviet bloc area, the Bureau has developed a number of 
• informants and defectors-in-place in Soviet-bloc establishments
