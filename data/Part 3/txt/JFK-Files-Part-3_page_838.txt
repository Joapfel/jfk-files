4. Options for Future Policy: 
The missions of law enforcement, internal security, 
and counterintelligence are separate, distinct and distinguishab~e 
functions, even though each partakes a little of each other .. 
Law enforcement is investigation after a crime has been _committed 
to identify suspects and build a case for prosecution; counter­
intelligence is the identificatibn, penetration and neutralizatio~ 
of foreign intelligence activity in the U.S.; and internal 
security is identification arid thwarting of home-grown plots 
to subvert the government and activities within the U.S. in 
illegal support of foreign causes, whether by u. S. citizens 
of foreigners. 
The missions overlap to some degree. For example, 
law enforcemen~ requires some intelligence collection, and is 
intimately concerned with internal security criminal acts, e.g., 
foreign related te~rorist bombings, skyjackings, gunning, and 
subversive groups' kidnappings; bank robberies, bombings, etc. 
Counterintelligence sometimes results in criminal prosecution, 
and some internal security groups are funded by, and act on 
behalf of, foreign intelligence services.· Internal security is

motivated, are being committed in violation of the U, S. 
criminal law. Yet, the investigation may be a continuing effo:::t, 
basid on·conti~uing acts threatening the internal security 
without actually violating the criminal law, and thus the investi­
gation is.more like a counterintelligence investigation, than 
like the typical law enforcement closed cycle of crime, investigat.i 
and prosecution. 
While counterintelligence •could adequately, and 
wit~more success in some cases, be handled by a~ organization 
totally separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal 
security work, in m~ny cases, is directly r~lated to criminal 
prosecution. There has been little effort, and less success, 
in most English speaking Western democracies in prosecuting 
domestic II subversives, 11 even those wi·th foreign ties; ho,·1ever, 
prosecution is often a principal, if not primary, objective in 
cases involving ernigre bombing and harassment of foreign 
diplomatic establishments, fund and arms procurement for 
foreign political groups, polit,ically motivated te·: rorist 
acts, e.g., skyjacking, etc.
