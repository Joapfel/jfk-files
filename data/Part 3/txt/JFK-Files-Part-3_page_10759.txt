Dear Mro Hoover: /'

(. ·-PERSO!ML AND CONFIDENTIAL l 
Thank you very much for your letter of July 17, 1964.9.-- .. ~ 
I have- been giving this racial problem constant tho.ught. Paren- • 
thetically, I did what I could yesterday in New York to get;,that 
office moving faster and more effectively in this matte:v"¾-t./7'. r/ ...,-/'-'

You asked for suggestions and this is what I now offer 
you for whatever little value it has.

After writing you I recom.~ended to the 
Inspection Division that a study pe made 
relative to whether or not the Domestic 
Intelligence Division can better handle 
certain aspects of the Civil Rights-Racial 
problem. Mr. Gale is very much in favor 
of this inquiry and is moving promptly in 
this matter. I think the results of his 
inquiry will be most helpful in evaluating 
the situation. 
"'bn What 1 have in mind basically is this: 
You may want to, in light of.his inquiry, 
consider transferring the ?esponsibility 
.fo1" the development of informants ·in the 
Klu Klux Klan White Citizens Council and 
related t'ha. te" organizations to the Di vision 
while leaving the responsibility for 
investigating bombings, killings, and so 
forth where it now is. My idea. is: This 
Division can bring to bear all the techniques,/ _______ _ 
skills, and procedures which it has uset:V ··.~- , 
to successfully penetrate the Communist Party ., 
and espionage organizations to now penetrate 
these hate organizations causing us so much 
trouble. (In talKing to Mr. Tolson this 
morning I mentioned this briefly to himo) 
lf 
(3)/my idea is operationally sound, and if this 
is done, I would immediately hold some 
:regional conferences in areas where the 
:rD:cial issue is acute and get under i.vay in 
these •.:>ffices,. s;;>~ci~l .,and ag~ressive . \ i'~\
