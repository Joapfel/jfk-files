Senator Hart of Michigan·. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:3 . 
Iahve several questions, and I'm sure they'll be 
covered by others, but the ones that I have is a result of 
reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and 
it relates to your comment at the foot of page 10 and at the 
top of 11. 
There you are indicating that you caution us about 
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigation 
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplate 
for the courts under the Constutution. 
Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national 
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussjons 
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court 
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to 
penetrate and report on some group. 
And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen, 
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasive 
type of an eavesdropping devic·e. It is a human device. It I s 
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy 
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He 
can ask me questions to get information the government would 
like to have. 
Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the 
wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters
