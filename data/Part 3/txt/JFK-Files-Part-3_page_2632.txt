in many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have.been 
necessary to have addressed the original threat. 
How do we keep within the proper balance there? 
Mr.·Kelley. Well, .actually, it's just about like any 
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's 
right and it is by an officer and an FBI agent is an officer. 
There's the· possibility of criminal prosecution against him. 
This is one which I t.'1ink might flow if he counsels-
the informant. 
Now insofar as his inability to control the informant, • 
I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is 
still supervisory control over that agent and over that 
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuin 
basis. 
Senator Huddleston. It brings up an interesting point 
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be 
very alert to any law violations of its own members or anyone 
else. 
If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do 
something unlawful, the ques·cion seems to me to occur as to 
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported 
by the FBI. 
Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to 
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper 
authority.
