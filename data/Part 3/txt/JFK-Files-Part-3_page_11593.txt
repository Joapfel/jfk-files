New Left Movement reports submitted quarterly by 
each field office have enabled us to furnish interested 
agencies timely and informative documents on the activities 
of the New Left movemento This is a substantial contribution 
to the objective that responsible Government officials 
be alerted concerning the nature and extent of this aspect 
of subversive activities and the threat it presents to our 
democratic society. • 
By conducting an intensive review of many New Left 
publications which range from the pornographic to·:ttie clearly 
revolutionary, we have determined the leadership of these 
publications; their subversive activities and whether or not 
they urge violence; and sources of funds. Since these 
publications are the voice of the New Left and are influencial 
in recruiting youth, pertin·ent factors concerning them are 
disseminated to interested officials and agencies. Since 
our review of these "underground" publications has revealed 
many of them frequently come into being and become defunct 
within a short time, we are alert to the birth of new publications 
by perusing various underground news service lists as well 
as other documents and books which report new publications in 
this fieldo 
A library of research material on the New Left is 
maintained for use of Bureau officials in connection with 
approved speaking engagements before Government officials and 
responsible citizens. In this manner, we have assisted these 
Government,officials and responsible citizens to more fully 
·understand the subversive and anarchist manifestations of the 
New Left movement. 
Through the key activist program, we have focused 
investigative attention on the lead~rs of the New Left movement 
with the aim of prosecuting these leaders under appropriate 
statutes, Federal or local, wherever possible. This program 
has proved successful in that we have been able-to closely 
follow the activities of these individuals and furnish interested 
age·ncj_es and high Government officials wi.th information concerning 
their ~ubversive and agitational activities. Of particular note 
is the fact that more than half of the 73 individuals designated 
as key activists are subjects of some type of prosecutive action.
