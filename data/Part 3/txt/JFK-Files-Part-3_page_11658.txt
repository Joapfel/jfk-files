EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM 
Bufile: 105-42300 4-H 
·This program originated in 1955 in an attempt to 
provide internal security safeguards regarding'the admission 
of Soviet and satellite nationals. Soviet intelligence regards 
the visits of East-West Exchange Agreement participants as 
opportunities to promote intelligence activity. 
As a result of the 1970 Inspection revisions were 
made in the investigative action taken in this field. The 
change was made as a rES.Ilt of other manpower commitments. 
SAC Letter 70-25 provided that no investigations will be 
conducted of.groups or individuals participating in the East­
West Exchange Program in t·he absence of any information 
indicating affiliation with Soviet intelligence. Bufiles 
are checked on all Soviet participants and where information 
is developed showing intelligence affiliation, cases are then 
opened and the field instructed to conduct necessary investiga­
tion. 
During the period of January-June, 1971, 982 
individuals were scheduled to enter the U. s. under the provisions 
of this exch~nge program and of this number, we had information 
indicating Soviet intelligence affiliation on 25 of these 
individuals. -
With regard to Soviet exchange students there are 
currently'32 in the U. S. Based on information furnished by 
defector sources and investigations of Soviet students previously 
in the U.S., we have determined that Soviet intelligence 
utilizes these students in an intelligence capacity, principally 
as spotters. In view of this, we afford these students active 
investigation. We have also found that a number of these students 
return to the U. s. for assignment at one of the Soviet establish­
ments and in most instances, contacts which they made while· in 
the U.S. as students are generally reactivated. The case of 
Yuriy A~e~~andro~~-G.,9§tipt~~Y- is an example of an individual
