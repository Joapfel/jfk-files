Gebhardt was asked if he.felt the Cointelpro was a 
separate entity distinguished from the basic·investigation 
and it was e~plained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the 
overall investigation in any particular organizatio~ or 
individual. 
Gebhardt was asked it he felt Congress should enact 
legislation which would set forth specific investigative 
techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or 
other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in· 
Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,

It was pointed out that both the Director of the 
FBI and "the Attorney Genersi-1 are nominated by the President,

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting. 
Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with 
this statement of Mr. Kelley. 
. Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were 
relative to what the relationship should be·between the FBI 
and Congress. He was informed that a Sehate Oversight
