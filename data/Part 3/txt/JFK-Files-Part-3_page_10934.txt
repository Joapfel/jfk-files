\ In April, 1963, we received information indicating 
that CIA Director John McCone was considering expansion of 
CIA operations in the United States -- specifically intelligence 
coverage and the development of sources in thia oountryo Tho 
Director made a note on the memorandum recording this: "McCone 
is trying to do another 'Donovan.~ If he injects himself into 
the U. s., the FBI gets outo Too many cooks spoil the brotn9H 
In December, 1963, the Director inquired as to the 
nature and extent of intelligence operations wherein CIA had 
established contact with a diplomat, operated him ±n the U. s. 
with our coordination, and continued to operate him upon his 
having departed this country. Four such cases were cited. On 
the memorandum, the Director noted: "I have little confldence 
in CIA abiding by agreements if it serves its purpose better 
not to ·cto so." • 
In January, 1964, CIA advised us it had reorganized 
..its activities in the Uo S. The Domestic Operations Division, 
·c1A, had established field offices in this country under 
. appropriate cover. A memorandum was prepared describing the 
hisi;ory o.l CIA ope:catious ii1 the u e -S. an-d ::-s;::o~-r.~nc.ing 2.~t:!.0~ 
designed to protect our interests. A letter went to CIA with 
ground rules which the Bureau expected CIA to follow in all 
matters requiring coordination. The Director noted: "OK, but 
I hope you are not being taken in. I can't forget CIA 
withholding the French espionage activities in the u. s. nor 
the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only 
to mention two of their instances of double dealing." 
The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64·, -set forth 
its observations concerning a briefing given that office on the 
matter of CIA opera~ions in the U. s. The Director commented: 
"I think this domestic ouerations expansion of CIA is very 
• ... dangerous and will inevitably 'muddy' the waterso" • 
In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsidered its stand 
with respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreign 
establishments in the United States for intelligence purposes. 
The following. policy _was proposed and subsequently approved:
