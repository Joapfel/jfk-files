· •• General Lansdale thought that another attempt should· be I 
made against the major target which had been the subject of 
three unsuccessful missions and he said that six new missions 
were in the planning stage. 
Mr. Johnson said tl1at the "massive activity
11
·would have 
to come from within, and he hoped to be able to present soon 
to the Group a plan for giving Cuban exiles more of a free hand, 
fully realizing that this will give additional visibility to 
their activities. Mr. McCone reserved judgment on the feasi­
bility and desirability of such a program, and Mr.·Johnson 
agreed that he had reservations as well. 
Mr. McCone said that he had received the impression 
that although high levels of our Government wanted increased 
activity, they: still want to keep it at a low noise level, 
but Mr. McCone did not believe this would be possible and he 
felt that any sabotage would be blamed on the United States. 
Mr. McCone cited the enormous number of telephone calls 
directed at CIA at 'the time the skin divers landed in east 
Cuba, and the time that the Cuban exile students shot up the 
apartment house. Mr. McCone therefore urged that responsible 
officials be prepared to accept a higher noise level if they 
want to get on with operations. 
The Attorney. General, in partial rebuttal, ·said that the 
reasons people had such concern were (a) the fact that the skin 
divers were Americans, and (b) the fact that the student activity 
was irresponsible and foolish -- and if either of these had • 
in fact been engineered by the United States it would have 
been a great mistake. The Attorney General also related the 
possibility of attributability to the importance of the 
particular undertaking, and· he· questioned whether we are going 
down the right road or whether more "direct action" were not 
indicated. He urged that alternative and imaginative plans 
be developed. 
Mr. McCone said that internal restrictions are so rigid 
that internal -uprisings would surely be brutally suppVessed. 
(It was agreed that the current guidelines did not call for 
inciting such an uprising.) . 
Mr. McCone and General Carter explained the tremendous 
efforts necessary to insure that operations such as the sabotage 
operation previously authorized cannot be pinned dire~tly on 
the United States. (After discussion, the Group agreed that 
it was not necessary to go to such extreme lengths to insure
