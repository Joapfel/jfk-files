A diligent, extensive; exhaustive search was 
conducted in an effort to obtain a copy of the minutes 
of the Executive Conference held on October 1, 1958. 
However, this search discl~§ed no memorandum reflecting 
an Executive Conference being held on October 1, 1958. 
Executive Con~erence memoranda for the year 1958 were 
reviewed. This review did not disclose any memorandum 
which related to discussions about the Ku Klux. Klan.
