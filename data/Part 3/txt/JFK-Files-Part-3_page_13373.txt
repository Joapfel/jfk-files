STIJRGIS: I don't remember at this time because I was under so much 
pressure at that time because of the trial, because of all the publicity 
that was coming out, and because if my name was connected with anything 
especially--you know, l had to keep quiet, l could not cotm.ter of 
this publicity. r felt at that time--from what l know today-, that the 
same people that we worked for were in turn trying to give us a bad re­
putation, trying to smear us- in order to protect themselves- from what 
I see what happened up to today from what I know. So, naturally I could 
not counter, and I was deadly afraid to talk with any newspaper people. 
And here Seymour tt.ersh crune out with certain articles which I don't recall 
what they were today, making statements about: at least one I can remember was 
the Chilean Embassy supposedly that CIA had something to do with the break-in 
and that I was the person who broke into the Chilean Embassy in Washinton, 
D.C. And I confronterl_--I called Seymour H~rsh after I spoke with Andrew 
St George late at night and told him "Who gave you this information? Why-
did you go ahead and print all these things? r don't know anything about 
what's in this outline that this man Andrew St. George wrote, and so forth. 
Who gave you this? Where did you get it at? He tells me you stole this 
outline. ft is not my outline because it is not me telling Andrew St. George 
all this bullshit that's in there. How could you print these things? Why 
didn't you call me and talk with me personally to confirm or deny some of 
these things that supposedly is outlined. And you're saying directly that 
I said this." 
OLSEN: Well, did Seymour Hersh then tell you where he got the 
information?
