Colonel Nasser, and the opinions ranged everywhere from assassin -
tion on the one hand, suggested by somebody, to .the other extrem, 
and that was- that we get in bed with Nasser because he was 
' 
considered to be the wave of the future . 
Well, when the paper got written, there was no mention 
of assassination and no consideration even given to it. In fact 
the paper came down about the middle of this thing, which was 
where it should have come .. But I am saying that that is why I 
' 
wanted.to.not say yes or no. I have heard the word assassinatio. 
lO mentioned, but I know of no plan or op9rational capability that 
ll has ever been authorized at any high level of-government.

MR. ~ELIN: You are saying you might have heard on 
occasion one person discuss it, but that w~s never in any way 
adopted as a policy, to the best of your knowledge, during the 
Eisenhower administration? 
HR. GRAY: That is correct. 
Now, how many other time~ it might have been discussed 
down in the bowels of some agency, I would have ~o way of kno~iri:~. 
' 
MR. BELIN: You mentioned to me early this morning 
that President Eisenhower talked to you about having the '54/12 
Coromittee looking over activities of the Agency with regard to 
an ov~rsight f ..... unci..ion. 
Do you want to discuss that with the Commission? 
MR. GRl-"\.Y: Yes. Well, I really had forgotten what 
we discussed.
