These were supplemente~ by informal responses or briefings to 
interested.members on a frequent basis. The result has been 
greater exposure of the substance of our intelligence process 
to assist Congress in its decisionmaking, as well·as a few. 
untoward exposures of our sources and methods. I ho~e that 
this Commit-tee sets out clearer arrangements with both houses 
so that we can make available the substance of our intelligence 
to assist in your decisionmaking while protecting the intel­
ligence sources and methods. 
The Executive Branch directs.and supervises the intel-
w0.rk together for the common goal without duplication or 
bureaucratic conflict. At the head of the structure is, of 
course, the National Security Council, pursuant to statute. 
rhe Council itself has issued general directives to the Intelli­
gence Community, and the subcommittees established under the 
Council give more frequent guidance and direction to our effort. 
Certain subcommittees focus on current crises and call for in­
telligence coverage thereof, c~rtain work on longer term problems 
that require intelligence ana.lyl3'is, and certain review the 
work of the Intelligence Community in specified fields. I 
will not get into the bureaucratic detail hecessary to clarify 
. 
this at this session, although I certainly expect to do so in 
,.
