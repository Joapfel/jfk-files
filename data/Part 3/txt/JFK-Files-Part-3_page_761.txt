Dear Mr. O'Connor: 
UL 16 di 
}(VVO' {... 
I have received your letter of July 15 regarding 
access/delivery of documents requested in the Committeers 
lettPr of July 9, 1975. The following relates specifically 
to the procedure suggested for handling documents on the 
so called "Kissinger 17
11 
surveillance, which is also applied 
in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur­
veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic 
City in August 1964, materials relating to the electronic 
~u~v·~illc.11.cG vf Dz-. Itii-1g, O.il~1 !_JU::,i:).l.Lly Ll1t: 0 & C .L.i.le~. 
I regard this suggested procedure as a major step 
forward and a recognition that previous arrangements ·were 
too cu.rnbc":.rsome and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there 
'are certa.in practical problems with the procedure which may 
be resolved by interpretation. For example, I assume that 
application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven-= 
lion matters does not foreclos~ the Coro.mittee from receiving 
for use a.t its offices actual documents or portions of 
documents, as well as surri.~aries. I understand that the 
FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this 
matter to the Committee for use at its offices. 
Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest 
may be applicable t6 all areas of Committee inquiry claimed 
by the Department to involve particularly sensitive matters, 
it should be interpreted as fellows: the Committee staff 
will have direct access to all files aria materials at FBIHQ: 
~ the comm:tnee stad: shall select certain documents from the 
files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry 
and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es­
tablishment of certain facts during the course of the
