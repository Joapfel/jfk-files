October, as I recall. 
Mr. Johnston. Did you expect this instruction to be carried 
out, that the file would not leave the office until you had 
given your personal approval or Fitzgerald had approved it? 
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. I"'.would have thought that my 
secretary would not have permitted this file to leave unless 
cleared. 
Mr. Johnston. We previously discussed whether Mr. King 
knew about the operation. 
Did he specifically know, to your knowledge, about the 
AMI.ASH operation in the fall of 1963? 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. I don't know. I never briefed him 
personally. 
Mr-; Johnston. Did you have any reason to know that· re 
did know about AMLASH ~peration? 
.r-.:-~LABH Case Officer. No . 
Mr. Johnston. Our no~es indicate that on February 4th, 
1964, Mr. King sent a memo to yo~ requirements for AMI.ASH, and 
I'll show you our notes, They basically detail questions, 
intelligence information to be gathered from AMLAS!I, 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. I don't specifically remember receiv· 
this, but if we have -- certainly the fact that we have an 
asset who can surface any intelligence requirements from the 
community or,anybody else in the Agency, it would be perfectly 
TOP SECRET
