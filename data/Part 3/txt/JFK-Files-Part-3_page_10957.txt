individual'peculiar~~es and governing princip~ wil~ be positive 
intelligence weighed against internnl security factqrs. CIA may, 
however, continue its contractual relationship for purpose of handling 
t.raining, pd)curemcmt of positive foreign intelligence, (under- . 
lining adde fuliiilmen~ of CIA connitments to the agent and 
preparation for next assignment abroad. 
f. Where CIA will be handling its agent in U.S., CIA 
w:i.11 service FBX security or counterintelligen.ce requirements and 
will provide FBI all information bearing on counterintellig0nc0 or 
internal security matte:r-s. Where CIA servicing is inadequate :for 
FBI intern~l security interests, FBI will have direct access to 
agent. (Comment: Rules (d), (e) and (f) represent greatly expanded 
• and ~efined version of rule {c) of January, 1964, agreement. Old 
. ground rules provided consider.able latitude with regard to who \ __ 
would handle CIA source in the U.S. and this has led to some ', 
disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules c·learly provide 
for CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training, 
financing, etc., but also for "procurement of positive foreign 
intelligence." In aqdition, they make it clear that the FBI should 
not ask for direct access unless there.· is a specific internal 
security need.) 
4. In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have 
reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; name:i.y, our recent 
agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the u.s. 
By way of. background, there aTe a number of Soviet exchange students 
currently attending various UaS. universities. Each·student, of 
course, is not only a possible Soviet intelligence agent·but also 
a potential source for the UoSe after he returns to his homeland. 
Accordingly, both FBI and CIA have an interest in these students. 
. . 
Per memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64 
that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to Soviet 
students he.re. FBI will take responsibility for col:Iecting material 
·regarding each student on expedite basis, furnishing r~sults to 
CIA as developed. At logical point FBI will confer with CIA to 
decide on case-by-case basis re possible recruitment. If Bureau 
recruits Soviet student, we will resolve whether we should turn 
him over to CIA be~ore he leaves UoSo Under this procedure, CIA 
will not make any inquiries (through its sources -in U.S.) unless
