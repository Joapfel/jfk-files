The primary intent of this suggestion was to point 
up a possible problem developing as a result of 
the increased number of criminal violations 
being encountered by Special Agents handling security work. An excellent 
illustration. of this can be found in case captioned ''Peoples Coalition for Peace 
and Justice; IS -Miscellaneous," Bufile 100-459771. In WFO report of SA James F. 
~ated 5/7/71, serial 423, page 5, is found a narrative of eve,nts at a 
demonstration on November 21, 1970, at New York. This information was not 
placed on an FD-302 and became an issue at a preliminary hearing. As the 
contents of this report were not on FD-302s it was necessary to excise pertinent 
portions of the report and considerable issue of this was made at the preliminary 
hearing. A further indication of this mcst necessary indoctrination of security 
Agents in the use of FD-302s can be found in the EASTCON case. Your attention 
is invited to an airtel under that caption dated 8/25/71 calling for an in-depth 
interview of a key witness. In this airtel the supervisor felt it necessary to 
instruct that the results of this interview be placed on an FD--302. 
In light of the above, it is felt yrushould take whatever 
action deemed necessary to bring to the attention of Special Agents working 
security matters the necessity of placing information which could be testimony 
on FD-302s. It is felt the matter should definitely be highlighted and then followed in the individual cases. 
Comments of Assistant Director Brennan are requested.
