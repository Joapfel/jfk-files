Dear Mr. O'Connor: 
UL 16 di 
l(vvo' L. 
I have received your letter of July 15 regarding 
access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's 
letter of July 9, 1975. The following relates specifically 
to the procedure suggested for handling documents on the 
so called 
11
Kissinger 17" surveillance, which is also applied 
in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur­
veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic 
City in August 1964, materials.relating to the electronic 
C-:.l~·v·c:illc.iiCG cf D:i:'. Kii.-19", a.i:id. .fiu::,;::,j_Lly Ure G & C .Li.le::;. 
I regard this suggested procedure as a major step 
forward and a recognition that previous arrangements were 
too cumbersome and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there 
are certain practical problems with the procedure which may 
be resolved by interpretation. For example; I assume that 
application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven~ 
tion matters does not foreclose the Coro.mittee from receiving 
for use at its offices actual documents or portions of 
documents, as well as summaries. I understand that the 
FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this 
matter to th~ Committee for use at its offices. 
Therefore, in order that the prq~edu~e you suggest 
may be applicable to all areas· of Committee inquiry claimed 
by the Department to involve particularly 11_§.Em'Sitive matters, 
it should be interpreted as follows: .~C£,JJU11:L.tte.e staff 
will have direqt:. aqqess to_all fi~_s...-and.JU.ckt.l:;!rials at FBIHQ: 
the·-{!onuifi c'i:.ee starf shall select certain documents from the 
files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry 
. and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es­
tablishment of certain facts duri~g the course of the 
MD/l-lb .Mltffiim"QlllY,.!r!ON'CON'l'AINEO
