Dear Mr. Vice President:· 
..... 
As you are aware., all employees of the Central Intelligence 
Agency are required to si~ secrecy agre~ments when they enter on 
duty. This is a condition of employment., and it reqci;res that they 
keep forever secret all classified information gained during the 
course of their employment. The secrecy agreement further re- • 
quires that they may not disclose classified infor.mation in inter-
views or by publication without prior authoriza,tion from the Director 
of Central Intelligence. There is a provision in tbe secrecy agree­
ment that the conditions and obligations with respect to th~ protection· -
of classified .information by the agreement continue after employment 
with the Agency has been terminated. 
As I have stated to the Commission., I will make available any 
employee of this Agency to the Commission for staff interview and 
!or testimony before the· Commission. This letter will serve as 
authorization for any such employees or ex-empl,oyees to furnish 
information as requested by the Commission or its staff on matters 
that m~y be classified. As has been discussed with the _Commission; 
there are certain sensitive items which should receive special han­
dling. Such items include names of sources., specific details of • 
technical devices and systems maintained in compartmented channels 
by the Agency., names of employees., names of persons who may be· 
targets of kidnapping or assassination by foreign intelligence organi­
zations., names of organizations cooperating with the Agency~ and 
detailed information which would pinpoint any of the above. Some 
information might also conflict with a subject's right of privacyo
