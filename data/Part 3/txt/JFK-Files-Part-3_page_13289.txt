We are not competent to comment on Mr. Roch's questions 
or allegations concerning other Government agencies or the 
Commission. He has raised a number of points concerning CIA 
that we address below. Before doing so, however, a few words 
are in_order concerning the set of mind with which Mr. Hoch 
seems to have approached this matter. 
On page 11 of his memorandum, Mr. Hoch quotes Mr. James 
Angleton as having made the following ·remark to Mr. Seymour 
Hersh when asked by the latter about alleged CIA wrong-doing 
and domestic activities: "A mansion has many rooms and there 
were many things going on during the period of the [anti-war] 
bombing~. I'm not privy to who struck John." Mr. Hoch then 
expresses puzzlement over this litter itatement. He notes that 
"who s truck John" may b e a 1 it er a r y a 11 u)s ion or c 1 i ch e u n fa mi 1 i a r 
to him and goes on to say: 
It may have been a reference to some other John--
e.g., Mitchell. Also, it is conceivable that "Who 
struck John" was some sort of code name for the CIA 
study of the Kennedy assassination. Angleton should be 
asked to explain that statement, and whether he is aware 
of any CIA investigations of Oswald or the assassination, 
particularly any which may have reached conclusions dif-
ferent from the Warren Commission's. Regardless of what 
Angleton- now says he meant by his comment, an intended 
reference to John Kennedy seems as likely as any other 
explanation.
