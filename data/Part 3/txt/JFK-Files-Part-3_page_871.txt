The issue of lli: •l~g:li~-::•~•r:~~::es~-, Pres:~~:tWlly • :••:y• •• ,; :. _,g I 
approved electronic surveillance in foreign national security cases has not 
yet been decided by the Supreme Cour.t; this issue is now pending in two 
(?ircuit Co~rts of Appeals. 
Thus the specific problems with regard to domestic national 
security electronic surveillance are that it produces information of value 
not obtainable by other means; it has been prohibited without prior 
• · judicial approval; there is no mechanism to obtain prior judicial approval . 
. Consequently, we conduct no domestic national security electronic surveil­
-· • lances.

• :- . The specific problems with regard to foreign national security 
electronic surveillance are that: it produces information of value not 
.obtainable by other means; the legality of. the President to authorize its 
use without prior judicial review is being challenged; if it is held illegal 
there probably will also be no mechanism to obtain prior judicial review; 
current court procedure requires in camera disclosure of the existence 
1 
of national security electronic surveillance in criminal trials and if found 
. illegal, disclosure of the content of the intercepts to the. defense, which 
for ov~rriding security and foreign policy reasons can usually not be made. 
·' • 2. Present Policy 
Domestic National Security Cases: 
We do not conduct eiectronic surveillance in these cases. 
Foreign National Security Cases: 
<.... Pending Supreme C~urt consideration of the "legality" of 
· electronic surveillance in these cases , they continue to be approved by 
the Attorney General, and utilized without warrant. 
3. The Issues 
The main issue in both domestic and foreign national security 
electronic surveillance cases is the right and need of the Government to 
obtain iritelligence information in cases involving (1) U.S. foreign policy 
considerations; (2) threats to our security as a nation from without; and 
(3) threats to the tranquility and safety of U.S. society from within, 
versus 4th Amendment rights and the right to privacy.
