purposes. 
I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider 
honoring any such request. 
I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI

the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including 
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and 
practices~ These are discussed openly and candidly in order

over the FBI. 
I am convinced that the basic structure of the.FBI today 
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity 
can be assured only through institutional means .. 
Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the 
character of the person who occupies the office of the 
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

their standards, and the self-discipline which they personally
