On the late afternoon of February 10, 1970, I was ,

.. n~~-.: _ I very emphatically told TODOROVICH that until he gave me •• 
the'name of the Agent who supposedly gave him and FRITZ this in-, 
formation, that I would not believe that either he or FRITZ had 
• been given any information such as this by any Aient of this 
-Bureau and this was based on the fact that no Agent would have 
any reason whatsoever to rr:ake such a statement sinee we had 
not conducted any investigation in this matter nor did we 
have any inforrna tion concerning RIHA and, therefore,. we would 
not be in a position to make such a st$'l..t.ement as to whether or 
not RIHA was all right. /.:· • • ~=~

I then also uointed out to Mr. TODOROV'!Cfi~that if he· 
_ !gave the information t~ Mr. MCKEVITT and advised Mr.~t~~~~VITT 
the information had come froF. an FBI Agent and if Mr. MCKEVITT 
, contacted me I wo1.1ld certainly advise him that the .. information ! 
" did; not come from anyone in t.he FBI. for tl)e s_am~ reasons as ' 
• s~·t/forth above. • • • • • • •· 
I am enclosing, for the Bureau's information, an 
article which appeared in the February 11, 1970, issue of The 
Rocky ~fountain News, a Denver newspaper. The article is -­
