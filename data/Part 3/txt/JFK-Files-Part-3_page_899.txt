. As previously noted Alderman dealt exclusively with 
·illegal electronic surveillances, i.e., surveillances in 
violation of a defendant's 4th Amendment rights. It did not 
distinguish between "routine" criminal cases and foreign 
intelligence-espionage cases when it required that full 
disclosure of all interceptions of the defendant be made to him 
. so that he, in an adversary proceeding, might determine if

At the conclusion of Alderman, when remanding 
Ivanov, .the Supreme Court ~nstructed the District Court that 
if it found the surveillance in question did not violate the 
defendant's 4th Arnendment rights it should reimpose judgr;;ents 
of conviction. The Supreme Court did not consider the effect 
of Section 605 on the cases.before it in Alderman. 
. The case has been remanded for further proc~edings, 
apparently an evidentiary hearing on the second set of surveil­
lances. The Government can opt to save Ivanov's conviction 
by participating in such a hearing, since none of his case 
was actually built on surveillance information; however this 
• would requi~e disclosure to Ivanov of his intercepted conversa­
tion at t~e Mission and Amtorg, a disclosure concession we don•~ 
want to have to make because of the imoact it would have on 
diplomatic relations, qngoing counteri;tellisence operations, 
and possibily on future prosecutions. Additionally, ~he 
salvaging of Ivanov's conviction falls far short of the original 
purpose of cont~nuing the appeals in this case, vi~., to obtain
