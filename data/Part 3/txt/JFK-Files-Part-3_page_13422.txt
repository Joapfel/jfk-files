meaning something else. I had heard that Trujillo had been 
assassinated before the Dominicans had announced it. President 
Kennedy was then in Paris . 
I called and got Pierre Salinger on the scene, and 
he tells about this in his book, by the way. 
MR. BELIN: He was President Kennedy's Press 
Secretary? 
MR. RUSK: He was President Kennedy's Press 
\ 
Secretary, and I told him Trujillo had been assassinated and 
10 to keep his mouth shut, because it had not been, it had not 
11 been announced.

Well, he stubbed his toe and announced it, or 
referred to it in,one of those glancing remarks at a Press 
. conference. My,concern was that Trujillo's son was in Paris, 
. 
that if Tr~illo's son heard this announcement first from an 
American source that he would think that we had something to 
do with the assassination of Trujillo and might take it out 
on President :Kennedy personally in Paris, and I was concerned 
about Kennedy's personal safety under those circumstances. 
But those were the only two things that I remember 
in the assassination field. 
MR. BELIN: When Mr. Thompson talk to you about it, 
did he indicate what potential foreign leader was involved?, 
MR. RUSK: If he did, I just don't remember it. 
I don't remember it.
