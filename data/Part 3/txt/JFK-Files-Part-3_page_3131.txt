4 Mr. Adams. That's right. So I can assume that the letter 
5 was sent; I have determined nothing from my review of the 
6 files, and neither has your staff, to my knowledge, or has been 
7 reported back to me which would indicate that this action was 
8 duly recorded in any file or was a--part of any authorized 
9 program or anything else. This is a void that I do,. not think 
• 10 any of us has been satisfactorily able. to resolve. 
11 The Chairman. We know the·letter appeared in the files. W 
12 know that the letter was received. We know it.was associated 
13 with other matters that were sent by the FBI to Dr. Martin

15. Mr. Adams. The letter was never in our files in the sense 
16 that it was entered into the official files of the FBI. It was

Mr •. Adams. Yes., sir.

23 thing left.for you to.do. You.know what it is. You have just 
24 34 days in which to do~. -j:_t·~ ·th±s ::exact:number hasrbeen ·,s~lected
