Weatherman and their ilk will doubtless try to 
organize wider support in the broad youth cultur~, most of 
which is not presently committed to violence. By the 
continuation of energetic efforts to prosecute the instigators 
of violence, we can increase the isolation of terrorist groups 
and reduce their influence on youth. This objective is being 
forcefully pursued wherever possible. In Seattle, a group 
of seven violence-prone individuals with Weatherman connections 
were tried in November and December, 1970, on Federal ARL; 
Conspiracy; and Destruction of GovernnBnt Property charges. 
A mistrial in this case was declared December 10, 1970; however, 
due to the defendants' misconduct in court, all seven were 
cited for contempt. These Seattle indictments were made possible 
through New Left informant coverage. 
The East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives, led by the 
notor!ous .. Berrigfill._.l?);...o.JcJl~-l'~...12; has been the subject of intensive 
investigation since the last inspection. This group, which 
is masked as· ·a religion-oriented peace group, has actually 
plotted kidnaping and violence. This matter has been presented 
to a Federal Grand Jury with the result that six individuals, 
~~gi~.¼J.¼~P.J?.~lJJ?.-Jifl:Si&i.~ were indicted on January 12, 1971. 
"s'even other individuals, including Dant.,~l_Bga¾~iRaik. were named 
by the Grand Jury as unindicted coconspirators. 
Information set forth above referring to New Left 
extremists and the Weatherman organization also applies to 
work handled by the Special Investigations Unit - East.
