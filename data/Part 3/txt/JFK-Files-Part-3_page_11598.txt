III. Soviet Illegal Operations 
Tpese operations are staffed by officers or agents 
of SIS who enter the U. s. and operate without any connection 
with the legal bases, i.e., the intelligence residencies 
staffed by intelligence personnel under cover of official 
position located at the Soviet Embassy and Mission to the 
United Nations. In view of the completely clandestine nature 
of these operations, they are the most difficult to detect. 
We have in the past achieved some success in detecting several 
illegal operations. Since the iast inspection, three such 
' agents have been identified in the cases outlined below.

In another outgrowth of the CHOWLINE case, we have 
identified the A~gR~ svg.~ as a Soviet illegal agent. This
