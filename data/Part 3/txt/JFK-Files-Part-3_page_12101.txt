4:, \ SECTION CHIEF A.W. GRAY:{ Inspector's suggestion is a good 
one and should be adopted. However, in conformance with 
both existing "character" structure of Bureau case titles 
and a recommended change regarding security informant titles 
(memorandum A.W. Gray to C.D. Brennan, captioned "Security 
Informants; IS - Communist; New Left," dated 1/21/71}, it 
is proposed that the character designation Racial Matters 
be included. Incoming communications concerning white hate 
group informants only would thus bear the title: CO 1234-R 
RM - WHG 
The Internal Security Section, if the Inspector • 
concurs, will implement this change with appropriate 
instruction$ to the field.
