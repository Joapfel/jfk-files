He did ask if I knew Roy Moore. He was informed I knew Roy in 
Birmingham and that he was one of a very few 11trouble shootingn 
inspectors who traveled throughout the United States as agent in 
charge of major case investigations. He asked my opinion on why

boss for whom most ·agents enjoyed working. -
