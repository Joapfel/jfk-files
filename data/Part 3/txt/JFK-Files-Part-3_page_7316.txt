•• On :.t/21/75 the u. S. Senate reported Senate _,,,..-. 
Resolution 21 to establish ca~tioned committee. The ✓, 
Committee will look into operations of members of the . 
U. S. intelligence community including the FBI. The Commi tte ,r. _ _,. 
is being chaired by Sena tor Fra-nk Church of Idaho. We have 
already received and responded to requests from the Ad Hoc 
Coordinating Group for Congressional Inquiry for information 
to be used by Mr·. William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, 
in preparing for his anticipated initial appearance before the 
committee. The Ad Hoc Group is composed of representatives of 
U.S. Intelligence Board member agencies and departments to 
deal with , "SENSTUDY 75." 
For administrative convenience, as well as economy, 
it is suggested that copies of all communications and material 
dealing with the activities of the committee be placed in a 
new control file, 62-116395, and that the code word "SENSTUDY 
be adopted as a brief title for internal communications 
relating to this matter. FBIHQ indices contain no references 
to that code word. REc~11 1 • _ _ -:.·,...., , _
