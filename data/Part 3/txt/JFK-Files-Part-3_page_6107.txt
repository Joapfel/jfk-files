If act of vio·lence is a criminal violation O\'er which Bureau has

, relating to bombings and attempted bombings. 
Agents are net to attend functions or rallies of any Klan or hate 
group although onen to the public. 
These rnvestigatio~s must be both viJorous and incisive. The 
fundamental objective is to identify those who may be engaged or 
responsible for acts of violence, and care must be taken to avoid 
becoming involved in widespread, nebulous investigation which does 
not go to the heart of the problem at hand. When a case is opened, 
it should receive immediate continuous attention until the initial 
allegation is resolved. The case should be promptly closed if it is 
definitely determined that it does not fall within the criteria set 
out in item 3a above. 
Individual cases should be opened on officers, leaders, and •act·i ve 
workers in these o~ganizations !o determine whether they have been 
involved in acts of violence or have a definite potential for future 
~cts pf violence. [Wholes~le investigations of individuals of-these 
organizations should not be conducted and investigations of in­
dividual members should be initiated onl_y on a. most selective 
basis •. Individuals investigated should be those who are key personnel 
who actually formulate and carry out the ?rga.nization's policy and 
not those individuals who merely attend meetings on a. regular basis. 
If there is any question as to whether such an investigation should 
be initiated, the facts, should bo presented to the Bureau for its 
conside:cation. j 
Immed~ately advise the Bureau when investigation of a prominent 
person is contemplated; and if there is any question as to whether 
there is sufficient probable ca.use to fully justify_investigation, 
no investigation should be conducted without Bureau approval. 
s· -[The Bureau should be advised by letter of the information obtained, 
together with a statement as to whether the individual warrants 
inclusion on the potential bombing suspects list of your office. 
If investigation indicates that the individual should not be included, 
the case may then be closed administratively. If the subject is 
included on the list, the matter should be handled in accordance 
with instructions set forth in section 23, volume II, of this 
ma.ftua.l concerning bombing matters.} 
h. Names of members in attendance at meetings should not be set out in 
investigative reports but should be indexed from informant's(statements.J 
Na.mes of new members should be furnished the Bureau by letter for 
indexing purposes.
