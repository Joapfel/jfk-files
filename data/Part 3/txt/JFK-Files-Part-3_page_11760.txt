Coordination Unii. Other miscellaneous investigative matters 
involving extremist groups with foreign nationality ties such 
as Mexican-Americans, Spanish-Americans, and Puerto Ricans 
will continue to be assigned to the Nationalit:ies Intelligence 
Sectiono 
The Research Section has been placed in the Counter­
espionage - Foreign Intelligence Division in order to balance 
the workload as well as to provide for expansion for research­
type work in espionage and foreign intelligence areas or for 
the manpower therein to be used as the Assistant Director sees 
most advantageous to carry out his responsibilities·. It is 
recognized that this will cut DID short but it is felt DID 
will be able to handle any needed research at a Section lever. 
·The New Left and Civil Disorder Reporting Units, 
currently in the Research Section, will be placed in Internal 
Security Section as data pertains solely to domestic groups.

In realigning work, we have provided for transfer 
of three Agents from Sections within the proposed Domestic 
Intelligence Division to the Nationalities Intelligence 
~ection of other new Division. This has been accomplished 
-by absorbing Klan and White Hate cases (2 men) into Extremist 
Intelligence Section and releasing one Agent from the current 
four-man Security Informant Unit of the Internal Security • 
Section. 
The proposed reorganization will re·sult in the 
following Agent - clerical count:

clerks to be transferred from General 
Investigative Division to handle
