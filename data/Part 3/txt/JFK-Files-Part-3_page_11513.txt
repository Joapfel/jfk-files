r. Ao.ams: RE: Criticisms-- GJ'.=,FBJ:-By"'tJ .s. Senator, 
.,I 
Robert B Morgan of' North Carolina 
Reference my letter of' January 23,1976 addressed to you and 
enclosing data concerningpublicly uttered adverse remarks about 
the FBI made by U.S. Senator Robert B.Morgan(D),N .. C., on 
January 15,1976 before the Asheville,N .. C.Chamber of Commerse,, 
and my letter of rebuttal to Senator r1organ dated January 24-.. 
Since then the "Asheville Citizen" ,i\sh'eville N.C .. printed 
a portion of my rebuttal in its January 30,lt976 issue, in an 
article titled:nRetired Agent Questions Morgan's- FBI position": 
A copy of this news item is enclosed. 
Also I've received replies from U.S. Senator Jesse Helms, 
(R),N.C. and from U.S' .. Representative, Roy A.Taylor, (D),N.,C .. 
who represents the Eleventh Congressional District and which 
includes the Ashevill and Spruce Pine areas. I'm enclosing 
copies of their replies which you will find are s8pportive 
and encouraging. In-fact, Mr. Taylor went out of his way to 
support the FBI in his remarks of January 22,1976 in the 
Congressional Record. Acopy of his remarks is also enclosed. 
Finally, on February 5, 1976 I received a reply from 
Senator MIDrgan~dated February 3, 1 976 which was less than 
favorable. A copy of his letter is enclosed. Today I 
am replying to Mr. Morgan in the form·of a :t-etter to him 
dated February 7, a copy of which I'm enclosing for youe 
These efforts may prove to have been in vain- but if 
one convictions as I have and fails to take a stand, he 
is more remiss than one who is neui:faiaJ/!:oj who has no cowriGft.i.@S--'--'-'-' at all o , _______ - 1· c~7 T :;.- ·,-~"'.:--;~~- _ -----:.:·.,
