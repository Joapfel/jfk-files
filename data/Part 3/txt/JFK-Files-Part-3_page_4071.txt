It should be noted the article of JACK NELSON is 
based on one specific situation, namely the testimony of 
former informant GARY ROWE that he had furnished advance 
information to the FBI to the effect that members of the 
Ku Klux Klan would be given the opportunity to beat members 
of the Freedom Riders without interference by law enforcement 
authorities for approximately 15 minutes after which the 
local law enforcement authorities would take action, and 
that the FBI was advised of this well in advance of such 
beatings and furthermore, the FBI took no action to prevent 
this violence.
