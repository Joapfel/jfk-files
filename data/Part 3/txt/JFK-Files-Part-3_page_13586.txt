MR. BELIN: I am going now to the question of review 
by 0MB. 
Would you care to discuss that as to the number of 
examiners, the choice of portions of the budget that are reviewe, 
and any pertinent questions or hearings or recommendations? 
MR. DONOHUE: Certainly. I have already explained 
the nine month preparatory. Hare on October 1, and almost, 
usually always on that date, this column will come in and the 
' 
examiner will usually, the examiner, and there is one examiner 
for CIA, ,will usually review this document in detail, going thro gh, 
marking it up, seeing what areas he does not feel are adequately 
addressed, or in which he wants more information to address them 
. terms of budget recom.uenda tion . in a 
The things he would look for there are the criteria 
16 he would use, which would be for one thing incremental change 
17 from year to year, what it was in 1974 versus what they are 
18 proposing for 1976. He would look at the magnitude of resources 
19 involved here, and if it is a $50,000 project, he obviously 
20 would not have time to look over ~very $50,000 project, but if 
21 it is a $500 million project, he might very well look into it. 
22 He would look into critical areas, critical areas whers we 
2~.3 felt, or the Administration felt, or somebody had expressed a 
2 t. liview that this was a critical area that needed to be addressed, 
25 and he might look at that area v~ry closely. A new project
