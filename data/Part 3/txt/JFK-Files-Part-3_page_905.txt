During our meeting on July 2'>, 1973, you referred to a discussion 
you had with Senator Charles Mee. Mathfas, Jr. , of Maryland during your con­
firmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Department of 
Justice in the field of domestic intellir;ence investigations. You then asked 
Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus to worlc with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons 
with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that research vias 
being performed on this subject at the present time and that we would be in 
touch with Mr. Ruckelshaus with regard to this matter when we have completed. 
the results of our consideration and findings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two ' 
years as to the scope of FBI jurisdiction and autho~ity in domestic intelligence.:::~ 
investigations. When l',Ir. L. Patric~c Grayt III, was designated as Acting 
Director of the FBI, he instructed that a position paper be prepared concern-
ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic i..lltell!gence 
investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence stated that 
authority of the FBI in this field is based on legislative enactments, even 
though we may have publicly relied heavily 011 Presidential directives as the 
basis for such authority. Mr . Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the 
position and in August, 19 72 , a detailed repqrt was furnished to hi.'11. The 
following is a summary of thut report. . RE" 2 1 1 _ 1 1 r· , ri /tf.'7_.~ /.
