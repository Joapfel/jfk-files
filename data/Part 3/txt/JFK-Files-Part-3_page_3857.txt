Re: D0}.UNICAN" SITUATION 
INTERNAL SECURITY -
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
Diego Emilio Bordas Hernandez and his brother, 
Luis Manuel Alfredo Bordas, have emerged in the current 
Dominican crisis as important f inancin.l, poli tic::il ::i.nd 
military advisors to the deposed Dominican President Juan ,·. 
Bosch in the latter's efforts to regain control of the 
Dominican Government. Diego Bordas is a wealthy shipping 
executive currently residing in exile in Su.n JuRn, Puerto Rico, 
having been born in the Dominican nepublic on January 11, 1923. 
He served in va~ious high posts under Juan Bosch during the 
latter's short occupancy of the position of President of the 
Dominican Republic in early 19630 Bordas spends much of his 
time at 868 Ashford Avenue in San Juan, using an apartment 
at that address as his residence during the absence of its 
owner, Jose Antonio Benitez Jiminez, from Puerto Ilicoo 
Jose Benitez is the cousin of Jaime Benitez. the latter the 
Director of the University of Puerto Rico and a close 
-associate and advisor of Juan Boscho Diego Bordas also 
maintains a residence at 21 v, Florencia, Pueblo Viego: a 
su'qurb of San Juan. near the current residence and headquarters 
of Juan Bosch. Diego Bordas and his brother jointly operate 
a shipping business known as Bordas and Company at High.way 
Number 2, Puerto Viejo, Puerto Rico, and his financial 
dealings in support of the Bosch efforts can reasonably be 
expected to be conducted from this commercial establishment. 
The Bordas brothers have both been the subjects of 
numerous allegations indicating their cooperation with 
procommunist and pro-Trujillo factions in Dominican politics 
, and are apparently opportunists who have seized the current 
>,:~ situation to enhance their political and financial futures.
