Subject: PROJECT ZRRIFLE AND QJWIN 
On April 25, 1975, I was given three.file folders 
containing material on the.above subjects by Mr. Joseph Selzer 
of the Inspector General's staff. According to Mr. Selzer, his 
review of these files indicates that the basic purpose of

"executive action" in any form. His opinion is that clandes­

in these files would never commit to writing anything having 
to do with the subject of assassination.

RYBAT OPERATIONAL." The following entries in this file seem 
to have some potential relevance:

'l'he. purpose for which these agents would ultimately be used 
is not clear from this dispatch. However, paragraph 2a reads 
as follows: "In view of the extreme sensitivity of the
