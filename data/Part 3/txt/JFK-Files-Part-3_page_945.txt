9. Problem - The question of a Civilian Review Board for the intelligence­
gathering activities of the FBI should be examined. This is a. recurrent 
suggestion which crune up at the Princeton Conference, in addition to other 
forums.-
Policy - There is no Civilian Review Board to monitor the FBI inasmuch 
as various checks and reins a.re available to check or control the FBI. 
{See Options) 
Issue - Is it necessary to have a group of civilians review the FBI' s • 
policy and activities to insure that nothing imp1•oper is being done and to 
handle complaints regarding the FBI? • • 
O;etions - No Civilian Review Board is required since numerous means· 
exist to control the FBI. These specifically include: a Senate oversight 
Committee, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, the Office 
of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, the President's 
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Civil Service Commission, the 
Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the Federal Courts, the news 
media, and of course public opinion. The President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory. Board is in reality a civilian review board for the President. 
Its members are non-government personnel qualified in matters relating 
. to national defense on the basis of their knowledge and experience. 
Especially is the FBI opposed to the concept of civilian bo~rds exploring 
the field of FBI counterintelligence and intelligence-gathering operations 
which would adversely affect this Bureau's relations with foreign intelli­
gence agencies. In general, we feel that the Congressional oversight 
concept should have put this question to rest. ~
