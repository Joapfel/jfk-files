SUBJECT: 
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall telephoned and 
I a~vised that on instructions of the Attorney ~eneral he wa:1ted to clear 1 . _., f a 
! with us the rough draft of a memorandum which he was gomg to send m1\ji•vY<­
I to the Bureau. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General has approved" ' t .f.J

The proposed memorandum, a copy of which is attached,

Dr. King's attention. Later that same date, both the Attorney General ~-
and the President, separately, strongly urged Dr. King that there should "., 
be no further connection behveen O'Dell and the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference (SCLC). Thereafter, the Attorney General and .... .- . Marshall received copies of a letter dat~d July 3, 1963, from Dr. King ~ •• i
