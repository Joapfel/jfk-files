2354, 
get deeply involved in the program activities and budget of all 
of the Departments and agencies of government, once in the 
spring and secondly in the 'fall as we are doing the final 
I 
preparation of the President's budget, and the Director and 
Deputy sit down with examiners who have the responsibility, and 
their straw,'bosses and foremen, and go through with them their 
examination of the programs, the recommendations that are made 
by the Department and agency heads, the insights that-our own 
staff have about how resources can best be distributed in 
10 preparation, for a series of meetings that we have with the 
11 President to in turn discuss with him at some-what higher levels 
12 of abstraction the alternatives that we see he has in making 
13 the judgments for the upcoming year. 
14 In addition, we have, of course, some responsibility 
15 for efficiency as indicated earlier, and we do spend some time 
16 trying to _ferret out programs that are not working well, 
17 proposing legislative changes, management changes, on occasion 
18 personnel changes to.· try to accomplish and accommodate better 
19 public performance. 
20 I think maybe just by way of an example, to give you 
21 a more detailed feeling as to how the resources that are investe 
22 in the CIA area, or in the intelligence area, or the Defense 
23 area as compared to other areas, I might take an example in 
24 another area that we examine, and let me say Social Security as 
25 an example .
