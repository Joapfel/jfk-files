Intelligence is designated as Chairman of this Bdard and in 
this capacity is distinguished from the Director·of the 
Central Intelligence Agency. A more complete discussion with 
regard to the Bureau's role in this over-all setup is set forth 
heroin~.:fter under tho caption "FB:C Rcla.t:l.ons With tho 
United States In.telligence Board." 
. National Security Council Intelligence Directive 
No. l, originally issued 12/12/47, defines the various types 
of intelligence in Section 4. 
(a) National Intelligence is that intelligence 
which is required for·the formulation of national security 
policy, concerns more than one department or agency, 
and transcends the exclusive competence of a single 
department or agency. The Director of Central Intelli-
.. gence • shall produce>:t national intelligence with the 
support of the U.S. Intelligence Board. 
(b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence 
. ·····which any department or agency requires to eAecute its own 
mi f:f::.i on, 
(c) Interdepartmental Intelligence is integrated 
departmental intelligence which is required by departments 
and agencies of the Government for the execution of their 
missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence 
of a single department or agency to produce. The 
subcommittee structure of the U. s. Intelligence Board 
may be utilized for the production and dissemination of 
interdepartmental intelligence. 
Director of Central Intelligence is then authorized 
to disseminate national intelligence and interdepartmental 
intelligence provided it is done consistent with statutes and 
Presidential policy, and provided further "that any disclosure 
of FBI intelligence information ~hall be cleared with that 
agency pr.ior to dissemination."
