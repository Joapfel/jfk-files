U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT 
ROBERTS. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were 
prepared by the Bureau Laboratory. 
Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall. 
Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated, 
and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive 
criminal records, and because of this and their general 
demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-
rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state 
of turmoil. He stated that Special Agents connected with 
the COINTELPRO did not devote much time to the program be­
cause of heavy case loads of other matters and because they 
assisted in working criminal matters such as bank robberies 
and other criminal violations. 
Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great deal of 
time was spent by the Special Agents working with their 
sources because they had to be extremely careful that they 
were protected. If a crime was planned and a sot.lt' ce had 
knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from 
being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime, 
the source might be forced to participate,and if arrested,a 
problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out 
of jail and still conceal his identity as a source. 
Mr. Seidel inquired of Mr. Baker as to the names of 
the Agents he dealt with in Los Angeles and San Francisco in 
connection with COINTELPRO. 
Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that Supervisor 
Albert Clark had something to do with the program in San 
Francisco, and in Los Angeles he dealt with Supervisor Richard 
Bloeser and Bill Knowland.
