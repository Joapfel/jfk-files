Memo from Legal Counsel t0 Mr. Adams 
SENSTUDY 75 
Mr. Epstein classified the· interview as an 11abus~ 11 
type and agreed to allow agents to be available but not present 
during interview. 
On June 3, 1975, K. William O'Conn~r, Special Counsel 
to the Deputy A~torney General for Intelligence Coordination, 
was advised of the request and of the fact that an agent could 
not be present during interview. He stated that the Department's 
position was that unless the Committee consented to allow Bureau 
personnel to be present, the interview would not go forth# and 
that he would advise Epstein and F. A.O. ~wartz, Chief Counsel 
of the Committee, of this dicision. 
Mr. O'Conner telephonically recontacted Special Agent 
Daly and advised that he discussed the matter with assistant 
to the Counsel tbf>the President, James A. Wilderotter. 
Wilderotter t0ld O'Conn~r it was the White House position that 
these girls should not be made available for interview unless 
the Committee allows Bureau personnel to be present. Wilderotter 
stated th~se two employees had been cited as examples wherein 
the White House felt interviews should not be conducted without 
representatives of the particular agency or Bureau being present 
as they are service personnel. According-to Wilderotter, Shwartz 
agreed to this position.

on June 4, 1975, at which time he -advised that he had discussed 
the interview with Shwar~z, Epstein, and staff member M~r.k
