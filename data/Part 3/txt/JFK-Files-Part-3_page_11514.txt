Dear Senator Morgan: OA'TE • 
Reference my letter to you dated January 24~ 1976 and your 
thoughtful and sincere reply dated February 3, 1976. 
. I can appreciate your due concern with what you sinc€6:ely 
believe to be past abuses and errors 0£ the FBI~ I 1 m sure.you 
have heru?d some sordid testimony, and I'll be the first to.agrea 
that the FBI has had its'~aults ·when compared with some theo:ctJt:ical 
per.fedtion .. 
' I submit.however, that you heard onfy the worst,'the most 
glaring and most shocking incidents which can only rept-esent· the 
most ini'initesemal number of cases, taken ~rom hundreds ,or hhous­
ands of investigations.-. Much of the testimony heard by you em­
anated from disgruntled, sometimes disillusioned and less than . 
candid individuals, many of whose sense of values and objectivity 
has changed, f~r various reasons~ with.the pass~g. of time~ 
What you didn't hear was the testimony of thousands of 
selfless citizens~ many of whom risked their .. lives and personal. 
safety to work un.dereover or semi-covertly in a sincere et.fort 
to assist the FBI in :protecting this country, it cit.izens and· 
their civil liberties~ -,> ~, 
-.. "'~ .. 
You did.n*t hear of the interminable and consistent FBI 
investigationtt which scrupulously went the extra steps to protect. 
the legal rights of individuals under investigation. Nor did you •. 
hear the testimony o:f thousa,,ds of :fearfu1 and concerned citizens, 
parents and other close relatives of persons whose warped minda 
and action~ were aimed at destroying our government and thereby 
the civil lib~rties of their victims, both black and white., 
From a philosophical as well as a preg matic standpoint perhaps 
we can ag~ee• that the potential harm to privacy must be weighed 
against the necessity :for law enf'orcement action in relation to 
social and security needs at any given time~ 
If only one or the other of these interests is to be consid­
ered to the exclusion o:f the o·thers irrationality results-an.do 
should this irrationality persist protractedly~ in either direct­
ion, our nation would tend to ty:ra:nny, namely, that of anarchy on 
the one side or tyranny of police agencies on the othero
