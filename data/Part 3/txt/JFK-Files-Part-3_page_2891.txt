Senator Huddleston. But that hasn't been the case in the 
past. 
Mr. Kelley. Well, I don't know what you're referring 
to but I would think your statement is proper. 
Senator Huddleston. Well, we certainly have evidence 
of unlatvful activity taking place in various projects that 
have been undertaken, which certainly were not brought to 
l~ght willingly by the FBI or by other law enforcement agencies 
The question that I •r~ really concerned a!:>out is .as 
we attempt to draw· a guideline and charters that would give 
the Agency the best flexibility that they may neecl, a wide 
range of threats, how do we control what happens within each 
of those actions to keep them from going beyond what 
wa~ intended to begin with?
