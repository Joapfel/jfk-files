TOP SECRET 2281 
of leadership in the coromunityD When I say we, I am speaking 
now not as a former Special Assistant, but if it is all right fo 
,j 
me to speak as a member of the President's Board, how the 
community could be organized, and one of the problems has always 
been what I would describe as a constitutional problem. If 
X Agency has 60 parcent of the dollars, and the head of z 
Agency wants to or is told to gi~e guidance and leadership, he 
simply cannot under our system give orders to a constitutional 
officer in another branch of government, specifically the Secret ry 
of Defense. And at the same time, I feel there should be a 
chief intelligence officer of the Government. I think he must 
have the confidence of the President and a rapport with the 
President, and if he has that, his job is easier, and if he has 
to only persuade and request, but if your Committee is going 
15 to make recommendations about this, it seems to me that you migh 
16 want to recommend that there be someone who is considered a 
17 chief intelligence officer, and that if you wish, it can be the 
18 DCI, or a new thought that we did not discuss this morning, ther 
I 
19 might be a special assistant to the President f9r intelligence 
20 affairs, and he could then represent the Presi~ent across the 
21 board, and perhaps have greater success and leadership.

23 situation where one Agency simply canr-ot instruct another Agency 
24 under:certain circumstances.
