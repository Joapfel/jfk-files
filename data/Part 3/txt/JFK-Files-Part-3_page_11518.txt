Mr. William Ho. Lawrence

Spruce Pine, Norhh Carolina 28777 
Dear:' Mr., Lawrence :: 
~.1hank you :for taking time to ·write me and for your 
expression o.f your feelings about the Federal Bureau o.f 
Investigation •. I admire your loyalty to the organization 
you served .. 
We .have finished many long hours o.f hearing test­
imony regarding the activities of the FBI .. Let me say 
that as a citizen and as·- Attorney General of North 
Carolina, I always.supported the FBI and de.fended it when 
I heard it criticized. 
It gives me no pleasure now to hold it in less high 
esteem than I did before, but after hearing testimony 
about its activities, especially under Mr. Hoover, I 
could reach no other conclusimn but that the due process· 
clause and the civil liherties of individuals were violated 
time after time.. What may be worse, I got the feeli~g 
from the testimony of present FBI officials that they 
didn't plan to change things much, if at all .. 
. I know that many fine people such as you served the 
Bureau and thir country well, but I cannot disregard 
the unchallenged testimony I heard during the past 
several months. 
Thank you again for writing and with best ·wisheso, 
Sincerely yours, 
Robert Morgan
