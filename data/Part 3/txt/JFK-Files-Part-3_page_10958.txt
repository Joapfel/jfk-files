l. Overt Coll0ction Activities 
! It is evident from the National Security Act of 
1947 and the succeeding National Security Council Intelligence 
Directives as well as the directives of the Director of 
Central Intelligence that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection 
of foreign intelligence in the United States. I.n pursuit 6{ 
this, CIA exploits non-governmental organizations and _\ • 
individuals, foreign language publications and aliens. Although 
CIA claims to have contacts with about 7,200 organizations· 
and businesses as well as about 60,000 sources of information 
as a result of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA 
estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign 
intelligence information available in this country. 
The question we must consider here is whether the 
FBI should take over the overt collection of foreign intelligence 
in the United ~ta"tes, tne:reoy mal ... i11g CIA 0ps3:;:~;,;ti~n;:.,l ~nly i!l 
areas outside the limits of FBirs jurisdiction. In this 
connection, the following v1ould have to be considered: ./ 
(a) Reporting: 
The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has 
,traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings 
without bias or conclusions. This would not change. . 
Intelligence developed by the FBI would be evaluated by the 
users in the intelligence community. Our report writing 
format might have to be geared to the needs and established 
procedures of the United States intelligence community.
