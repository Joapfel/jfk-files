that a Section has been formed within the Intetjial Security 
Division of the Department to file petitions before the SACB 
pursuant to Executive Order 11605 and that the Department 
is interested in proceeding as quickly as possible against 
such parties as the Black Panther Party and the Ku Klux Klan 
among others. Such proceedings will materially increase 
the workload of the Section. 
Under the proposed reorganization of the Division 
which is under consideration at this time, this Section, if 
such reorganization is approved, will handle all Klan and 
white-hate organizations, individuals and informants with 
the present supervisory complement. In this connection, 
the informant cases are adoptable to full assimilation into 
our present extremist informant setup and a great deal of 
the work in connection with the handling of these informants 
will be assigned the responsibility of two grade 6 clerical 
employees in the Black Nationalist - South and Racial Informant

Black extremist activity in this country is 
,developing more and more in international aspects. Residents 
of other countries including U. S·. citizens and n<?nci tizens 
are involved in clandestine and overt operational activity 
among racial extremists. We have targeted Central Intelligence 
Agency as well as our Legal Attaches abroad for the develop­
ment of data regarding foreign influence in the black 
extremist movement. We have levied requirements and are 
expanding on such requirements on the National Security 
Agency which has vast capabilities in developing the type 
ot information needed. 
(7) In evaluating personnel adequacy, we take into 
consideration not only the case load which is compiled on a. 
monthly basis but also results of periodic mail counts taken 
on a quarterly basis. Many of our cases on key figures in 
the black extremist movement such as Hu~x:, l,:.~ N~n~,,-~.1£1.~~g~ 
.,.Clea~~, :fames !'.2....'.9,P~, !:z.~t2,,s>~, and others require a 
considerable amount of supervisory attention.
