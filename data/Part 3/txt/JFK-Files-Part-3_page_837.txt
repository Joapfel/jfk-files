The underlying rationale for·, and history behind, 
these concepts is: 
Personnel - the generalist qllows for a highly 
flexible, mobile force which can be deployed, generally solely 
on the basis of manpower needs, i.e., any agent can do ~ny 
job in the FBI. There are some exceptions; ~ome employe~s 
have unique abilities which tend to make them less mobile in 
the eyes of administrators, e.g., language or technical 
factors in the case of agent deployment and promotion; they 
are more determinative in cases of clerks: special employees, 
translators, etc. 
Administration of cases and conduct of investica~io~ 
these were originally geared to accommodate a relatively few 
criminal and civil investigative matters, and as the respo~si­
bilities of the organization grew they were modified and a~a?~e~, 
within the. unitary structure, to accommodc::..te the vm;ious 
missions. Thus they are quite similar in all three missio~s .

a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
f. 
Are the missions of law enforcement, internal 
security, and counterintelligence separable?. 
If so, is complete separation possible, prac~ical 
or politically feasible or desirabJe? 
Can the three missions be accommodated in one 
organization? 
By doing so, do any of the missions suffer? 
If all three missions can be accommodated 
one agency, is the FBI currently doing it 
best way possible? 
If not, is it practically or politically 
-ble or desirable to change the FBI's way 
forming the mission?

sepa:r.ate from law enforcement agencies?
