AMLASll Case 
time, I think the last report we·had was what, a couple of 
years ago? 
Mr. Baron. I was given·· th~ ·name of a CIA contact in 
Florida who had been on the Island of.-Pliea z.t one point and 
said as far as he knew, altho_ugh he hadn't been in Cuba for 
several years, AMLASII was a prisoner, but he wasn't in•prison. 
lie was doing some sort of hospital work which was considered 
part of his rehabilitation program. 
1\MLASH Case Officer. He was a doctor, wasn't he, for 
\ 
the prison? 
Mr. Baron. Yes. 
AML1\SII Case Officer. lie had more freedom because he 
was heing used as a doctor for the prisoner but he still was 
still on the Isle of Pines. 
Mr. Baron. It is my understanding that he was working 
as a doctor even outside the prison and again, this is just 
hearsav of one contact that I called on the phone. 
Mr. Wallach. Are you positive that someone just not 
using his name is there, that he switched over using an alias? 
You wouldn't have intelligence of that type? 
JI.MLJ\S11 Case Officer. No. 
Mr. l'lallach. I want to quickly follow-up on some thin\: 
that Jim and the Senator were getting at.
