i Reference is:.:now made to Tampa letter to the 
Bureau dated 5/6/64 which made reference in turn to 
Jackso;:iville letter dat.ed 4/30/64 wherein .GEOR-G~.F~NIH.it~ 
?~E1:i0S st2 ted tha.t the ··viiffitg-Youth of America never 
bec~me organized •in.the United States and that he never 
made an actual active attempt to.recruit members in this 
organization. The Tampa f~le in this matter is closed. 
We l~ave .not been able to determine that any active chapters 
of tnis group are in existence or that any members were 
recruited for the group~ It is therefore felt that there 
·would be no point in our _attempting any disruptive tactics 
in connection with this group. • 
The Bureau is requested to advtse Tampa whether 
it would be satisfactory not to initiate any action on 
the :Viking Youth of America and to_subst~tute some.other 
organization for this purpose. . ... __ .A--1-•
