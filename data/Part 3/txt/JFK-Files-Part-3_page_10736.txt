ROBERT LEE DAVI1 ON., JRo., is a racial informant 
of the Atlanta Office He v s formerly Imperial Wizard 
of first U. S. Klans Nig~ of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc., 
and later of United;K_: . He is presently not a member 
of any Klan group; however, he has considerable influence 
and contacts among many of the members of United Klans. 
. This situation appears to offer an opportunity to 
capitalize upon the personal conflict of two Klan leaders. 
We propose the following action: 
Instruct Racial Informant ROBERT LEE DAVIDSON, 
JR., to agree to help BING oust CRAIG as Grand Dragon for 
Georgia and instruct DAVIDSON to actively work with BING 
to achieve CRAIG1 s ouster. 
BING has considerable following, particularly 
in the rural area south of Atlanta. DAVIDSON has contacts 
i_n the Klan throughout Georgia. We be 1 ie ve that with 
DAVIDSON1 s assistance, BING could disrupt much of the 
United Klans 1 organization in Georgia~ 
The Bureau is requested to authorize the above • 
~ action.
