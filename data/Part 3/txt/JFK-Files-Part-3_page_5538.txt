19G9, who at the time were executing a search warrant in 
Chicago. ,Illinois. 
While in the party, Junior held the title of Field 
Sccretary_and was privy to administrative matters relating 
to the ·BPP. On two occasions ho traveled out of the state on 
party business, once to BPP National Headquarters for the 
purpose of meeting the National Staff, and to Wash-ington, D. C.,_, 
to attend the- Rovolut ionary' People's Constitutional 
Convention (RI'CC). 
The RPCC; held August 7, 1970, at Howard University, 
Washington, D. C., was organized by the BPP to structure 
"a constitution that will guarantee us the right to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit ef happiness: a constitution that serves the 
people instead of a con..stitution that serves the ruling class". • 
. . 
In early 1969, Junior negotiated to purchase a quantity of 
weapons from an undercover United States Treasury Agent, for 
the BPP and as a result was arrested on a Federal Firearms charge~ 
While out Qf jail on this charge, Junior learned that he had 
been indicted and,decidOd to jump bond and leave the country. 
Junior left the country for Canada, through the aid 
of p~rsons connected with the draft resistence movement, 
and who did not know of hrs pending criminal charges or his 
affiliation with the BPP. He declined to identify these 
parsons who aided in his leaving the country or those who 
aided him in Canada, 
The BPP in no way aided him in leaving the country, 
nor did they provide him any financial assistance while he 
was a fugitive and for.this he is bitter. 
Junior decided to leave Canada and return to 
Chicago for the purpose of surrendering to face trial 
on the Federal Firearms Act charge, because of his 
parents• poor health.
