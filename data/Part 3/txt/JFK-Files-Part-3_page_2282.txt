Jaffe is a form.er New York Office infoi·ma.nt 
who was a correspondent for CBS a.nd AOO. While with ABC,, 
he was stationed i.n Moscow from 1961 to 1965. During this 
assignment he was compromised by the KGB through .a 
relationship ho bad with a Soviet f-oma.le and because of a 
ear accident. Jaffe rePorted the subsequent recruitment 
effort by the KGB to both the U. s. Emb!:issy and to 
Now YorI:.. lie adtni tted to New YoX'lt thttt ho had a continuinz 
reln:tionchip in ?,!oscow with seve:t~l ltGD officers, but 
denied that he furnished them anything. In 1964 1 a Soviet 
defector reported that Jaffe had been recruited by the KGB in about 1961 and thereafter furnished the KGB with 
information about oth()r Americans in Moscow .. Our investigation; 
including two intensive interviews of Jaffe, neither substantiated or refuted the defeotor•s allegation.u 
Qur evaluation of Jaffe's relationship vlith the KGB is that afte~ his a~tted ~omprondse he undoubtedly cooperated to a degttce, simply to avoid being expelled 
from. Moscow because 0£ the damage it would ba.ve caused to his then advancing career. lle was eventually expelled 
in 19651 ostensibly because ot an unfavorable article 
written by ABC Correspondent John Seal~ about the So~iet 
leadership. We have never uncovered any evidence that 
Jaffe .assisted the I<:GB after he le:ft !.foscow. u
