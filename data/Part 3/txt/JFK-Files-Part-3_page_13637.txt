Mr. Johnston. The CIA~• plans for using him. 
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. He wa1 concerned as to how and 
in what way he was to cooperate with CIA. He was also -- and 
we must underline this, right from the beginning, dubious 
as to our resolve to really follow through on initiating a 
coup against Castro. 
Mr. Johnston. Is the cable correct in stating that he was 
assured that his case was receiving consideration at the 
highest levels? 
AMLASH Case Officer. Yea. 
Mr. Johnston. Was the word "highest level" used, or was 
a name used? 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. Highest levels, but at that staqe 
of the game he knew he was talking to CIA, so highest levels 
in CIA is what was meant at that particular time. 
·Mr.Johnston. That's the word you used? 
You didn't say Director McCone? 
AMLASH Case Officer. I did not use names, no. 
Mr. Johnston. On October 5th, you reassured him that his 
consideration, that his case was receiving consideration at 
least at the highest levels of CIA, and the cable reflects 
that when he left that meeting he seemed much more relaxed about: 
the case. 
Is that an accurate portrayal of the meeting? 
AMLASII Case Officer. That's right.
