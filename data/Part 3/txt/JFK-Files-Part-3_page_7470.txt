h. Maintenance of files and records; 
i. Dissemination of information from files and 
records; 
j. So-called "COINTELPRO" techniques and methods, 
including all forms of o~ganizational 'disruption.'" 
App~ndix B, item number 4, requests: 
"For each of the techniques described in Item 5 of 
Appendix A above, all memoranda and other materials relating 
to: 
a. The original decision to utilize the technique in 
internal security, intelligence collection, and/or 
counterintelligenc~ m~tters, _operations, or 
activities. 
b. The policies and procedures of t~e FBI for the 
utilization of the technique in internal security, 
intelligence collection, and/or counterintelligence 
matters; operations, or activities." • 
It would appear appropriat~ that response to Appendix 
A, item number 5, be prepared by the Legal Counsel Division· .. 
It is also apparent that response to·Appendix B, item number 4, ·­
should be clos~ly coordinated although responsibility for research 
in this area would appear to fall more logically within the 
Intell~gence pivision. • 
'RECOMMENDATIONS: 
• 1. That Legal Cou:r;isel Division assume respons.ibility 
for preparing response contained in Appendix A, Item number 5.
