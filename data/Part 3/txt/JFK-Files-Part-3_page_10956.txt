3. As result of conference with CIA in January, 1966, the , 
above 11ground rules" were modified and expanded and agreed upon by 
both agencies early this year (Confirmed by letter to Admiral 
Raborn 2/7/6~. New ground rules in summary are as follows: 
a. CIA will not imtiate investigation of any foreign 
official in UoSo.witpout concurrence of FBI. (Comment: This is 
essentially same as (a) in January, 1964, ground rules. Only 
difference is that wording of this modification implies more 
sympathetic FBI attitude towards any proposed ClA investigations.) 
• b. CIA will seek FBI concurrence before approaching for 
recruitment any foreign official or communist bloc visitor in u.s. 
FBI will concur if CIA action does not conflict with any FBI 
operations. (Comment: This is similar to (b) and (c) ground rules 
adopted in January, 1964, with two differences.· First, it drops 
requirement that CIA,.clear with us before approaching a non-Soviet 
visitor although it must still do so with regard to non-Soviet 
officials. Secondly~ it specifically commits the FBI to concur if 
proposed CIA action ~oes not conflict with FBI operations.) 
. c. CIA will advise FBI prior to meetings between CIA 
assets and foreign officials or communist bloc visitors of interest 
to FBI. (Comment:· This was ~ot included in previous set of 
ground rules.)
