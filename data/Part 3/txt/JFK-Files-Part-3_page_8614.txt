Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall 
Re: SENSTUDY 
• 
While we cannot say exactly what ~ormer Assistant 
Director W. C. Sullivan had in mind when he added the 
instruction about items with an unusual twist, we can 
speculate with a hypothetical example. 
If we learned that a trusted .assistant to an 
important government official--an official who had taken 
a "hard line" with respect to dealings with the Soviet Union, 
for example--was under development by Soviet intelligence, 
this would be an unusual twist to an item of intelligence 
interest to the President involving a prominent person. 
In such a hypothetical case, we would, ~f course, 
advise the government official involved, and The Attorney 
General and the President. We would have done this under 
INLET and we would still disseminate this type of data. 
INLET was only a vehicle for special dissemination. 
ACTION: 
For information.
