SPECIFIC COMMEN'rS

1. In Protest and Trotskyist Groups Unit, one 
Special Agent Supervisor (McGuire)_ and one clerk ~g,),@' 
temporarily assigned New Left Section. Supervisor in Charge 
of same Unit (Griffit4l also spending majority of his time 
in New Left Section assisting on special. An additional 
Supervisor from International New Left Unit (Benedict) and 
one clerk from Klan and White Hate Groups Unit Itf~J.-are 
also working majority of their time on New Left Section 
special. 
2. No pending transfers or resignations. 
-- 3. See number 1 above. 
4. We have requested one additional clerical employee 
for the Communist Party, USA, Unit (request not yet filled) 
because of substantial need due to increase in Unit case load 
from 572 to 1076 as a result of reorganization. We are currently 
ass'3ssi~g :n.A?.rl for ;:1.nother cle:r;j..~a.l __ ~mplgyee in Klan and White 
Hate Groups Unit to handle large volume of mail involved in 
supervision of several hundred Klan and White Hate group informants. 
. 5. Considering that Internal Security Section, as it 
is now constituted, was established December 16, 1970, approxi­
mately three weeks ago, no meaningful comments regarding manpower 
savings as related to this Section can be made. We are carrying 
·a substantial case load, with increases in several areas. For 
example, the case load of the Communist Party, USA, Unit as a 
result of the reorganization increased from 572 to 1076 with no 
increase in personnel. Additionally, two Supervisors assigned to 
this Section (Griffith and McGµjrel are on temporary loan to the 
New Left Section along with a clerical employee (Hapni,ug,i. 
Additionally, a third Supervisor (Beo,st4i£,.t,l and a second clerical 
em~loyee (De~& are spending the majority of their working time 
oh assignment to New Left Section special. For all practical 
purpos.es, the work of three Supervisors and two clerical employees 
is being absorbed on a daily basis within the present personnel 
complement which, of course, is a tangible manpower savings. In 
all Units we are constantly involved in attempting to eliminate 
or curtail the volume of paperwork being handled, reducing 
_·programs and projects to •bare essentials and wherever possible, 
keeping the case load volume at a manageable figure. 
Another example of manpower conservation exists in 
the Subversive Individuals - Basic Revolutionary Groups Unit
