Mexican photo 
Answer: 
We have had previous communications with Mr. Hoch concerning 
this matter (see Tab 5). 
The Agency at no time in its dealings with the FBI in the 
Field or with the Warren Commission in Headquarters described 
• 
or suggested that the unknown individual whose photograph was 
taken in Mexico City on 1 October was Lee Harvey OSWALD. Our 
total coverage of the unknown individual numbers twelve photo­
graphs taken on 1 October (USSR Embassy), 4 October (USSR 
Embassy) and 15 October (Cuban Emti~ssy). OSWALD left Mexico 
City, it is known, at 0830 hours, 2 October. It is clear, 
therefore, that this individual could not be OSWALD. Mr. 
Helms, in a memorandum to the Warren Commission Chief Counsel,. 
indicated very clearly that the photograph of this unknown 
individual had nothing to do with the OSWALD case. In the 
light of all of the facts in the file, we find no reason to 
modify this judgment.
