MR. GRAY: That's right. 
I 
MR. CONNOR: Going back to your earlier testimony 
about your experience as assistant to the President for security 
matters, do you think it is wise for the same person to occupy 
that position and Secretary of State? 
..../ 
MR. GRZ\Y: No, sir. 
MR. BELIN: Any particular reason why you feel that 
way? 
MR. GRAY: Yes. I think that the Secretary of State, 
' 
10 the responsibilities of the Secretary of State are very clear. 
11 I think the respo'nsibilit;.ies of the Secretary of Defense are 
12 very clear. I think the responsibilities of other executive 
13 agency heads are very clear. And I have a strong feeling that 
14 the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs should not 
15 be tied to any other agencies~ I thi~k he should be not a 
16 Secretary of Defense and a special assistant either. I think th 
17- special assistant shoulq have his loyalty only to the President

and not to any one department, and my own feeling is that the 
present situation creates some bottlenecks,. administrative 
bottlenecks that should not exist. 
·MR.BELIN: Does that relate to your earlier testimony 
of actions by the Advisory Board perhaps not getting through to 
the President? 
MR. GRAY: It relates in good measure to that. My 
25 own feeling is we have made recommendations to the President
