OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the ~e information,wli:.tch does 
not appear that the aiibjec • ts within the criterian ~ 
of the(:iLEM Program..ait i o be noted that the subject 
was in the US for a considerable amount of time before he 
married an American citizen and had been granted Permanent 
Residence on a,-Immigrant status prior to his marriage to 
CYNTHIA HAAS. 
)' 
Although the subject did enter the US with the 
profession of a photographer and had employment with Magnum 
Photos, Inc. upon his entry, thite does not appear that his 
services were solicited by this company because of a special 
skill. y 
In view of the above, it is the opinion of the 
NYO that further investigation of the above is not warranted 
and this case is being placed in a closed status. ~.
