This memorandum reports that on the morning of 
Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community, 
telephonically advised Section Chief William o. Cregar, the 
Bureau's representative on this Group, that the Senate Select 
Committee (SSC) has requested a copy of the 2/7/66 FBI - CIA 
Understanding, .rl,.,~.c,:,.t.;ttt .. c.l, '' c. t A ~t-H~ I.,¥µ ;:;t~ V✓ .. i/ir..4 ,J:1.,1,LZ;,t,1, '' 
We have reviously received requests from the House 
Appropriations C ittee as well as the Rockefeller Commission 
for copies of t e FBI - CIA Understanding dated 2/7 /66. In $ .,, 
both instances Deputy AG Laurence Silberman authorized the v(•f 
release of the FBI - G.IA 'Q'nder~!!!t.<!?,~g to the House Approp:ria- ; J . 
tions Committ e~eII as-tne'·R.ockefeller Commission. 
On the morning of 3/24/75 Mr. John Clarke telephonically 
\ advised that CIA has received a request from the SSC to provide 
the SSC with a copy of the FBI - CIA Understanding. Inasmuch as 
we have previously provided a copy of this Understanding to 
another Congressional committee, it would appear that we have no 
choice but to furnish a copy of this Understanding to the SSC; 
however, clearance should be obtained from Deputy AG Silberman. 
Inasmuch as a timely response to the SSC is desired, 
it w:.ould appear reasonable for the Legal Counsel Division to 
tele.phonically inquire from Mr. Silberman whether he interposes 
l any objection to CIA furnishing a copy of the Understanding to 
~ the SSC. If oral authority is obtained, the Intelligence Division 
will confirm such authority from the Deputy AG J:}l lV.rJ.i,ing~/ l , ,.:l I J 0~ u~ - w,
