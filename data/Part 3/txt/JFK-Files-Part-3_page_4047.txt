Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), today finds himself 
in the embarrassing position of having too much money, or at 
least the probability of too much money. The SCLC sent out a 
huge mailing to.its cont~ibutors pleading _for funds fo~.tpe 
Washington Spring. Project, the npoor .. people 1 s. march ·on .. '':"·,:. •• . 
Washington." Thousands of com=i·ibutors were urged to support 
the march financially in order to feed and house the demon­
strators. But the chtirches in the Washington, Do c .• , area 
have offered to house and feed the demonstrators. 
Now the contributions are beginning to roll in from 
the mailing and King doesn't n~ed the money. An embarrassment 
of riches has befallen King, who wi~l only use the money for 
otµer purposes. The churches had better come through with 
all the housing and support the demonstrators need, because 
there will b·::-little money le:ft for the "poor people" by the 
time the march rolls u-ound.
