'~Jt is significant that we have been able to operate for 
many years in the development of live sources in foreign diplomatic 
est2B.ishments, both Soviet bloc and non-bloc, without encountering 
any serious incidents embarrassing to the FBI or the United States 
Government. _. 
ln assessing tho p:i. .. oduct o:f such live sources in a number 
o:f instances in the non-Sov .. et field:7 State Department has 
requested that we restrict our efforts to American citizens. To 
a considerable degree, this has limited the effectiveness oi our 
program in the ron-Sov-iet field since U. So employees of foreign 
establishments will normally hot have access to top-grade data. 
Thus, especially.in the non-Soviet bloc field we are not tapping 
the full potential which exists for high-level foreig~ intelligenceo 
, This can only be realized through the development of high quality 
sources. • ~ 
4. (Jagram Program .• - ~ / W~1t ~ . 
Anagram is code word for FBI program to penetrate foreign~­
diplomatic establishments in U.S. for purpose of securing crypto­
graphic material. This material is primarily of value to National 
Security Agency in ~ts communications· intelligence efforts. 
Since incepti9n of program in 1954, we have conducted Anagram 
operations involving 38 different foreign countries and a ~o~ai oi 
57 separate establishments. Approximately 10 FBI field offices 
have participated in the program. Our operations under this 
program have resulted in monetory savings to the Gove:cnment estimated ,, 
at better than $13,000,000 and it has provided data of incalculable 
intelligerice value. While it has been of primary value to NSA, we 
have on occasion produced information of primary interest to the 
Bureau. For example, in April, 1963, we affected a successful 
penetration in the Polish field which produced material disclosin:J 
the activities of Polish Intelligence Sez-vice in· this country. .. • . .. . . 
.5. Double Agents and Informants 
In a number of instances, Bureau double agents and informants, 
developed to assist us iu connection with our internal security and 
counterintelligence responsibilities, have been. able to provide 
. significant high~level information of f6reign inte~liience value •. ·.~-
