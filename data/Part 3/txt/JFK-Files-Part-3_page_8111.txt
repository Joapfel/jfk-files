Select Committee (SSC) that U. s. Postal Service tusPS) 7;Ji,Q; :.1 z: " 
:furnish to the S"sc the identities of all mail covers placed I 
by the FBI since 1960. / ) 
On 5/14/75 Mr. Ron L. Jackson, Assistant Chief 
Inspector, Office of Security Investigations, USPS, adtl.sed 
Liaison Officer L.A. Crescioli that Mr. Paul Wallach, staff 
member of the SSC, has requested USPS to furnish the 
identities of all FBI mail covers placed with the USPS since 
1960. According to Jackson, Chief Postal Inspector William J. 
Cotter has informed Wallach that the FBI is the custodian 
of such detailed information and that the SSC should there­
fore make this request directly to the Bureau. Mr. Jackson 
requested that the FBI consider directing a communication 
to Chief Cotter, pointing out- that the Bureau does interpose 
an objection to the USPS complying with above request and 
that the SSC should proceed directly to the FBI in this 
regard. 
OBSERVATIONS: 
The request for the identities of all FBI mail covers 
I 
since 1960 in· effect provides the SSC with the identities 
of the subjects of FBI investigations, which includes ~ome 
• extremely sensitive cases. The intelligence community in 
attempting to work out gµidelines with the SSC as to 
sens·itive areas of inquiry have :indicated that specific 
t~rgets of ongoing intelligence operations should be subject 
to negotiation between the SSC staff and the appropriate 
agency. The Intelligence Division believes that we should 
·1 take a ~trong stand in this instance and attempt to negotiate 
an accommodation which would allow the SSC to carry out its 
mission but yet not compromise ongoing FB;r sensi t~"" ~~ ~~~
