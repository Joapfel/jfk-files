assassination of Castro, to my recollection, did not come to me 
for my attention. I cannot testify that down the line there mig t 
not have been some talk of this, but it never came to an action, 
a policy action judgment or a decision . 
MR. BELIN: By that you mean the decision to go ahead 
with the plan? 
MR. RUSK: That's right. 
MR. BELIN: There are some documents which the Commiss on 
g staff has seen which indicate that at a meeting at the State 
10 Department on August 10, 1962, which memoranda say that you were 
11 present, a meeting of a group known as the Specia1--·operations

Group, or the MONGOOSE group, that there was some discussion 
. 
about the development of a possible plan to assassinate Castro. 
Do you have any recollection of such a meeting or such

my appointment books at the LBJ library to determine whether, in 
fact, I was at that_meeting, and I will report back to you as 
soon as I can find that out. It is entirely possible. You know, 
my own personal practice was to do a lot of listening in such 
groups, but not to get into the decision phase until the Preside t 
and Secretary McNamara and I were ready to face a decision on th 
matter, because otherwise you would discourage the consideration 
of the widest range of possibilities or options that might be
