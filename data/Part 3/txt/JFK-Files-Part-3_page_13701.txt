in Cuba was the elimination of Castro and when ha expressed this 
conviction, not in '63 but in late '64, is when the Agency, an~ 
I presume tho u.s. Government at thatrtilH felt we can't 
continue that directly involved with AMLASII. 
Mr. Johnston. And the last sentence of thati 
I 
"This included the following -- 'Wo would not furnish 1 
I the silencer, nor scope, nor any money for direct assassination./ 
I 
Furthermore, we would not lift a finger to help the subject I 
escape from Cuha should he assassinate Castro.'" 
Has that the suhstance of the discus3ion ir:unediately 
after the assassination of President Kennedy? 
NU.ASH Case Officer. no. A year later in November of 
'64. 
Mr. Johnston, And you're saying that this does not 
describe the fall AMLASII meeting? 
NU.ASH Case Officer. It does not. It is a mixture of 
.,,hat happened over at least a two year :neriod. 
!Ir, Johnston. It perplexes me somewhat that your 
failure to ~cep written records would so warp later thinkers 
as to what was 9oing on. I mean take the March, 1965 document. 
As of :1arch, 1965 CIA is going on the assumption that you 
and Fitzgerald met NILA~ll in Paris, that you assured him that 
he would qet all the money he wanted and that your plans 
changed after the meeting because of the Kennedy assassination. i
