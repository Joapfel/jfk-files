Diego was teaching children to 
hate and kill police officers. 
They planned violent criminal 
acts and were making plans to 
take over the established govern­
ment at the first opportunity. 
If a leader of such a group could 
be discredited and removed, it 
would help to keep the group from 
becoming stronger, as they would 
have to select a new leader, and 
he would have to get the group 
reorganized. Denmon had many 
additional weaknesses which could 
be used in a counter-intelligence 
program. 
Do you recall a letter being sent 
to BPP Headquarters saying a 
leader of the BPP was cooperating 
with the police in Los Angeles? 
I do not recall such a letter. 
Do you recall some cards being 
sent to San Di·ego from Los Angeles 
saying, "Ron Karenga is impotent"? 
No, I do not recall such cards. 
Ron Karenga was a leader of US, 
Inc., not the BPP. 
Do you recall that cartoons were 
to be sent to BPP members to dis­
credit the leaders? 
I recall the cartoons but do not 
recall whether they were set to 
BPP members.
