MEMORANDUM 
SUBJECT: Electronic Surveillance Legislation 
1. Over a dozen bills have been introduced in Congress to date 
aimed at restricting electronic surveillance conducted on national security 
grounds. Although impelled by concern for the Fourth Amendment rights of 
American citizens, the major bills in this area ($. 743, H.R. 141, H.R. 214) 
are characterized by a ,heavy-handed approach wh~ch poses a serious threat 
to the exploitation of foreign SIGINT sources, both within the United States 
and oversea,s. (Signals intelligence subsumes communications intelligence 
and electronic. intelligence.) 
2. -The· 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (18 U. S . C. 
2510, et~-) established certain procedures which require the Government 
to obtain a court order issued on probable cause prior to conducting wire or 
oral communication interception in the investigation of certain offenses., In 
section 2511(3) of that Act, Congress specifically disavows any limitation on 
the constitutional powers of the President in -national security matters and 
recognizes that the President has inherent constitutional authority to engage 
in certain foreign h:1telligence activities: 
(n)othing contained in this chapter or in 
section 605 of the Communications Act of 
1934 shall limit the constitutional power of 
the President ... to obtain foreign intelli­
gence information deemed essential to the 
security of the United States, o:r to protect 
national security information against foreign 
i~telligence activities. (emphasis added) 
The emphasized language implicitly recognizes that foreign intelligence 
surveillances may be distinguished from national security surveillances 
aimed at the discovery and prosecution of criminal conspiracies ·and activity . 
. 3. In reliance on these Presidential powers and congressional 
recognition thereof, foreign intelligence signal and communication interceptions 
may be conducted within the United States without judicial ~arrant .
