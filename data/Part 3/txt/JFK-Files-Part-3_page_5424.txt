ANSWER: 
Why can't you tell us the nu!Tlber? 
Because we're going to make reports to our Congres­
sional groups and to the Department of Justice and, 
frankly, I can't tell ·you the number myself. We 
don't have any .... 
They did not entirely stop in 1966? There were 
some that did get, you say, a small number after 
1966? 
There may have been some after 1966 which were, 
of course, in the field of foreign counterintelli­
gence, and such that it would make a grave impact 
on our .... 
Before that, they were not with the field of foreign 
counterintelligence? 
Oh, yes, there were some in that field also. 
There were others that were not in the field of 
foreign counterintelligence before 1966? 
You recall that I said in the context of the time, 
it may well have been that prior to that time national 
security or counterintelligence or whatever terminology 
you might want to use could have included other areas. 
But, then you began to compartmentize various types 
of activities and then it became evident that the 
area of foreign counterintelligence national security 
certainly should be differentiated from domestic 
security. 
But, Mr. Kelley, what policy have you followed in 
the time that you have been Director? Is this type 
of activity, has it been permitted? Is it policy 
now to conduct this kind of activity? 
I have not had a single request to conduct such 
activity since I have been made Director. If ever 
anything of this type comes up, and I can't foresee 
this need, but, if it ever did come up and it became 
a matter of grave concern, a matter which is to be 
solved only through such activity, I would present 
it to the Attorney General and would be guided by 
his opinion as to such activity. Frankly, I have 
not had any such request since I have come aboard.
