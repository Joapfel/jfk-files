Re my memorandum to you dated 2-14-75. 
As indicated in referenced memorandum, the Bureau's 
program concerning destruction of files and records has been suspended 
unt11 we can determine whether it involves arty documents that might 
be of interest to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. 
We contacted William G. Miller,, Staff Director for the 
Committee, .and he asked that we withhold further destruction of files Ill 
until the Committee Counsel, who had not been appointed at that time, L/ 
had an opportunity to review the matter. Mr. F. A. O. Schwarz 3d, 
a New ¥-ark attorney, was recently n·amed the Committees ~hief Counsel. 
It is recommended that representatives of the Files and Commµnications 
Divisiqri•and the Legal Counsel Division meet with Mr. Schwarz and 
Mr. Mi.lier at the earliest opportunity to resolve this matter. 
-RECOMMENDA:.qtION: 
That representatives of the Files and Communications 
Division and the Legal Counsel Division meet with the Chief Counsel 
and Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities 
to determine whether the Bureau's destruction program can be reinstituted.
