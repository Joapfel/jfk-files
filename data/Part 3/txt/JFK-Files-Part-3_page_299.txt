INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT

Wirick: 
Seide:J_: 
They featured "cartoonsu showing the "pigs" (police) 
being killed, stabbed, et cetera. I believe I recall 
seeing some "cartoons" showing how the BPP ·would kill 
the "honkies" (white people). They were similar to 
the propaganda leaflets used by the Nazis against 
.American troops before an attack. The articles in th~ 
BPP newspaper were even more foul. 
Did the COINTELPRO promote dissen\ion between the BPP 
and the US Group (see Appendix page)? 
Not to my knowledge. As I recall there was never 
any need to. They were constantly at odds with each 
other and on a gang type basis were trying to eliminate 
each other. I believe Sylvester Bell, a San Diego BPP 
member was killed by an US Group member and John Savage, 
another local BPP member was killed by an US Group 
member. 
In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not 
recalled, were allegedly killed by US Group members. 
I believe this led to the popular saying in Southeast 
San Die80 section where most blacks live that the score 
(game) was, "US 4 - BPP O". 
What do you think of the merits of a proposal to 
spray shipments of the BPP newspaper with a noxious 
acid so that readers would be confronted with a vile 
odor when attempting to read the paper?
