CUBAN UNIT 
Our sustained pressure on CUban Intelligence 
Service (CuIS) operations in the U.S. resulted in the recall 
to Cuba of three very experienced CuIS officers in April, 1970. 
They had been serving as officials of the Cuban Mission to the 
United Nations (CMUN) and their withdrawal was in line with

Based on FBI information, a leading Puerto Rican 
terrorist in New York City (Car..J.,~~™~~9f!-~Z~~ was 
apprehended by the New York City Police Department on May 16, 
1970, while in the process of placing a bomb in an Armed Forces 
recruiting st~tion. 
After being confronted by us in early August, 1970, 
a very attractive and sexually permissive employee of the 
S~!lt~!?."3,-,P._ 1 Embassz, Washington, D. C., admitted her deep 
involvement wiin !he CuIS. She had furnished the Cubans data 
concerning American and foreign officials with whom she was in 
social contact. After becoming sexually involved with a State 
Department protocol officer in March, 1970, she was able to gain 
entree to diplomatic functions where she met ranking officials 
and employees of the U.S. and foreign governments. Our investi­
gation indicated she was unable to establish contact with her 
principal to furnish information concerning the dignitaries she 
met following her involvement with the protocol officer and she 
voluntarily returned home to S~yt,h..,~J,~~ shortly after our 
interview of her. Her name is Jennifer Enid Miles.

A San Juan, Office source was primarily responsible 
for developing information leading to the conviction on 8/26/70 
of four Socialist Workers Party (PSO) leaders in Puerto Rico. 
The information developed by our source enabled the Police of 
Puerto Rico to arrest a total of nine PSO members. The PSO has 
been active in the wave of bombings taking place in Puerto Rico 
and the arrests were for violations of the Puerto Rican Explosives 
Law.
