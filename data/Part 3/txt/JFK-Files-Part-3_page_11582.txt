ment of Weatherman sympathizers. Approval has been obtained 
for this Unit to supervise this Pine Street case in view 
of its intimate connection with the overall Weatherman 
investigation. Approval has also been obtained for this Unit 
to supervise a New Left - Violence case in Tucson, Arizona, 
which involves Unlawful Possession or Receipt of Firearms 
(UPRF) charges. This Tucson case concerns five New Left 
extremists, three of whom have now been indicted by a Federal 
Grand Jury. Two of these have been apprehended and the 
third is a fugitive. Another subject in this case has been 
sentenced to jail for contempt of court for refusing to 
testtfy before the Grand Jury. 
An example of the.salutary effect of vigorous 
investigatio~ and prosecution of New Left extremists is seen 
in the Seattle area. There, a radical group called the 
Seattle Liberation Front (SLF), which was composed of 
former Weatherman members, had fomented continuing violence. 
Then SLF leaders were tried in Federal court on anti-riot 
cha=ges. This tria] ended jn a mistrial but the SLF leaders 
were cited for contempt of court. Since that mistrial in 
Decem.ber, 1970, SLF has been disbanded and most SLF members 
have left Seattle. There has been a noticeable reduction 
in New Left violence in Seattle. 
In the several cases referred to above, it is noted 
that in each instance information crucial to the prosecution 
of New Left extremists was provided by New Left informants. 
In recent months significant accomplishments were 
made in a case involving two extremists in Ohio through the 
use of a tesur installation. These two extremists were
