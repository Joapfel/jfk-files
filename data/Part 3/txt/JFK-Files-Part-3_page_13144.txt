Cuban exiles were saying that the US was providing a steady 
flow of aid to the MRR which _was led by Manuel Artime Buesa. Some 
exiles claimed that the MRR attack on Puerto Pilon in May,, 1964, was 
launched from the Dominican Republic. There was no evidence that 
Artime was receiving support from the Venezuelan Government. His 
failure to establish personal contact with the Venezuelan Administra­
tion during his 5/22-27/64 visit to Caracas, had provoked criticism 
in government circles. Some disillusionment with the MRR was said 
to be caused by Artime's failure to establish himself as t!jjd~s- -
puted leader of the militant exile forces. (CIA, 7/16/64) _ (!-)
