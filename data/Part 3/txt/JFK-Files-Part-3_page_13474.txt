2263: 
Headquarters. I came back out of the Army in 1947 and became 
an Assistant Secretary of tI:ie Army in 1949~- .and became Under 
·' 
Secretary of the Army and then-Secretary of the Army, which 
post I held until some time before the Korean War broke auto 
I then became a Special Assistant for President 
Truman for the purpose of writing a report on foreign economic 
policy which was published in November, I guess, of that year. 
After the election, in 1951, I came back to Washington at 
President Truman's request.to organize an organization which 
was somewhat abortive, known as the Psychological Strategy, 
·Board, but which put me in very close contact, in contact, 
with tho intelligence matters, obviously. 
\ 
MR. BELIN: Where physically did that Board meet? 
MR. GRAY: That Board physically met in 712 Jackson 
Placea As a matter of fact, that is where it was organized 
and,created. 
MR. BELIN: Pardon me. Go ahead. 
When you a~d I met this morning at 712 Jacksor. Place 
at our Headquarters, it was like going home to you in a sense, 
wasn't it? 
MR. GRAY: It was, and that's not the end of it, as 
you will see in a moment . 
. In 1953 I was a member of the so-called Jackso~ 
Committee, and I think it was called the President's Committee 
on International Information Activities headed up by William
