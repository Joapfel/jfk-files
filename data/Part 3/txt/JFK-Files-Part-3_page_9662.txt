On 6/4/75, M.!:!,...1>-•n:otp_y_ S!<_glm_an, former Executive !~ 
Assist,ant,.to,, .Mr. Clyde Tolson, was interviewed by Mr. Mark H.:a 
Gittenstein and Miss Mary Deoreo of the Senate Select Committee 
Staff. Mrs. Skillman was escorted to the interview by former , . ., 
Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr who remained outside 
the interview room during the interview. Prior to the interview, 
Mrs. Skillman was met by SAL. F. Schwartz at which time she nl1' 
advised that she had been advised by Mr. John Hotis, Office i, .f 
of Legal Counsel, that the interview was to be concerning \9: 
Mr. Hoover's Official and Confidential (OC) files and that it 
questions came up during the interview on other matters ·wb,f'eh 
might impinge on sensitive sources and methods, current Bµreau 
investigations, etc., she was free to request an interruption 
of the interview to consult with Mr. Schwartz. • 
The interview of Mrs. Skillman commenced at 2:30 p.m., 
and it was terminated at approximately 4:30 p.m. On only one 
occasion toward the end of the interview, Mrs. Skillman• a~ked 
to consult with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz. She advised that 
the interviewers had asked her concerning her knowledge of 
what might have been in certain cartons which were reportedly 
stored in the recreation room area of the late Director's 
residence. Mrs. Skillman stated that she thought these cartons 
contained many of the gifts and mementos that had been collected 
by Mr. Hoover over a period of years. After consulting with 
Mr. Mohr, she realized that she knew this only from comments 
that had been made to her by Mr. Mohr and had no firsthand 
knowledge of the contents of the cartqns. On Mr. Mohr's advice, 
she advised the interviewers that she had no firsthand 
knowledge of what was in the cartons but that she knew that 
Mr. Mohr was aware of what was in tb,em because he was present 
when the appraisers of Mr. 'rolson·•s estate inventoried the 
l
entire house including these cartons. At the conclusion of 
the interview, Mr. Gittenstein co~mJ!ented to Mr. Mohr that h.e 
might have further questions to ask him concerning the contents 
of the cartons but would probably handle thit/b7, a telephone ca'111 
to Mr. Mohr. , h 1 ✓I &,;•:f;ts;:/3,_ ALL nrFORM:~5'rmr CONTAINED-.;\, ,., ~-. . er-=- ~ .. - r,.,,., • -·•, ~ •
