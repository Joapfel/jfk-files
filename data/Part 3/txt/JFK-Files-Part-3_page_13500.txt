he carried in his briefcase for three weeks a cable on an 
agent report from Cuba ·which turned.out to be an accurate 
description of these missiles, and he was then personally 
briefing the President, and he said I was never sure enough. 
Th~re were so many other reports, ·and we knew they were false, 
that the weight of my gut feeling fell on the side of new.missil s. 
Well, this is a subjective judgment which was dictated in part 
by what peopl~ wanted to hear. 
Now, the Chairman of this Commission will remember in 
recent years the Board had been able to get out of the rtational 
intelligence estimates of offensive military capabilities of 
12 the Soviet Union, language to the effect that by no stretch 
13 of the imagination, and I am paraphrasing, can the Soviet Union 
14 be a threat in this area for ten years, this type of statement. 
15 They used to have a sta~ement that there is no way to conclude 
16 that the Soviets would ever"take action against an American 
17 reconnaissance satellite. Well, we got that changed. These 
18 are subjective. 
19 When the missiles, it was a 'question of MIRVing., 
20 the missiles, the Agency_was about the last place in the governm nt 
\ 21 to believe that the Soviets were MIRVing missiles, and for·some 
22 reason they didn't want to find missiles being MIRVedo So 
23 somebody on behalf of the President has got to watch this 
24 business of subjactive judgraents, passed forward as unfinished 
25 intelligence.
