exercises, and this is what hangs some of us up. 
Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I 
imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, eithe 
asking you about the qualifiqations of some other Senator 
being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter­
viewed concerning some friend·who is applying for a job. 
Were you embarrassed to have that in the files 9f the 
FBI? 
Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, tha 
this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a name in our 
files has an.onerous impression, a chilling effect. I agree. 
It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our 
files, but if they recognize that we interviewed you because 
i4 of c<;msidering· a man for the Supreme Court of. the United 
15 States, and that isn.' t distorted or improperly used, I don '·t 
16 • see.where any harm is served ·by having that in our files.
