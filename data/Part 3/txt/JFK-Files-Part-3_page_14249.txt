In the audio field, Hr .. M9Cdn~ said 'that the USIB will have so~e 
reccnnmendations to make. 
As for inform.at iori. processing, the DC I ref erred to the SC IPS a tudy wh ic'h 
was recen~ly made.· .i.n tho USIB •.. He consider.C!d this. study to be a good approach, 
although it is difficult to apply a \.iniform· program in all •intelligence agencies, 
e.g., the State Department requires a codirig ~ystem different from.that which 
might be used as a ·cantral system in the intelligence community. So, Mr. McCone 
is urgi~g that the SCIPS study be 1.1sed by each.agency as a model approach to 
the problem. • • 
With reference to contacts with the President, Mr. McCone said ·that the 
CIA sends a daily check 1 is t to t,he President. b\/t he does not nee es s a r ily. wish 
to read it every day. CIA also sends over special inte l t igence it ems and a 
weekly check list ~hich General Clifto~ hands to the President fo~· reading, 
Mr. McCone said that he see~ the Pre~ident freque11tly including occasions when 
others are present, e.g., a't conferences on South Vietnam. Some items the DCI 
take~ to the President directly, when they Jre nf such critical or s~nsitiv~ •• 
nature that Mr, McCone doea not want to handl~ them through routine chanr.els. 
The OCI said that, he pers\opally would pref~r oppoi·tunit ies f o·c inte 11 igence 
briefinga of the President -with the Secret:artes· .of State and Defense present, 
in order that these off ic":f:a·ls- could expre5.s:~.,~ny· differing views to the President 
(for e?(ample, it 'is the ~ecretary of Defense i.s ·view that U-2 overf:.ight:G 0f· Cuba 
ar~ not require~, whereas Mr. McCone says he feels that there is a need for th~m). 
Wit_h regard to the situation in South Vietnam, Hr. McCone said that this 
had been discussed at the Honolulu meeting 'from which he had just returned . 
. Ambassador Lodge an•:f:General Westmoreland. reportet;l a d2terioration of the 
situation. For one thing General Khahnhas not ga:Lned control of tl)e people 
as he claimed he would. Mr. McCone said that he d:Lffered • from others at the 
Honolulu meeting who are of ~he opinion that the situation -in South Vietnam 
has "bottomed 01.1t". To the contrary, Mr. McCo.ne bHlieves that the situation IIlliY 
.we 11 de tcr iorate further and planning should be made on that· bas is. . He recalled 
Ambassador Lodge's comment that South Vietnam is' not a country but a place 'Whe.re 
a lot of di~cordant people live. • ' 
As for Laos, Mr •. McCone noted 
after over-running the western part 
that the Pathet Lao forces can·take 
the aid of the·North Vietnamese. 
th'at the·Pathet Lao had stopped its advance 
of the Plain de.Jarres. Mr. McCone believes 
6ver.the country if it wants to, ~ithout '-- ,' 
In Mr. McCone's opinion, a token air ·strik.e on North Vietnam would probably 
not produce a· military reaction from'·e:tth~r Communist China Oi" ?forth,'Vietnarri.' 
If a strike were me.de by South Vietname·se pilots accompanied by U. S. "instructor.c; 11 
(project FARM GATE) more damage would be done and. more react ion wou
1
ld result. 
An A-bomb attack would probably produce a strong Chicom reaction. In any event~· 
the u. ·s. will have to guarantee. to Khahn that we will 'bail him out.: as necessary.
