This memorandum recommends that we provide at 
Mr. Colby's request two lists: (1) information which the 
FBI feels under no circumstances could be discussed with 
the Select Committee of the Senate (SCS) and (2) items of 
information which could be discussed with the SCS under 
controlled conditions.

On the afternoon of 2/1/75, Mr. John Clarke, in 
his role as Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for 
Congressional Inquiry, telephonically advised the Bureau's 
representative on this Group that a meeting was held at 
the White House on the morning of 2/1/75. Participants were 
the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelli­
gence and Dr. Henry Kissinger in his role as advisor to the 
President on national security affairs. Dr. Kissinger 
requested Mr. Colby to prepare two lists for the President's 
consideration. The purpose of these lis.ts was to provide 
the President with information necessary for him to make a 
judgment as to whether certain information should be with­
held from the SCS on the basis of executive privilege. 
As a result of the White House meeting, Mr. Clarke 
requested the Bureau prepare by the close of business, 2/3/75, 
two lists: (1) that information proprietary to the FBI which 
under no circumstances could be discussed with the SCS and as 
a result would require the denial of such presentation by virtue 
of executive privilege and (2) a list of information proprietary 
to the FBI which could be discussed with the SCS under controlled 
conditions (presumably this means discussed in Executive Session 
limited to members of the SCS). R . _ 1 I I/, . _.
