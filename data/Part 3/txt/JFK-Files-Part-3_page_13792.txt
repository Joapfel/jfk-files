l. The World Peace Council (WPC).was expected to pay for the 
expenses of the Continental Congress in Support of Cuba,. 
which is to be held in Rio de Janeiro from 28 to 30 March 1963, 
according to comments made by General Luiz Gonzaga Leite, 
president of the Society of Friends of Cuba (SAC), at a 
meeting of the SAC on 21 January 1963. 
2. As of 21 ,January the SAC had not received any replies from 
the invitations sent to the African nations to participate 
in the congress. It was announced at the meeting that Valerio 
Konder, acting president of the Brazilian Pro-Peace Movement 
and a m2:mber of the SAC,was planning to go to Tanganyika to 
attend t~e Third Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference 
in early February and would take a copy of the convocation 
for the congress ~1th him. 
3. Plans were made for painting slogans concerning the congress 
4. 
all over the city and for placing large signboards along some 
of the main parkways. The possibility was' discussed of 
persuading a well-known painter, such as Emiliano di Cavalcanti, 
to paint a picture for the congres~ which would be raffled 
off for the benefit of the congress. 
At a meeting of the SAC on 15 January a series of.pro-Cuba 
meetings, which would be held before the congress, was 
planned. The possibility of inviting certain Brazilian 
artists to perform at the meetings in order to attract a 
l0rge crowd was discussed. The SAC was also trying to obtain 
the signature of Dias Gomes, the theatrical producer, on the 
convocation of the congress. Gomes planned to go on 19 January 
to Cuba, where he was to direct a play.
