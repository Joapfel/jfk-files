an operation of that size with military aspects involved, it 
seemed to ·me that compartmentation was a weakness in the 
preparation of carrying out·of the operation, not to mention the 
changing decisions that took place along the line as the

MR. BISSELL: Well, I ce~tainly agree with you, 
General Lemnitzer, in the change in decisions, and I agree 
with you, I probably would agree with you if you and I discuss 
specit'ic examples of the compartmentation. I will say, however, 
that some of the compartmentation I think to this day was

13 exile members of the political parties, to visit the brigades

16 the politicians were totally insecure, and at odds with one
