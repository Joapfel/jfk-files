,~ Project Senstudy 75, established within theu J~ 
Intelligence Division, for the purpose of developing a ~ vJfJV • 
capability of implementing requests received from the ~ ~;: ·' 
Select Committe~ of the Congress., Bureau file 62-1163'95. 1. 1rft'(; 
has been openect·:for this Project. ~kl~ 
Because of the unusual factors relating to this 
entire Project, such as the sensitive nature of much of the 
material involved, urgency for handling, necessity for having f 
the file very readily available to the working staff at all \i 
times, and similar other reasons, it is essential that the \ 
file be maintained in the work area of the Project which, C-, 
of the file in the designated room rather than in the usual ,I_ ~ 
effective 4/14/75, will be in room 4063, JEH. The purpose of J \ 
this memorandum, therefore, is to have Files and Communications ,. 
Division take necessary steps to arrange for the maintenanc~~

(?~o-r h-_~ Select Committees and we anticipate much more. This involves 
I -~tih''\i;5j many newspaper stories. It is, therefore, believed very 
~i ./ desirable that a Sub A file to the main 'file be opened as 
~ ~t~~ the standardized repository for newspaper articless As a 
iV'1~ ~~ff/1. first step, it will be necessary t~at a few articles already
