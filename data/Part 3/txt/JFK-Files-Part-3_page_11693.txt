COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROORAM - BLACK EXTREMISTS 
Bufile 100-448006 
Counterintelligence action regarding black extremists 
was initiated 8/25/67 and was last justified 5/14/70. This 
program was a supplement to our black extremist investigative 
activities and involved a variety of sensitive intelligence 
techniques which were afforded close supervision at the Seat 
of Government. No action could be instituted under this 
program without prior Bureau authorization. 
To afford additional security to our sensitive 
techniques and operations,·. all counterintelligence programs, 
including this program, were discontinued and the field was 
so advised by airtel 4/28/71. 
Although this program was discontinued, the field 
was advised if exceptional instances arose wherein it was 
c9nsidered counterintelligence action is warranted, that 
recommendations should be submitted to the Bureau under the 
specific case caption involved. These recommendations will 
then be considered on an indiv~dual basis. The field was 
also reminded that prior Bureau authority is required before 
initiating any activity of a counterintelligence nature. 
,Significant results since last inspection as a 
result of this program are set forth under "Accomplishments 4E" 
elsewhere in this report.
