control you exercised over this kind of informan.t in this kind 
of an .. o:i;-gani.zation and to what ·extent an effort is ·made to 
prevent these- inf6rmants.. • .from engaging in the kind of thing 
that you are ·supposedly tryin~ to prevent. 
Mr. Adams. A good example of this was Mr. Rowe, who becam 
active in ah action group, and we told him to get··out or 
we would no longer use him as an informant, in spite of the 
information he had furnished .in the •past. 
We have had cases, Senator, where we have had 
$enator Huddleston. But you also told him to participate 
in violent activities . 
Mr. Adams. We did not tell him to participate in violent 
activities. 
Senator Huddleston. That's what he said .. 
Mr. Adams. I know that's what he said. But.that's what 
lawsuits are.all about, is that there. are.two sides to the 
issue, and our agents.handling. this have.advised.us, and I 
believe have advised.your. staff, that at no time did they 
advise him to engage. in violence .. 
Senator.Huddleston. Just to. do what was necessary to 
get the information, ~ believe maybe might have been his 
instructions. 
Mr. Adams. I don't think they made any such statement 
to him"along that line, and·we ·have informants,· we have 
info.rrnants who have gotten involved in the violation of the law
