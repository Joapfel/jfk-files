We disseminated every single item which he reported to us. 
To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to 
the crime. 
Not necessarily knew. 
Your informant told you that, hadn't he? 
The informant is on one level. We have other informants 
and we have other information. 
You were aware that he had worked with certain members of 
the Birmingham Police in order ... 
That's right. He furnished many other instances also. 
So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that 
incident by telling the people who were already a part of it. 
We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the 
time and finally the sitµation was corrected when the Department 
agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.S. 
Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions . 
... This brings up the point as to what kind of control 
you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this 
kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to 
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing 
that you were supposedly trying to prevent. 
A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in 
an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer 
using him as an informant in ·spite of the information he had 
furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had 
But you also told him to participate in violent activities
