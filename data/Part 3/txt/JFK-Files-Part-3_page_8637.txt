"Revolutionary Suicide" 
On August 7, 1970, Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, the Deputy District 
Attorney, and three other persons were tied together with piano wire and dragged 
from a San Rafael, California, courtroom and taken as hostages by three armed 
Negro convicts, one of whom was standing trial for stabbing a San Quentin prison 
guard. The escapees were assisted by the defendant's 17-year-old brother who 
supplied them with weapons for the escapade. Judge Haley, who had a sawed-off 
shotgun taped to his neck, and the other hostages were forced into a waiting van. 
When the authorities tried to stop the kidnappers, the judge was brutally murdered; 
the Deputy District Attorney was injured seriously; and another hostage was 
slightly wounded. Three Negroes were slain and one was wounded. 
Immediately thereafter, Huey Newton declared the killing of Judge Haley as 
being of "historical" importance to the Black Panther Party. This declaration was 
based on the Panther belief that all black prisoners, regardless of their crimes, are 
political prisoners and should be released.
