As to the ava1lablllty of an· F· BX rer,reaentative during 
Committee staff interviews of present or former FBl employees 
concerning alleged t~buses, 0 1 have determined that such no longer 
'Will be generally afforded. 'the wbjeet n'latters requirhlg eop\lltation 
with such witnesses are eijsenttally four: (1) information which identifies 
or n-Ay identify Fm confidential soorces; (2) tnformatton which may 
adversely effect on-going FEI investigations; (3) information concerning 
$eDS1tive methoos and techniques; and (4) lntormatlon ol.>talned. from 
third agencies, tncludll'lg foreign intelligence agencies. Vvltnesses may 
be cautioned prior to inteniew coneernhlg such problem areas and 
refrain from fun,tshlng the informatlon pending consultation with FBI 
Headquarters. 1b1s modification is effective immediately-. 
I hope that you 'Will ~mg tbts· matter to the attention of 
yoo:t staff and that in so doing you also will revJew the .standards of 
objectivity and tmparttallty being followed in theil" interviews to assure
