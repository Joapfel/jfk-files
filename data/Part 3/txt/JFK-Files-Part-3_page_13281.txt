Memorandum for 'the Honorable Lee Rankin 
Front . A. W. · Dulles 
• 
I ; 
( 
, 
X read with greae interest the papers attached 
to the agenda for the Commission's meeting February 24, 
1964. In J . .Edgar Hocver's letter to you of February 10, 
1964, on page 2, last paragraph, there is reference to 
Mr. Robert Stcrey'a stateµtent ,t:o Mr. ".·lade that when he, 
Storey, was with the War Crimes Commiosion in Germany after 
World ~iar II, he ascertained.that "the Central Intelligence 
Agency had informants that no one knew about, except the 
Central Intelligence Agency agent, and that the informant 
might have been an informant". \ 
' . '\ 
While this statement is not·very clear, I would 
point out that the Central Intelligence Agency was not 
organized.until late 1947 under the National Security 
• J\ct of that year and tl:at t}:le Agency }Ir. Storey is presum­
ably referring to, if he:did make the statement. must be 
the Office of Strategic Services, which was dissolved in 
( 
late 1945. Of course4 curing the period of existence of • • 
the OSS, Lee Harvey Oswald w~s an inf.ant. 
With respect to J. Edgar Hoover's letters to you 
.of February 11 and 13, 1964, I suggest that it may be 
desirable to .try to clear up the confusion as to the existence 
~~• • r 
of the "law enforcement of£ic~r in Dallas .. who allegedly· -
·claimed that L. H. Oswald had been contacted by the FBI 
to become an informant. ·As I read the record available to 
me! there seems to be some conflict in the testimony of 
newsmen Hudkins and G?lden. _Very possibly this has ar~sen 
from the three contacts the FBI had with Oswald ~n JU.ne 26, 
and August 10 and 16, 196'2.· I dcS not find in the affidavits 
any indication of the p~ose of either the June 26 or 
August 16 visits. The August 10 visit apparently related 
~o the New orleans Fair Play for CUba incident. Have·we 
memoranda on these visits to Lee,Barvey OSWald?
