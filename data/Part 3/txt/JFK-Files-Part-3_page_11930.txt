In October, 1970, the Internal Security Division 
of the Department informed us that the Interdepartmental 
Committee on Internal Security wa.s concerned with the 
espionage and intelligence activities of Soviets employed 
at the United Nations Secretariat (UNSEC). We were requested 
to prepare a paper concerning such activities. The paper 
was furnished to the Department and to State during November, 
1970. We have now been informed that based on our 
information u. s. Ambassador Phillips at the United Nations 
is considering placing certain restrictions in effect 
concerning the travel of Soviet nationals assigned to 
UNSEC. Should this take place, our efforts in this matter 
could definitely lead to more effective and efficient 
coverage of these Soviet intelligence personnel by the 
Bureau~
