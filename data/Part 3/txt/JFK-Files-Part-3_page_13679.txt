Mr. Johnston. No discussion betweon you and Fit~gerald 
at all about any connection? 
NU.A.SIi Case Officer, No, not•·that I can recall. 
Mr. Johnston, When you say not that you can recall, are 
you saying that' it.•.s possible but you ~on •t recall it, or arc 
you certain, fairly certain to the best of your.recollection? 
N1LASH Case Officer, I'm fairly certain to the best 
of my knowledge that there was.no connection between the hMLl\Sll 
in other words, that we discussed it, we discussed the Kennedy 
assassination, I'm sure we did. I mean who wasn't discussing 
the Kennedy assassination at that time. '!!hat we tied the 
Kennedy assassin~tion in with AMLI\S11, I don't recall any kin~ 
of conversation of that nature, 
Mr. Johnston. On November 23rd and tlovember 24th and 
November 25th? 
AMLJ\SH Case Officer. Right. 
Mr. Johnston.. All right. Let me point you to one of 
the documents we wanted to ask you about and it is a contact 
report dated 25 November, ancl let ma just show that to you. 
Is that a document -- lat me state for the record w:111~ 
it is. 
It's the original, apparently copy, of the tlovcmber 2:ith 
contact report of the llovember 22nd meeting. 
Did you prepare that contact report?
