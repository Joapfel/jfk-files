these cases include the bulk of our double agent operations. 
As of December 1, 1970, there were 1.i. act:i~e double agents in the 
Soviet field. This is the largest number ~f double agents we 
have ever achieved. At the time of the l:ast inspection as of 
April 1, 1970, there were Ai active doubl·e agents. The current 
number of 74 is compared most favorably w.i~h. the number of actual 
double agents three years ago (12/1/67), •en there were ...il., active 
double agents. At that time there were JJS case Agents handling 
Soviet matters. At the time of the last llspection, there were 
16 case Agents in the Soviet field, and the current load is being 
carried by less than 14 case Agents. Th~ee of the 14 are assigned 
part time to the handling of Soviet-bloc :~ters. 
With the reorganization of the D1~ision in December, 1970, 
the volume and work load for the Supervisms in the Espionage 
Section were materially increased. Four A;gent Supervisors who 
't'!e~e ·::eor!.nA'.':"1.y ~~~:i.gneo to th~ Sino-tSatell:ii.it,e Section were 
transferred to the Espionage Section and ~ought with them in 
excess of 2 1 000 cases. The only possible W:ay that this volume 
could be handled was by redistributing the work within the 
Coordination Unit and the Special Cases Umte The volume of 
investigations in these Units is extremely heavy considering the 
number of special projects and special opm!'ations which are 
normally assigned in the Units. 
In the Satellite Unit handling Pmlish, Romanian, 
Czechoslovakian, and Yugoslav investigatiwe-, matters, we currently 
have 1,293 active cases divided among four Special Agents. 
In our Soviet-bloc counterintelligence wou·, we were as of 
December 1, 1970 1 operating_§.i_active douwe agents. This should 
be compared with the figure at the time o~ our last inspection, 
April., 1, 1970, when there were §.!.. active d~uble agents.
