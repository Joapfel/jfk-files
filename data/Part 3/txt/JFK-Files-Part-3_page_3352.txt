tiThe Bureau will not tolerate any oxperimento or participation 
on the part of its personnel in the utilization of tlle so called truth 
scrums or other chemicals clle3cd to ll~ve n .similo.r cl'fcct. -~-­
consequently t in tho evei,t any Eurrou agent Viola.tea theco instructions,

Thero 't'laS nothing found in Bureau files that ~ould indicate that we 
have reeeived any doeun1t.u"1ts from CIA concerning their drug re::;earch 
proera,ms. Tho lilc::; do reflect that we were a'\".n:u+o that CIA ua.z conductlng 
re3oarcll with lysc:rgic :ttcid diethylrunide (LSD) and that British Intd.ligenco 
had succossfu.J.ly utilized LSD on cevcral RUssfun cspiona.ge a~en.ts. Tho 
inrorm.ntion conccrnin~ CIA and Br-ltish activities io set out for t.lte benefit 
of tho Director only and .eo,nnot bo rclen.ced outoidc the Bureau.

Ga-sea). Pertinent corialo ma,y also be found in 80-80'1 and 100-3430'17 as
