As.a follow-up to our briefing of Assi$tant Director 
Wannall or:i No:vemb_er 6 concerning our proposed format and 
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's 
use of intelligence informants ·and sources, we would like 
to make the following requests. 
As discussed 'in our ·meeting with Mr .. Wannall, we in-
. vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence 
informant and·source program that could be inserted in 
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at 
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to 
present to the $elect Committee a complete descr;i.ption 
-~· of· its program and to discuss the iss_ues of particular 
•• . • ··interest to the Committee members. These include, for 
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program, 
including an assessment of the program 
1 
s ·cost and effective­
·ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the 
·intelligence inform~nt program and the Bureau's _criminal 
informant activity; 2) the Griteria that determine when 
. an informant may be us-ed in an organization or group; and 
.. • 3) the .program 
I
s cormnand and- control system, including the 
:_limits that are placed on the activities of informants 
and the type of information an informant or source is per­
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau. 
In addition, the memorandum would discuss.~possible leg­
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition 
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re­
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this 
memorandum in advahce of the hearing and to discuss it 
w~t~ .FBI_representatives·during thei~ testimony at tije ub 1 11.c hearin~, we request tha~ the memor~?-dum b~ submi ·11 ~ 
by November 24. _ • • • . / . -// . /}~ I nt
