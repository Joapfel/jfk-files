Mr. Seidel then inquired a~ to whether or not it 
was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under 
present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure. 
He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an 
effective intelligence operation under present circumstances 
and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be 
helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its 
investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel 
inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific 
legislation which might completely separate criminal and 
:htelligence operations so one would not taint the other,,.
