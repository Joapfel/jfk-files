• • L. ALTERNATIVES L 
In addition to the recommended plan set for~h i~· 
preceeding sections, there are several alternative courses 
of action we might take: 
1. We could tal~e the position, and seek ways to implement 
it, that the entire field of foreign intelligence collection 
in the U. s., both overt and covert, should be handled by 
tho :FB:C. Such an across-·tho-boai:·~ approacl1 would exc1ude 
CIA and other U. S~ agencies from foreign intelligence 
collection in this country and would place exclusive 
responsibility and jurisdiction in this :field on the FBI. 
As indicated in Section I, this would require a revamping 
of. existing legislation and directives and would necessita-'c;e 
drastic changes in the Bureau~s operations, including major 
increases:·. in personnel and costs and a substantial expansion 
in our recruitment • and training programs, and o-'cher reorganiza­
tion. We do 11.o·t feel this approach is warranted nor do. :we 
believe it would be a practical and sound one. • ....... : .. •. 
2. We cou.ld recommend that· CIA continue to be 
responsible for overt collection of foreign intelligence in 
this country but that the FBI exclusively handle covert • 
·f0:i:0i 6:;.·.,_ intcl:.i;;~r:.~c c~:!..:!..e~tion.. This '½8.S SP.Vera"! obvious 
drawbacks. First, we would be assuming a wide range of 
heavy and fixed respons:..bilities which in many cases would 
be completely divorced fron the Bureauvs internal security 
and counterintelligence interests. Second, we would become 
to a large extent a service group for other U.S. agencies 
and departments (including CIA, Statej the military and othe~s) 
,in the handling of a host of foreign intelligence req_uirements 
levied by other agencies. This would involve a considerable 
commitment of manpower, communication costs, etc. on the part 
of the Bureau. In addition~ such an approach would necessitate 
significant changes in our recruitment and training procedures 
and would also place on our shoulders a definite accountability 
-in connection with any failures in U.S. intelligence foreign 
·collection. It is not~ elieved that this approach is.as sound 
or desirable as our recommended plan of action: namely,· that 
we expand our foreign intelligence collection efforts but on
