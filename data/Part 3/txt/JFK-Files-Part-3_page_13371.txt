OLSEN: All right, we are beginning belt No. 7. Frank, did you 
state to Andrew St. George that if you had to do any killing that you would 
use your bare hands and a piece of wire. 
STURGIS: That's h.ogwash. I never stated that. I may have stated in 
· talking with. Andrew about my activities in the Marine Corps and Edson ts . 
Raiders, which was the first raider battallion, that part of my training 
was for instance sneaking up on victims using the stiletto which we were 
equipped with to operate behind enemy lines, to go ashore in rubber boats, 
and so forth.. l did receive that training to how to kill people with. 
Piano wire with- this stiletto, sniper, telescopes, etc. -- that training 
r did receive -in the South Pacific. 
OLSEN: This was fairly common training received by people in the 
military· services,or certain branches of the military services,during 
World War fl? 
STURGIS: I would say certain units in certain--for instancef£he 
Marine Corps and the Army we had certain units that did this type of work; 
not everyone received th.is type of training. 
OLSEN: All right, Frank. I think we are about near the end of this 
interview. But I did want to follow up on one other item. You said that you 
had had a telephone conversation, l believe, with Seymour Hersh about certain 
inaccuracies that were appearing in the press on articles he had written. 
STURGIS·: Yes, sir. 
OLSEN: Did he relate to you that he had received this information 
from Andrew St. George?
