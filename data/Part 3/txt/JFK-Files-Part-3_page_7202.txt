It is important that our intelligence activities be 
viewed in proper perspective and that the few instances of 
failure or error that may have occurred i~ the past be 
understood in context. 
We will welcome clear statements of the authority and 
mission assigned to American intelligence. I believe the 
public, including thqse engaged in the intellig.ence profession, 
are entitled to and are prepared to accept clarifications 
and new definitions. The Conqress and the American people 
do not expect intelligence to be carried on in the shadows 
of euphemism and ambiguity. Nor can we operate effectively 
without more precise provisions in the law to protect our 
?ecrets. I believe our nation is ready to accept the nec­
essity of reasonable secrecy in our intelligence operations 
in the same way it accepts the need for secrecy in diplomatic 
negotiations, in development of war plans, or in protecting 
newspaper sources. ·,
