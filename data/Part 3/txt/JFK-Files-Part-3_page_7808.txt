This memorandum reports the resu ts of a t..§1.e=. 
phonic conversation with former Special Ag~tr~.-~SA) _Charles D.

General with enclosures be sent. ~ , 
On the morning of 5/23/75 the Department of Justice ~ 
advised Assistant Director Mintz that former SA Brennan has or was \J 
to be interviewed by Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee • ~ 
(SSC). On that same date I telephonically contacted Mr. Brennan \ r} 
to advise him that the Bureau had been alerted to the fact he was '-
going to be interviewed by the SSC Staff and should he desire, a ~ 
representative of the Bureau could be available during the intervie~ 
for consultation. It was made clear to Brennan that the r@le of~ 
Bureau representative would be to insure that he couilld consult ~th 
the representative at any time during the interview should the ~f f 
of inquiry reveal; the identity of sensitive FBI sources, metho~ \J 
or sensitive investigative techniques; information derived from~ ~ 
third agencies or friendly foreign.intelligence services; or any~

information which Brennan felt could adversely affect sensitive 
ongoing FBI investigations. ij 
&! 
Brennan then changed the conversation to personal chit8 
chat. At what appeared to be the conclusion of the conversation§ 
Cregar asked Brennan if he had peen contacted by the SSC Staff. o 
Brennan advised that he had received a telephone call earlier in tlla.e 
week inviting him to an interview in Washington, D. C., and in fact 
was interviewed on 5/22 by SSC Staff Members Mark Gitenstein and 
two others whose names Brennan did not get. 
Brennan showed some concern over the fact that the Staff 
\
had invited him to be interviewed earlier in the week but only 
notified the Department subsequent to his interview. (At the 
outset of the conversation with Brennan, I had advised him that 
the SSC had informed the Departme~f which in turn informed tthe
