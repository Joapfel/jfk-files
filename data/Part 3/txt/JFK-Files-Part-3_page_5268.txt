impresiion that the lead at Wainut Creek to identify a 
telephone subscriber had been covered and reported at 
the time the case was RUC'd on 10/15/70. The writer did 
not have the file available as the RUC communication was 
s~bmitted from the Santa Rosa Residence Agency and was 
therefore unable to make a thorough review of the file.

·in the future.
