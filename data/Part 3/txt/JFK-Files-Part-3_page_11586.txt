Each of the more than 1500 brigade members has 
been the subject of a security investigation which includes 
the identification and obtaining of background data as 
well as a personal interview with each brigade member. 
These investigations are being made to determine the 
immediate danger presented by these young revolutionaries 
and also to ascertain the long-range role they will take 
in the revolutionary movement in the U.S. Upon comple­
tion of the investigation and the interview of each of 
these individuals, the field must recommend either the 
inclusion or noninclusion of the subject in the Security 
Index. In addition the field must continue to report 
every 90 days for a period of one year on the activities 
and whereabouts of each brigade member. 
The intelligence responsibilities of the Bureau 
in reg2!'d to t!le VB h?vr:> ½ee.u- .handled thro.ngh the placing 
of Bureau informants in the ranks of the various contingents. 
Accurate on-the-scene reports concerning the training and 
activities of these groups in Cuba have been furnished to 
the intelligence community and factual responses have been 
made .to congressional and other legitimate inquiries re­
garding these young supporters of the Castro Regime. As 
a result of our investigations, more than ~75 VB partici­
pants have been placed on the Security Index and it has 
been noted that about 25% of those individuals currently 
being intensively investigated as extremists in the New 
Left section: are ex-VB members. 
Plans for a fifth contingent of the VB have been 
formulated. This new group is tentatively scheduled to 
pepart for Cuba in early January, 1972, and is to be 
comprised of 225-250· individuals politically oriented to 
th~ socialist .cause.
