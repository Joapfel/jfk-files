th is wns ·anothc1· case of poli~c 'haras~mcnt of tho IlPP. an,t another 
cxa'mp-lc of hm1 the flPP has lost its attract ivcncss to people 
in Chica~o. Of the sixteen people who were originally chnrr.ed 
in the ki·dnapping case. including the deceased Hampton. only 
two of· those, Yvonne King-, and Billy Broqks. continue as 
members of the lJPP . 
. , Junior claims to have no contact with any members 
or fm•rr.cr members of the I3PP, except when the persons charged 
with the kidnaping report for trial every month. Junior 
cites the numerous continuances of the kidnaping case as 
an example of white hobbyists playing with young black 
revolutionary hopefuls. To him the continuances represent 
a conspiracy on tho part of the BPP attorneys and the States 
Attorney's Office, ~ Qn alternate months they ask•that the 
case be continued and neither e~er objects. If he could afford 
it he would not avail himself of .. the· BPP attorney's services. 
Junior is required to report to his probation 
• ~ officer twice per month and is not allowed to travel 
(:~tside the State of
0 
Illinois, without prior permission, 
Logical sources, in positions to know, advise 
that Junior is not now active with the BPP, and has 
not been so in more than a year. 
On October 29, 1971, the FBI recontacted Junior 
and learned that his pending kidnaping case was 
continued from October 26. 1971, until Noveml;>er 30, 1971.
