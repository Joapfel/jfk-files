Avenue, Miami, Fla., which operates vending machines and 
juke boxes, is owned by JOSEPH and ELOISE MANGONE. Mrs.

1958 winter season· for approximately six months, that he 
had rented a house, address unknown, on one of the islands 
adjacent to Miami Beach. She said that GALLUP had contacted 
her and her husband with a proposition to buy into their 
vending machine business but after considerable negotiating 
the deal was never consummated.

of the persons engaged in the vending machine business in 
the Miami area and that BEN GALLUP did not enter into the 
business in Miami and to her knowledge has not been in 
Miami since the 1957-1958 season~ She said that GALLUP 
was originally from Trenton, N. J. and was believed to l1ave 
returned to Trenton where he was in the cigarette vending

business he used the All-Coin Amusement Company, 2820 
Northwest 7th Avenue, Miami, as a mailing address and 
received mail during his stay in Miami. Mrs. Iv!ANGONE 
denied any further knowledge of GALLUP'S associates, back­
ground, activities, or present whereabouts. It was stated
