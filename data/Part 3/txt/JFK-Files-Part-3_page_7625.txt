Division~ I do not believe that this Se-ction should be tranaferred to ,:;;:uantico, 
however, becau.3e there is daily need for access to files and .other material , 
at I-!eadquarters and occasional cop.tacts with the public .. Furth~rmors, there -
i!} no aitailable space at Quantico e::rc-ept in· the Libra:ry Building. AccordL,gly, . 
I recommend that the. FBIHQ--Library. be. moved into the Library. :f;3uilding .at , ., : . 
Quantico. V-!e would need to re'l:ain at FBIHQ the telephone directories and 
encyclopedias which ar0 used on a daily basis b-y other Divisions. The _ 
space into which the FBIBQ Library was to have been moved in the 9th and D 
Building can be used ~-rid in fact is badly needed by the Dom·est_ic Intelligencs 
Diyision which is very crowded.

I recommend that you approve now the transfer of functions ·and 
that any n~cessary realignment of perso:rmel be considere~ by separate •
