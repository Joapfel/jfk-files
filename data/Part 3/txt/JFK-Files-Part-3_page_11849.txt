Nationalities Intelligence 'section is giving up two 
men from pr.esent assignment, one to the Chinese Unit and one 
to Special Coordination Unit. The latter is a non-case 
assignment ·and deletes one man from computation of average case 
load in the Section which brings that Section more in line with 
the present Division average of 335 cases per case supervisor 
under the new rules for case count. This also results in one 
less supervisor committed to case supervision and alters the 
Division average per case supervisbr to 341 cases. 
It is recognized the Internal Security Section has a 
high average case load per Agent, however, that Section has 
less organization cases and proportionately more individual 
matters requiring less sup~rvisory attention than other Sections. 
This,,,will be followed closely an .• depending on approval of 
transferring EID and ARL cases to this Division and/or 
resolution of Eastcon and appropriate recommendation will be 
made to adjust a block of work internally within the Division 
to create a better balance there.
