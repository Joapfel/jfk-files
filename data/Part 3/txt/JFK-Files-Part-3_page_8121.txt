• 
The question of Mr. Tolson's will did arise. 
Mr. Mohr advised that Hillery Tolson had not decided whether 
he was going to contest the will. According to Mr. Mohr, he 
recently had lunch with Hillery Tolson at Mr. Tolson's request 
at which time Hillery Tols~n suggested he was not going to 
contest the will. ~owever, Mr. Mohr had not seen any documentary 
evidence of Hillery.' s decision in this regard. 
Finally, the Staff Members asked if Mr. Mohr knew 
the whereabouts of Miss Gandy or at least her teJephone number. 
He told themhhe did know herewher.eabouts and telephone number 
but promised her he would not reveal.them. Mr. Mohr was asked 
whether Miss Gandy would be available for interview. Mr. Mohr 
advised the Committee that he would attempt to persuade her 
to be interviewed providing he, Mr. Mohr, was allowed to be 
present during the entire interview. The Staff Members inter­
posed no objection to that arpangement and Mr. Mohr indicat~d 
to Mr. Gitepstein that he would advise him of Miss Gandy's 
desires regarding an interview under the conditions stipulated 
above. 
Prior to the onset of the interview with Mr. Mohr, 
Cregar asked Gitenstein whether a decision would be forthcoming 
from the SSC regarding the interviews of former employees of the 
intelligence community by Staff Members of the SSC. Gitenstein 
I 
stated the the Cqmmittee had no problem with the FBI and that if 
The White House would not interfere he felt satisfactory arrange­
ments between the FBI and the Select Committee could be worked 
out regarding futur~ interviews of former FBI.employees. The 
(
thrust of Mr. Gitensteirt's comment as well as his general 
demeanor during the meeting suggested the Staff felt they could 
work closely with the FBI to the satisfaction of both parties. 
ACTION,: For information and record purposes.
