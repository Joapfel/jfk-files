BLACK PANTHER PARTY 
Formerly Known As 
• 
Black Panther Party for Self-Defense 
The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December, 
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby ·1 
George Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing ! 
black people to take control of the life, politics and destiny 
of the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther 
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called 
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the 
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program 
to end the oppression of the black people but since early 
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution. 
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercommunal 
Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California. 
While openly advocating direct overthrow of the 
U. s. ·Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders 
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling 
for action within the established order. Newton, in an 
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy" 
magazine, stated the PanthersY chief ambition is to change 
the American Government by any means necessary but that 
ultimately such change will be through armed violence. 
Despite its claimed dedication to community service, 
indicators.of the BPP's continued ~ttraction to violence persist. 
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been 
arrested in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers, 
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of 
Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges 
and is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and 
three were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored 
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.
