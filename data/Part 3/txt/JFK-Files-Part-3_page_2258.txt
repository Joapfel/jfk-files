GAO offered us an advance copy of Mr. Staats' testimony with the 
proviso that it would accept FBI suggestions and minor corrections but 
would not make any substantive alterations in the draft. We have reviewed 
the draft, and GAO has made some technical changes at our suggestion. 
From a substantive viewpoint, while we take exception to GAO's phraseology 
in certain instances, as well as to certain factual conclusions and inferences, 
our overall reading of this material is that it represents an effort -on GAO' s 
part to present an objective picture of FBI operations .
