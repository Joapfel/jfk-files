FROM A. Rosen~ 
SUBJECT: 
j 
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights 
Diyision called to state that he will have to talk with R~~rtin Luther 
Kfng with reference to Jack Hunter O'Dell. • " ....,___;. 
' vi~ ·By way of background, he stated that an inquiry has been 
received from King about O'Dell and apparently the Department wants 
to be able to talk to King about O'Dell. 
Before Marshall can do this :tie states he would like to have 
whatever background information we have on O'Dell. In this regard, 
it is noted that O'Dell is supposed to be a member of the Communist 
Party and has in the past been associated with the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. This is King's organization. We have in the 
past furnished information to the Department concerning O'Dell and his 
association with Rev. King. 
Marshall should be furnished with memoranda which have 
heretofore been given to the Security Division. It is understood that 
a report of O'Dell's activities is also available and has been furnished 
to the Security Division but has not been given to the Civil Rights 
Division. It would appear that Marshall is entitled to this information 
if he is to properly evaluate O'Dell's background . 
. 
Marshall has asked for a summary on O'Dell. If such is not 
readily available, copies of material previously furnished to the Depart­
ment would seem to suffice. He stated he has been in touch with the 
AR:mpd (6) Attorney General on this matter and is anxious to 
have it handled as soon as possible.
