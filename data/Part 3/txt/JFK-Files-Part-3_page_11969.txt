Survey Regarding Potential for Racial Violence 
4-H 
activities 
This survey program was formerly under the title 
"Possible Racial Violence, Major Urban Areas." The program 
was initiated in 1964 in order that the Bureau would be aware 
of potential danger spots in the U. s. The present program 
requires each field division to conduct a continuing survey in 
their respective territories covering all localities having a 
potential for racial violence based on current racial conditions. 
The objective is to .insure that the Bureau receives a realistic 
and comprehensive picture of existing racial conditions in these 
areas on a current basis and to obtain advance information of any 
impending racial developments which clearly point to the 
nossibilitv of mob violence. ... . 
Quarterly reports submitted by field in line with this 
survey represent information obtained through contacts with 
local government and police officials, leaders of racial groups, 
and a c·ross section of informants and sources. The survey 
enables us to be thoroughly knowledgeable of racial develop­
ments and potential trouble spots and provides timely and 
pertinent information which is disseminated to the "White 
House, Attorney General, and other Government agencies. 
Information developed is also used ~or an analysis of the 
potential for violence in the U. s., which is prepared in the 
.spring of each year, just prior to the most active months, 
in this field, and which is disseminated on a high level.
