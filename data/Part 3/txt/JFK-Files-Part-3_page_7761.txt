INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND CIVIL LIBERTY 
One of the biggest distinctions between the criminal 
and s·ecurity-type investigations is the fact that national 
security investigations, which involved the ideological factor, 
are almost without exception concerned with the concept of 
political ideology. No matter how radical the political ideology 
might be, it is nevertheless considered by the people involved -
and often by many intellectual idealists - is a right guaranteed 
under the Constitution. As a result of a great deal of liberal 
thinking on the part of the civil libertarians and groups such as 
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), there is a much 
greater hue and cry when intelligence-type investigations ~re 
surfaced and it developed that the purpose of the investigation 
had something to do with an individ~al's so-called political 
beliefs. The potential problem for the FBI in conducting purely 
intelligence-type investigations, even when based on statutes, 
is when the investigation broaches or gets real close to rights 
protected under the First and Fourth Amendments. 
As pointed out before, however, the Supreme Court has 
emphatically stated that th~ President has no constitutional 
power to abridge these two Amendments. Therefore, no Executive 
order, no matter how broadly worded to convey investigative 
authority for intelligence-type investigations, could enable the 
FBI to avoid the same pitfalls regarding areas of activity 
covered by the First and Fourth Amendments. Therefore, even though 
a definitive Executive order would be desirable from the stand­
point of fixing our responsibilities and bridging any gaps between 
statute and Executive necessity, the FBI would still be in a little 
better position than it is at the present time under purely 
statutory authority. 
INTERPRETATION OF AUTHORITY BY SUBSTANTIVE SECTIONS 
At this point it appears appropriate to introduce comments 
offered by representatives of the various substantive Sections of 
the Domestic Intelligence Division as to their interpretation of 
Executive power flowing from the 1939 et seq, directives and 
the types of investigative matters that possibly cannot be conducted 
solely under statutory authority. 
EXTREMIST INTELLIGENCE SECTION VIEWS 
The Extremist Intelligence Section Jescribed four 
investigative matters where it appears that investigation, at 
least initially, would not or could not have been grounded in 
specific Federal statutes, but where the FBI nevertheless was in 
a sense fulfilling intelligence responsibility tracing its
