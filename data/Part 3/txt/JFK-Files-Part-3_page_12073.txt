ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL 
.J!~~-!~L~.l.~~~ and_~~!11l...J!,._.\tl!.~ submitted resignations close of business January 8, 1971. Replacements were received 
as enumerated in item one above. 
(3) As of January 8, 1971, there was a shortage of • 
two GS-4 Clerk in the Officials Unit - Washington, but this 
was remedied on January 11, when replacements were received 
as indicated in item one above. A replacement has been requested 
for Special Agent .... G~~-~k«, ~i£~-- in the Officials Unit - New York, 
but none has been designated at this time. There is no overage 
of authorized personnel in the Espionage Section. • 
(4) Clerical personnel is considered adequate at the 
present time. With the reorganization of the Division, and· 
combining Soviet and Soviet-bloc investigations in the Espionage 
Section~ an extremely heavy burden has been placed on the clerical 
personnel handling the assignment cards for the Sectio1i ( i.ht::i·t:: i::LL'~ 
now 5,046 cases). This situation is being watched and it may be 
that it is unworkable to place the responsibility for maintaining 
the assignment cards in a GS-4 employee who is already heavily 
assigned. If this proves to be a fact, a recommendation will be 
made to ·add a Clerk at a GS-3 level who would exclusively handle 
the assignment cards. 
(5) Following the 1970 inspection, personnel handling 
Soviet investigations was reduced by two Special Agents, GS-14. 
Following the inspection, personnel handling Soviet-bloc 
investigations were reduced by one Special Agent, GS-14, and 
one Clerk, GS-4. At the time of the reorganization of the· 
Division in December, 1970, personnel handling Soviet-bloc 
investigations were reduced by four Special Agents (one GS-15; 
three GS-14) and five clerical personnel (one GS-5 and four GS-4). 
• (6) Special Agent personnel is considered adequate. 
(7) Criteria utilized in determining the adequacy of 
personnel includes the volume of cases supervised, the complexity 
of the cases, and the importance of the investigations. 
In the Officials Unit, both· Washington and New York, 
we handle the greatest volume of complex investigations since
