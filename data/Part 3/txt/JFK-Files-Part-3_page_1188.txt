I APPENDIX 
COMMUNIST PARTY, USA 
Title 50, u. s. Code, Section 781 (Internal Security 
Act of 1950) stated that, as a result of evidence adduced 
before various committees of the Senate and House of Representa­
tives, Congress found the existence of a world communist 
revolutionary movement, whose purpose is to establish a 
communist totalitarian dictatorship in the world's countries 
through the medium of a world-wide communist organization~ 
Communist action organizations in various countries endeavor 
to carry out the objectives of the world communist movement 
by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by 
any means., The communist organization in the United States -
the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) - pursuing its stated objectives, 
presents "a clear and present danger to the security of the 
United States., 11 The Subversive Activities Control Board, 
established by Section 791 of the above Act, found the CPUSA 
to be a communist action organization. This finding was 
upheld by the United States Supreme Court in June, 1961. The 
CPUSA has continued to be an arm of the international communist 
movement dominated by the Soviet Union. The CPUSA, in its 
dependence on the Soviet Union,- has never knowingly adopted a 
position contrary to Soviet policy. Its leaders frequently 
confer with Soviet leaders to receive guidance and direction 
on the policies the CPUSA is to follow. There has been no 
evidence that the primary aims of the CE-USA, as they conform 
to Soviet objectives, have changed over the years.
