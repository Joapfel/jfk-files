JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset 
• ••• of the interview on 8/13/70 that she 
-· could consider herself a member of the communal "family", 
however, this became a matter o,f i11terpretation durinp.; the 
~~ourse of interview and eventually she denied she was a member 
of the "family" or commune. Sh$ admitted visiting people 
connected with the qommune and associating with them, .even to 
the extent of allowing·some of these individuals to use her 
address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps. 
. This matter was discussed at length 
with Securitv Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of 
Security at NASA, Moffett Field, Cilifornia. They made no 
··.··statement as to what action they i-t"lltended to take. 
I realize now that I should have 
also nrepared a letterhead memorandum for dissemination to NASA 
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. I regret not having done-so and 
in the future will insure that such matters ar~ promptly 
disseminated.
