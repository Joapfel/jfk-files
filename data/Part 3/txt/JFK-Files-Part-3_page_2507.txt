This informative memorandum records information 
telephonically furnished the morning of 7/17/75 to Supervisor 
S. F. Phillips, INTD, by former FBI Inspector Donald E. Mo?~§. 
---·-· ···---
At about 11:00 p.m., 7/16/75, Moore received a 
telephone call at his residence from a Dave Martin (PH), who 
identified himself with the AP (Associated Press).,. who asked 
Moore if Moore was acquainted wilh the press accounts of 
Director Kelley's press conference on 7/14/75, particularly '\ 
as Mr. Kelley's remarks pertained to surreptitiou.s entries,~· ... ••j, 
principally at embassies. Moore told Martin _that he had /"-""'-....) 
read about the matter in the newspapers. Martin asked 
specifically about the "New York Daily News" of 7/16/75, and 
Moore said he was not familiar with that account, Martin 
then referred to the 7/16/75 "Washington Post" article and 
referred Moore specifically to the newspaper referring to an 
unnamed source. Martin wanted some comment from Moore which 
the latter declined to g.;i.ve, Moore advising that any comment 
should more properly come from the FBI. 
Martin attempted to convince him he should make some 
comment by stating t4at information about this matter would 
eventually come out, and Martin was now offering Moore a change 
to put the matter in a better light. Martin then asked Moore 
ii Mr. Kelley was correct in his statement and Moore again 
declined to comment. Martin said he thought that the "unnamed 
source" referred to in the newspaper was Bill Sullivan 
(obviously referring to former Assistant to the Director 
William c. Sullivan). Martin asked Moore if he-ag..eed ~.E.? 'lfr11:· 
again Moore gave him a no comment reply._ ~ ;;._ - / / /::-' :f /: -::. 1
