Memorandum to Mr. Belmont 
RE: RACIAL MATTERS 
\ 
Of course, any specific offenses such as, for example, 
the case of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia, 
Mississippi, •·or cases involving brutality, bombings or any other 
violations these individual investigations should be handled by the 
appropriate substantive desks such as the Civil Rights Desk. 
The over-all racial field is specifically an intelligence operation 
for the Bureau. It can best be organized when all facets are followed 
and directed by one Division. The communist potential for activities 
in this field would seem to be a major factor as ~videnced by the doings 
of Martin Luther King and his associates. The Bureau can best keep 
abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united 
in one Division utilizing the tactics which Mr. Sullivan has suggested 
as being effective.
