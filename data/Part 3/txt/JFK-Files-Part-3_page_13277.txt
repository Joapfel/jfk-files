Memorandum for: The Honorable Lee Rankin 
Attached are a few items of pos-sible interesti 
(1) a copy of.an ~ticie in the January 1964 
~itish "Labour Monthly" by. I believe, R. P. Dutt. I 
llnderstand he is the editor of th~ uLabour Monthly" and a 
British Communist. I-an seeking _further data with regard 
to Dutt.·. I call your attention_ p~ticularly to the section 
beginning on page 13,entitled "A_C.I.A. Job?''.- I suggest 
that you might wish the _CIA to send to you directly all 
. important itens of this• ~eneral nature and also items 
bearing on the future Communist propaganda tre~trnent of 
.the assassination issue with their estiraate, preferably 
coordinated with the State··nepartment, showing the general 
trend of such'propaganda, if there. is one. It has been 
my experience that the Cornmuni.st party of the Soviet Union 
exercises a good deal. but not complete. control over the 
propaganda activities of the various Ccmrnunist parties 
in the free world and often uses these parties or selected 
ones to launch various trial balloons in the propaganda 
:field. : 
• (2) a letter I obtained frc:m. a source I will 
indicate to you orally written by Geor;:e de Mohrenschildt, 
who you may recall appears in the CorrtQ!lSsion•a records a~ 
one of th~. men who had contact with, am· as I recall, some 
influence· over ·oswald. You'will ·recall that the State 
Department had interrogated him brieflTh !·believe. at t..~¢ 
insistence of the FBI·. • This, letter micht furnish a desirable .,. 
basis for scme further interrogation as I did not find t...~e 
State Department interrogation wholly ~atisfactory.
