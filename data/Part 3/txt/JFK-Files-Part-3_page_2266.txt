Memorandum to Mr. W. R. -W annal! 
Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations 
.62-56866 
All of the above were enumerated as .examples of FBI field office 
-, exercising judgment and discretion in opening cases based on "soft" evidence. 
Congressman Badillo took loud exception to this and said he saw no basis for 
opening cases in any of these instances and referred to them as "no basis 0 cases 
•• rather than soft. 
GAO advised they were not prepared to make a positive recommendation 
on these cases (36 percent) at this time but, in their final report, they would 
address this issue. GAO indicated it could.be an area where the FBI might review 
and more carefully define criteria. 
Organizations 
\ 
_Congressman Drinan took exception to the use of terms in the 
FBI Manuals, such as extremists and black and white hate groups. He stated 
these are basically people pursuing their goal of racial justice~ ~e then ~sked 
for GAO to list some of these organizations which the FBI characterized as 
"Extremist." Mr. Fogel then named the following: 
The Ku Klux Klan 
The Minuteman 
The American Nazi Party 
The Black Panther Party 
The Nation of Islam 
Mr. Drinan made no further comment on this subject . 
.Preliminary Inquiries 
GAO pointed out that 73 percent of the preliminary inquiries 
received went beyond the 90-day FBI Manual limitation and that in 68 percent 
of these cases, FBIHQ was not advised and had no opportunity to review or • 
possibly terminate the investigation. Congressmen Dodd and Drinan claimed 
the FBI was, therefore, not following its own rules. GAO offered no 
explanations as to why field offices might go over the 90-day· limit,. such 
as matters requiring special investigative effort and attention, such as the 
bombing cases, Hearst case, Pine Ridge Indian case, which affected offices 
under audit.
