The Bay of Pigs Background 
Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organ1z1ng a 
"g9ver~ent in exile" for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida. The 
pltn ado ted by the National Security Council under P~esident Eisenho\.ver 
called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who 
\vould invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog­
nition by the United States and overthro"v the Castro government. The 
brigade had its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the 
United States Government. The operation, hov1ever, was not supposed 
to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture 
was to involve training and launching from outside the United States. 
In connection with his political activity and the organization of the 
government in exile, Hunt "vent to Mexico in 1960. Shortly thereafter 
the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to 
the United States. Richard Nixon, then V~ce President, was working 
closely with the CIA on the project. 
When President Kennedy was elected 1n November 1960, he \vas briefed 
on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air 
cover to the invading Cuban force. In early 1961, however, the Kennedy 
administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban 
government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all 
elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be 
included. _ Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the 
Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure 
of the government in exile. Hunt found this to be an impossible job to 
accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force 
had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti­
Castro and anti-communist. Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment 
because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned 
to Washington to ·work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects 
of the forthcoming invasion. 
Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade \Vas 
to· hit the beaches at 'the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two 
critical decisions that affected the final outcome: · he cancelled plans
