AMLASH Casa Officer. I don't specifically recall today

way of comportment. He didn't answer to anybody. 
Senator Schweiker. What was his role in government at 
that point? 
AMLASII Case Officer. lie was -- excuse me, this must have 
been '63, He was a personal representative of Castro to the 
games, first in Brazil, and I don't think he had a specific 
TOP SECRET
