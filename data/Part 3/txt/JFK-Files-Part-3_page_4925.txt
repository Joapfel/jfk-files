Ion 4/9/64, (NY €94-S* made the following observations 
regard to th, CP S\,atus of STANLEY LEVISON: 
LEVISON has been an important Party member for 
many years(and never at any time differed with the Party with 
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the 
Party has been ·with respect to the fact that in his opinion 
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending 
Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left" 
of the Party. LEVISON1 s differences with the Party are merely 
s-fJD 11tactical. 11 He has never criticized the Party, except with 
respect to the Party 1 s handling of the Negro question. The 
fact that he does not accept qomination by the Party with 
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be 
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all 
respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestabli"sh friendly 
relations with LEVISON a·s it was in the past.) 
(rt should be noted that LEVISON never has been 
officiall~ "drummed out II of the Party, nor has anyone ever 
. c_::·i ticized him for being opposed to the Party's general 
p:t•inciples. It further should be noted that according to 
·the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of 
( ( \ QLEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party. 
_)f LEVISON never has said anything reflecting -that 
he does not continue to be a CP member. It.should be noted 
·;hat it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING 
111ovement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly 
:i:>epudia ter◄}·the Party, which he has never done. It should be 
:~urther noted that in an effort to renew friendly rela t1ons)
