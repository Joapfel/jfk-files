BACKGROUND, DATE OF INCEPrION AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES 
This program was initiated in September, 1964, for 
the purpose of exposing, disrupting and otherwise neutralizing 
activities of white extremist organizations, their leaders and 
adherents. There are currently 17 field offices regularly 
participating in this program and as specific situations arise 
other divisions also participate.

by opposing violence and stressing need for law and order as 
well as continuing his acts against communism. This has been 
effective in toning down Klan violence. 
Midwest coordinator of National Socialist White 
People's Party, formerly known as American Nazi Party, was 
·expelled from that organization after publicity furnished under 
thi? program disclosed he was of Jewish descent. 
Through manipulation of informants, anonymous letters 
and utilization of friendly press services we were successful 
in creating a split in the UKA in North Carolina. This split 
was brought about when a rally of dissident Klansmen in • 
September, 1969, showed their disaffection with the UKA leader­
ship by burning their Klan membership cards. This split was 
highlighted in front~page news stories in North Carolina 
newspapers. 
During 1970 National Klonvokation, Robert Shelton,

his feelings that high ranking members of the UKA may be disloyal
