MR. LEMNI'rZER: I had in mind particularly the recover 
of the Russian submarine and the large expenditure that was 
involved. How was that handled, for example? 
MR. DONOHUE: Do you want me to answer, David? 
MR. BELIN: I will ask. you this qusstion because the 
Witness is cpncernad about secrecy agreements that h3 has 
signed pertaining to certain projects.

g of more than $10 million by the Agency in any one year that was 
10 not audited or reviewed by OMB?

MR. DONOHUE: It would not be audited. 
MR. BELIN: I used the word audit incorrectly because 
you do not audit. That was not carefully reviewed by the OMil? 
MR. DONOHUE: I do not know of any large project of 
that magnitud2 that we would not be aware of. I will be glad 
to go off the record and answer the question.
