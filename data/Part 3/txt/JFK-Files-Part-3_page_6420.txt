conversation with the Attorney General on June 17, 1963, agreed

Dr. Martin Luther King could be informed that he should get rid of 
Levison and O'Dell because they are members of the Communist Party. 
It was on the basis of this advice from the Director that action was taken

ACTION TO BE TAKEN: 
While Mr. Marshall's proposed memorandum does not spell 
l
out the sequence of events here in detail, his summary is nevertheless 
accurate and it is therefore believed we should inform Mr. Iv1arshall 
that he should feel free, of course, to submit the memorandum as he 
~~L .. drafted it. If. approved, Mr. Marshall will be so advised telephonically.
