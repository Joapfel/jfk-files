these years that an atmosphere of mistrust and lack of 
confidence was c~eated. 
3) CXA was e~tablished ns our first over-all, 
worldwide intelligence ~gency. The events and the 
maneuvering which led to this certainly.did not bring 
with them a harmonious relationship. 
4) Unfortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast, 
particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and 
developments such as the Korean War. The Agency did not 
jell effectively as an organization, and with this came 
numerous difficulties, many of which exist to this day. 
5) Each organization has lacked adequate 
knowledge of·. the other's operational machinery,· objectives, 
and "ways and means oi doing things. 0 
6) An element of rivalry actually developed over 
the years, and this, when not ~empered with prudence and 
soung judgment, creates unhealthy situations.

has not been an easy matter to establish a good working 
relationship with CIA without frequent conflicts, and 
sometimes agonizing negotiations. It could be suggested 
that the ideal situation would be to remove CIA from the· 
U. s. with the understanding that we would assume respon­

As described in another section of this report, such a 
move would be highly infeasible for the Bureau.

the past there have been some highly constructive develop-
