Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well

Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed, out the

departments, for instance, with not having a ~nixing of 
gathering intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techni ues

on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fact, it is 
a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as 
it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement. 
Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes

time in your judgment as to just who can ask the FBI for 
information, what kind of information they can ask for, and
