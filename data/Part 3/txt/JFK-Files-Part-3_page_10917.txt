"Detailed study of organization and activities of 
intelligence divisions of the Government, inc+uding CIA, is 
being made by a committee consisting of Messrs. Allon Dulles, 
William I-I. J'acli;;son, and Mathias Correa, assisted by a staff 
of .four directed by Mr. Robert Blum of the Office of 
Secretary of Defense." With this statement it may be assumed

that since CIA is charged with the over-all responsibility 
for coordinating the output of all intelligence forces, the 
Task Force was giving special attention to the work of that 
Agencyo 
In the Task Force Report a review of the FBI 
functions in the intelligence comi~unity was set forth. The 
committee noted that the FBI had only limited activities in the
