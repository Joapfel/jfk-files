(b) Observations: 
While a program limited to ~he clandestine gathering 
of foreign intelligence would require u subs~an~1a~-incrcase 
in manpower, both in the field and at the Bureau's headquarters, 
as well as an expansion o_ our personnel selectton and training 
procedures, our liaison responsibilities and- our filing and 
data processing facilities, however; in none of these phases 
would the increase be nearly as great as that which would be 
required should we assume full-responsibility for the overt 
gathering of such foreign intelligence. . ..
