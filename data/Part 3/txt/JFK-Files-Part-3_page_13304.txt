What actions d~d CIA take in Dallas or in Washington after 
Kennedy was shot or after Oswald was arrested? 
Answer: 
A special cable channel was established at headquarters to 
insure that ·all correspondence concerning Oswald would be con-
trolled in a central repository . The resultant correspondence 
• 
was subsequently incorporated into the Oswald file which was. 
reviewed in full by the Warren Commission. Extensive investi-
gative and analys·is work was performed by the Agency in coordi­
nation with other Government agencies and with the Warren Com-
mission. 
Following the assassination of Pre~ident Kennedy, DCI McCone 
instructed the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) to send an 
officer from its Dallas office to Parkland Hospital to contact 
' 
and offer assistance to the FBI and Secret Service. Mr~ Linwood 
Davis of that office went immediately to the.hospital where he 
identified himself to the FBI and offered his services during 
the emergency. To date, our file review shows no indication 
that any particular use was made of Mr. Davis at that time.
