This program was initiated in 1964 under the title 
"Possible Racial Violence, Major Urban Areas." It requires 
each field office to conduct a continuing survey of localities

ditions. Objective is twofold--to insure Bureau receives a 
current, realistic, and comprehensive picture of existing 
.conditions which may lead to violence, and to obtain advance 
•information of developments clearly pointing to the possibility 
of violence. 
The field submits semiannual reports summarizing 
information receivedo Of course, pertinent information is 
submited on a timely basis depending upon the circumstances 
.. • • involved. The survey provides the basis for a cogent analysis 
.· '. of potential for violence and pertine:t information is dissemi-
.• _. ·· nated to the White House, Attorney General, and other Government 
,._. : ·agencies. In the spring of each year an analysis entitled 
~ "Potential for Violence in l.-fajor Cities in Summer" is prepared 
and disseminated on_a h~gh Level ~n the Governmen~.
