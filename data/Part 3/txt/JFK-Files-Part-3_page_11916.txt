Through the New Left Movement reports prepared 
quarterly by each field office, we have provided to interested

of the New Left movement, thus making a substantial contribution 
to the objective that responsible officials be fully aware of 
the threat the New Left presents to our democratic society. 
By closely following a myriad of New Left publications 
ranging from those merely pornographic to those clearly 
revolutionary, we have determined the leadership of these 
publications; their propensity for violence and subversive 
activities; sources of funds; and through dissemination have 
advised interested officials and agencies. -Since these 
publications frequently app~~~ and disappe4r ~ithin ~ short

various underground news service lists as well as other 
documents and books which report new publications in this 
field. 
We have recognized that in the past, informant coverage 
of New Left groups has not been adequate and accordingly have 
given great emphasis to this aspect of our responsibility. As

increased~ At present, we have,,2q(l.informants and sources of 
all types providing coverage of the New Left. This number 
includes 178 security informants and 410 potential security 
informants:-' 
Since the last inspection, New Left informants have 
provided information which has: led to the indictment of a 
number of New Left le_aders on Federal and local charges; 
loc.ated fugitives including some Weatherman fugitives; provided 
advance information on numerous New Left demonstrations including 
plans for violence; and furnished detailed information on the 
organization, membership, .and activiti~s of a broad range of 
New Left groups.
