of A.~erica, Inc~, in North Carolina, and pu~lished both. Photos 
and names of a nu.'1lber of membarso So far as has been learned 
from informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the 
organization~ It was alleged that two to five members we~e 
discharged from their jobs, or warned abq,ut continuing mernber­
~bi~, but t~~ identities of -~hes~~e,,ge'd persons is no~t k:1-own,. 
-N~~i~~~:e:J,-1..R~- ·Gr-~:1:-~~~BS-~'-O~Es- has stated, notn 
publicly and privately to informants: that this publicity was 
very valuable to the growth of the organization~ One informant 
reported that the day after the articles published his n~~e as 
a local leader, three persons contacted hL~ and applied for 
me.tuber.ship, stating tb~y had not previouslv known whom to contact .. 
It is considered that pu.!:lrrcity···of ·this-t:!_rpe gen~rally 
deters from joining only those persons who would not; be 
inte:r-ested in joining irr the fi:::-st·placeo It is believed that 
a large proportion of those persons who are potential members 
are seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent 
to them; it makes them feel important and m~~bers of an important 
group .. 
The major apparent effect of the series of newspaper 
articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, and 
refusal of leaders to allow newspaper photos of i~dividual 
Klansmen to be taxen at public rallies. 
3. Disruptive activity, wherever possible, should be of 
a nature which does not expose the £act that the Bureau 1 or the 
11Federal Government

1 is behind the activity" It i~ balieved 
that open action, to a large extent, can backfire and create 
resent.uent and sympathy~ It must be remembered that Klan ., ., . . ~.. d . ~ 
mem..oersnip, in many sec~ions, oes no~ ny any means carry the 
odilliu that alleged Com:uunist membe~ship or sympathy does in 
aL~ost any section of societyo 
4 .. Along this same line, there is probably no point in 
t~ying disruptive activityr at least not at this stage,· on a 
local Klan group which is small, inactiv2 1 and peaceful. Any
