P. 9 
What was the purpose of a CIA-State study concerning defectors 
in general in 1960? 
Answer: 
There was no formal "study," but there was inter-agency 
preoccupation and exchange of information caused by the fact 
that there had been 13 U. s~ defectors, including Oswald, 
• 
between 1958 and 1960. Among the 13, there were five asceil~ined 
KGB agents: Davis, Dutkaniez, Martin, Mitchell, and Slaboda.
