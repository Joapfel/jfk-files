MR. GRAY: ~ 61.

MR. BELIN: Do you have. any opinion as to the viabilit 
of that board in general and also with specific reference to ., 
any oversight functions it might have performed with the CIA? ------··-----------! ..... ________________ _...., ----· ...... •-·---

on behalf of the P~esident can oversee and interpret and

intelligence activities. This board, I feel, should have the 
confidence of the President. He should be, feel comfortable 
with its membership. If any President inherits such a board 
and is not comfortable, then he ought to make his own board. 
I am saying such a board-is extremely important, 
especially if the recommendations of the Board get to the 
President, and there have been times in the past:when they have 
not gotten to the President soon enough, and in some cases 
I am afraid not at all. 
MR. BELIN: What particular types in the past are you 
ref,erring to'?
