The Deputy Attorney General 
. , 
Item (6)(b) should be reconsidered with the follO'\ving lang-uage: 
"If the 1"'ask Force Leader has any objections to the 
excisions or paraphras~s, the FBI will furnish a 
written statement of the grounds for its position to 
the Special Counsel who s!}all resolve the matter by 
negotiation within 24 hours. 11 
Ite1n (8) should be reconsidered with the following language: 
"The Staff and the l-1erabers of the Committee may examme 
the original materials to which the Staff is given access 
as extensively as necessary between the hours of 8:00 a. m. 
and 5:30 p. m., lVfonday through Friday, in the FBI J·. Edgar 
Hoover B.i.ildL.--ig at Room 4171. 11 
In light of the d5.fficu1ti.es described, tt is my strong 
recommenctanon that sucb proeed.ures should not be hastily agreed upon 
with the Cmnmittee and that full discussion should be had concerning this 
matter by representatives of the FBr, the Attorney General, the Committee 
and the Counsel to the President.
