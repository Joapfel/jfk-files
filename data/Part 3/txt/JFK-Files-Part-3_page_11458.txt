Due to the fact that this matter is being handled in Records Section 
through normal mail processing procedures, it is most difficult to determine 
which specific individual(s) may have typed a certain card or abstract, searched 
a particular name, reviewed a particular file, etc. Therefore, names of 
individuals have not been given. In some instances, a specific number of 
individuals involved may be known and, where applicable, this has been shown. 
But in some units it is impossible to know even how many persons performed 
the work relative to a specific subject. All that can be given in some cases is 
the estimated number of hours in a particular grade or level based on production 
figures relating to this matter.
