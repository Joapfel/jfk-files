Each of the more than 1300 brigade members has been 
the subject of a security investigation whicti includes the 
identification and obtaining of background data as well as 
a personal interview with each brigade member. These 
investigations are being made to determine the immediate 
danger presented by these young revolutionaries and also 
to ascertain the long-range role they will take in the 
revolutionary m~ement in the U.S. Upon completion of 
the investigation and the interview of each of these 
individuals, the field must recommend either the inclusion 
or noninclusion of the subject ~n the Security Index. In 
addition the field must continue to report every 90 days 
for a period of one year on the activities and whereabouts 
of each brigade member.
