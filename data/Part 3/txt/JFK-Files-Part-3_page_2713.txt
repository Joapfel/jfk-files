Mr. Adams. I agree, Senator. 
Senator Hart o.f Michigan. Why don't you t~y to .shut that 
stuff o·ff. ·by simply t~:l;ting. ·.the_ -~ge;·;t; or ,yom:·· informant.? 
Mr. Adams.- Here is the: problem that ·you_ -hay~ wi:th that. 
When· you're looking· at an organization, do you report only the 
violent statements made by the group or do you also show that 
you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have 
some of these church·groups that were mehtion~d, and others, 
that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the 
statutes. You have to report the good, the favorable along 
with the unfq.vorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with 
information in our .files. We are accused of being vacuum 
cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner.· If you want to know the 
real purpose of an organization, do you only report the 
violent statements made and the fact that it is by_ a small 
minority, or do you also-show the broad base of the organizatio 
and what it .really is? 
And within that ·is where we have to have the guidelines 
we have talked about before. We have to narrow down, because 
we recogniz·e that we do wind up with too much information in 
our files. 
. Senator Hart of Michigan. But in that vacuuming process, 
you are feeding into Departmental files the names of pe9ple 
who are, who have been engaged in basic First Amendment
