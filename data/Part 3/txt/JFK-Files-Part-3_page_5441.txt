QUESTION: 
MR. KELLEY: 
•• 
maintained con!idential. I still have not given them a close 
review. I have not done so for the very reason as I mentioned 
about my own tiie. I don "t think it will benefit me to go over 
them. Under archival rules they must be preserved. In the 
guidelines which are to be established, I will welcome any 
reasonable guideline which says we either do or do not presez:ve 
them. I am anxio_us for us to do our worl{ the way it should be 
done. More than that, I cannot .say. 
Mr. Kelley, there have been suggestions that your absences 
from Washington for family reasons have prevented you froltl· 
getting the kind of control of the Bureau that you would have if 
you were here all the time. I am wondering how you respond 
to that kind of suggestion? 
My response is that I feel that I have been able to maintain 
control. I am certainly in constant touch. I have telephone 
calls that are relayed to me when I have made !3Uch trips. I am 
confident t~at the e~ecutive staff of this Bureau is solidly behind 
me. I say this inasmuch as I have somewhat a feeling such as 
may be implied in your question. I must as a result of 
conditions that you know about make these trips. If I feel that in 
so doing it will endanger my administrative control and my 
capability of doing that which I think should be done, I will leave.
