Intelligence Community Staff 
Mr. L. Frank Schwartz 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
Room 4637 
J. Edgar Hoover Building 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Frank: 
Ad Hoc St~ff 
Reference is your request for comments on the sample 
abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being 
provided to the Senate Select Committee. 
As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as 
complete a record as possible of what is provided to the 
Committee, and for this reason hope that the actual copy of 
( 
special reports and_p~~filii±!IY ifuriprtant documents wrrr be 
1??ov1dea to t.:tie Re,g:!-.§~~~:¥...-Where this is not 
I 
done, an abstract 
or summary of each document or homogenous set of documents. 
We have amended the abstract format slightly to include 
an entry for "Document Classification." A copy of the 
amended format is enclosed. 
Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make 
them more "indexable." 
a. Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT'; refers to the subject 
matter of the material which is being provided. The 
abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have 
an entry here something like 11Instructions covering FBI 
Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the 
title of the Senate Committee. 
b. The date at the head of the page should be 
the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of 
submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9. 
c. The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified 
the organization with authority to release the document.
