Attached is a copy of a letter from Senator Church to the 
Attorney General dated .Al.:lgust 28, 1975. The letter is self­
explanatory. 
I would appreciate it if you would treat this request 
with the highest priority. 
I have discussed with Mike Epstein ( in Elliff' s absence) 
of the SSC and with Elmer Larson of the Bureau the demands this 
request will pose for the Bureau, and we have agreed to defer 
responding to Elliff' s requests of August 20, 1975, for Parts IV 
and V, from September 4 to September 9 , in an effort to meet the 
response date ( September 3) of the attached request.
