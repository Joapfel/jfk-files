UNITED STATES SENATE 
SELECT COMM:ITTEE ON 
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
(SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT 
( SA) LAWRENCE F. WIRICK BY 
SSC STAFF MEMBER 
• 
we made certain requests to conduct some types 
of counterintelligence against the BPP, but I 
do not recall that the Bureau ever authorized any 
counterintelligence act which might be productive. 
Change? COINTELPRO is not being utilized to the 
best of my knowledge and has not been for some time. 
I believe that in about two or three years Congress 
will be frantically asking the FBI why ·we did not 
furnish them intelligence, advance knowledge of a 
demonstration, a riot and other civil unrest and 
elimination of the COINTELPRO has been another step 
in the direction of placing the FBI and other law 
enforcement agencies in a position where we cannot 
react to the activities of groups such as the BPP 
which have been formed with the main purpose 
of overthrowing the United States.
