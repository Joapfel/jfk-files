Inµnediately prior to the last inspection, by letter 
May 29, 1970 captioned 11CRI.MINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM, 
ASSIGNNENT OF ADDITIONAL r1ANPOWER,11 you advised the Bureau 
of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively, 
.to·this program. Your success since that time has b~en 
noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969. 
Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven 
additional PCs. T~is is to your credit and you are encouraged 
to continue this favorable trend. However, the collection 
of, intelligence information, though very important, is only 
one phase of this program. The other·phase of the program 
-which must receive c!ose supervision and personal attention 
is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's 
responsibility toward statistical accomplishments. 
In regard to statistical accomplishments, other 
divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in 
the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3 
requires extensive use of u1ai-1:i;.,uwl2!r a.Hu .i.r Lhe 'l'i tla 3 you ••

·1 In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is 
imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show 
the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of 
,intelligence information and statistical accomplishments~ 
In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to 
show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given 
to-the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.
