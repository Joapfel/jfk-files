I certainly agree with the Inspector that one 
field division is no different than another in connection 
with the topic as important as Soviet Espionage. The 
point the~t Mr. Branigan and I were attempting to mak~ is 
that ·we have to recognize the difference in methods of 
operation in Soviet intelligence officers ~l~~~ 
and 'WFO. The Inspector may be assured that I will 
follow the operations of Soviet-bloc intelligence officers 
in New York, WFO and also in San Francisco in.v-iew of the 
establishment of a consulate there. I will continue to be 
most alert to any successful procedures utilized in one 
office that w.ay be productive in another and will certainly 
.see th::1.t the procedu.rr.:>s r'lre ::1ripl i ed where feasible.
