There may be exceptional circumstances 
requiring a special-prosecutor from out­
side the Depirtment of Justice who is 
not dependent on the Attorney General 
or the President for future promotion • 
or other preferment. The primary obli­
gation to appoint such an attorney should 
reside in the Attorney General. 
The relationship between the .Justice Department and the 
intelligence service unquestionably presents us with an excep­
tional circumstance. 
The person chosen to perform the task of special prosecutor 
must po_ssess the same impartiality and strength of resolution 
which Leon Jaworski demon~trated duFing his appearance before a 
committee of Congress 1n 1973. The following exchange occurred 
that year in hearings before the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
Senator Tunney. So-as I understand your 
statemen~ today, ycu feel that if there 
i-., evidence of cri.mir.-:11 activity which is 
ir,,!ictc1hlc, th~t yx1 v:ou1.d b~ prepared to 
r:iovc ah8ad with .;i_n investieation and in­
dictments despite th~ fact that the defen­
dants involved might be prepared to claim 
that national security required them to 
do what they did? 
Mr. Jaworski. That is right, sir. And 
they would have the burden of sustaining 
that position. I would not assume the 
burden. I would contest it. 
The special prosecutor, r:-.creover, should be imbued with the same. 
faith in the law that possussed J::)hn Adams, who knew that the 
law "without any rezard to persor.s, commands that which is good 
and punishes ~vil in_ all, whether ~ich or poor, high or low -­
'tis deaf, inexorable, inflexible~" 
The_ basic machin~ry o·f a special prosecutor's office is 
already in place as a legacy of the Watergate.affair. It.should. 
not be too difficult to modify this ~achinery in the appropriate 
manner to carry o~t the inva~tigation of unlawfulness in the 
intelligence ug(?ncics.
