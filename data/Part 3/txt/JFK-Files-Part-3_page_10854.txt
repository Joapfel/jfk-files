. (e)- Legislation: 
CIA currently has the duty to correlate and evaluate 
intelli~onco rclatin~ to the national security and to provide 
for appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the 
Government. This is set out \n Title 50, USC, Section 40S~ 
The overt collection of foreign intolli~once is not the subject 
of legislntion b~t ra~her of National Security Council Intelligence 
Directives which would have to be revised in order to give tha 
Bureau this authority now lodged ,vith CIA. \ 
(f) Organizational• Changes: -~ 
To carry out a program committing the Bureau to 
the full responsibility for the overt collecting of foreign 
intelligence in this country would necessitate a substantial 
increase to the he~dquarters st~ffs of the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division and the Laboratory Diviso~, as well to the. 
personnel assigned to the New York and Washington Field Offices 
where diplomatic establishments and international organizations 
ar0 m~in1y located. In all probabil~ty the creation of a new 
division at the Seat of Governm0nt devoted entirely to overt 
collection responsibilities, would be required . 
. 
(g) Observ::i.tions: ... 
The many responsibilities that would be ours under 
a progr~m making the Bureau accou:;rtable for the overt collection 
of ·all foreign intelligence in this country would (1) require 
an enormous incre~se in our own personnel, trained in many 
specialized fields, or (2) the delegation of varied intelligence 
functions to other governmental agencies and close supervision 
of such agencies to insure efficient execution of the tasks 
• levied upon them. These overt collection responsibilities 
would undoubtedly be subject to the scrutiny of many sources, 
some of them hostile, and we would have to face the charges, 
unjust though they might be, that the Bureau had ceased to 
., .... .,._pertorm __ th? d_uti_es _fo~. -y1hi~h it wa~ originally created and 
had developed into a gigniltic bureaucratic octopus. • ••• 
2o Clandestine Gathering Act~~~ties 
There are no statutory provisions for the clandestine 
. gathering of foreign intelligence in the United States. We

CIA established its Domestic Operations Division (DOD)
