itself, we would look in terms of covert action projects 
to the 40 Committee, with an indication of Presidential approval 
and since I have b~en head of the unit in 1973, I think we have 
had indications in every covert action project of Presidential 
approval of that covert action project. We would make an 
independent financial ass9ssment as to whether the dollar amount 
requested by the Agency to carry out that covert action 
project was reasonable, and that would amount to a fair amount 
of detailed review of each request to use the contingency 
reserve for covert action projects. We would hold a hearing, 
based at the time of the request on the facts and information as 
to the financial cost of that particular project, and do that in 
a fair amount of detail. 
That does not mear. gztting down to every last dollar 
or person involved, but it does amount to looking on an aggregat 
basis as to whether this is a reasonable amount, and can they 
provide, just can the Agency provide justification for that

MR. KIRKLAND: Wall, in point of fact, since future 
20 contingency or future covert operations by their nature cannot 
21 be budgeted in advance, and usually must be initiated out of 
22 the contingency fund, in the 0MB, you would, get a look at each 
23 of these projects for all practical purposes at their inception, 
24 wouldn't you? 
25 MR. DONOHUE: Yes, siro We would.
