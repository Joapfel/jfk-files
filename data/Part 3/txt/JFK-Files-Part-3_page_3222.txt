has taken over control of a domestic group and the Communist 
Party is operated by the Soviet Union. We would furnish that

Senator Mondale. -Right. But I just want to get the

might have influence over Dr. King, and therefore, he was 
.. ~ 
tI:ioroughly investigated . 
Are there any·limits.then bn who can be investigated?
