MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RE: f°BLACK p ANTHER p ARTYl 
LNEW YORK DIVISION _J 
You have previously authorized this Bureau to 
initiate and continue a telephone surveillance on the 
office of ~he extremistGlack Panther Party (BPP) in 
New York City located at 2026 Seventh Avenuif This 
installation continues to provide significant data on 
this group's plans and operations, and it is apparent 
theffePP in New York City is second only to the national 
headquarters in Berkeley, Californi'il from the standpoint 
of generating plans for racial violence. 
This Bureau has developed information that the 
(}PP in New York recently opened an office at 1370 Boston 
Road, Bronx, New Yor€J This office is known as the(ihack 
Community Information Centej]and reportedly is to function 
as thel]ast Coast Information Center for the BPP] It is, 
therefore, apparent that a telephone surveillance at this 
location will provide access to invaluable data regarding 
theThPP 1J plans and activities, not only on a local level 
[n New York CitiJ but on a national scale as well. 
It is, therefore, requested that authority be 
granted for a telephone surveillance at the above loc~tion. 
The telephone, concerning which coverage is requested, is 
listed in the name of~onald Morris, a known BPP member 
in the New York area:-.(
