Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening 
of an investigation into a domestic group. 
Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the 
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving 
violence? 
Mr.Kelley. To open a domestic security case. 
Mr. Schwarz. Yes. 
Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist 
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities 
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where 
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic 
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious 
federal crime involving violence? 
Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and 
they have been well defined as to what is the possible 
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been 
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances, 
but there are other criteria that are used, yes. 
Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be? 
Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations 
2 ~ over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the t::., 
2 :: most used of the basis, and then you have, of course, some 
24 intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of 
25 short duration. If there is no showing of this into action
