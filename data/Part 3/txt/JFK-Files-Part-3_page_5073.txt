Dear Mike: 
As.a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director 
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and 
witnesses.for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's 
use of intelligence informants pnd sources, we would like 
to make the following requests. 
As discussed ·in our ·meeting with Mr~ Wann.all, we in­
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence 
informant and source program that could be inserted in 
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at 
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to­
present to the Select Committee a complete description 
of·its program and to discuss the.issues of particular 
interest to the Committee members. These include, for 
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program, 
including an assessment of the program
1
s cost and effective­
ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the 
intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal _ 
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when 
an informant may be used in an organization or group; and 
3) the program's command and· control system, including the 
limits that are placed on the activities of informants 
and the type of iI).formation an informant or source is per­
·mitted to -report to his handling agent and the Bureau. 
In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg­
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition 
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re­
view. To permit the Select Co1mnittee members to study this 
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it 
with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub 
lie· hearing, 't~e reque!.t,'\ that (l:he men1or~ndum be submitted
