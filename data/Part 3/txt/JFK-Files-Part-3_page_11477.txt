Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR: 
• 
Senator Church's allegations concerning the FBI's 
investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., are replete with 
inaccuracies, untruths, half-truths, exaggerations, distortions 
and opinions masquerading .. il.s facts. The Senator• s allegations 
!
illustrate his disregard for facts as duly sworn to and · 
documented (the testimony of Mr. Adams on 11/19/75) preferring 
instead to persist in certain. fixations and preconceptions of 
the SSC Staff. The entire King matter is currently under 
intensive Departmental review which includes Departmental 
access to· all FBI files. 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE: 
This refers to the fact hbat in 1969, the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) established a special staff used to gather 
intelligence on dissident groups. The legitimacy of this 
procedure is something for the IRS to answer. 
OPERATION CHAOS: 
Senator Church criticizes the special operation group 
formed in CIA to explore possible ties between hostile foreign 
nations and domestic dissent within the U. S. CIA's defense 
to this operation has been the fact that they were doing this in 
response to direct instructions from the President. 
ILLEGAL MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS: 
Much has appeared in the press regarding the sti-called 
illegal mail opening programs conducted by both CIA and FBI. 
This is currently the subject of a very intensive investigation 
by the Department of Justice and both the FBI and CIA are 
cooperating with Departmental attorneys in an effort to determine 
whether there is any criminal culpability on the part of FBI 
and CIA employees.
