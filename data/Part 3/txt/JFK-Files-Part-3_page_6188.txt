need to use the names of IP$ personnel who cooperated with 
the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities. Those names 
were made available to us for our use. 
As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake 
here is the investigation of serious breaches of the 
security and confiden~iality of iµformation obtained by 
the FBI. Such information was apparently disclosed or 
"leaked" for the purpose of disruption. The full extent· 
of such disclosures in many of the cases, s~ch ~s the 
efforts to discredit Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is still 
unknown. Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry 
into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the 
FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality. 
The Committee has a clear mandate and a firm commit­
ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted to 
harass and discredit individuals. • The integrity of this 
investigation depends upon our ability to conduct inter­
views without the appearance of outside interference. 
Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting 
the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if 
you do, please contact me by Tue
11, October 21.
