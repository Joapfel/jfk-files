~CTORE, S. ''Double Agent" (DA) is a commonly and frequently 
used term in the field of espionage and counter­
intelligence. In the Bureau's activities in these fields, DAs are a distinctive 
MILLER: 
group of Security Informants (Sis) utilized against foreign intelligence operations 
in the United States. "Potential Double Agent" (PDA) is a unique term used by 
DID to identify an individual under development as a DA; one who is in contact 
with a foreign intelligence officer but who has not yet been solicited by his foreign 
contact to perform clandestinely or covertly for the benefit- of the foreign intelligence 
group.

reviewed to determine the extent of supervision afforded PDAs. A similar 
reviw 1was conducted last i~spection. It is realized, however, that a comparison 
is not.possible in view of recent DID instructions regarding the administrative handlin 
of all SI and PSI files. 
Subsequent to last inspection DID established procedure whereby 
those SI cases requiring day-to-day supervision or PSis still under investigation 
should remain in active status; informant-type cases requiring only periodic 
review are closed and placed on administrative tickler, to be made pending 15 
·days after the six-month justification letter is due. DA and PDA files are 
included in these categories. 
During the last inspection 1afiles were reviewed. Included 
in that group were PSis and DESECOs, and not limited to PDAs. All of the files 
were then in a pending stat~. During this inspection there were ...2.§. files on 
PDAs' in a pending status and.ll!_PDA files in a closed status. These were strictly 
PDA files and did not ind ude other PSis or DESECOs. It has been determined 
• that at any given time there will probably be approximately 70 such cases in a 
pending status, if the number of such investigations in the field remains constant. 
Of the 65 pending files, 98, or 89%, were reviewed. Of these, 
22, or 38% contained specific instructions, directions or other guidance to the field
