Memorandum to Mr. W. R. W annall 
Re: General A_ccounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations 
62-56866 
Verification 
The Comptroller General read from his prepared testimony and was 
interrupted occasionally for questions. The initial pertinent comments and ·questions. 
by Chairman Don Edwards were directed at eliciting a statement from Staats 
that the denial of direct access to FBI files for the purpose of independent 
verification was unique in GAO's audi_t history and that, because of this, 
\ 
GAO was unable to completely assure Congress as to the accuracy of their 
survey. GAO indicated they still felt that they had valid audit. They w~re 
~forded the opportunity to interview FB~ officials and case Agents and had 
no reason to doubt the accuracy of the summaries. They were not impuning 
the motives of the FBI or the Attorney General in denying acc(;!ss; they under­
stood the principle involved, but insisted that verification was necessary. 
Mr. Edwards mentioned th_e House may subpoena the necessary FBI files to 
permit verification. Mr. Fogel of GAO replied that GAO would prefer the 
files on which summaries were prepared be shipped to FBI Headquarters 
where the GAO could conduct their random verification proposal .

FBI-Prepared File Summaries 
Mr. Staats stated that GAO's testimony and preliminary review 
was based on 676 FBI case summaries in the Subversive and/or Extremist 
field out of a projected 899 from 10 FBI field offices.. In response to specific 
·questions from Mr. Drinan, he and Mr. Richard Fogel, GAO, indicated that 
GAO had received more than the 676 summaries (they had received as of 
9/24, 852 out of 899), but that in order to prepare for testimony, their analysis 
I 
was based on the 676. Drinan attempted to est~lish that the FBI was ~ .. 
delaying or dragging its feet in providin,g the othe:i: summaries. GAO 
replied that most FBI field offices have been extremely cooperative in the 
time-consuming job of preparing summaries. (GAO did not identify pub~icly 
the FBI office which they did not consider completely cooperative--Spri:ngfield.
