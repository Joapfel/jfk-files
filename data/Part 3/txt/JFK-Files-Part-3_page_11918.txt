~i.nce the Summer of _1969, New Left extremists 
have becoati(,1- increasingly identified as Marxist-Leninist 
revolution~~ies, and have utilized extreme violence in 
effort to ~chieve their purpose. In the period since the 
last inspe-..~tion, the prosecution of these revolutionaries 
has conti~;~ed to be one of our primary objectives, to the 
end that i~dividual terrorists are neutralized and their 
organizat~~ns are isolated; leaderless; and finally defunct.· 
We have h.'l.:il significant accomplishments in this regard. On 
April 2, :~70, 12 leaders of Weatherman {the most violent 
faction 0~ Students-for a Democratic Society) were indicted 
in Chicag~ on Federal Antiriot Law (ARL) charges. Other 
Weatherm~~ leaders were indicted on local charges and became 
Bureau fug-... ti ves. The Weatherman organization has gone 
undergroun\~ and has taken extreme measures to avoid apprehension.

• -On July 23, 1970, in Detroit, Michigan, indictments 
were obta:..~ed against 13 Weatherman leaders for violation of 
Fede:ral ~~,bing and gun control statutes. Five of these 
-indiv idua.:.,:s have since been arrested or have surrendered. 
:Other Weatherman 1·eaders remain in fugitive status 
and inten~~ve efforts to locate them continue. Already these 
indictmen(~ and arrests have had a noticeable effect on the 
Weatherm~~ organization. Bernardine Dohrn'""' a Weatherman 
leader wnQ- in May, 1970, had ae'ctare'a a ·state of war against 
the U. S. _ announced in December, 1970, that Weatherman had 
made a "'n..!..litary error" in tending to consider only "bombings 
and pick:::..z-.-.;~ up the gqn as revolutionary."_ Weatherman has 
leaJ;"ned, -~onrn said, that a group of "outlaws" who are 
isolated ::--rom··the youth communities cannot grow to include 
large num.~~ers of people.
