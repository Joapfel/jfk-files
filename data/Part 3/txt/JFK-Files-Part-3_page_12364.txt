7. I have read with interest of the Special Weapons and Tactics 
course given under Bureau auspices at the Santa Rita Rehabili­
tation Facility in Alameda County. I would appreciate your 
forwarding to me a description of the activities undertaken in 
this course, and the relationship of UCPD and BPD to the course. 
In addition, I would appreciate being provided any relevant 
information on SWAT that you have available. 
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. I will look forward 
to your reply. 
ely,
