Memo Hauer to LaPrade 
Re: Destruction of Files and Records . 
Files and Communications Division 
state and Federal law enforcement organizations in cases other than FBI cases 
wherein positive identification was not effected are also purged. These files 
no longer possess sufficient reference or evidentiary value to merit retention. 
Administrative and noninvestigative records maintained in the various 
field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are purged also. This material 
is retained in the field offices until necessary action has been taken or it has served 
its purpose. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
That Office of Legal Counsel prepare an appropriate reply to Senators 
Mansfield and Scott to determine if their request not to destroy records and 
documents was intended to include the destruction programs enumerated above.
