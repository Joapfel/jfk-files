Meeting of December 27-28, 1962 
• I 
Dur.ing this: meeting of the PFIAB, and in the course of 
the discussions had with DCI McCone, the DCI made reference 
to the. ''MONGOOSE". program with respect to Cuba·. He said that 
Phase I qf the progra~ consiste~ of·obtaining intelligence 
on the possibilities for organizing and supplying resistanc~ 
grbups within Cuba. The DCI s~id that it had.not .yet been 
. considered an ap~ropriat~ time for the ·execution of plans for 
"violent actions ' of a sabotage nature within Cuba. Mr. • McCone had 
thought that such actions would_not be appropriate because of 
his o~~ speculation in August 1962, that the U.S. would be 
faced with MRBM's. In any case, the DCI said, the "MONGOOSE" 
' \ 
effort became diyerted by considerations of Soviet activities 
in Cuba. (

For use in cbnnection with the Board meeting of 
January 25--26, 1963, pr:imarily on the subject-of Cuba, 
A. R. Ash prepared a memorandum fbr 'the·file, dated January 11, 
1963, summarizing the results of a review of minutes of the 
Special NSC 5412/2 Gr_oup, and of the Special Group "Augmented" 
(the latter eroup including the Att.orney General, concerned 
with the ('MONGOOSE
11 
program directed at the Castro regime in 
Cuba). At the .August 4, 1962 meeting of the Special Group 
"Augmented'', the Attorney General sta~ed ~h~t the President 
felt that more priority should be giv~n to mounting sabotage 
operations, and. tbe Attorney General urged massive activity 
\'{i thin the entire. framework of the "MONGOOSE n program. It .. ,,.. .. -
was agreed ~hat one of the objectives· of the Special Group. 
"Augmented"., under the chairmanship of the· Attorney General, "-, 
would be to d~velop~new and imaginative approaches to the· / 
possibility of getting rid of the Castro regime. (The review 
of minutes of the Special NSC 5412/2 Group with respect to 
Cuba, reflected that this body was concerned primarily with 
reconnai~sance overflight questions during.the period leading 
up to the Sciviet missile crisis.) •
