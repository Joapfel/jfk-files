Foreign intelligence is not geographically 
restricted. Information regarding Chinese Communists 
can be obtained anywhere in the world, and even if it

significant value. The demand for information is 
heavy and is sought by every agency in the Government. 
Because of this, it has been necessary for the· , ,/ 
U. S .. Government to map a program of collection on 
a priority basis. This has been done through the 
creation of a committee which is attached to the • •

the capability of tapping all available sources on 
a current basis. . .. . . .
