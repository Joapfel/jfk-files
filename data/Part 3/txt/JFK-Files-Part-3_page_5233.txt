SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS 
' //,,1 /_~ 
INSPECTOR ARijQtJYC. LARSON: 
I 
The following comments, ·, 
v~r 
observations, recommendations 
and instructions are being made after an in-depth rev~e~ of 
a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter 
cases and administrative files along with conversations with 
supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to 
questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5): 
The San Francisco area is a 
haven to draft dodgers ·an·a this undesirable situation will 
not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for 
"bums,""hippies,
11 
and members of white and black extremist 
groups who come to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft. 
Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this 
undesirable situation. The indifferent attitude that the 
judges have displayed to date must be reversed towards a 
tough handling of Selective Service Act violators. Su9ervisory 
and Ag~nt !)P.r~nnn° 1 Tn1:at- !0? .. 5~nta.i~ a:1 3.;;rc:::::i ·.·::. ~=-:.i -:.:.::.::"!c ~~~ 
continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures 
by the United States Attorney 1 s Office and various Selective 
Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly 
prosecuted in the courts. Every technique available to the 
Bureau should be used to get the judges, United States 
Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation. 
~ggravated violators should be put in jail. 
There are 2,983 "hippie-ty:;>e 11 
cqmmunes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess 
of 20,000 population. 1,050 of these communes are located in 
the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of:10,000 
population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented . 
. Your office has eight subjects who have committed Selective _ 
Service Act violations that are members of white and black 
extremist groups. Every effort should be made to take these 
individuals out ofci~culation by placing them in jail. 
·Information concernina their activities with extremist arouos 
should be furnished t~ the probation officers so that they" 
can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All 
Agents handling ~acial Matters and Selective Service Act 
~atters should be perio~ically reminded to be on .the alert
