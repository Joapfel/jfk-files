The Ac1: attempted to attack organized crinie by making 
criminal the mai:iagement of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting 
racketeering activity characteristic of or~anized crime including the 
use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises . 
. Tfie long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers 
were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments 
did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains 
.the task. of establishing the identities of those constituting the national 
menace and developing prosecutable evidence ·of their guilt. "Criminal 
intelligence" collection is one means by ,vhich this responsibility may 
be fulfilled. It :may be the only practical 1neans in view of the scarcity 
of witnesses willing to testify and of ·the high mortality potential of those 
who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in 
United St::?.tes v. Addonizio, 451 F2d 4~ (::$rd L:1r. 1912) where u v1·u~}Jc~~~, c·

• • • . Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical 
necesstty, the issue remains as to its propr:Lety in i.he face of Constituticn2.l 
protections. ·If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a 
Constitutionaily protected right of privacy that rnay be overcome only 
through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue 
will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only dra\lffi upon the concept 
of Constitutional privacy to re~olve cases involving special_ circumstances 
such as n1a.rital affairs (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (19G5) ) and 
interception of communications (Katz v. United States~ 389 U.S. 347 (19G7) : .. . .. 
More specific Constitutional limitations on. the criminal 
intelligence function inay be found in }he First A1n:enciment protections of 
speech a.nd assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasanabie 
searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amencln1cnt privilege against 
compu_lsory self-incrimination. 
The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on th 
relationship between these rig-hts anc] the collection of criminal intclligm ce 
is that, when in direct eonflict, the collection efforts must yield. Such is . ,
