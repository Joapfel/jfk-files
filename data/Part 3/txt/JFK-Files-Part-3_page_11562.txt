For example, in the Fall of 1970 we undertook to 
determine through an Automatic Data Processin (ADP) project 
. whether EASTCON principals had established a long distance 
telephone communication network. The basis for this theory was 
information received from our informant, PH 1211-S, who advised 
that fictitious telephone credit card numbers were being utilized 
by members of the Ber;-i~~a,antiwar movement to facilitate contacts. 
This project disclosed voluminous calls between EASTCON principals 
and between them and sympathizers from their own telephones and 
also corroborate the fraudulent use of fictitious telephone credit 
card numbers. This information was of value tot he Department in 
the examination of witnesses before the FGJ since it placed 
witnesses in a position of either admitting contact between each 
other on specific dates, committing perjury, or claiming the 
Fifth Amendmertt. This projec~ has more recently been extended 
and is now being utilized to identify individuals involved- in the 
Washington, D. c., plots of the EASTCON case through "nonhit" 
telephone toll calls between EASTCON activists and persons not 
previously known to have been active in the movement. It is 
believed that recent information from this project, developed 
f~rt!!er by :!.~vestig~t~.on, J-i~i=; ide.nti.fi.e.d. ~ Capitol Hill elevator 
operator who was recruited for these plots. The project is a 
continuing one, and the investigation of pertinent developments 
hopefully will identify an engineer who was consulted on the 
tunnel plot, as well as other individuals involved in the 
Washington, D. c., action. The very technical· nature of the 
raw material developed by the ADP project has resulted in 
:individuals at the Bureau and certain offices such as Philadelphia, 
New York, Baltimore, and WFO having become well versed and 
particularly adroit in the interpretation of such complicated 
information. 
The investigation of EASTCON includes the handling of 
two informants; the first, ,~!I !~ll,-;-§• is the individual who will 
be· responsible for the introduction of the most convincing 
evidence against all of the defendants - the letters between 
Ph.i3i,i~...&Jl~ and Elizabeth McAlist..,e,x which relate to every 
count in the indictment. Since the testimony of this informant 
before the FGJ, he has ·become theoretically the responsibility of 
the Department, -as a Government witness, but of necessity, the 
Bureau has coordinated his activities, etc., because of his 
peculiar status until he testifies at trial. He is currently
