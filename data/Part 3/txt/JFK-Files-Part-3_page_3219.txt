The Chairman.. What I worry about is this. You say there's 
no way to know when to close a file. These were surveillance 
files, or originally opened up to determine whether organizatio s 
might have subversive connection~. 
There are names in these.files, so some demagogue comes 
along and says against some public figure that his name is 
contained in a certain file to be found in the subversive 
fil~s of the FBI and there it is. II€:. has not made a misstateme t 
at all. But to the :American pe,ople that man-'s name and 
raputati~n has baen scarred. 
Mr. Adams.· And I hope this Committee recogniz-es tha~ 
and recommends legislation that would enforce strong punitive 
or criminal violations against misuse of information in the 
files. We feel this way, CIA feels this way. We recognize 
we have a lot of sensitive information in it. We fire our 
.employi:es if we find them misusing inform~tion. We fs.el 
w~ need additional sanctions in this area. 
I don't think we can ever stop the accumulation 0£ 
information. I don't know an investiga~ive agency in the 
world, a law enforcement agency, that does not have to 
accumulate information. _And we are working on guid~lines 
as to how to get rid of the irrelevant information, how to 
eliminat~ material t..~at really does not need to be kept, 
al 
that \ve hope we will :be able to come to ·Congress with these 
guidelines before too long, which will help address itself
