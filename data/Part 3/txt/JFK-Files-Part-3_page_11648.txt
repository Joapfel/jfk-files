PROTEST AND TROTSKYIST GROUPS UNIT 
\ 
May Day Collective {MDC) 
Prior to May, 1971, MDC was the hard-core youth activist 
group of the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice {PCPJ) and was 
the main force behind massive civil disobedience in Washington, n.c. 
There has been a definite split between the two groups over the 
question of violence which is favored by MDC. Following regional 
conferences in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Washington, D.C0 , MDC 
held a national conference in Atlanta, Georgia, 8/13-17/71 to map 
its fut\.lre course and to pl'an antiwar activity for the Fall of 1971. 
By airtel to all offices dated 7-26-71, the field was instructed 
to determine the existence of MDC organizations in the respective 
divisions and to furnish all available information to Bureau by 
8~30-71 with comments regarding extent of coverage. Potential for 
violence by MDC was emphasized, and the field was alerted to 
possibility of violations of Federal laws. 
Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) 
Letter tc all off::.~es d2.ted 8-3-,...71 :i. ~i=;t,..,t~ted P.a,ch office 
to initiate a survey to determine existence of VVAW. This action 
was necessary in the light of increasing indication that the VVAW 
may be a target for infiltration by subversive groups such as the 
Communist Party, USA, and the Socialist Workers Party and their 
respective youth groups. VVAW has also been involved in aiding and 
financing u.s. deserters, including false identity papers and 
reportedly in one area has a cache of arms. VVAW has become 
increasingly active in the antiwar field and must be considered 
a prime target for infiltration.

constant supervision and review at the Seat of Government. It
