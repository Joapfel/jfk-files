Productivity 
.• As of 6/30/71, London had 333 -pending cases, 
the largest number per agent of any office except Ottawa. 
Ninety-one persons wanted in the United States were located 
by the office during fiscal 1971 and 4 "informal deportations" 
were arranged despite the British insistence upon formal 
legal procedures. As of 8/23/71, London had submitted 20 
items for HILEV dissemination 11 of which were accepted. 
This is slightly below average.

this will still leave London with an above average number 
of cases per man. We believe that the Bureau gets high value 
for its investment in the London Office.
