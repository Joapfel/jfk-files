cannot collect or maintain anything unless it is relevant to 
. -an ongoing matter of which we have investigative jurisdiction. 
But beyond even the Privacy Act, t11e Attorney General 
institu~ed a guidelines committee in this area that we have 
been meeting diligently with every ~ay .and hopefully hava 
tri-ed to avoid this ideq that we are for no good reason 
maintaining a gossip, scandal, and unncessary, irrelevant 
mate~ial. 
So once these. guidelines are in some sort of final 
form, not to be adopted, then the Attorney.General ha~ 
indicated that he is going to take it up with the various 
Congressionql committees to get their i~put into it, after 
which they will be published. 
Senator Goldwater. Well, now these dossiers, I think 
you can call them that probably. 
Mr. Adams. I prefer not to, but I accept the fact that 
that is how they a~e referred to. 
Senator Goldwater. What do you call them? 
~- Ad~ms. I call them files. To me, I guess we all 
have our little hang~ups, but to me that is usually used in 
some sinister connotation. It is probably not to you. - But 
I will use whatever terminology you want to use on this . 
Senator Goldwater. I hope what you have on me is not 
called a dossiar . 
Mr. Adams. No, ~dJ;, it•~ a coJ_lection of material.
