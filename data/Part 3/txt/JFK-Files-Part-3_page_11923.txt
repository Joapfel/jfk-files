Boris Mikhaylovich Orekhov was a correspondent in 
New York City ~~~~J?J,.,.i~~~~~Y-..fl.~rfi~oiit'"June, 
1968, to July 7 7 1970. Based on the results of FBI investigation: 
on the latter date he was expelled after the Department of State 
informed the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C., on June 24, 
1970, that Orekhov had engaged in activiti~s incompatible with 
his status ~ .... .i£u..,:i:,u~ .. .:!-~ His departure from the. u1;i ted States 
was requested. Orekhov departed July 7, 1970, depriving the 
Soviets of the presenc7;"°in the U. S. of a very active intelli­
gence officer. 
In a similar case, also as a result of our investi­
gations, on November 6, 1970, State informed the Soviets of the

In an interesting and successful counterintelligence 
operation, the Soviets were forced to remove ~~g~.A;b,~,_Y.fil§Jl.i4b~ 
a KGB officer 1 from the United Nations Secretariat and send him 
home. ~$...b.i~ had been in contact with sources under our control 
in the aerospace field. In September, 1970, the "arrest" of one 
of our sources during a meet with Yelsh.i.u..,.was staged. Subsequently, 
Yelshin was contacted by our Agents concerning his intelligence 
activitias. Although Yelshin had not completed the term of his 
contract with the UN Secretariat, he returned home with his 
fam~ly, at Soviet expense, on 11/1/70. 
In a pending case, our investi"gation has established 
violation of U. S. immigration laws by an individual known to be 
a KGB agent. He has denied affiliation with the Soviets 1 but has 
admitted immigration fraud. INS and State have initiated action 
to have him dismissed from the UN Secretariat and expelled from 
the U.S.
