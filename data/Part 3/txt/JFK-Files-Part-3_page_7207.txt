II. The American Intelligence Process 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to cover briefly the American

-by many quarters who associate it almost exclusively with the 
spectacular images of James Bond, ·Mata Hari, or even Maxwell 
-lectual exercise that encompasses the following steps: 
1. The collection and assembly of raw informa­
tion from all sources available to the U.S. Govern­
ment, ranging from overt news dispatches to data 
from the most secret technical devices or agen~s; 
2. The assessment of the validity of the raw

development of 0bjective conclusions and judg­
ments; and 
4. The presentation of the findings to policy 
makers in a clear, succinct, and timely fashion.
