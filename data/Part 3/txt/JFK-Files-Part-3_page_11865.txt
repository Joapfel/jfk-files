SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
SUPERVISION AND CONTROL OF SECURITY INFORMANT 
DEVELOPMENT AND COVERAGE BY INTERNAL SECURITY 
AND NEW LEFT SECTIONS 
. ! -11~ ' w lECTOR E. s. MILLER: At the time of the last inspection a 
suggestion was submitted (pages 227 -
233) pointing out advantages in implementation of a program in this area of 
operation which would make our approach to both above types of informants 
and Extremist (Racial) informants uniform. You agreed to implement for 
one year; however, your subsequent efforts to initiate the program were lost 
in a "security of transmitting problem. " 
Your Extremist Intelligence Section solved the same- problem by having 
the fieid send their i11.fu1:ma11t reports· to ·the Burea~ by sc~'.!!'C t8letype ar..d. 
it is understood that method of handling is satisfactory. The overall 
Extremist Informant Program also appears productive. 
_ It is recommended that you again favorably consider the prior suggestion 
and tailor implementation after its counterpart in the Extremist Section. 
Administration of such a program should be more efficiently handled now 
since you have reinstituted handling of ,.these informants by a Security 
Informant Unit. • 
Comments of Assistant Director BreJnan requested. • 
ASS~STANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNAN.rf\/This suggestion will.be 
{JAS:cb - 8/27/71) • :\J.v favorably considered. 
• A careful analysis will 
be conducted to tailor the suggestion to the needs of the 
Sections affected, keeping uniformity in mind. This matter 
will be closely followed by me.
