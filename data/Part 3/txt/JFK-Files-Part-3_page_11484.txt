Certainly, the present Attorney General is a man of 
integrity. He has voiced his concern several times over re-
garding the abuses which have come to light through the inves,,, 
tigations of the past year. He has been helpful to the .S~1J{~r 
Committee by providing documents and other information. 
fu11 confidence in his good intentions and his respect for the 
law. 
Nonetheless, the Attorney General faces an unfortunate 
dilemma. Since the Federal Bureau of Inve~tigation is a sub­
division of the Justice Department, ~t lies within the admin-is­
trative responsibility of the Attorney General. He is thus 
placed in a position of investigating the very house over which 
he must preside. 
It is not only the actuality of impartiality which is, at 
·stake. The appearance of impartiality i.s just as important. 
The American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice provide 
that a prosecuting officer should have no conflict of interest 
or the appearance of a conflict of inter~st. As Chesterfield 
Smith, past president of the ABA, has not~d, "Under the Standards., 
it would be improper for an investigation ... of the Executive 
Branch ·of the Federal Government to be conducted by a prosecutor 
subject to the direct ion and control of the _President. 11 
The fact that the FBI is· a part of the Jus-tice Department 
is no~ the only troubling aspect of this situation -- though it 
is serious enough since, over the years, senior-F.BI officials 
and Justice personnel have had close contact.:i,n their daily work 
and have shared knowle.dge of t-he dubious. acti,v:i,ties brought to 
light by the Select Committee inquiry. _The Justice Department 
and the CIA have also had a unique relationship.· A secret agree­
ment between the two was in effect for twenty :--;ears which exempted 
the Agency from the usual requirements of reporting to Justice 
any violations of the law amonp; CIA personnel.
