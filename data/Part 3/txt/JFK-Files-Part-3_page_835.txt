Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
The Deputy Attorney General - Designate 
Howeve1·. we recognize that these two documents may 
assist the Department in analyzing our proposal concerning the issuance 
of an Executive order and therefore I am enclosing a copy of the two 
documents requested by I1/Ir. Goldklang. We request that these documents 
. not be disseminated outside the Department of Justice; that the documents 
not be duplicated or photographed; and that, if possible, they be returned 
to the FBI after they have served their purpose. 
If you, or members of your staff, feel that additional infor­
mation would clarify our proposal, it is suggested that consideration 
be given to arranging conferences between members of your staff and 
.the FBI officials in the Intelligence Division and our Legal Counsel's 
Office who have conducted considerable research into the matter.
