Mr. Adams. Okay. Because there would be one. I would 
say the judgment in approving that is in question. But out 
of 3000 recommended, the fact that 2000 approved shows that 
there was some concern to try to.keep these to a proper level, 
and I think the actual number of grossly improper activities 
fortunately is rather small. I think there are a lot in there.

Mr. Adams. Well, the·main recommendation I make is that

years that one time in. our history. Congress. is saying we ought 
to be doing.something to stop.violence in the streets, murders, 
blowing up.of buildings,. and at another. time they are saying 
you shouldn't have done.what you did, and that we make a 
mistake when we react and try to identify one area and say that 
is the voice of the people. What we need is a legislative 
mandate which is the will of Congress in order to tell us what 
(fl 
our role- should be in this area. I think that is the main 
' 
thing ·that would come out of all of these, I hope, some more
