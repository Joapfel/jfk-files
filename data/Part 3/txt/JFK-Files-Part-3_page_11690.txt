In line with the fluctuating membership in the 
various black extremist organizations, we have constantly 
adjusted our informant coverage. This can be seen very 
clearly with the most violent of the black extremist groups, 
the Black Panther Party. At the time of the last Inspection 
BPP membership was 1,000, and we afforded coverage of these 
1,000 members with 173 informants which represents 17.3 percent 
of the membership. The present membership is Z.1.Q.., anctwe have 
156 informants reporting on these individuals which represents 
-21.7 percent of the membership. This is a net increase of 
informant coverage to total membership of 4.4 since the last 
Inspection. This also ind_icates our aims and purposes of 
penetrating these organizations with the most qualified 
informants and keeping within the policy of operating the 
informant program in a very efficient manner. 
At the time of the last Inspection we were operating 
~informants furnishing information concerning white extremist 
organizations, and as of 7/31/71 we are operating ~informants. 
Tµis is in keeping with the current membership of the Klan and 
white hate organizations. 
By memorandum dated 2/19/71 from G. C. Moore to 
•Mr. C. D. ,Brennan captioned "Penetration of Black Extremist 
Groups in Canada, Racial Matters" it was recommended and 
approved that this Bureau attempt to penetrate the clack extremist 
activities in Cana~ due to the close working relationship 
being developed between the extremists in that country and the 
United States. We made ava}lable to th-~~ R~~$J;!&IJ.aB-~an~S,_'lJ!l--t~§
