Trotskyite said that the Cuban Government ought not 
to allow those who wanted to leave to do so since they ~= 
might be dangerous wh~n they got to Argentina. The

group, one of whom loaded a rifle, intending to shoot 
: the Trotskyite. The shooti~g was prevented but the

withdrawal of the Peronists and the Vanguard Socialists 
so that they could return to Argentina. That evening 
the trainees left for Habana, where they were housed in

the trainees, because of their semi-abducted situation,

men left the house\ without permission, intending· to take 
a walk; they were told by Ulises (lnu), a Negro member 
:Tr of G-2, that. they ~ould not go out without the permission 
of the Cuban Government. They said that they wished to 
deal directly with'the Cuban Government concerning their 
return home since they did not wish to have anything to 
~. do with Co~ke, who they thought was deceiving them.
