Memorandum. W. R .. Wannall to Mr. J. A. Mintz 4/ 11/7 5 ~ I 
recommended that a draft o-f_the proposed Memorandum of Understanding 
concerning cl~arance""i,rocedures ·for Staff Members of the caption~d -~ 
Committees be coor~inated with qentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) an<l~ 
other appropriate members of the intelligence commu~ity. . v'-
On 6/2/75 the draft Memorandum of Understanding was dis- ~ 
cussed by SA L. F. Schwartz with Mr. John M. ,Clarke, Associate ~ 
Deputy, Intelligence Community Staff, and Mr. Donald E. Moore, \ 
Chairman, Security Committee, U.S. Intelligence Board, who advised 
that the draft had been reviewed by CIA and by the Security ~ 
Committee on behalf of the intelligence community. They requested~ 
that the draft be revised in order to recognize the need for certa:in 
Staff Members to be cleared for access to compartmented informat:Ei~ 
(a procedure already being followed by the Church Committee) and~• 
the desire of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) that it~' 
be made clear that the DCI will only offer his advice upon the t1 
request of the Committee Chairman and that in all cases the fina18-
determination as to c1earance is the responsibility of th~ 5ommiti=E 
Chairman. _ (// ~

Attached is a revised draft of the Memorandum of ~ 
Understanding incorporating the qhanges proposed by Mr. Clarkeand~ 
Mr. Moore which changes are. undersc0red. Both Mr. Clarke and 
Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's Committee 
was already following the procedures outlined in the Memorandum of 
Understanding, and had completed the Committee Staff, it would be 
inappropriate to furnish a ,1ft'B.tt-of the Memorandum of Understanding 
to Senator Church; ) • Do /.,..f-. L _
