KEY BLACK EXTREMIST PROGRAM 4-H 
Key Black Extremist (KBE) Program initiated 12/23/70 
with Director's approval to intensify investigative coverage 
of selected black extremists throughout United States who are 
extremely active and most vocal in their calls for terrorism 
and violence. Ninety individuals are currently on the KBE 
list, including such persons as Sto~~U-~ ..... c~~]., .lJ~~JS!ffeWJ:~lb 
and David Hilliard. 
~~:.:;I 
Objective of program is to develop complete and 
detailed information on the day-to-day activities and future 
plans of KBE individuals. Investigative summary report is 
required followed by investigative report every 90 days. 
All KBE individuals are included in Priority I of 
Security Index. Each is included in the Black Nationalist 
Photograph Album. All aspec·c.s of their finances are determined. 
Their handwriting specimens are placed in the National Security 
File in the Laboratory Division. Their fingerprints are 
included in the Black Extremist Section of the Single Fingerprint 
File in the .Identification Division. Particular attention is 
paid to their travel. Possible criminal violations are 
vigorously ~ursued. Emphasis is placed on obtaining record of 
their inflammatory statements. High level of informant coverage 
on each individual is required. 
Supervision of KBE investigations is handled on the 
individual desks and additions to and deletions. from KBE list 
must be approved by Bureau. Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of 
the type whose investigation would ordinarily require close 
supervision by Bureau supervisors, the administration and 
supervision of this program entails only a minimum amount of 
time above that which would ordinarily be expended on the 
supervision of the cases of these persons. 
Continuation of this program wili be justified in 
December, 1971.
