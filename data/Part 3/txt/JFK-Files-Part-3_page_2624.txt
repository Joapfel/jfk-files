you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a 
third party making a judgment as to whether the intrusion is 
warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand 
·your position. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator ·Hart. 
(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.) 
The Chairman. Senator Baker, do you have questions? 
Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect-for you and your 
organization and I personally regret that the organization is 
in political distress, but we've both got to recognize that 
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the 
government. 
I think you probably would agree with me that even though 
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects 
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives 
us an indication of our future direction and the opportunity, 
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of 
the government itself. 
With that hopeful note, would you be agreeable then to 
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on hm-1 to improve 
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or 
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the govern.'1len, 
to the Congress, to the Attorney Gene~al, to the President, and 
NW 38608 Docld:329 20. 29
