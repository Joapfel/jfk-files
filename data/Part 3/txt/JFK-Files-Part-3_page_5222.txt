The following comments 
are based on a review of 
information 9£ pending 
files and interviews 
: . 
Investigation by your office revealed the existence 
of two LCN 11 families

within your territory. Membership 
within these "families 11 total 64 individuals. Your 
investigation revealed neither "family" is considered to be

The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

office .

Although p~ostitution, gambling and narcotic activities 
exist within your division, there is no indication from your 
investigations that these operations are controlled by either 
the LCN or other organized groups. Your investigations 
should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your 
office will be aware of any illegal operations within vour 
division. This is particularly true in regard to gambling 
activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30 . ...
