In April, 1963, we received information indicating 
that CIA Director John McCone was considering expansion of 
CIA operations in the United States-~ specifically intelligence 
coverage and the development of sources in this country. Tho 
Director made a note on the memora·ndwn recording this: "McCone 
is trying to do another 'Donovan.~ If he injects himself into 
the U. s., the FBI gets out. Too many cooks spoil the broth." 
In December, 1963, the Director inquired as to the 
nature and extent of intelligence operations wherein CIA had 
established contact with a diplomat, operated him in the U. s. 
with our coordination, and continued to operate him upon his 
having departed this country. Four such cases were cited. On 
the memorandum, the Director noted: "I have little confidence 
in CIA abiding by agreements if it serves its purpose better 
not to ·cto so." • 
In January, 1964, CIA advised us it had reorganized 
~ts activities in the U. S. The Domestic Operations Division, 
·crA, had established field offices in this country under 
. appropriate cover o A memorandum was prepared describing the 
hisi;ory o:f ··c-IA ope:1 ... a.civus i;., tli& ~c 3. and rec::;:::.~s~d.i~g !?..~"tit::'~ 
designed to protect our interests. A letter went to CIA with 
ground rules which the Bureau expected CIA to follow in all 
matters requiring coordination. The Director noted: "OK, but 
I hope you are not being taken in. I can't forget CIA 
withholding the French espionage activities in the u. s. nor 
the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only 
to mention two of their instances of double dealing." 
The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64.p ·S"et forth 
its observations concerning a brieting given that office on the 
matter of CIA opera~ions in the U. S. The Director commented: 
"I think this domestic operations expansion of CIA is yery 
• ... dangerous and will inevitably 'muddy' the waters." 
In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsider.ed its stand 
with respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreign 
establishments in the United States for intelligence purposes. 
The ,following policy.was proposed and subs~quently approved:
