SPECIAL COORDINATION UNIT 
During December, 1970, six new foreign offices were 
established. As a result of personnel moves, 19 Special Agents 
and 16 clerks were transferred to foreign offices each requiring 
passport, visa, and Department of State and Embassy notifica­
tion. The numerous contacts with State and the outgoing 
letters (two for each person transferred) were handled in 
this Unit, together with the memoranda and notification to 
the White House regarding various phases of the operation. 
A special one-week indoctrination session was arranged and 
attended by most of the new Special Agent personnel. The 
Director's instructions that the expansion take place were 
issued 11-20-70. Each of the new offices was open and opera­
ting during December, 1970. 
Through liaison with appropriate officials at the 
White House, the interest of those officials in proposed 
legislation which would provide increased retireme~t benefits 
for FBI personnel has been maintained. The advice of these 
officials concerning channels to be used in promoting this 
legislation was secured and has been followed. 
Since the last inspection, SA ~~~has expedited 
and coordinated visits of the Director tothe White House on 
approximately six occasions. This has included meeting the 
Director, taking him to the meeting site, introducing him to 
persons present if not known to him, and assuring his return 
to his car by the most direct route following the meeting. 
Through carefully 6ontrolled contacts with the 
Commission on Campus Unrest, it was possible to secure a 
copy of their report in advance in order to'insure that there 
were no unfavorable comments concerning the FBI. The left­
wing staff o:i;. this Commission was very active in areas of 
direct interest to the Bureau, and SA Hay,,g.~§,,. was able to avoid 
any conflict and there were no derogatory references to our 
work made by this group. • 
'Direct personal liaison was established during the 
period with Washington representatives of two additional 
countries: .... IJ~JJ:~!8 ... 11~.J:~a~tJ1,:cAJ:r;~~~.a-;;an,ds""JA£~ ... ~l1~:r;,e.P,,,r..~­
