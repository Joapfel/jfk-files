6. Subject told our source that this "Government 
Official 11 did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security 
Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is. not too worried 
, concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it 
is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet 
~--- Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in Moscow 
--------he. feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his 
academic work to have contact with any officials. Our 
source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence 
with the Czech official. We have no description or name for 
the Czech official. 
7. It is requested that no further dissemination be 
made of this information without prior clearance from this 
office, and that our source be fully protected in the event 
that contact is made with RIHA.
