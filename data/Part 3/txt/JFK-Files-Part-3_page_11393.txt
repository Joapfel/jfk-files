Memorandum captioned as above, ~i12ii•;5, from Legal , 
Counsel to you, noted that you and Wannall were to meet with 
Mr. Hills and Mr. Phillip Buchen, Counsel to the President, 
on 3/28/75. Your addendum to the memorandum pointed out the 
results of this meeting and the various matters discussed. 
As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel 
Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr. James Wilderotter, 
who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating 
intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries 
underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was (}) 
given a briefing similar· to that which had been afforded to .,,,,.,,-:­
Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters J.­
of. a sensitive nature relating to the /ORCHIDl and similar prog~-­
electronic surveillances, specialized hand!ing of informants, 
and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records). Many of 
these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr. Wilderotter 
had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an 
Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman. 
•1 Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House 
that while raw FBI files should not be made available to the 
Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review 
a few such files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be 
established with the ~fflllittee. It was pointed out to him that
