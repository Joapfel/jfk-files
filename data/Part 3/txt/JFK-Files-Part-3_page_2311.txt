Dear Mike: 
• 
Information has come to the attention of the 
Committee which indicates the possibility that the FBI 
conducted heretofore undisclosed electronic surveillance 
of personnel of the executive office of the Prssident 
(possibly a Deputy.Director of the Budget Bureau) and that 
thi·s information was included on a list of names of persons 
subject to FBi electronic surveillance prepared for Attorney 
General Elliot Richardson in or about July 1973. 
Therefore, the Committee requests all material 
in the possession of the Justice Department or the FBI 
which may bear on the above. Please notify me by phone 
when any such material may be available. 
Sincerely, 
C /lr'i ti) .i ~~~
