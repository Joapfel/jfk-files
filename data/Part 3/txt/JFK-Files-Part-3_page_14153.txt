(~ 40. 7 /19/62 - 'Ihe NSC Spec 1al 5412/2 Group ( and later the ... _,:;-; President.) approved a proposal that U-2 flights over Cuba llbe con­
tinued at their current level of two a month". This recommendation \ 
\'las based on a memo from the DD/I to the DCI following a request i • 
made of the DCI on 7/10 by General Taylo~ who had asked for a compre­
hensive review of -~11 aerial photography activities. The justifica­
tion advancoo. for the DCI 's proposal that U-2 flightEJ ov~r Cuba be 
"continued at their current level 11 was (1) that earlier missions I 
over Cuba had provided "conclusive evidence that recur1

that "our most important need is for anr; evidence of the deployment ( (

41, 7/26-29/62 - Soviet ships carrying equipment and personnel 
for the Soviet buildup . in Cuba first began arri ·,:ing at Cuban ports. 
" .. , evidence gradually accumulated that the behavior pattern of 
these shj_ps ~.,as ..:imilar to that of Soviet ships carrying arms to 
9ther countries, that even greater security measures than usual were 
in effect, that a number of the ships were coming from the Baltic 
rather,than Black Sea ports, that some of th~se were passenger ships, 
and finally that there was a general movement of Bloc shipping toward 
Cuba on an unprecedented scale~ Apparently, the first recog1iition of 
unusual ~ctivity in any intelligence publication was a note in a 
daily review of economic intelligence for' CIA internal use . . . 
this paper stated on August 1, that 1at least some if not all of the 
ships involved probably are carrying.additional military equipment 
to Cuba'. This statement was in direct contradiction to NSA's 
comment on the same information, i.e., that it tended to corrobo:.--ate 
a report by the Brazilian Ambassador in Ha\:.na (earlier intercepted 
by NSA) that Raul Castro had asked the USSR to tcµ<e back excess war 
materiel. . . " • (Sourcet CIA Chronology·, 11/7 /62) 
42 .. August 1962 - '' ... It should be noted for the record that 
CIA • . ..,as in disagreement with DIA over interpretation of intelligence 
on the movement of shipping to Cuba throughout the month of August. 
The resulting difficulties in coordination of items for the Central 
Intelli~ence Bulletin (cm)'., held up publication from 3 August-to-
g Augus of the first item on this subject in that publication. AD 
late as 29 August, DIA in its own daily Intelligence Summary said 
;that 'The high volume of shipping probably reflects plannea increases 
1
1n trade between the USSR and Cuba ... ' There were further diffi­
culties resulting from CIA-DIA differences in the interpretation of 
photography of aircraft crates deck-loaded on Soviet ships; the 
record shows that CIA was right. Finally, it should be noted that 
there is a long h~dtory of CIA efforts to obtain better photpgraphy 
on deck car~oes' and faster service in.returning these pictures to 
Washington. (Source: CIA Chronology~ 11/7/62)
