While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review 
of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha' s 
disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum 
case. Briefly, since 1958 we have communicated to your Bureau 
significant information which relates to Riha 1 s involvement with 
Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron 
Curtain. I attach for your information and convenience copies of 
pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case. 
I hope sincerely that this recent incident will not im.pair our 
mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors 
possibly having a significant bearing on UoS. intelligence and internal 
security· interests. I shall pursue this matter through our respective 
liaison offices.

news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national 
scale. Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in
