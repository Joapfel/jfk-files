The Attorney General 
NOTE CONTINUED: 
Item 3 asked the FBI to "provide all memoranda or analyses 
prepared for the Justice Department, Director Kelley, or Assistant Director 
Wannall on the findings of the General Accounting Office as presented to the 
House Judiciary Committee on September 24." 
Referenced memorandum and LHM dated 12/24/75, were prepared 
as an initial response to the SSC. In this letter, the Bureau pointed out that 
extensive file reviews would be necessary to respond to most of the SSC 
requests: however, in it we stated a response to Items 2 and 3 would be 
forthcoming as soon as possible. 
Copy of the 12/18/75 request attached.
