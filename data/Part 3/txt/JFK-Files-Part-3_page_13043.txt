ON CHAIRMAN MAO TSE TUNG 'S DECLARATION 
OF 20 MAY, 1970 
In this declaration, Chairman Mao 
Tse Tung has set forlh a brilliant 
and timely analysis of the qvalita­
tively new situation that exists in the 
world as a result of the treacherous 
new acts of aggression launched by 
the fascist, imperialist Ni,con-
Chinesepeoples. 
This declaration pulls together into 
clear focus the revolutionary struggles 
and the liberation struggles of the peo­
ple of the whole world, including the 
revolutionary struggle of the American 
people themselves. 
speaking specifically for the Black 
Panther Party, but reflecting the 
sentiments of millions of oppressed 
people inside the United States, it has 
become crystal clear to us that 
rampant imperialist aggression on the 
international scale and vicious fascist 
repression on the domestic scale are 
the· two faces of the criminal govern­
ment of the United States and the 
calculated policy of the American 
ruling_ circles. For 400 years now, 
Black people inside the United States 
have been the long-stiffering victims 
of fascist violence and rePression. 
But under the Nixon-Pentagon clique, 
this reactionary violence and rePres­
sion has been escalated to newheights 
of barbaric cruelty. At the same time, 
in order to put down the already gi­
gantic and still growing mass move­
ment among White Americans against 
the wreckless and sanguinary poli­
cies and imperialist adventures of 
the U.S. government, the cowardly 
Nixon-Pentagon clique has unleashed 
a bloodbath against the American peo­
ple as a uizole, creating for itself 
new enemies who have joined hands 
with those who were already deter­
mined to carry out a struggle to the 
bitter end against an economic, polit­
ical, and social system that is do­
minated by the madmen in the 
Pentagon and that is responsible for 
the misery and bloodshed ali over the 
world today. 
Chairman Mao Tse Tung captures 
the truth of the situation when he 
points out the unprecedented isola-
160 
37 
lion of the Nixon-Pentagon clique. 
Never before have these criminals 
been so exposed and isolated as they 
are today. And never before has it 
been so clear that this criminality 
can only he ended by the people rising 
up to seize their own destiny from 
the handful/ of willful exploiters and 
murderers that now have the power 
in their hands. 
Coupling a revolutionary call to 
arms with revolutionary optimism in 
the assurance of victory, Chairman 
Mao Tse Tung, the great leader of 
the Chinese Revolution, hero and tea­
cher of the revolutionary people of 
the world, has performed an inval­
uable service to all mankind by step­
ping forward at this time to renew 
the people's indictment of the common 
enemy of us all--U.S. Fascism :znd 
Imperialist Aggression. These coura­
geous words of Chairman Mao Tse 
Tung will give new heart to the peo­
ples in their lonely anddif/icult strug­
gles to throw off the shackles and 
chains of oppression now being held 
in place by U.S. Fascism and Im­
perialism. 
Lastly, we wish to point out that 
only the enemies of the people and 
those who shirk their revolutionary 
duties and who are afraid of their 
own shadows will find fault with Chair­
man Mao Tse Tung's declaration. For 
our part, we welcome it, because we 
have learned, by shedding our blood, 
that only through relentless struggle, 
by resorting to arms inside the very 
house of U.S. Fascism and Imperial­
ism itself, can we gain our freedom 
and liberation. This is what our ex­
perience has taught us and this is 
the faith that will sustain us as we 
push forward our struggle •• 
LONG LIVE CHAIRMAN MAOTSETUNG! 
LONG LIVE THE VICTORY OF THE 
PEOPLES' WAR! 
DEATH TO THE U.S. FASCISM AND 
IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION! 
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
