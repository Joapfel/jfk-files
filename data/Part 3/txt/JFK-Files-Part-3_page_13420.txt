to embrace it on two or three occasions in Press conferences, 
and originally I believe it was President Eisenhower. 
To me, the domino theory is a euphenism for something 
else. The theoretical basis for it is the Marxist doctrine of 
the world revolution, and we at least ought to talk-about it 
in those terms. Is it. there, what are they doing about it, is 
this still a real matter in the real world, and not obscure it 
by talking about a power game?

to find points of agreement between ourselves and those who 
might become our adversaries. I think the process- ~f ~rying 
to find points of agreement like the Test Ban.Treaty and the 
15 Nonproliferation T~eaty, the Arms Limitation, the SALT talks 
16 and things of that sort, those are absolutely essential, but 
17 we ought not to be.under an illusion about it, and I am afraid 
18 there has been: .so much illusion around what we -are up against, 
19 and this is why I feel that the CIA and its capabilities are 
20 absolutely vital to the safety of the United States. 
21 And I think one of our problems now is how to 
22 maintain some capabilities in the present atmosphere and 
23 discuss these, and in the face of the various investigations 
24 which we anticipate, and the investigative reporting and all 
25 of the rest that goes along with it .
