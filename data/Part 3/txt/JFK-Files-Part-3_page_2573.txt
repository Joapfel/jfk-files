The Honorable Edward H. Levi 
Attorney General 
U.S. Department of Justice 
Washington, D. c. 20530 
Dear Mr. Attorney General: 
We have received a letter from Clarence M. Kelley, Director 
of the Federal Bureau of Inves.tigation, dated July 7, 1975, 
requesting to meet with us for a discussion of certain 
materials pertaining to the FBI which were compiled by the 
Commission·on CIA Activities Within the United States and 
may now be in the ·possession of the Select Committee. The 
Committee welcomes this opportunity for discussion with 
Mr. Kelley of these and other matters of concern both to 
the FBI and to the Committee. Our reply to Mr. Kelley is 
addressed to you because we believe it is essential that 
you participate in this meeting in order to arrive at a 
mutual understanding among the Justice Department, the FBI, 
and the Committee. 
Prompt-discussion is especially important because of the 
Committee's concern about the status of certain requests 
for documents. On May 14, 1975, the Committee wrote to you 
requesting documents pertaining to a number of areas of in­
quiry. The status of the May 14 request was considered by 
the full Committee on July 8, 1975. The Committee's review 
of the responses to this request indicates that, although 
certain documents have been supplied, others in areas of 
the most vital concern to the Committee are still outstand­
ing. A summary of the outstanding items from the May 14 
request is attached.
