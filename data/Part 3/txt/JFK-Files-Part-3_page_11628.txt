- WHITE HATE GROUPS

BACKGROUND, DATE OF INCEPTION AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES 
This program was initiated in September, 1964, 
for the purpose of counteracting and neutralizing white 
extremist organizations, leaders and adherents. During 
period January, February, and March of 1971, there were 
4-H 
17 field offices involved in this program and as specific 
situations arose, other divisions participated. 
THE UNITED KLANS OF AMERICA, INC., (UKA) 
Under the leadership of John Paul Rogers, 
~ Realm of Florida, the UKA·~rn-that area 
has become increasingly aggressive in recent months 
and has been afforded generally favorable coverage by 
the news media in Florida. In addition, .Rogers has been 
infuriated by r.ecent interviews of Klansman by the FBI 
and has been increasingly vehement in his verbal attacks

a primary subject for counterinteli"'igence activity. Tampa 
has instructed its informants to discredit.Jl.<),ger~ wherever 
possible without creating suspicion. 
_J,.o,.p.n_.galll-BQ~~~above has also recently 
devoted practically all of his energy to the UKA to the 
exclusion of his wife and job, having hired a retired 
barber to handle most of his business; yet he purchased 
a $19,000 home. Tampa is seeking ways to create suspicion 
of Rogers by other Klansmen. 
Imperial Wizard, Robert M. Shelton of the UKA 
has for some =f'ime e13™-a"'-ft"ehifpt':titgi:-wYt'11~t-success, to 
purchase polygraph machines in order to uweed out FBI 
informants." Chicago, with Bureau authority, interviewed 
~~t~r Y~£. .... P.~-;i.~kj~® past president of the American Society 
of Polygraph Examiners, in an effort to ascertain who we 
should logically contact in the polygraph field to prevent 
Sheltoa,and the UKA from purchasing this machine. Interview, 
which was handled in a discreet manner and in complete 
confidence, revealed that we should not expand this endeavor 
further at this time due to the large number of individuals 
and companies involved. In the event we learn of a specific 
firm or individual the UKA desires to con:tact·:for this 
purpose, further consideration will be given to this matter.
