Reference is made to the memorandum bLMr. Walters to Mr. Felt. 
dated 12/14/72; in captioned piatter. A review has been made of the units assign~::. 
to the Traintng Division from the former Crime Research Division, particularly 
. the Research and Service Section. ·As you know, • 
, has retired. I believe we can colliiolidate the Training Progr2.T;1, 
Processing Section and the Research and Service Section at FBI Headquarters 
into one section, calling it the Training Programs Processing and Research SectiG:::. 
This·\vould elilninate one section chief. • °' 
As you lrJ1ow, we have reccnnmended and ).t has been approved that t::~ 
Library in the Crime Research Section be moved to Quantico. It is my proposal

with the Research Uni~ leaving three units from the former Research and Service· 
Section; namely, the Research Unit; Special Productions Unit and Publications 
Unit. , • -
I have -discussed with J\1r. Callahan the transferring of the $U,ggest:2::.:=. 
Forms, Reports Management, 1vlanuals and Chief Clerk Matters to the Aclministrz.""~7~ 
Division and he is agreeable. This would mean an addition to his division of one 
Special Agent and seven clerical staff. The remaining units presently in the Tra.ir"..::::; 
Division would remain as is. • 
This would give the Section Chief _of the Training Division stationed 
at FBI Headquarters a total of, 18 Agents and 53 clerks under his supervision. I 
believe that current Section Chief_ -- . is capable of handling this 
assignn1ent as 8ection Chief, particularly if : is retained as 
Number Om 11:a.n of the Section. - - • has served as Number One :rvian in the 
former Research and Service Section of the Crim.e ResecJ,rch Diviston.
