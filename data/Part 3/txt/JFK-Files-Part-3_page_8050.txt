Commission 'by CIA. 
.. 
The Criminal Divisi0n -of the Department has received 
copies of the entire Rockefeller Commission file plus testimony. 
The Deputy Attorney General has ruled that these f.iles and · 
testimony cannot be .turned over to the FBI in toto until 
such time as the Criminal Division has ruled on any possible 
criminal culpability on the part of the FBI. T9 facili~te . 
th~ review of the Rockefeller Comni.:ilss:i,<;?n files, the 6riminal 
Division will separate out any infor~on it feels involves 
_any FBI crimipal culpability. That portion separateq. out 
I 
will be the E!Ubject of di·:;tc:us.sio.µ between die Pe:g_'l.l~Y Attorney 
General and tfie Directot: The remaining portion of the , 
Rockefelier files ,will then be turned over to the FBI for 
review to determine if any of the infor~tion contained therein
