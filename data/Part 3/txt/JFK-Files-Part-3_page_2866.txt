I believe we have lived up to those promises. 
The members and staff of this Committee have had unprece-
dented access to FBI information. 
You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type 
investigations and who are personally involved in every facet 
of our day~to-day intelligence operations. 
You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who 
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with 
all major areas of our activities and operations in the nation 1 
security and intelligence fields. 
In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these 
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the 
Congress. 
As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of 
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I 
credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the 
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's 
record of performance. 
' 
It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus 
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the 
organization. 
The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the 
lion's share of public attention and critical comment constitut d 
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.
