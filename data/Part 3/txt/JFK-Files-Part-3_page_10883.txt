• ·• B. INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY 
People who do not speak and understand a common 
language have difficulty in communicating their ideas. Even 
in a country such as ours where English is the common language,· 
words take on different meanings in different geographical 
locales and in different social, political, nn<l economic 
environments. Likewise, in professional fields, varying 
.~ackgrounds and experiences have conveyed different meanings 
: to terms in the professional vocabulary. 
, In the field of security, intelligence, and counter-
. intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has 
developed ostensibly to assist in the exchange of ideas by 
persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a 
fi~ld or a special segment of the field, new horizons develop 
which require additional terminology or cause an evolution in 
...... existing terminqlogy. This development or evolution in security 
.··.and intelligence terminolog½ coupled with individualistic usage, 
• brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the 
• broader aspects of the English language. We have all noted 
. ::-.:~ that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning 
•• •• and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are not 
.. misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.

·'.::-: . to the organization devoted to the collection and production 
• •• of information necessary to the government. In addition, 
it may pertain to the whole body of theory and practice on· 
the basis of which an intelligence organization operates. 
Finally, the word "intelligence" may be utilized to mean 
any part or all of the above.
