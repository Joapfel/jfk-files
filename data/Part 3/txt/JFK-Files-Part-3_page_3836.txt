C. Option Two -- A Separate Security Intelligence Agency 
. .. 
·cqngress might iive s~rious consider~tion to l~gislation 
creati_ng i separate Security Intelligence Agency within the 
:Justice Department. It w?uld perform the functions of the 
f 
present Counterintelligence Branch of the ~BI Intelligence 
Division; dealing with foreign int~lligence and counterintelli­
·gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has· considered this 
~ption as part of ihe larger question of separating all. FBI 
.i_ntelligence functions from tb~ law enforcement functibns of 
·the Bu~eau.~ (Tab ";E) 
A separate agency would l;>e justified only if it was 
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using 
different techniques than would other~ise be permitted. Ih 
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli­
ge~ce investigations should go b~yond investigation of specific 
·Crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should 
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
