that a reviewof~bo*tfi cases~ ine potential security informant 
and the intelligence officer against whom he is targeted, 
shows that these matters were afforded proper supervision at 
the Seat of Government. 
2. The field has and must have the primary responsi­

informants against communist intelligence officers. The nature 
and intensity of the direction of such potential security 
informants must be commensurate with the apparent authenticity 
of the informant's relationship to and course of conquct with 
the intelligence oificer against whom he is targeted. Over the• 
years it has been firmly established from both investigative 
experience and information obtained from defectors that anyone 
who is aggressively cultivating an intelligence officer is 
automatically suspected as being under the control of opposition

Therefore, it is believed there is no lack of proper supervision

3. It is respectfully submitted that there was no 
ne~essity for the Seat of Government to instruct the office of 
origin to disseminate to Baltimore information concerning 
Bokinsky and to obtain verification of his employment change 
·as t'iiese items were ·covered in investigation. As a matter of 
long-standing policy WFO has the responsibility for developing 
and handling source coverage against communist intelligence 
officers assigned to diplomatic establishments in the Washington, 
."D.C., area even though the source may live or work in suburban 
Maryland or Virginia. Review of the Bokinsky file shows that 
WFO by letter dated 3/17/70 to the Bureau""s't'ated that there was 
no record of information concerning Bokinsky available to the
