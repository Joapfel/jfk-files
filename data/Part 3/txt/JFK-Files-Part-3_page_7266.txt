PROCEDURES FOR THE AGENCIES CONTRIBUTION TO IEC ESTIMATES 
lo The INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC) has been 
charged with the responsibility of providing intelligence 
estimates to designated Government dep2rtments by effectively 
evaluating and anticipating problems of civil disorder. 
To evaluate a potential problem it will be necessary for 
IEC to re.quest each assisting agency to prepare an 
intelligence analysis. The analysis, in the form of 
evaluated contributio0,s, will be forwarded to the Executive 
Director of IEC. These contributions, pursuant to requirements 
set forth by IEC, will become the basis for the IEC

s 
intelligence estimate of potential problems of civil ct1soraer. 
2,. 'I1he IEC does not desire to receive a voluminous collecticr:.

contribution should be an evaluation of the particular 
situation based on the data which that agency has in its 
possession. The IEC Staff may i~sue GUIDELINES, to assist tne 
five agencies in the preparation of their intelligence con­
tribution. Addit,i_onally, such GUIDELirJES will be of 
assistance to IEC in identifying intelligence 11gaps 11 and 
the basis for making supplemental requests to the individual 
agency for further intelligence information.

evaluation staff in the preparation of lntelligence estimates.
