J.• GENERAL FINDINGS 
The study conducted by the Committee has 
produced the following signifi·cant findings: 
·(1) There definitely is a-vast.potential 
for collection of foreign intelligence in;the u. s. 
available through overt and clandestine chunnols. 
Even with the available capabilities of existing 
agenc_iesi> there is a large reservoir of untapped \ 
sources.. "------
(2) CIA has been authorized by statute 
• and implementing directives to collect foreign 
intelligence in the D. So through overt meth0ds and 
has been involved in such collection since the 
·establishment of the Agencyo This includes review 
of foreign language press and interviews with 
selected individuals such as American b~sinessmen 1 
aliensi> and studentso In addition, CIA has established 
an elaborate system of processing, storing, evaluating, 
and disseminating this information. ~ 
(3) Such overt collection by CIA does not 
_present any threat or infringement on FBI jurisdiction 
or operations. The pr~sent Bureau controls f9r such/ 
CIA activity are satisfactory_... : 
(4) We concluded that it would be highly 
undesirable for the Bureau to become responsible for 
• overt collection of foreign intelligence in the u. s. 
The necessary reorganization, expansion of facilities 
and manpoweri> and heavy task of info:.:-mation collection 
and processing could place a damaging burden on the 
Bureau .. 
(5) There has never been-any statutory or 
similar provision for the clandestine development by 
CIA of fo~eign intelligence in the United Stateso
