The Nation of Islam (NOI) is an independent semi­
religious group consisting of an adult, hard-core, all black 
membership of 6,000 members. Muhammad's Temple Number 2 of the 
Holy Temples of Islam, Chicago, Illinois, is the national head­
quarters of this organization consisting of 108 groups 'in the 
U.S. and one in Bermuda. In seven U.S. cities it operates 
University of Islam schools for 200 to 600 children at each 
school. Local groups convene weekly, and once each year a 
national convention is held in Chicago which is attended by 
5,000 to 6,000 individuals. • 
The NOI remains under leadership of 'Elill!l¼ Muhainmed_, 
who is the self-proclaimed Messenger of Allah and "Supreme Ruler 
of the Universe." Leaders continue to stress creation of a 
separate black nation; complete segregation of the races; hatred 
of the white ~an; and development of a black economic community. 
The _group opposes the war in Vietnam, teaches members to evade 
the draft," and strongly supports the Arabs in their conflict 
with Israel in the Middle East. 
Although for years the leaders of the NOI have taught 
members to refrain from carrying weapons and engaging in acts 
of violence and open attacks on the white man, as recently as 
July, 1971, the NOI Mosque, Ty~er, Texas, planned the execution 
of radio disc jockey and his associate for having previously 
killed a fellow NOI member. Subsequently, seven members of 
this mosque were involved in killing one of these men. Local 
police recovered thr~e pistols and a rifle from among members 
of this group. The highly inflammatory antiwhite ideology 
espoused by the NOI continues to make this group a highly volatile 
extremist organization. 
The organization is reaching new heights in accumulating 
wealth. Three-fourths of a million dollars monthly flows in 
and out of bank accounts at a national level. Corporations
