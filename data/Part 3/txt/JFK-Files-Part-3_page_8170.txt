Senate Select Committee To Review 
U.S. Intelligence Activities 
Senate Resolution 21 established a Select Committee of the 
Senate to review U.S. intelligence activities. The Resolution calls 
for a comprehensive review of the total U.S. intelligence effort 
and is not restricted to the recent charges and allegations against 
CIA alone. Consequently., it is likely to be far-ranging in its impact. 
It is in all of our interests to see that the Select Committee 
receives full understanding of our activities and their contribution 
to the country as expeditiously as possible. I have every confidence 
that the inquiry will be responsible., and constructive., and will pro­
duce new understanding of., and improvements in., the American 
intelligence system. 
It is with this conviction that I have pledged my personal coop­
eration and that of the CIA. I have advised Senators Church and Tower., 
the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman., that employees of the 
CIA will be available to the Select Committee for Staff interviews and 
for testimony. We are working with the Committee Staff to design 
procedures to facilitate their work in examining topics of concern. 
Attached to this bulletin is a letter which I have sent to Senator 
Church. To facilitate the necessary work of the Committee and in 
recognition of the security protection contemplated by the Committee., 
I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protected information 
to the Select Committee or its designated Staff members will constitute 
authorized provision of information within the meaning of the Secrecy 
Agreements signed by each CIA employee., subject to the special proce­
dures and limitations set forth in the letter regarding particularly 
sensitive matters. Senator Church has agreed that reference to sensi­
tive data in any Committee report will be subject to consultation between 
the Committee and the Agency.
