Memo to Mr. J. B. Adams 
Re: SENSTUDY 75 
Todd indicated that while he desired to respond as legally 
required to an official committee inquiry, he would advise Mr. Seidel 
that he considered himself bound by the Attorney General Order and did 
not feel that he could reveal official information without approval by the 
appropriate Department official. Todd was clearly advised· that this 
decision had to be hi'S' own and that the FBI could not and would not make 
any recommendation to him as to the course of action he should take. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
For information.
