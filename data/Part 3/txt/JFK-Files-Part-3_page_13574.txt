that say if it we.re possible a~d useful to put another ten peopl 
on to protect against any real misapplication of funds by an 
Agency like the CIA, that you fael that they would be more 
usefully put in_the auditing section under the comptroller of 
the agency rather than the OMB? 
.MR. O'NEILL: Well, I think it would depend in part 
on whether or not you look at that kind of a change in 0MB 
vis-a-vis CIA only, or whether there was a broad precedent for 
OMB's role and function. I suppose such a function could be 
lodged in the 0MB, although I must say to you,.with the number· 
of people you are talking about, ten peopl~, I would be highly 
skeptical that you can ensure that things you do not want to 
happen will not happen. Bureaucracy is s6 big, even in the 
case of CIA, that I am skeptical that ten good people can ensure 
that there would not be any examples or cases of operations outs'de 
of the law. I think that has to start at the top with a tone,, 
and direction, and a sense of responsibility that the key offlci ls 
18 bring to their job. So I guess I am not saying that you can 
19 cut off problems by having ten more people. You might make 
20 some difference because it would be a signal that somebody is 
21 going to pay closer attention than thsy,have in the past. 
22 MR. KIRKLAND: I just took the figure out of the air .. 
' ' 
23 You are-saying that if that were commensurately multiplied throu h 
24 all of the oversight functions, it would create an agency the 
25 size of which you do not want in 0MB to be useful.
