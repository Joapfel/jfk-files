Memorandum by Paul Hoch Concerning 
CIA Activities and the Warren Commission Investigat~on 
Mr. Paul Hoch, a long-time critic of the Warren Commission 
report, has been associated with Ramparts magazine, NBC news, 
and US News and World Report in the past. He has been in touch 
with CIA on the Warren Commission investigation since at least 
) 
1971. Our files show that Mr. Hoch was one of 12 people who, 
in 1967 or earlier, received·a copy of the original unexpurgated 
list of all Warren Commission material held by the National 
Archives before· a new list without CIA titles was prepared by 
Archives at our request. 
In the introduction to his copyrighted 24 March 1975 memo­
randum (Tab 1), Mr. Hoch notes that he "concentrates on the 
CIA, with emphasis on specific questions relevant to domestic 
CIA activities, possibl~ CIA nondisclosure to the Warren Com­
mission, and possible links between the assassination a~d CIA 
attempts to kill Fidel Castro." A review of the memorandum 
reveals that it contains a number of questions and allegations 
concerning.CIA. However, it also contains questions and 
allegations concerning the FBI, the Department of State, and 
various military departments. It appears to be a general 
criticism of Warren Commission methods and findings with 
particular emphasis on CIA's alleged role in obfuscating what 
Mr. Hoch believes to be the true nature of its own activities 
leading up to and following the assassination.
