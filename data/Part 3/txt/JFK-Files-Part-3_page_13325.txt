of his departure or his mode of travel. The original assumption that 
he had returned by bus could not be proven. Several possibilities Vlere 
discussed ,vhereby the Com1nission could fill in the gaps of its investi­
gation of the Mexican phase .. The suggestion ,vas made that tb.e n1ost 
effective ,vay of resolving the questions they had ,voul~ be to have a 
member of the Commission visit IVIexico City and discuss the issues on 
the spot with those A1nerican and f/~exican officials directly concerned.

vie\vs ,vith Iv1exican police officials, particul3.rly if it is desired that 
these intervie 1.vs be informal in nature. Our Chief of Station ,vould also 
be able to put the vVarren Commission staff member in contact \vith the 
FBI officials and Immigration 2.nd Naturalization Service officers stationed 
in 1'Iexico City. ·!Ar. Helms cautioned that our Chief of Stationfurould be)~

and ,vondered if there ,vere not more. T\Ir o Rocca summarized the n1a- ' 
terials that _had come to the attention of the Secret Service, or had been 
disseminated to the Secret Service, i1nmediately after the assassination. 
Mr. Rocca said there ,vas .not additional substantive i11formation and that 
the sanitized version 'seen by the Commission constituted the sum of our 
holdings. 1-1:r. Helms then explained that as a 1natter of practice ,ve did 
not release actual copies of our messages because they contained code­
words and digraphs ,vhich ,vould be unintelligible to a person not familiar 
With them. He added, ho,vever, that he would be happy to sho'.v the file 
with the original messages to any strtff :rr.e1nber of the \Varren Commission 
v,ho ·might come to visit him at Langley.
