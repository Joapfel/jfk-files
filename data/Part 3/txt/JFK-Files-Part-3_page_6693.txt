Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
• 
Of course, it would be desirable if no documents 
were released by the SSC; however, Mr. Elliff advises that 
the senators are-desirous of ·furnishing some documents to 
the press. If," in fact, Bureau documents have to be released, 
it appears that the ones the SSC plans to use are favorable 
to the Bureau. 
For the information of Bureau officials reviewing 
the attached ·documents, no excisions have been made; however, 
the brackets in red ink show what information will be 
obliterated from the documents prior to their release to 
the press. 
ACTION: 
For information.
