Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights • • ···; 
Division has asked that we give him a statement concerning the Communist . 
Party affiliation of Hunt er Pitts O'Dell. We have called .to his attention /:). cr.·•i 
current reports which have been furnished to the Security Division, Att~ntion / •t:/ 
Mr. Walter Yeagley, concerning O'Dell's activities. i; 
Marshall was interested in O'D~ll's association with Rev. Martin. ·.',~-, 
Luther King and he was given a copy of a report of Special Agent James F. )'t/4, IC/ 
O'Connell dated 12/20/62 at New York, which was classified "Confidential", cl .. :--r­
which had been disseminated to Walter Yeagley of the Security Division. x{{,~ { . 
\' This report reflected the current association of O'Dell and the organization'.[ r ·:. : , 
of Rev. King, namely, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).( .~ ~i, 
; In addition to the above we also furnished him a copy of a memorandum • • 
i from the Director to the Attorney General dated 12/6/62 and another dated l/23/6i3, 
~ pertaining to O}Dell. . . \} 
Marshall stated that upon review of the above information which was / 
I 
furnished to him, he would like to have a statement from the FBI concerning / 
the present Communist affiliation of O'Dell, particularly, whether O'Dell 
actually is a member of the Communist Party at this time. 
i I advised Marshall that an appropriate memorandum would be 
l prepared and furnished to him concerning his request. There is attached 
, hereto a memorandum which has been prepared by the Security Division 
indicating that we have developed evidence through our coverage of the 
activities of the Communist Party, USA, which indicates that as of July, 1962, 
J Party leaders considered O'Dell to be a member of the Party. It is being 
} pointed out tha;Jhis information is highly sensitive and confidential. f' 'l
