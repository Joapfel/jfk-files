Memorandum to Mr. Vl. R. V/annall 
1-le: Cointelpros 
62-116009 
• 
34 percent of all Coirttelpro action$ within areas of constitutional or 
statutory Violation, obviously indicating po$s1ble criminal or civil 
liability. Thi~ indicates the thrust -Of the forthcoming SSC ~.~eport, 
as relates to our discontinqed Cointelpros, will either criticize the 
Petersen Committee report as an inadequate review or one possibly 
based on incomplete information. The SSC very likely intends to· 
dispute the Peter$en Committee report conclusion that the "over ... 
whellni,ng bulk 0£ these activities were clearly legitimate and proper 
undertakiligs, within the scope of the FBI' a ongoing i-esponsibilitiea, " 
and to charact~rize the activities as cruninal or civil violations· of 
individual rights or· outside the mandate or charter of the FBI. 
We may expect the SSC, in its forthcoming report, as 
was done in public heat"ings, to bighlight FBI Cointelpro abuse$ using 
selected dooumentation from. FBI fll~s to ·support its conclusion. It 
is likely the SSC will reeommqnd legislation to preclude future 
COintelp:ro-type activities and it is possible it will recommend 
.criminal or civil prosecutions. As was done with the Petereen 
Committee rep()rt,. the subjectlve characterization .of an action as 
falling. within one -Qi several arbitrarily described ·categories is not 
only a matter of individual interpretation, but raises questions which 
cannot be-objectively answered. Whether or not these actions ax-e 
truly thought to· be prosecutable offenses, the innuendo arising from 
their characterization is-in itself damaging. 
ACTION: 
None. For information.
