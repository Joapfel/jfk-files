This new counterintelligence effort will take advantage 
of our experience with a variety of sophisticated techniques 
successfully applied against the Communist Party, USA, and related 
organizations since 1956. Primarily, we. intend t~~-~ to pu_P.Jic 
scrutiny the devious maneuvers and duplicity of the hate groups; 
tQ fi·ustrate_any_e:f.:f.or.ts or plans they may have to consolidate 
ttieir forces; to discou;i::gg_~ their recruitment of new or youthful 
adherents; and t.9 disruQt or eliminate th~ir efforts to circumvent 
,or violate the law. Our counterintelligence efforts against hate 
_groups will be closely supervised and coordinated to complement 
·our expanded intelligence investigations directed at these 
organizations. 
We are furnishing general instructions to 17 field 
)offices (14 Southern offices responsible for active investigation 
of 17 Klan groups and 6 hate organizations, and New York, Chicago 
and Baltimore, who have active investigative responsibilities 
for one hate organization each) relating to the administration 
and prompt enactment of this new counterintelligence program. 
Briefly, these instructions require the 17 participating offices 
to submit to the Bureau on or before 10/15/64 an analysis of 
possible counterintelligence operations, including any-specific 
reconunenda tions for action. Thereafter ( commencing 1/1/65) the 
participating offices will submit a 90-day status letter setting Jr, - I 1..:' 11 • ,7 ~ ~
