Director Sec'y_ 
Mark Gitenstein, staff member of captioned Committee 
who has been doing an extensive inquiry into the "official and confidential u 
files reportedly maintained in former Director Hoover's office, 
telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly 6-5-75 and requested the 
II 
identities of the employees who had brought the material from the 
Director's office during May, 1972, to Mr. Hoover's residence and 
to Mr. Felt's office. 
By way of background, Mr. Gitenstein has tbtained through 
interview of Mr. Felt, former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr, 2-_ 
and other Bureau personnel familiar with the operations of the Director's~­
office, considerable knowledge concerning the official and confidential -
files. There is also an extensive request contained in captioned Committee's 
letter of 5-4-75 pertaining to information surrounding these files.

Additionally, we responded to a request of the Committee contained in their 
letter of 4-28-75 pertaining to the allegation; of removal of certain material 
from Mr. Hoover's residence after the death of former Associate Director 
Clyde Tolson. We have not, at this point, determined that Bureau documents 
have been rem0ved from Bureau space to Mr. Hoover's residence or any 
other place outside the Bureau. However, it is apparent that Mr. Gitenstein 
has information, or believes he has information, relating to the removal 
of Bureau documents. i'."'1'.:C-%S . 1 I':, .,,,. . t!J/Q v7
