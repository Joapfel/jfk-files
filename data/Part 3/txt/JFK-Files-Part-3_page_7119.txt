Dear Mr. Kelley: T r'-' T -e. t / , y-tk~ ::...,~ /) r 7 I ti 11i" ,i?..;;.J 
u 
The Senate, on January 27, created a Select Committee to Study 
Governmental Operations With Respect to All Intelligence Activities. 
I am confident that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will make 
every effort to assist the Select Committee in its work, and I look 
forward to working together with you in completing this important task. 
I 
In order to carry out the necessary tasks mandated by the vote 
of the Senate, it will be necessary for Senators and designated staff 
to have access to the most sensitive classified material. The Select 
Committee is now in the process of bringing together a staff to assist 
in carrying out its work. In this regard., it is likely that many members 
of the staff who will be hired will not have current security clearances. 
On behalf of the Select Committee, I would be most grateful to 
you if you could expedite, as a priority matter, clearances on designated 
staff so that the work of the committee can proceed as expeditiously 
as possible. In debate, prior to passage of S. Res. 21,, the standard 
of clearance agreed upon by the Senate was equivalent to the_s~~nd~d~ , 
applicable to a "Qu clearance. R l,;;A _ //{> 3 9~--_ 7i' -r;
