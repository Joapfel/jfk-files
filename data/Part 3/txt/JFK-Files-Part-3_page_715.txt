The BPP in· San Diego ·was very effective in causing 
their m·m problems and their. m·m extinction and their 
criminal activities 1vere not restricted to the examples 
I've given. • 
Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast 
Prograi.'11? 
No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after -
the Breakfast Progra□ ·was started that other members 
of the BPP a~cused Ken Denrnon of stealing money from 
contributions made to the Program. 
On second thought I believe ·we did disrupt the BPP 
Breakfast Prograr.1 in that 1,7e rGc.e.ived complaints 
from several dairys and bread companies, et cetera, 
that they had been approached by BPP members 1·1ith 
veiled threat~ 0£ extortion if they did not donate 
qtLu1tities ·of food et cetera to the BPP Breakfast 
J Program. The FBI and local police investigated and 
I believe as a result their practices were discontinued, 
but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable 
offense of e}ctortion. 
Did you have any connection with distribution of 
11cartoonsn depicting BPP members as compro:nising each 
othGr et cetera? 
No, but I have seen 11cartoons 11 in the BPP newspaper. 
Have you ever seen 01: read c0pies of the BPP ne,;•ISpaper? 
No
