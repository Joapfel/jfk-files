ing that a copy_of this investigation would be made available 
to Mr. Colby as the Director of Central Intelligence and that

J
SSC will be organized. It is noted it will be broken down into 
four Task Forces, each with a Task Force Director, a lawyer or

including the FBI and those parts of the CIA that relate to 
domestic matters. Army counterintelligence activities may also

Force number three is still in.process and no Task Force Director 
has yet been appointed.

Mr. Colby designed to relieve current CIA employees from any 
obligation of secrecy. It is noted all CIA employees sign a 
Secrecy Agreement as a prerequisite to employment. Also attached 
is a copy of an Employee Bulletin, dated 3/12/75, advising CIA 
employees as to the procedures he should follow if he is selected 
to be interviewed by a member of the SSC or its staff. It is to
