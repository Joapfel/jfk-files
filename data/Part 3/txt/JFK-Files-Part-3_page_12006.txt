EXTENT AND NATURE OF CURRENT SUPERVISION - Program is 
supervised by one Seat of Government Agent who devotes a 
portion of his time. All cases are afforded careful 
supervision in an effort to detect presence of a repatriate 
who may have been recruited by the Cuban Intelligence 
Service for activity in this country. Thirty-two cases are 
pending. 
CURRENT JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE - Fidel Castro has 
consistently used the mass exodus of individuals from Cuba 
to infiltrate intelligence agents into the u. S~ Program 
offers excellent potential for detecting such individuals 
who reenter this country under the protective coverage of 
their citizenship. We feel that the program is fully 
justified. 
FREQUENCY OF EVALUATION AND DATE OF LAST JUSTIFICATION - An 
annual eva"Iua=fion is made:- Tlie progr'am ~was' '!ast 'ju"s-eT:fied 
on September 1, 1970.
