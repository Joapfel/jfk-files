~~l~v_:ery by Mr .. Staa.~_O.JLVl~<;lnepda~_~f~~~EE~~rj.-~_J)/.21/.'L~i.:....-~s was the case 
with the draft of Mr. Staats' morning testimony, GAO has furnished this 
document with the understanding that it would entertain suggestions for 
I minor corrections but would not make substantive alterations. We have been 
informed that the ·attachment was prepared under an exceedingly short dead-
line. Hasty preparation is evident from .our preliminary evaluatiJn, and, , -,.\ 
although the draft is critical of certain aspects of our domestic security intel­
ligence investigations, we ~o not consider this document to be an articulate 
or incisive statement. 
Nevertheless, the draft does raise issues which may be the 
subject of follow-up inquiry, particularly with reference to investigative 
sources and techniques. Under the subheading nsources and Techniques 
Used During an Investigation, 11 on pages 8, 9, and 10, refe~ence is made 
to the use of school and telephone company employees as confidential sources, 
access to postal and passport records, pretext interviews, COINTELPRO-type 
activity, and surreptitious entries in cases reviewed by GA('.). In addition, 
reference is made at the bottom of page 9 to information derived from 
() :§)electronic surveillance coverage which appeared in cases reviewed by 
:,.,.0s10~ ~GAO. However, GAO' s testimony fails to indicate that the information 
\
/ t:~c referred to was completely derived from overhears. Consequently, 
the testimony may create an erroneous impression with respect to the 
use of electronic surveillances in these cases. We are working w-ith GAO ti 
1 to have the dra_ft altere? to avoid ';'iJi1:_terpr';!ation ~ith. r;spect}o ~~~ /1 /J\}.~
