-these type of techniques were used, it se~med to indicate a 
lack of confidence or taith in the Ameri9an peopl_e to bt:;lieve

One of the great freedoms -vre have is the freedom of 
hearing other ideas whe.the~ we agree with them or not. I 
think this is an area that we are concerned with and one 
I 
technique which I hope is being discontinus.d and one that will

legislation is drawn. 
Mr. Adams. Well, I think you can be assured that any 
such techniques in that area died with COI~TELPRO in 1971. 
Senator Huddleston .. That is comforting. 
Mr. Adams. Yes. 
The Chairman (presiding).. Thank you, Senator. 
I have been forced in and out by virtue of votes and othe~ 
Committee business. I am not sure which Senators have had 
their opportunity to question and which have not. 
Senator Goldwater, w:ere you n-ext'? 
Senator Goldwater. I will not take much time. I 
apologize for not having been here in the last two days-. It 
is going good, I have ~eard. 
We have heard testimony regarding the voluminous records, .. 
I balieve 500,000, mairitain-ed by the Bureau. 
How in your view h~ve these records come to be kept?
