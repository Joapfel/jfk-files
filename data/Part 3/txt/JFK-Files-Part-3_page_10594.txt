Legal Counsel to Adan1s Memo 
RE: J-OHN T. ELLIFF 
It should be noted that the Select Committee considered 
of.:fering the position to Lar~askir, .Co,1.1ns.e,l_t:.9j;}.l~_I>res~~t1t.,:$_Ql531ne~~Y-
J3_1>ai:g~--Mr. Baskir formerly $erved as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's 
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had .nume1·ous contacts 
with hiln in that capacity. Our purpose was to :reach s9me common agreement 
on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 9.3rd 
Session of Congress. There were numerous rneetings with Baskir on the 
sanre subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved 
unsuccessful and after seve'ral months we discontinued the discussions. 
In our opinion,, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out anv reasonable /e·~,.,,i 1>13 .,.ti co111promise and seemed unsympathetic to the le-~1:s-.1:ari-10n concerns of law 
enforcement. 
It is clear that this is a matter fo:r Professor Elliff to 
determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although 
we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we 
have had no occasion, to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar. 
Mr. ·.rvnller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is 
our under stand:i:ng that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an 
adversary relationship between the Bureau ~md the Committee. 
Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to 
the Senate Cornn1ittee until he hears from us. 
RECO:M ... N[ENDATION: 
That P:i:ofessor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate 
for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment 
offered by the Senate Select Committee.
