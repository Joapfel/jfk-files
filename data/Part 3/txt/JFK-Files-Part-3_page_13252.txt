irforrnation about the Communist activity. And Fidel was coming 
on his big thing, you know, about talki~g against the Americans. 
And this was creating a lot of dissension with some of the top 
military brass. 
MR. OLSEN: That is, the military brass of the 
Cuban Government? 
MR. STURGIS: • Of the Cuban rnili tary, yes. And at the

MR. OLSEN: You had attempted to recruit him? 
MR. STURGIS: I attempted to recruit Commander Camelo 
Cienfugo, and also Commander Almejera. He was the National 
Chief of Police. 
MR. OLSEN: An~·who was the first one, Cienfugo? 
MR. STURGIS: ·commander. Camelo Cienfugo was the Chief 
of the Ar~y -- I think Raoul was the Chief of the Armed Forces. 
MR. OLSEN: Did you succeed in recruiting.them? 
MR .. STURGIS: ·I met them at the Capri Hotel, where 
the show as at. And I got them stoned out of their minds. And 
we discussed money, how they would be willing to do, and so 
forth. I didn't want to get 'into it too much, because I had 
Camelc·Cienfugo lined up more, he was thinking more in line with 
what I was talking about. Commander Almejeira got stoned out 
of his mind. And he jus~ put his hea<l on the table and went 
to sleep. That was it. And so I had a hard time keeping Camelo 
r; 0 nfugo awake.
