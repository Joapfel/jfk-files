/3. Since January, 1971, Program has disclosed continuing 
purchases by Soviet nationals of Grundig Satellite Multiband 
po·rtable radios. During 3/71 one KGB officer in Washington 
purchased 12 of these radios at one time. Soviet husband 
and wife illegal team previously in U.S. used one of these 
radios to receive clandestine broadcasts from USSR which con­
tained their operating instructions. Program made it possible 
• to s·ecure serial numbers for possible future identification. 
Analysis of pµ~chase~ enables Laboratory to make reasonable 
estimate of internal communications used at Soviet establishments 
and security devices being operated. Program also disclosed 
detailed information concerning two new antennae systems purchased 
by Soviets from company ·in Nebraska. It appears one of these 
will be used at new Consulate General in San Francisco when 
permanent location for that establishment secured. Details 
concerning such installations are of interest, not only to FBI 
,,Laboratory, but to State Department and NSA in connection with ,,.,._
