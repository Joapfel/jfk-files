Baltimore Office. This indicated to the B ,reau Supervisor 
at the time that an interoffice communicat1on had been sent 
to Baltimore by WFO. A check with WFO on 1/22/71 disclosed 
that by interoffice letter 11/6/69 it had advised Baltimore 
that Boki~~kx,_ was being considered for development as a 
potential security informant by WFO. His employment, 
residence and date of birth were set forth and indices check 
was requested. By interoffice letter 12/12/69 Baltimore 
advised WFO that its indices were negative. Subsequent 
verification of Bokijl~k::'l,!S change of employment was unnecessary 
when same was brought to the attention of the Bureau in 90-day 
evaluation letter submitted under the.1,{lasa.caption on 9/8/70, 
and again in 90-day evaluation letter of i277/70. No separate 
communication was required for the informant file regarding 
the change of employment because that information would be 
furnished in the normal six-month -! justification • submitted 
by WFO and it does appear in the six-month justification 
dated 1/19/71.

that Bokinskl will continue to contact_J:~concerning
