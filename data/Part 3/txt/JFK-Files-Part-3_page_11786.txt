Within this perspective the 12 6ases referred by 
the Inspector will be kept open for intensive review to insure 
that all possible action not already taken to enhance and 
exploit the potential of each .source has ~een considered 
and, where appropriate, additional instructions issued to 
the field. 
It is noted that 10 of the 12 PDA cases referred to 
were in a closed status in accordance with recent DID instructions 
regarding the administrative handling of all SI and PSI files. 
Briefly under these proced~res such cases are placed in a 
closed status and are reopened only at such time as a justi­
fication letter is due. These criteria will continue to be 
applied to PDA cases with exc?ptions, on a selective basis, 
in those situations which fall within the category defined 
by the Inspector ..

The continual need for quality double agents 
is certainly recognized in our counterintelligence efforts 
against Soviet bloc intelligence and the cases referred to 
by the Inspector as excellent candidates will be given 
careful and aggressive handling.
