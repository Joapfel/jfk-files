Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chillccl by a Congressional 
Con1mittce's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there i,vas 
insuffi.cicnt justici8.bility in th.cir claims to create a viable case or 
• controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of 
investigation bf the present Committee home to themselves,'' their fears 
were wholly specultttive; there were nq criminal ·proceedings confronting 
them; nor was any action pending. :rvroreove-r, the C(?urt in Davis fow1d 
~ that the power of a Congressional Committee bE;gan and ended with the 
investigation; whenever a Committee of the Cangress seeks punitive action,

The compilation of dafa by a civilian investigative 
agei1cy is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the 
• • deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right 
•. of free speech that such action by the military is, because 
a civil investigative agency has no inherent power al ways 
being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and • 
the approval of the courts. * * *
