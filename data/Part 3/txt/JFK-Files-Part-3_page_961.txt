' I 4. End all FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal and 
security 1~esponsibilities by :FBI personnel stationed ab,road and conduct them 
by dh-ect communications. This option does not appea1• to have a11y e.dvanta.geous 
. aspects and would tend to stifle effective foreign-liaison. Only a man on the . 
• ., scene can be thoroughly aware of the local customs, tradition and judiciru. 
process of the numerous foreign countries involved. Each country is different 
- and the unique understanding of these differences is vital for successful 
communication and cooperation. It is not believed that a supervisor stationr:d 
·in Washington can adequately grasp these unique situations. If such 8J."l option 
is adopted, it is felt that our present outstanding relationships with hundreds 
. of foreign police agencies would quickly disintegrate. Further.fuore. such 
communications . because of a lack of direct cable connections with foreign 
c~mntries, would force the FBI to utilize direct ma:il or public cable systems as 
opposed to secure methods presently being utilized. This would not only 
create iong delays, but would also pose serious securit°'.{ risks . This option 
is , therefore, not acceptable . 
Conclusion 
. • • F01~ the reasons set out above, it is felt that the only effective 
WfJ.Y for the FBI to discharge the full scope of its responsibilities is to maintain 
its liaison posts abroad.
