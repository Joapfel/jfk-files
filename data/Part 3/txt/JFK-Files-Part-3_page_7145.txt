On 3/4/75 Mr. Steve Kuhn-, Office of Security, CIA, 
advised that all CIA employees prior to commencing employ--
ment wi:th that Agency are required to execute an "Entrance on 
Duty Secrecy Agreement" and upon terminating their Agency 
employment are requested to execute a "Termination Secrecy 
Agreement" (copies of both attached). Briefly, these agree-
me11ts :i:equire that CIA employees keep forever sec:cet all 
classifi~d information gained during the course of their 
employment. Bot.h agreements further l"equire that CIA employees 
may not disclose classified information during interviews 
or by publication without prior authority from the Director 
of Central Intelligence. Both agreements spec:5.fically set 
forth that the employee has read the provisions of the 
espionage laws (Sections 793, 794 and 798 of Title 18, U.S. 
Code), is aware that unauthorized disclosure of classifi·Bd 
information relating; to the national defense could lead to 
prosecution and has reviewed the provisions of the National 
Secur:lty Act of 1947, which specifically charges the Di:eector 
of Central Intelligence with protecting intelligence sources 
and methods from unauthorized disclosure. In this connec­
tion, the "Te~r.mination Secrecy Agreement'' notes that the 
employee has also read the provisions of Sect:i.on 1001, Title 18, 
U.S, Code, a.nd is aware that making a false statement uherei11 
or otherwise 11 may be punished as a felony. The 11Termination 
Secrecy AJreement" consists of a four-page fo:rm, page:'!.l
