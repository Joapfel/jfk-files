Memorandum to Mr. Adams 
Re: Senate Select Committee 
• 
Mr. O'Connor noted that even though formal \!-:1~•::-12i1t rules 
have not been agreed upon with the Committee, it appears that Elliff's 
cooperation in furnishing the above information indicates a willingness 
to abide by the terms and conditions that I had requested Mr. O'Connor 
to seek in behalf of the FBI. 
In this developing cooperation with Elliff, it is my opinion that . 
we should not participate in the conference at noon on Tuesday, May 27, 1975, 
at which time the broad proposals by Wilderotter will be discussed. It is 
to the interest of the FBI to develop a cooperative attitude on the part of 
Elliff and his staff and that is being accomplished. 
RECOMMEND.A TION: 
For information.
