Mr. Adams. Of which you are aware . 
Senator Goldwater. That's right .. 
Now let me ask you, the information you have would 
probably b~ on computer tape? 
Mr. Adams. No, sir. 
Senator Goldwater. It's not. Information that IRS 
would have, is that computerized?

Mr. Adams. It may be. I'm not familiar with the extent 
of theirs. We do have certain computer activities, such as 
the National Crime Information -Center, or we have, I gu~ss, 
7 or 8 million records. This is not the usual file material. 
This is, it consists of individuals concerning whom a 
warrant is 9utstanding, stolen property, material such as 
this. And also some documented criminal history information 
in the nature of prior arrest history. But not what I think 
you are referring to in the way of file material; reports, 
intelligence, this type of information. 
IRS [JFK Law ll(a)] 
Ur. Adams. No, sir. 
Sena tor Goldwater . There '·s. no such list that you know
