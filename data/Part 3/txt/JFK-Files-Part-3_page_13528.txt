United States at that time were being in eff2ct utilized 
through front organizations that were being sponsored by the 
Age rcy, were they not? 
MR. BISSELL: Uh-huh. I think that is true. Yes. 
MR. KIRKLI1.ND: Was there discussion of targets there 
confined to Fidel Castro, or would.it include Guevara and 
othars? 
MR. BISSELL: Exclusively Castro. 
C!IAIRJ1L7\H ROCKEFELLER: \vere not most of those Cuban 
organizations penetrated by Castro representatives? 
MR. BISSELL: Th~y were, indeed. 
CHAIRI-L\N ROCKEFELLER: So that • +-1._ would bl:: very easy 
for double agents to report back to Castro what ·was going on? 
MR. RISSELL: That's right. Exactly. I think our 
judgment at the tine, as a matter of intelligence-, and I am now 
talking about after ths Bay of Pigs operation in particular, 
but the same applies, by the ·c.vay, to most_ of the preparation, 
I think our belief was that Castro was ~xtremely well informed 
on what was going on. I don't think that he penetrated, so ·far 
as we knew, parts 6f that preparatory activity that were under 
the Aqency's direct control, but all of the exile groups in 
22 -Miami, including the political groups tha~ we. attempted to 
23 form and did forE1 as front organizations, I 1 :P1 quite sure he 
knew what . 
24 t..·1as going on.
