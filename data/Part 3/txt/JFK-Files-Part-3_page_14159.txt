64. 8/29/62 - 'the State Department brie.fed • a bipartisan group 
in the House of Representatives, according to SenatoP Engle 's state­
ment on 'the floor of t_he Ser,(ite on 9/5/62. He said that the st.ate­
ment which had been supplied· to the Houee of,Representatives by the 
Department of S_tate on 8/29 read· as follows: "Soviet Mili tn.ry Aid to 
Cuba. After .a. lull since earl_y 1962 the .Soviet Union resumed lar·ge­
scale militaiy deliveries to ~iba in the last week in July,_ Since

avai.lable on the contents of the· ships, nor of the breakdown "between 
military and nonm111 tary, 1rd.'onnation to ·date incticates the following:

"cargo: Milj.tary cargo, perbaps as mt•.ch· as half of the total, 
included large ·quantities of transportation.,. electronic, and construc­
tion ·equipment, such as communications vp.ns, radar vane, trucks, and 
mobile g·enerator uni ts. Much of the equipment is likely to go into 
the· improvement- of coastal .and alr .defenses. The ·size and shape of 
some of the. boxes delivered suggests th2.t it is possible they could 
1 
contain ground..;to-air missiles· for. antiaircraft use,. but we. have no 
information on that as yet. These missiles are not adaptable for 
nuclear use. • 
. "Nonmilitary cargo·, roughly half of the total, consists of .de-
(·~- :1 liveries, already behind schedule, of industrial and agricultural 
equipment under. aid and trade -agreeme·nts. • 
"Personnel: A large number of additional Soviet spec1.alis ts 
arrived in Cuba

·1n the. same period. Wi t.1 the recent arrivals, tl)e 
total number in Cuba or _on the way, both military and nonmili'tary 
may be as high as 5000.' The breakdown b'etween military and technical 
persont;1el is not_known,·but the additional numbers ofmilitary special-
ists _ate ~ot incompatible wit~_the training and setting u~ of.the • 
complex military_equipment which has arrived. There is no evidence 
of· the .arr1vc11 of Soviet combat troops from other Soviet bloc coun­
