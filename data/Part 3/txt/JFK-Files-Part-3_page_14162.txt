The JCS d::-aft also included a section ·(

Item '7,

.in respons.e 
to the provision of Par. 7 of NSAM 181 which called for a Department 
of Defense study of "the various military al_ternatives which might 
be adopted· in executing a decision to elim,inate any _installations • 
in Cuba capable of launching nuclear attack on t.he u. S/ ... (for 
example, (a) pinpoint attack (b) general count-er-force .attack, (c) . 
outright invasion). 
In a praface to this study the JCS pointed out that (1) although 
the current <Jvaluatio.n of reported SAM s1tes in Cuba is that they are 
for defensive purposes and designed for _air defense, if these sites are 
effectively used to derogate u.s. aerial reconnaissance the.Cubans • 
will have·an opp6rtunity to develop such offensive ·capabilitieH as 
mis.sile launch sites and submarine bases (2) a Cuban· offensive ·capa­
bility would fill gaps ,in the Russian mif3sile coverage of the· u. s. 
-and also pro ,·lde the Cuban Communist gove.rnment with a means of 
countering fut·1re U.S. actions againE3t Cvba'through blackmail, and

The JCS analysis of alternative U.S.· military actions; was then 
set forth in essence as follows: 
\ . . 
. a. Pinpoint attack (i.e., a localized attack against a specific 
f ac11rty 'foil owed by planned wi tndrawal . •. . TniJ might be done by • 
pinpoint air attack, or by covert commando-type· raids (not recommended) 
on targets adjacent to coastal areas). Advru1tages ·:· economical in • 
force applied •. . . minimizes µ. S, and Cub.an casual ti-es,. an,d -pre:-
att~ck publicity. Disadvantages: eliminates nuclear launch capa~ 
bil1ty only on a temporary basis •.. no less bellige~ent than any 
other act of war ... even if covert will brand U~S .. as aggressor .

amphibious assaults ·with or without immediate subseqJent withdr_awal).
