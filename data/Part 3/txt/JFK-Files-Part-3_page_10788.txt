"friendly" or "neutral" country embassies in Washington in 
the early 1940's and frequently referred to the fact that 
this was being done by OSS with knowledge that its juris­
diction in this country was based only on the theory that 
a foreign Embassy is not American soil and is technically

'service it' and the State Department in fact started the 
SIS project. H'' (62-64427-1059.)

provided in a report prepared by Colonel Richard Park of 
the War Department as a result of a survey of OSS operations 
made as a special and confidential mission for the President 
in 1944 and 1945. Colonel Park commented: "Without going .
