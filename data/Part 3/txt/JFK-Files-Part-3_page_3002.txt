Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but 
I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into troub e 
over it in the political idea trouble, and that that's where we 
need to have new legal standards. 
Mr. Adams. Y.es, I agree with that. 
Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston. 
Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Adams, these two instances we have studied at· some 
length seems to have been an· inclin~tion on the part of 
the.Bureau to establish.a notion about an individual or a group 
which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In 
the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was 
being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi­
gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating tha 
this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go·out 
to intensify the investigation. There never seeme~ to be a 
willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts. 
Ms. Cook testified this morning that something si~ilar 
to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, tha 
every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau 
seemed to indicate that the Bureau was. not correct in its 
assumption that this organization planned to commit violence, 
or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist 
(~ 
that this investigation go on, and t; .. s information was used 
against the i~dividuals.
