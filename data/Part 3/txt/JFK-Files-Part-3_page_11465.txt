This is to advise of our interpretation of analytical infor­
mation relating to our disco~ued Counterintelligence Programs 
(Cointelpros) prepar~ by the Senate Select Committee (SSC). 
On 2/2/76 the. Department made available for our review 
a number of FBI documents the SSC intends to pqbltsh in connection 
with its forthcoming :report. Included with the material were three 
SSC prepared charts (copies attached) analyzing the same five baaic 
domestic. C<>intelpros which were reviewed in 1974 by the Department 
Study Co,il:n.ittee on FBI Cointelpros (Peter$en Committee). The 
statistics utiltzed by the SSC 1n compiling the charts differ from 
those reported by the Petersen CQm.mitt~e, and the SSC has ,also 
established different categories for .characterizing Cointelpro actions 
than used in the Petersen· report. 'Ilhe following. is a description of 
the three ssc charts. 
1. Colnt_elpro CompOsite (SSC Exhibi~ 10). • This chart 
lists seven bas le categories for the 2, 679 total Cointelpro actions 
tabulated by the ssc, it being noted tbi,s ls 3.10 more aetions th~ 
calculated by the Petersen Committee. The first three cat~gorie$, 
·(1) Attacks on Spea.Iung, Teaching, Writing, and lv.Ieeting;, (2) Inter­
ference w/Pe:rsonal and Economic Rights; and (3) Abuse of Government 
Processes, place apprQ:xlmately 925 of the Cointelpro actions in an 
area indicating FBI violation of constitutional rights with possible 
cdmmal and civil liability. The fourth .category, Third Party Hostile, 
Enclosures.
