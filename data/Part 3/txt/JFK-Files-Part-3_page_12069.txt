3. Special Investigations - West Unit has one Agent and one 
clerk on loan from the Internal Security Section. 
4. Activities by New Left terrorists during the past year 
has been marked by an increase in acts of violence and 
conspiracies toward violence. The Weatherman group and 
other such groups have made it imperative that we institute 
continuing intensive investigations. By approved airtel to 
SAC, Albany, and all offices dated 11/ 4/70, the fie·ld was 
instructed to initiate investigation of all members of the 
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and members of 
procommunist militant New Left type campus organizations 
which follow SDS advocacy of violence and revolution. It 
is estimated that this will involve some 6,500 new investi­
gations. If this trend continues, it will be necessary to 
obtain an additional clerk in the future; however, we are 
not requesting any additional clerical personnel at this 
time. 
b. At the time of the last inspection~ this section had 
22 Agents and 27 clerical employees authorized of which 
22 Agents and 25 clerical employees were assigned. As a 
result of the.realignment of the Division:in December, 1970, 
this Section currently has 22 Agents and 23 clerical employees 
authorized: 
6. As noted in number 4 above, the increase in terroristic 
activities by New Left militants has increased the burden 
of this Section .. On the basis of the above, if this trend 
continues, it appears that it will be necessary to obtain one 
additional Agent in the future. 
7. Personnel adequacy in the New Left. Section is constantly 
evaluated on the basis of the productivity of each unit, 
requests received from the Department and other·agencies 
and the overall objectives of the Section. The delinquent 
work in each unit is closely followed and in special situations 
where an excessive amount of work is assigned to one unit 
supervisory personnel from other units are utilized.
