There is no purpose here to impede in any way the Commission's 
investigation. I believe, however., in m:ost cas·es these specific 
identifying names and details are not necessary fqr an y;nder.standing 
of our activities. Where the Commission or the staff believes that 
specific identification is necessary to the purpose of the testimony 
or the staff interrogation., the matt~r will be discussed between the 
Commission and the Agency, and I will be prepared to consult with 
you and the Commission to determine the course of action to be taken. 
·where in the judgment of the employee a specific identification is 
especially sensitive as outlined in this paragraph, an identity number 
will be assigned pending resolution of the matter between the Com­
mission and the Agency., and in the meantime the identity will not be 
divulged by the employee. 
I appreciate the cooperation or" the Commission and of Agency 
~ . employees in this regard... I am still responsible under the statute 
and as a professional for the protection of intelligence sources and 
methods from unauthorized disclosure. In many situations the inad­
vertent disclosure of a name or identification cotJld have serious 
repercussions, including placing lives in jeopardy., and I cannot in 
good conscience put such information at risk .. 
This arrangement of course does not affect the Commission's_ 
procedures for advising prospective witnesses of their rights., secur­
ing waivers, nor the employee's or ex-employee's right not to answer 
certain questions if they are concerned that the answers might tend 
to incriminate them. 
Respectfully ..
