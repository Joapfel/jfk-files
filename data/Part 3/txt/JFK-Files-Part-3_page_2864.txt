General Levi tomorrow, and with both the FBI a~d the Justice 
Department in the next months as the Committee considers 
recommendations that will strengthen the American people's 
confidence in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That 
confidence is vital for the effective enforcement of Federal 
law and for the security of the nation against foreign 
espionage. 
Director Kelley, we are pleased to welcome you, and if 
you would have a prepared statement you would like to lead off 
with, please proceed.
