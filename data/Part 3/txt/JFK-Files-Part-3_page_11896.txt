It is acknowledged that it was necessary to issue 
instructions to the field cautioning them about conducting extensive 
background investigations on members close to this conspiracy 
prior to the presentation of facts of this case to the Grand Jury 
• to preclude the possibility of compromising an informant. However, 
the foiiowing suggested investigative action is being set forth for 
your consideration inasmuch as it is ·of paramount importance that 
you continue to press this matter vigorously. These suggestions 
are not to be considered as all inclusive, but are being set forth 
for your consideration and appropriate action: 
1. You should insure that the field aggressiv•e1y 
intensifies its investigation of this conspiracy including detailed 
comprehensive background investigations on all subjects both 
directly and indirectly associated with the ECCSL. It should be 
emphasized, however, that utmost discretion and good judgment should 
be exercised in the conduct of investigations of the principal 
conspirators so that unfounded charges of harrassment cannot be 
leveled against the Bureau.
