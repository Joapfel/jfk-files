Re: Documents Pertaining to Requests for Mail 
Covers Made by the Bureau from 1971 
Through 1975 
NOTE: 
Materials furnished in response to this request were 
• • obtained by review Of all abstracts regarding communications to the 
Postal Service requesting mail covers. Since 1971, all national secu­
rity mail covers have been requested by means of a letter to the Chief 
Postal Inspector, Postal Service. The materials being furnished only 
encompass investigative matters involving domestic security cases 
wherein the mail cover has been terminated whether the investigat~n 
is pending or closed. The materials are comprised of copies of th~ 
letters to the l?ostal Service and supportive memoranda where used 
in lieu of notes. These materials were reviewed and, where necessary, 
excisions made. By memorandum 9/24/75, the SSC was furnished the 
bulk of such documents located at that time. The documents being fur­
nished now are those which could not be immediately located. All 
domestic mail cover requests which were located by means of the 
abstract review have now been furnished to the SSC. 
By oral agreement with the SSC staff, only domestic 
security mail covers were required to be furnished..
