leadership ofJ;li!t~P Hen,r%in Detroit, has been relatively 
inactive for some time. e Milton Henry Faction, however, has 
scheduled a-national RNA convention to be held in·Dayton, Ohio, 
September 4 through 6, 1971, which activity could herald renewed 
revolutionary activity by this group. 
The ~¥a .. ~:~L H~rX,. Faction h<:"s be:en ext:emely active 
in the past several months in attempting to obtain land and 
establish a black nation in Hinds County, Mississippi. During 
July, 1971, this faction held a "peoples court" to hear RNA's 
case against a black farmer and owner of the land claimed by 
RNA which was consecrated as the group's capitol in March 3, 1971. 
The black farmer has reneged on a former offer to sell his land 
to RNA. The RNA group found the farmer guilty and threatens to 
seize the land by force, if necessary. 
The RNA's propensity for violent action is demonstrated 
by the fact- -that on August 1.8 ~ 1.971. j loca 1 p01 i.cP. officers in 
Jackson, Mississippi•, accompanied by Bureau Agents raided an 
RN~ site seeking four subjects for whom warrants were outstanding, 
one of whom was wanted for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution 
(UFAP) for murder in Detroit. A shoot-out occurred during which 
two police officers and a Bureau Agent were wounded. One police 
officer subsequently died of a head wound. Eleven RNA members, 
-including Richard Henry, have been arrested by local authorities 
and the UFAP

i;iibj~i:~~ still being sought.. A subsequent search 
of the raided RNA headquarters determined it was a virtual 
arsenal of weapons of all types including homemade bombs and 
Molotov cocktails. The front door of this building had been 
booby-trapped and it had an escape tunnel leading from its rear 
which was accessible via a trap door in the building's interior 
anda trench-bunker similar to that utilized by the Viet Cong 
in the war in South VJetnam.
