Seidel~ 
Wirick: 
What type of illegal activities and did your program 
in any way instigate illegal activities on the part 
of the BPP? 
Criminal acts committed by locai members of the BPP 
is what I ,,ms referrin 6 to. I don't believe it was 
ever necessary to instigate any illegal acts or in 
any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The 
majority of local BPP members were thieves, narcotics 
addicts 1 lazy, unemployed and were hero "\•mrshipers -of 
the BPP in Oakland, California. They wanted to emulate 
the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty, 
et cetera, was a constant source of turmoil amongst 
the local group. 
I recall, date unknown, information ·was received 
regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), onetime 
head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit 
cards. 
' 
/ Information was received that Walter Wallace 
(1-Jalter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that 
he and his ,vife, Velma, were stealing to get money 
for narcotics and that Velma's r-:1other was also ;i.nvolved 
in local thefts. 
All above information was furnished local law agencies 
and local arrests were _me.de. Furnishing the 
above type of information is a function and responsibility 
of the FBI.
