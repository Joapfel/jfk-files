SENATE SELECT C"MMITfEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LET£ER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER 
There were no annual reports submitted by the 
office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investigation 
of Martin wther King, Jr .• in 1963 through 1968. With 
regard to the Women's LiberationMovemen~, the SSC has been 
provided copies of all pertinent reports for the years the 
organization was under investigation. In an ~ffort to 
cla_rify what ls mean~ by the annual reports available on 
the investigations about which materials were supplied 
pursuant to Mr. John- E~liff' s request of October 2~, 197_5, . 
it is again proposed that a.meetµig with.Mr. Elliff be 
arranged to clarify this ambiguity. • 
Ite.'Il 5 requests specific examples of cases where 
the FBI has taken action in the past similar to that which 
would be authorized by Section IV of .the Department of 
·Justice's guiq.elines draft on °Domestic Security_ Investigations." 
The indices of this Bureau are not organized to 
enable retrieval of information of a 11preventive action" . 
character_or examples of FBI ac~ions taken to prevent 
violence. The retrieval of such information from FBI files, 
other than that described in the response to Item 1, would 
require extensive review and/or dependence on the recollection 
of individuals of occurrences extending back almost 20 years. 
It is suggested that, during the proposed meeting with 
Mr. John Elliff, this .request be discussed. 
Item 6 requests access to all FBI materials 
pertaining to Martin 1.uther King, Jr., the Poor Peoples' 
Campaign and the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis, 
Tennessee,from January 1, through April 4, 1968.
