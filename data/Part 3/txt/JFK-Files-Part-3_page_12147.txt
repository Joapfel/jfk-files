target, all facets of the investigation of hi$ activities 
were carefully considered. _'!jy_~*J~-~was selected as the 
vehicle to carry out our defection approach. NelsonJ a • 
contact of _Aza.,;rY.~q, was interviewed and was cooperative. 
His operation as a source against Azar~~ij_was proceeding 
in proper fashion, and having decided on the ·utilization 
of~~-- to make the approach to Azary;an 2• there was 
no need to expedite_Nelson~§_development. By not involving 
Nelson in this operation we have not unnecessarily revealed 
·our-interests in him and preserved a potential asset. 
With regard to question four, the designations of 
an individual as a Potential Security Informant and as a 
potential double agent are not mutually exclusive. Potential 
Security Informant is the term defined in the Manual of 
Instructions for an individual in position to become active 
in intelligence activities and administrative supervision is 
in accord with provisions of the Manual of Instructions. 
On the other hand, potential double agent is merely an 
arbitrary designation we apply to an individual who is in 
contact with a Soviet-bloc official, but in which the 
relationship has not yet cteveioped into one oi c:i. cov-=:.r.·t 
intelligence natureo Such a relationship is well 
illustrated in ,Mi.%rJ!....~~-overt business contacts with 
1{,e,J,s,Q,n on behalf of A~:1:2:l;'Jt, ~~e Sovi_~.,,,,t, tradin~ c~~pa~y. That such a relationship may a6ruptTy ~:fn-=c11~ncter 
to a covert intelligence operation is well documented in 
countless cases which have arisen out of "innocent" business 
oriented contactso For this reason the arbitrary designation 
• of potential double agent was given to Nelson.

In connection with the observation that the Bureau 
.instructed the Newark Office to interview_~~~Aand furnish 
results in a form suitable for dissemination the Newark 
Office furnished background information and advised 
information would be furnished in LHM form under the Az~r.:sr,an. 
caption. The only·occasion when substantive data received 
from a source appears in the informant case file is in the 
semiannual justification letter in abbreviated form. See 
Section 107K, paragraph 7, page 13, Manual of Instructions, 
which states: 
"Correspondence in security informant and 
potential informant matters should be 
strictly limited to administrative handling 
of informant and should not contain 
information more properly furnished under 
substantive case caption."
