The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all \ 
~ 
responses for the production of records, etc., received from Congressional \. 1 
committees be forwarded by letterhead ?lemorandum through the Deputy I ,:~ 1~ ., 
Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected insta~es.~ .. 
a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting acces% 1 • ,: •• :~

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into ~ ' 
FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding oS: 1 ,~ 
documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as request~ , 
such as the request of tjJe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities <l .._, 
have been forwarded<'fo this Bureau through the Department, it would appear~ 
logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional, , • 
committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/ or the Bureau, s-~-.. ;:; 
l
:'2.~-~J>O!!ded to __ !hrp:t:gh_the_D~!}len~. Such a procedure not only will makeg ~ "­
all our responses consistent but wil1aiso give the Department an 0pportunity 11 ~ ~ 
review and approve documents being made available to Congress. f)&_,--~ ~ ~ 
In connection with our preparation of responses to requests ':Jt ~ ~ ~ 
Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses Should be by 
letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe 
the specific request which is being res~onded_.~~ in the letterhead memorandu .

In those instance~.nere documents are of a natufe tliat w~are 
not desirous of unauthorized personnel, whether they be in Congress or otherwise,
