Subject 
oC 
Letter .from Mr. G9se Coloiy 
o(; 
Please see enclosed letter from@,ose Colon) 
Over the phone he told me that he had some infor­
mation, rather vague, about some plot of air force 
o~ficers to ,; ~rnpeach II President Kennedy, including 
a.n·Air Force officer who had been attache in 
Czechoslovakia. I told him that·such information 
should be brought to the attention of the FBI. He 
promised to do it but whether he will or not, I do 
not know. 
::· ·X can only judge by telephone conversation 
in that he talked quite sanely but very vaguely.
