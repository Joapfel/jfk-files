basis by CIA. A good many things of that sort happened because 
they had the money. 
MR. BELIN: Secretary Rusk, we also talked about 
internal executive ov_ersight about CIA and the role of the 
Director of Central Intelligence, the per, as the head of the 
intelligence coromunity. 
Do you have any observations concerning tne question 
of executive oversight of the Agency, or any suggestions in that 
area? 
10 MR.' RUSK: Well, as I look back on it, I do have 
11 one specific and potentially important suggestion. CIA by 
12 statute reports to the National Security Council. Of course, 
the President . the Chairman, and his decisions in the National 13 l.S 
Security Council the; -decisions. . 14 are There l.S no voting pro-
15 cedure there. But the statutory members of the National 
16 Security Council, in my recollection, never once sat down and 
17 looked at the major tables and the budget of the CIA. We were 
18 sort of in the intelligence and operational chain of command 
l9 in a sense, but not in the administration chain of command. 
20 I would assume that what happened was that the,:. CIA 
21 would take their budget tc'. .m~ybe two or three members of the 
22 Bureau of the Budget, and then it would- .. ;be discussed briefly 
23

with the President, and then it wauld be taken down and 
discussed with Senator Russell, and that was about the end of 
it .
