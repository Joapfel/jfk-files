defiance of the State Department ban on travel to that 
country. These young revolutionaries were returned to 
Canada at the expense of the Cuban Government which converted 
a cattle boat into a malteshift troop ship. This boat 
arrived in St. John, Canada, on February 12, 1970, and 
immediately loaded 687 sympathetic American youths aboard 
for its return trip to Cuba. This group, like the first 
contingent, worked in the sugar cane fields until its 
return by the same means of transportation on April 28, 
1970. In August, 1970, the third c9ntingent of the VB, 
made up of 407 person~ journeyed to the Isle of Youth 
where they participated in a Cuban agricultural experiment 
of planting and fertilizing citrus trees. This group 
·returned to the u. s. mid-October, 1970. 
Each group worked approximately 7½ hours a d~y, 
. 5½ d~ys n.w~ek, and jn their fiee time were afforded the 
opportunity of absorbing communist propaganda offered by 
the Cubans, North Koreans and North Vietnamese. They were 
reminded by the Cuban camp director that they were here to 
show "solidari.ty with the. socialist struggle, to smash the 
U. S. blockade, and to make a breach in the facade of the 
u. s. imperialist monster."
