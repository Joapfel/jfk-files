Statement: "All Americans, as well as all of our friends in this 
hemisphere have been concerned over the recent mov~$ of the -Soviet 
Union to bolster the military power of the Castro regime in Cuba. 
Information has reached the Government in the·1ast 4 days from a 
variety of sources which establishes without-doubt that tl1e·Soviets 
have provided the Cuban Government with a number.of antiaircraft 
missiles with a short range. of 25 miles which are similar to early 
models.of our Nike. Along with these missiles, ·the Soviets are 
apparently pro~iding the extensive radar and ·other electronic equip~
