Senator Tower. Are the criteria different for paid.and 
for non-paid informers? 
Mr~ Adams. We have some informants over the years that ha e 
refused to accept payment, bu~ generally the criteria for 
both, I mean for ones ·that are paid is that it must be on a 
COD basis, evaluated as to the value of the ·information. 
Senator Tower. What protections are afforded to 
informants? 
Mrp Adams. Protections afforded them individually? 
Senator Tower. Yes. 
Mr. Adams. The greatest protection in the world we can 
afford them is to maintain the confidential relationship which 
they have adopted with the FBI, and the fact that those citizen 
of the United States who, for whatever reason, decide to 
cooperate with the FBI and cooperate with their government 
in criminal and the security field,. have that .confidentiality. 
maintained, and beyond that confidentiality we are unable to; 
afford them any protection,. any physical protection. We have 
had informants murdered through disclosure. We have·had them 
subjected. to. other. violence. and .. criminal. activities, and the 
only.protection beyond mainta~ning the confidentiality is once 
we have. used. them or. had. to. expose. them. for. some .. purpose., we 
do.have.procedures. for.relocation.and.maintenance.of. them which 
i~.utilized.quite.freq~e~tly in the top hoodlum and the Cosa 
Nostra type investigations.
