3. Extent and Nature of Current Supervision 
The program as it relates to all friendly foreign countries 
(except West Germany) is coordinated by the Number One· Man of the 
Nationalities Intelligence Section working through the separate supervisors 
assigned to the individual country rs desk within the Section. 
4. Current Justification for Continuation 
This program continues to produce information of substantial 
. value relative to Bureau investigations as well as substantive foreign 
political information of vital interest to the White House and members 
of the intelligence community. The information continues to illustrate 
the FBI's ability to produce valuable intelligence information relative 
to foreign political matters and to solidify the Bureau rs position as a 
valuable source of foreign intelligence data. It is recommended that this 
program be continued. 
5. Periodic Justification 
Program is evaluated annually and was last justified by 
memorandum dated 5/8/70. 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS - DANGEROUS 
ALIENS OF NATIONS OUTSIDE THE SOVIET BLOC 
Program was initiated inApril, 1951, to create a centralized 
com:p.ilation of undesirable and potentially dangerous aliens with diplomatic 
immunity against whom State Department can, when wartime emergency 
arises, initiate steps for deportation or lifting of their diplomatic immunity. 
The program applies only to aliens from countries outside the 
Soviet bloc employed in the United States in international organizations 
within provisions of International Organizations Immunities Act. The 
program is similar in intent to the Emergency Detention Program and the 
• PRODIP Program; however, it involves an entirely different type of 
individual. 
The program is a control device only and involves no investigative 
activity. Twenty-five individuals (as of 11/5/70) are included on the list 
with New York Office responsible for twenty and Washington Field Office 
responsible for five.
