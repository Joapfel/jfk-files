STURGIS~: I knew Jerry for years. Jerry did see the ad and did 
make contact with me and naturally I accepted him as a recruit because 
then because of the ad. 
OLSEN: How did it happen then that he got turned over to the 
United States Government? 
STURGIS: At a later date I have used up to this time here -- since 
1974, in the year 1974, after Watergate when I crune out of prison, I 
promised Jerry with the information that he gave me concerning the IRA, 
the Irish Republican Anny, concerning the North Korean agents that were 
in Mexico and also the drugs, I immediately tried to get in touch with 
Central Intelligence Agency. On January 25, 1974, I was in 
touch with Mr. McVan, that is his CIA code name, of the Miami station 
and his telephone at that time was 445-3658. I called him at my bank 
at 95th Street, N .W. 7th Avenue in Miami, Florida, at approximately 
10:35 A.M. He gave me a description of himself after I told him my 
name was Frank Sturgis. He 'named the Holiday Inn at LeJeune Road 
and 36th Street, where we were supposed to meet at. 11:00 A.M. in the 
lobby of the hotel. Naturally I waited fo-r an hour, and the bum never 
showed up. 
OLSEN: Frank, I'm having a hellva time trying to understand what 
the hell this is all about? I thought you started telling me about the 
ad that you placed in the Fort Lauderdale paper ~ n 196 7 to recruit people
