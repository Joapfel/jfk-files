-conferring an b,onorary degree upon a man like Dr .. Martin 
Luther King, who was not engaging in or suspected of engaging 
in criminal activity? 
·. Mr. Adams. J; know o;f no basis. 
The Chairman. Why did the FBI do it?· 
Mr. Adams. Well, we have to approach two_ parts, in 
my estimation, Senator Church. One, the basis fo~' our. 
-investigation of Martin Luther King, which was to determine 
communist influence.on.him,.my hands are t1ed in discussing 
that somewhat on the basis that: there is certain inform·ation 
which today, from an ongoing operation is sensitive and 
which, of course,:-we have made known to you and certain 
staff members. 
I would like to say on the 'basis that fro·m· our review 
we feel that we initially had a basis for inv~stigating Martin 
Luther King. 
Now as far as the activities which you a,re. asking about, 
the discrediting, I know of no basis for that and I will 
not attempt to justify it. 
Th~. ·chairman.. You never made a finding, .did you, that 
Martin Luther King was a com..~unist? 
Mr. Adams. No, sir, Wt;. d'id not. We were investigating 
communist influence an~ the possible effect on him. We 
never made such a determination. 
Th~ Chairman. Very well~ Then there was no justificati n
