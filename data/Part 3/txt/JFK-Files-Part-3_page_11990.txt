2. Positive Results Achieved Since the LaL Inspection 
Since the last inspection 151 cases have been 
opened on Chinese aliens and only one case on Chinese 
claiming United States citizenship. During this period 
197 alien cases have been closed and eight cases involving 
citizens were closed. Information developed during these 
investigations has been disseminated to the intelligence 
community. To date, no Chicom intelligence agent has been 
uncovered by these two programs; however, we have steadily 
increased our source coverage and collected positive intelli­
gence which has been disseminated to the intelligence 
community. This is a long-range program and it is expected 
it will pay dividends during the coming year with the establish­
ment of a Chinese Communist embassy in Canada.

destined to in the United States. The citizen cases are 
also supervised by three supervisors according to 
geographic location and these cases are furnished to us as

certain that each subject falls within the criteria and that 
when the cases are reopened for investigation after two 
years the case is evaluated to determine if the subject 
may possibly be an intelligence agent. 
4. Current Justification for Continuation 
These two programs cover two vulnerable areas 
·whereby the Chicoms could penetrate the United States by 
utilizing either aliens or individuals claiming United States 
citizenship who have been fully trained in Communist China 
and entered Hong Kong subsequent to 1/1/55. The screening 
process at United States Consulate Generalts office in 
Hong Kong is meager ·and current proposals for relaxation 
of rules will make it easier for the Chicoms to filter 
agents into the United States through the easiest route, 
that is, an alien or a citizen fully documented. These two 
programs ~lso are one of the best sources for the 
development of informants and the gathering of positive 
intelligence information. These programs are fully justified
