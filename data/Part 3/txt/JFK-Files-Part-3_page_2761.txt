deals with whether we shouldn't impose a standard of probable 
cause that a crime has been committed as a means of controlling 
the use of informants and the kind of information that they 
collect. 
D.o you feel that· this ·woµld be too restrictive? 
Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, I do. 
When I look at informants· and I see that each year 
informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they 
provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they recover $86 million 
in stolen property and contraba11:d, and that '.s irrespective 
J of what we give the.local law enforcemen~ and other Federal ::>

left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when 
we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure 
that we have the means tq gather information which will permit 
us to be aware of the identity of individuals and organizations 
that are acting to overthrow the government of the United 
States. l\nd I think we still·have some areas to look hard 
at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to 
stay. They are absolutely e~sentjal to law enforc~nent. 
Everyone. uses informants. 'l'he press has informants, Congress 
has informants, you have individuals in your cozmnµnity that 
you rely on, not for ulterior purposes, but to let you know 
what's the fecL of the people, am i serving them properly,
