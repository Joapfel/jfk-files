the information gathering facilities of the U.S. government 
became much greater. And I wonder if you have any opinion as 
to whether or not we might have at times gone to the other 
extreme so far as the storage of information? 
MR. RUSK: I think partly because of this absence of 
information earlie.r that· we tended to let intelligence become 
a thing in itself. I had the impression, for example, that in
