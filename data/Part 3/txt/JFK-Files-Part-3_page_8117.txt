As reported in my memorandum-oi 5/9/75, members of the 
Staff Committee are hoping that Mr. Mohr will be able to arrange an 
interview of Miss Gandy by members of the SSC providing Mr. Mohr 
is present. In this regard, Mr. Mohr desired some guidance as to 
what he could tell Miss Gandy if Staff Members asked her for the 
names of individuals, appearing in the official and confidential 
files of Mr. Hoover. Mr. Mohr was telephonically advised on the 
afternoon of 5/12/75 by Cregar that the Bureau could not give him 
any advice as to what he could tell Miss Gandy recognizing that 
whatever he told Miss Gandy was strictly between the two of them 
and not of concern or interest to the FBI. It was further pointed 
out to Mr. M0hr that neither he nor Miss Gandy should feel under 
any obligation to report to the Bureau what Miss Gandy decided i:p., 
this regard as well as what she might tell the Staf'fo:f:t:ne 's'scf \ 
during her fo~,it~coming interview by them on 5/15/7[,tS MAY 2;11 975 •

of the SSC Miss Gandy had turned over to Mr. Felt the official and 
confidential files amounting to one-half a file drawer. Mr. Mohr 
in speaking with Miss Gandy subsequent to his interview on 5/9/75
