COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - BLACK EXTREMISTS 
Bufile 100-448006 
Counterintelligence in the black extremist field i~ 
a supplement to our investigative activities that cannot be 
identified as a function of this Bureau because of its 
clandestine nature. The goals of it are to prevent violence 
and other illegal activities by black extremists and black 
extremist organizations, to prevent the growth and/or unifica­
tion of bJack. extremist groups, to prevent such groups from 
gaining respectability and to preclude the rising of a leader 
who might unify and electrify various extremist factions and 
, individuals. 
To achieve these objectives, techniques are e..~ployed 
to neutralize organizations and individuals involved in 
extremist activities that are a threat to the internal security 
of this·country. These techniques are aimed to embarrass, 
expose or otherwise neutralize these organizations and individuals. 
Counterintelligence action regarding black extremists 
was initiated 8/25/67 and was last justified 5/14/70. 
Counterintelligence operations are supervised on 
individual case desks as a logical adjunct of our investigative 
activities. In addition, one supervisor is designated coordinate= 
to insure that opera:ions initiated in different offices do not 
~onflict. A quarterly letter is submitted for each participating 
division showing operations under consideration and results 
gained. All communications authorizing the institution of any 
counterintelligence operaions are routed through Assistant to 
the Director William C. Sullivan; no operations are initiated 
by the field without Bureau approval.
