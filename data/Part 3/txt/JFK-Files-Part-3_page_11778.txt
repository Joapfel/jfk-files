COMPUTATION OF CASE AND WORK LOAD IN THE 
• DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
5-A-l c 
jA '" J;>lE€TOR E. S. IvlILLER: I have been advised that a new system of 
· ()t \ computing case and work load has been 
l {__µJplemented within your Division. Describe and state reason for implementation. 
It would appear that utilization of this system will result in a decrease 
in case load figures but not necessarily in the work load picture·. You are 
requested to advise by Section and 1Jnit basis the number of cases it is 
anticipated that the case load will decline in each instance. Use a 'before" 
and "after" approach. Case load figures 7/31/71 will be satisfactory for use 
as known base (before). Be as specific as possible. 
Comments of Assistant Director requested.
