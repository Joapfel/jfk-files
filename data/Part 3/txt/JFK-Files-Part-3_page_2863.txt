Kelley took charge. 
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director 
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous 
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse .. The 
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli 
gence operations,·and less on purely domestic surveillance. 
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in 
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These 
are welcome developments. 
Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved. 
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the 
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress 
should take into account in thinking about the future of 
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil·- · 
lance shoul~ extend beyond the investigation of persons 
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be 
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certai 
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance technique; 
whether foreign related intelligence activi±ies should be 
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement 
functions, and what should be done to the information already 
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in 
the future. 
The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange 
of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney
