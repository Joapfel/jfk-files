Was J. Walton Moore connected with CIA? Was he connected 
with the Oswald case? 
Answer: 
Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division 
office in Dallas during the early 1960's. His only contact 
with the Oswald case prior to the assassination is recorded in 
,. 
his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact 
Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document 
is also attached because of the poor legibility of the 
original). He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to 
support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-
gations. Mr., Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr. 
de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald. We find no 
indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and 
Mr. Moore.
