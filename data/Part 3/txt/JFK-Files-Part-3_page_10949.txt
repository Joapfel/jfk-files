Polish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovakian and other communist-bloc 
countries. For instance, irt the Cuban field on several occasions, 
FBI informants have been able to develop high-level or current 
intelligence regarding conditions in Cuba, and policies of the 
Castro regime through personal contacts with ranking_Cuban officials 
both in the U.So and abroad. • 
Through our coverage of the Communist Party, USA, and 
related organizations we have also frequently .Produced foreign 
intelligence, although to a lesser extent than in our operations in 
the foreign nationality field. One of our best sou~es of foreign, 
intelligence in.the domestic area is our.__so-called}Solo opefatio"r'iBI' 
wherein we have informants acting in a {Iiaisoii)capaci ty between th-e 
Communist Party, USA; and :foreign communist groups, i:acluding the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We have developed information 
through this operation regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute, social 
a~d political conditions in various countries, both in and outside 
the Soviet bloc, and tactics of the international communist movemento 
6. Additional Potential 
~ As indicated in the foregoing subsections, the Bureau is 
currently producing a considerable volume,of foreign intelligence 
through covert means, much of it of a significant nature. Most of 
'this cia-ca is an ou-cgrowi:h ui .iniu.1:111a..u.\,::;, Lc0ludca.l GvVG.;:-~go and 
investigative programs targeted primarily to fulfill our internal 
security and counterintelligence objectives and relatively speaking~ 
we have committed• only a small percentage of our assets exclusively 
in the direction of foreign intelligence . 
It is believed that the Bureau possesses considerable 
potential for the development of foreign intelligence which could 
be realized with a fairly modest expenditure of manpower and costs 
if we were to make foreign intelligence collection a primary aim. 
For example, with existing equipment and facilities, we could 
-expand our technical coverage of £or~ign establishments to include a. 
additional 30 to 40 foreign establishments provided we could assign 
about 25 additional personnel to this field. With the assignment • 
of an additional 75 to 100 Agents, we could greatly intensify our 
foreign intelligence collection through live informants, primarily 
through the development and exploitation of additional sources at
