TGP SECRET 
\ 229Q 
I did want to say, and I am afraid I have not said it 
here, and if.I have, I hope you will stop me, I- talked twice 
this morning, and I can't remember about the innovative role 
r 
that the PFIA has played in terms of its numbers or the board, 
and I guess I mentioned the U-2 reconnaissance and the satellite 
and etc., and~the economic-reports of the Government. That 
reminds me. 
Now, finally, one thing that might be considered, and 
I have suggested this in the Board from time to time, but it 
has never gone _very far, and I'm not sure about its wisdom mysel , 
one solution, one action that might be taken in connection with 
the covert activities of the Agency would be to move them to 
a warehouse in Philadelphia, or a music store in Dallas or 
something and get them out of Washington so that they are not 
on the cocktail circuit, although in fairness, I. t~ink :t}1at the 
Agency personnel through the years have done very damn well in 
not leaking. nut if there is to be a reorganization, one thing 
that might be considered would be to keep the completely • .. 
overt activities, which comprise, as you know, the majority of 
the CIA functions, or involve a majority of their personnel, and 
' 
move the covert.stuff outside, and just get it out of the nation's 
capital. I would not eliminate it because I think it is necessa y . 
But this is a consideration which perhaps may not have been 
pr~sented . 
MR. BELIN: Are there any other questions by members
