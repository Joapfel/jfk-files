you approved continu~tion of telephone surveillance at the 
headquarters of the[YLP in New YorkJfor a three-month period, 
effective June 30, 1970. • 
It has been determined that telephone service at[YLP 
headquarters]has been terminated due to nonpayment of the 
telephone bill. Accordingly, the coverage previously approved 
by you is being discontinued, effective July 15, 1970. 
The YLP continues to have telephone service at its 
ronx, New York, chapter which is also the center for publica-
1on of its revolutionary paper, "Palante." It would appear 
hat YLP activity in the New York area will now be centered at

·, coverage of YLP headquarters provided valuable intelligence data 
regarding the organizational and the financial structure of the 
.YLP and also furnished information regarding the identities of at
