certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on ---\I'-• , 
CIA Activities WithJn the United States, for the preparation ,: J 
of its report to the President, which materials most probably i .:-~·:. ~-~ 
contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost 
sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of 
such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with 
Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to 
discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant 
special consideration. Senator Church agreed that the above 
matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's 
appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

For your additional information~· this Bureau had 
earlier asGertained that the Senate Select Committee has had 
access to a 693-page document prepar.ed by CIA listing instances 
wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its 
mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi­
cated that some of these operations involve matters involving 
this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to 
a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material copta;Lp~ 
in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished 
copies of the material requested. 3 JUL 22 1975

SSC on 7/16/75, the above material furnished by CIA consisting 
of approximately 174 pages was reviewed. This material is .. 
found to contain numerous references, in sanitized form, ,to \ ,'
