responsibilities· of other Federal agencies. 
Is this essential to their functions, or do you 
believe that some regular appropriation control over them 
similar to the State Department and other would be possible 
without destroying their role? 
MR. RUSK: I am incli.ned to think that at least part 
of the CIA budget ought not to be on the public record. It 
ma1 ·-be that there is a part of it that can be, but I think there 
ought to be some covert money that is available to the CIA 
handled by people in the Congress who understand what is being 
done and the need for this for covert funds. 
I personally would not like to see this han~led in 
the normal budgetary processes of the government. And for 
example, we give away an enormous amount of information every 
year in these large budget presentations of the Department of. 
Defense tol the Congress, and I think certainly in the 
sensitive agencies we overdo public knowledge to some extent. 
M.R.·LEMNITZER: We have had a suggestion that if the 
19 government continues to support covert operations that the 
20 covert operations should be removed from the CIA and put in< .a 
21 central intelligence group, which was the arrangement in the 
22 early days between the_transition from ass to CIA. 
23 Do you think such an arrangement would solve any of 
24 the problems that are involved in carrying out effective covert 
25 operations?
