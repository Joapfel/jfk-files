On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church Director Se/__ 
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee. {;; ~ -r 67v11 
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee • 
a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing 
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that 
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence 
in the intelligence agencies. • 
,i' 
Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that t 
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic <{ £) 
activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies \ --;~" 
have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary 4-· 
to prevent such abuses in the future. 
Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central 
Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies 
involved in domestic 
1
intelligence. 
The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately 
40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary 
background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller 
indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in 
this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the 
FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being 
furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being per~o11ally 
satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance. 
Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that 
he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary 
Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard 
was pointed out wher,Si}l,_~~udiciary Committee in con:n.e.cij.on with the 17 . 
wiretaps had written ~er indicating that if we ma~e,l rlasslll'.eJt-=- Q,1'.
