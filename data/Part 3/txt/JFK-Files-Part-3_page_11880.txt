ASSIST~T DIRECTOR c. D. BRENNANd,re~m:s ic Intelligence 
'\!.tJ Divis on is appreciative 
of the.observations and suggestions set forth in the 
Inspector's Addendum. Accordingly, I am instructing all 
Section Chiefs to stress this matter with all supervisory 
personnel in the Division. Further, all of our supervisors 
who regularly lecture to In Service classes and New Agents 
classes will stress this matter. We will of course follow 
the field in the individual cases where it is obvious or 
even appears that the required action is not being taken in 
the preparation of necessary FD-302s.
