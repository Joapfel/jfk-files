Swiss Police asked Bureau assistance in establishing 
the location of Yos~l2.b--G~)!.,J~~ .. ,.,.. who had secured more than 
$400,000 in an armed robbery of a jewelry store in Zurich. 
The loot was recovered in Italy, and investigation under the 
Foreign Police Cooperation character resulted in the location 
of Gargy in the United States. We arranged for his arrest by 
other'"authorities so that he might be held for extradition. 
During the calendar year 1970, Agents on the Foreign 
Liaison Desk handled 822 foreign visitors. These included 
not only special tours of Bureau facilities but also, in many 
instances, special conferences with Bureau officials, including 
the Director, and other courtesies for these contacts of our 
Legal Attache personnel.
