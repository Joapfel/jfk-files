U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT 
ROBERTS. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of 
the COINTELPRO was. 
Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a 
disruptive type program. 
Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently 
written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth 
Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He-inquired as to why 
this letter was written. • 
Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one 
of the stroµger leade~s of th~ San Diego Branch of the BPP, 
• and" if· it wa·s possible to keep him from becoming a strong 
leader; it would be disrup~ive· to the party. The fact that 
Denman wa"'f···1rvitig with a '"'whitEi'· giri••·was considered ~aeroga-t.ory ·-.., 
tow~rd him by BPP members in San Diego. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such ·activity 
would have been taken against a leader in an organization 
such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) 
(see description) if the leader of such a group had been 
1iving with a white woman.· Would such a letter be appropriate? 
Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a 
letter would be appropriate in this case because this organi­
zation involved a religious leader and our program was not 
directed at religious groups but was directed toward black 
militant and extremist groups. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled 
individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell. 
Mr. Baker stated that he could not recall anything 
specific about any of these individuals, except what he had 
previously stated concerning Denman. He said he could recall 
the names but nothing more concerning these individuals.
