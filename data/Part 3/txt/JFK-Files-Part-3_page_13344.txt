get picked up properly on this thing, w~uld you move closer -- pick a

touch witIL him. You must understand that because he asked me -- you can 
understand his position; his position was political under Eduardo; 
as I said before, E. Howard Hunt or Eduardo was a political officer with 
CIA with the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
OLSEN: Well, what I'm getting at is: Did anybody ever contact you-­

about an assassination after the 0ne that you have just described to us?
