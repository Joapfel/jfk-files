RE: 
Approval was granted by you on December 4, 1970, 
authorizing continuation of the telephone surveillance on 
the offices of the'[f.os Angeles Black Panther Party (BPP), 
Los Angeles, Californiq for an additional three months, 
effective December 5, 1970. As you ·were previously advised, 
this authorization covers telephone surveillances of chapter 
operational phases at~043 East Stoclcwell~ 2136 East 113th Street 
and 731 East 78th Street:J . 
Infonnation has now been developed that the chapter 
is utilizing another location atl5321 Staunton, Number 257, 
Los Angeles:;! particularly for night operations. According to 
our sources, this location has become a hub of evening activity 
with leaders congregating there. Tl1e location has als~been the 
starting and termination points of a key\J.os Angeles Bff)under­
ground figure when acquiring ·weapons. It is also being used as 
an apparent clearing house for clandestine telephone calls. 
This location is referred to as theWPP Day Care 
Center:;] Typical of ~antherij deceit and treacllery, they reason 
that ·with the child atmosphere the police would not recognize 
it as a seriousThPFJoperation and would not take reprisal against 
it if they did. 
The~anther office at 2136 East 113th StreeiJwas _gutted 
by fire on FeEruary 6, 1971, making operational occupancy untenable 
and repair or replacement indefinite. Telephone surveillance has 
been discontinued due to fireo
