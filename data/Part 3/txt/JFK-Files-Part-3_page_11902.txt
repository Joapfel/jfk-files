The two principal informants in th~s operation 
. have received the "Order of Lenin, 11 with the \title 
"Hero of Soviet Labor" from the Soviets. This is the 
highest award given civilians by the Soviet Union and was 
given our sources for thei.r "invaluable contribution to the 
I
! international communist movement." 
. Continued high-level penetration of the CPUSA 
• :, represents a sustained major accomplishment. At the time 
f of the last inspection, we had 11 informants who were 
f: officially members of the CPUSA National Com.~ittee. At 
~i the present time, this overall number remains the same, 
~·; but we have exchanged two informants to give us a better 
1 geographical breakdown. In addition, we have another 
:"; informant who is an ex officio member of the National 
; Committee because of the sensitive nature of his Party 
~ assignments. This latter source is also a member of the 
I Political Committee which, in effect, runs the Party. 
;; This top-level coverage is responsible for furnishing 
J information regarding policy-making matters on a day-to-day 
.~ basis as they occur.
