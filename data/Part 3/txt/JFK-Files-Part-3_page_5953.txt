to 3:35 p.m., Section Chief William A. Branigan, CI-1 Section, 
Intelligence Division; Assistant Director John A. Mintz,

Generally speaking, the reception by the Chairman and 
the various Senators, as well as members of the staff, was 
a friendly one. No antagonism was shown to the Bureau repre­
sentatives, and the Senators by t~eir questions indicated a 
desire to help the Bureau in our foreign counterintelligence ....... 
operations. . • • \) 
At the request of the Chairman, the eight separate~ 
mail intercept surveys were explained to the Committee, 
including the length of time that these surveys were in operation 
and the value that was derived from them. 
During the hearing we were supplied with a copy of a 
Staff Memorandum which outlined various aspects of our operations 
which would not be disclosed during a public hearing·. The 
Staff Memorandum also outlined certain questions which could 
~ot be discussed at a public hearing and suggested that these 
questions be raised at the Executive Session •. A copy of the 
Staff Memorandum is attached for your inf ormaji'.'.?/ / f '2 ,· -:, q' f
