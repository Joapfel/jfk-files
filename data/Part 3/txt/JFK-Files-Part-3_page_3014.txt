Mr. Adams. The main ~ifficulty is the particularity 
which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You 
have to go after particular evidence. You have to specify 
what you're going after, and an informant operates in an . 
area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's 
. goin~ to be discussed at that meeting. It may be a plot to 
blow up the Capitol again or it may be a plot to blow up the 
State Department building. 
Senator Mathias. If it were a cr~ninal investigation, 
you would have little'difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't 
you? 
Mr. Adams. We would have difficulty in :i warrant to 
use someone as.an informant in that area because the same 
difficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify. 
Senator Hathias. I understand the problem because it's 
very similar to one t.hat we discussed earlier ih connection 
say wiretaps on a national security problem. 
Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of 
where the Sovi~t, an individual identified as a Soviet spy 
in a fricn<lly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy 
there an4 now he's coming to the United States, and if we can't 
show under a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that 
;;

he was actually e~gaging in espionage in the United States,
