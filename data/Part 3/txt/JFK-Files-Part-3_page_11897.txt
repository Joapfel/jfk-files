During the conduct of these background investi­
gations the field should be particularly alert to every 
potential opportunity for developing member informants in 
not only the ECCSL but also in other sympathetic and 
splinter groups which develop or spin off from the vortex 
of this group. ' 
It is noted that you have pointed out elsewhere 
in this report that 97 individuals have been involved 
in 16 separate and distinct organized incidents and attacks 
on Government agencies and private corporations. Twenty­
five persons were involved in three or more such incid~nts.

to keep the Bureau fully advised of all demonstrations, 
vigils, harrassment tactics, etc., conducted by sympathetic

strations should be afforded sufficient appropriate coverage 
to develop identities and background of leading activists 
and sponsors ?f such sympathetic activities. 
During these background investigations, particular 
emphasis should be placed on developing sources of funds 
~nd financing of the principal conspirators. A review of 
this file noted that the subjects appear to travel frequently, 
make numerous long-distance phone calls, rent cars, etc., 
yet outwardly, appear to have limited sources of income. 
3. The field should be alerted to the distinct 
possibility that other groups similar to the ECCSL are 
formed as a result of the indictments returned in this 
matter. Field offices should also be alerted to Other 
retaliatory actions by sympathetic groups attempting 
to-capitalize on the "persecution" theory thereby 
exploiting the recent indictments as a sympathetic 
rallying point for more conspiratorial activities.
