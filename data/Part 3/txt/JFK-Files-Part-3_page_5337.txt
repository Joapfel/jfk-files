. At 3:05 p. m. on July 8, 1975, I met with Deputy Attor~~y Generar . 
Tyler and advised him of the fact that Mr. Wilderotter had furnished l ': i 
certain materials to the Bureau at t.lie time of his transfer to the White House~ 
I told him that Mr. Wilderotter requested an inventory be prepared of the .N 
materials in order to assure their appropriate disposition and that such ar~ • 1:i 
inventory was prepared. I told him that the Attorney General was advised by~ 
memorandum dated June 26, 1975, with a copy designated for the Deputy, Bi: 
each of which enclosed a copy of the inventory. I explained that I took a copy a 
of the inventory to Mr. Wilderotter and requested him to n1ark thereon his .··· • S 
suggestions as to the disposition of each item. . . •• / __ ~ 
I suggested that some of the items appea;ring ~ the inventory-·w' ~. 
could be material pertinent to the current inquiries by th1e-S~ate Select ~ 
Committee and to conversations recently had with the Deputy Attorney General , 
concerning official and confidential files maintained by Mr. Hoover. 
I told the Deput-y th.at my pur.pose in bringing this matter to his personal attentlo. 
was to emphasize my concern that the Department would be aware of the 
existence and location of the material listed in the inventory and of our 
interest in having materials returnsd to the Department or o herwise 
disposed of at the earliest possible date. '
