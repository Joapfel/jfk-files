its findings and make its recommendations to-the Senate in 
connection ~ith our investigation into alleged involvement of 
the United States in certain assassination plots, and attempts 
directed against foreign leaders. 
The Committee, as you know, has made an exhaustive investi 
gation of this issue. It has ·taken some six months; 7 5. witness s 
a have been interrogated, over 8000 pages of testimony have·been 
9 taken, mountains of documents have been analyzed and digested, 
10 and the report will be a detailed accounting to the American 
11 people of that evidence, together with the findings and 
12 
13 
recommendations of the Committee. 
Initially these disclosures will be made to the Senate in 
14_ secret session, after which the Committee has previously voted 
15 to make ·the r~port public.· Therefore, it is anticipated that 
16 at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in this room,. the caucus room, 
17 following that secret session.of the Senate, the Committee will 
18 meet with the press for the purpose of. answering such

questions as the press may wish to address to the Committee on 
the assassination report. 
Now, the last few questions I would like to put to you, 
Mr. Adams, have to do with some confusion in my mind concerning 
the purpose of the FBI in monitoring the Women's Liberation 
movement, what was· that? 
. 
What was that surveillance done for? 
Why were you involved in monitoring that movement?
