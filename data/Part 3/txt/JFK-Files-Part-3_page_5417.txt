QUESTION: 
• • 
we have not, to my kno~ledge, denied the ·right of anyone, 
presently employed to be interviewed with, of course again, 
the requir~ents that if -they want to consult with us 
they·may.do so. 
Well, in other words, you're saying that FBI Agents can 
be interviewed by the Senate staff~ .Is that correct? 
Let m~ just check that. Mr. Mintz, is that correct? Have 
we denied any? 
We have not denied any. We've not indicated to anyone 
we would not let them be interviewed. 
What was that Mr. Kelley, about ex--I didn't understand, 
about ex-FBI Agents? 
Ex-FBI Agents, when called, and we're advised, are informed 
that one of our people can be present outside the inter-
view room for consultation by that interviewee with our 
peopl~ to determine whether or not a certain question is 
beyond the purview of his capability, and we do not say to 
him that he cannot answer but we do say here are the rules, 
the regulations, the law and you can be guided in accordance 
with your own dictates. But we make available to him a con­
sultant, so to speak. 
Is that a requirement or .. ? 
That's an agreement between us. 
In other words, when an ex-Agent goes up, he has to have 
somebody?
