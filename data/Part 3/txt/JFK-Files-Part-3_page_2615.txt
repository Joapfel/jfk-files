a step that I beli_eve is absolute).y essential , a legislative 
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence 
jurisdiction for the FBI. 
Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the 
security_ and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it 
must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither the Cqngres 
nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to 
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in 
the past. 
This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role 
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of 
our performance. 
I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the 
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that 
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role 
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative 
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have 
been Executive Branch decisions. 
I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would 
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast 
them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our 
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con­
gressional oversight or Executive decision. 
The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination
