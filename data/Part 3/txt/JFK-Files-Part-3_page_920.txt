·conduct the fact-finding investigations necessary to sustain successful 
prosecutions. The creation of this ''detective' 1 force by Congress aimed 
to fill that void. 
Over the years the responsibilities of this agency, which eventually 
became known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), have increased 
b'emendously. From a small agency charged with- the task of conducting 
investigations regarding reiatively few matters, the FBI has developed into 
an agency held accountable for investigating violations of over 180 categories

The question ai•ises at this point whether removal of. the FBI from
