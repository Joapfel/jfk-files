Suggestion Memorandum 
Articles Concerning Activities of 
Racial Extremists 
Research Section 
with the activities of racial extremists. Care should be 
( 
taken to use only material of a non-confidential nature which 
would not be detrimental to Bureau operations. Consideration 
' should be given to a study of the Black Panther Party along 
the lines of the article entitled "A Study of Marxist Revolutionary 
Violence; SDS, 1962-1969" which effectively exposed the SDS. 
Other articles, perhaps shorter and more limited in scope, on 
specific activities and groups also should be considered at an 
early date. 
Comments of Section Chief R. Do Cotter and 
Assistant Director c. D. Brennan requested.

COTTER: The Inspector's suggestion 
has merit. It is believed that 
Research Section would be able 
to gather together material which would be of value in educating the public 
to the real nature of extremists such as the Black Panther Party. Research 
Section will, consistent with current work assignments, begin preparation 
of material which, in coordination with Crime Records Diviston, can be 
made public.
