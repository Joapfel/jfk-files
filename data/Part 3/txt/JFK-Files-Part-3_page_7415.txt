Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
On 6/6/75, Mr. Walter Elder,. CIA, advised that CIA 
had no objection to the LHM dated 3/23/70, being furnished to 
the SSC. With regard to the memorandum from Mr. Papich to 
Mr. Brennan dated 2/13/70, Mr. Elder requested that the name 
of the CIA representative who furnished the information in the 
memorandum be deleted from line one of the memorandum prior to 
its being furnished to the SSC. Provided this is done, CIA has 
no objection to this memorandum being furnished to the SSC. 
He suggested that when the name is deleted, it be replaced with 
the phrase "A CIA officer." 
ACTION: 
To record CIA's clearance of the above-described 
documents.
