I . . . 
. The Court of Appeals makes it clear at the outset t~~~ 
it is not considering Title III since the interceptions in iss~~ 
occured prior to passage of t~at Act. Both the Government a~c 
the appellant agreed that the governing statute at the tine o= 
·the interceptions in issue was Section 605 of the Cornmunicat~c~s 
Act of 1934. 
.. 
The Court of Appeals found no error in the District 
. <. .. .' _ ,Court• s rtiling that the Government had given full disclosure 
·• · ·_. ·on the concededly illegal rµicrophones, and that these did not 
·.···taint Ivanov' s conviction. 
The Court of Appeals cites Alderman for the pro?ositic~ 
that the question of whether or not the Government's evidence 
was obtained from electronic surveillance could be resolved 
only by an evidentiary hearing, and because the Govern~ent houl~ 
not participate in a hearing on the second set of surveilla~ces 
the Court of Appeals felt it had to assume "in the presen~ 
posture of this case
