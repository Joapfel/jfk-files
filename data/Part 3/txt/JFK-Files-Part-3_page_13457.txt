daylights scared out of them and they will crawl off under 
their shells and will be too timid.

g Committee, but it does affect our concerns, because the

11 implications. So I wonder, you say we should keep this

6rganization in our governrnettal structure, to tuck it away 
where nobody hears about it and it doesn't come before 
parliamentary review and things of that sort. And maybe we 
should have tried that at the beginning, because so much of 
CIA's activities are for all practical purposes overt, and , 
maybe we might have had something called a Central Information
