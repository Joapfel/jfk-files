In early 1~75, at the request of the SSC and the House 
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)_, we began 
conducting applicant-type investigations of personnel assigned -
to these committees and also of applicants for positions with these 
committees. Through January 6, 1976, we have conducted 160 such 
investigations received from the SSC and 39 received from the 
HSC. Although no charges have been made, the costs involved at 
the current rate would be $338,720 for the SSC and $82,563 for 
the HSC, for a total of $421,283. 
Pursuant to Constitutional Amandment 25, approved in 
1967, the President requested an investigation in October of 
1973t- conce-rning Gerald R. Ford for the appointment to Vice 
President. Then in August, 1974, an investigation was conducted 
at the request of the Pre$ident -concerning Nelson Aldrich 
Rockefeller_, Vtce President-Designat·e. Thus t- for the fii-st time in the history of the United States Government, an applicant-type 
investigation was conducted concerning the President and Vice 
Presid~nt~ These were the most extensive investigations ever 
conducted by the FBI., of an applicant-type nature. 
The investigations handled by the FBI are limited to 
existing law, executive order, or by special agreement with the 
President and/or the Attorney General. They are not routine and it is not believed they should be or could be eliminated.
