This is a very important European office covering 
Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. There is a high 
volume of both criminal and security work. The large 
United State military presence in Germany is both an

In fiscal 1971 20 persons wanted in the United States 
·were located in the Bonn territory and 5 stolen cars were 
recovered. The Legal Attache is currently working a ring 
·case which will result in location of an additional number. 
Through 8/23/71 he has submitted 18 HILEV items of which 7 
have been disseminated. This is considerably below average 
and this matter was discussed with the Legal Attache during 
his visit to Washington on home leave recently. He has shown 
improvement as evidenced by the fact that he has submitted 4 
items already during August of which 3 have been used. His 
pending case load as of 6/30/71 was 355 which is considerably 
above average on a per ag~nt basis.
