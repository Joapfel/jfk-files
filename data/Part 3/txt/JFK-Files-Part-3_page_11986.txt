VISITORS TO COMMUNIST CHINA AND 
CONTACTS BY UNITED STATES RESIDENTS 
OF CHINESE DIPLOMATIC ESTABLISHMENTS 
(Bufile 105-144424)

1. Background, Date of Inception, Scope and Desired Objectives. 
Program was initiated in 8/65 in connection with 
efforts to cover Chinese Communist (Chicom) activities in 
the United States. Through cooperation of both United States 
intelligence agencies and friendly foreign intelligence services, 
,the identities of United States residents are furnished to us 
who attempt to enter Communist China or contact People's 
Republic of Cbi. na (P.l={C) ni yi1 omati c establishments in ce.rtaj.p 
countries throughout the world. 
'rhis program is field-wide and not directly connected 
with any other investigative program. The objectives include 
identifying those individuals who enter the PRC and who may be 
engaged in Chicom activities in their contacts with Chicom 
establishments. The identity of these visitors is absolutely 
necessary in order to determine if they have access to classified 
material or if they could be utilized effectively by the Chicoms 
when they return to the United States. Some of these individuals 
have excellent potential for informant development. We have 
utilized contacts with Chicom diplomatic establishments in the 
development of selected sources who are attr~ctive to the Chicoms 
and have been developed as double agents. By SAC Letter No. 
70-26 dated 5/12/70, we restricted our investigations to cover 
~ctual visitors to China. This procedure was initiated to 
conserve man.power inasmuch as State Department had relaxed travel 
restrictions to China on 3/16/70 in order to allow travel to 
PRC for any 11 legitimate purpose. 11 The President recently directed 
that a committee prepare recommendations for additional steps 
which may be taken to relax restrictions on travel to and promote 
further trade with the PRC. This highly confidential directive, 
if accepted, will permit many people to be eligible to travel to 
China if the Chinese will grant travel permits. Up to the present 
time, however, the Chicoms have only granted travel permits to 
pro-Chicom propagandists such as Edgar Snow.
