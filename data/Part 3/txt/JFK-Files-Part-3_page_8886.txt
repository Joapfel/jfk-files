BlACK PANTHER PARTY 
VIII. PROPAGANDA 
Although posters, pamphlets, recordings, and a singing group called "The 
Lumpen" are among propaganda vehicles used by the Black Panther Party, the main 
channel to the public is through their official organ, The Black Panther. Funds 
permitting, it is published weekly in Oakland, California. It includes editorials 
by Party leaders and spokesmen; provocative slogans; inflammatory articles; rev• 
olutionary art," comprising cartoons; and an international news section.
