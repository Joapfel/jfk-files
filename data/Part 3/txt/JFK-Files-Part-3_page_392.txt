inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific 
portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-
.ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect ':: • 
to such specifically designated portions of documents, ~-\2~~~'. 
the Committee staff will prepar~ appropriate excisions 
or summaries of the information; the summaries will be 
checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to 
ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI 
sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents 
and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices; 
the Committee staff may check back to the original documents 
as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated 
specific portions of documents-will not be removed from 
FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at.any time 
see the documents which the staff has seen. 
I believe this interpretation can serve as a work­
·able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive 
FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares 
your concGrn for the ~eed to provide srA~i~1 hMnoling tech­
niques to conyey or secure any particularly sensitive 
information or materials, as indicated in. t1).e 01,1tline for 
Inquiry Procedures. we nope this interpretation will 
-'facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the 
Department of Justice to accomplish this purposer 
I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice 
to me as to whether any further interpretation of this 
matter is required. Any public discussion of these arrange-
- ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as 
·will not jeopardize particularly sensitive FBI sources. 
Sincerely,
