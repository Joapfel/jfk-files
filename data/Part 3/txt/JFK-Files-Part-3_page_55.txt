RE! NOT TO CONTACT LIST 
OBSERVA'I'IONS: 
• 
It is not felt that the list continues to serve 
a useful purpose, and it is further believed that the 
responsibility of restricting contact with a person who is 
antagonistic toward the FBI or law enforcement in general· 
should be that of the Agent in Charge. • 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. ·That the attached memorandum be forwarded 
to all offices. 
2. That if approved, the attached memorandum 
be returned to the Crime Records Division for dissemination 
to the field.
