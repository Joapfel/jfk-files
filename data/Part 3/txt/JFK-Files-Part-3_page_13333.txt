SECRET SENSITIVE 
The information plugged into the indexing syste1n will not become an 
actual file until there is some reason for opening a file on a particular 
person. At that point (for exan1ple, a file search requested by another 
Agency) all information relating to a particular person will be collated 
in one place. ·This, in turn will be developed into a separate file (a 
personality file). If the iniorn1ation on a particular person is requested 
by a CIA field office, the collation process \vould occur and the field would 
be told ho\v the partiC:uJar person had c:ome to the attention of the Agency 
in the first instance and would also be told any derogatory information which 
the field station \vould vvant to kno\v. __ 
Other CI files derived from on-going cases. Part of these files emanate 
from information provided to the Agency by defectors. Fo~ example, one 
element of this information is designated "Soviet leads. 11 ·,This is because the 
-··• ·• CI staff learned from a defector that all Soviet \Vomen employed in the ·United 
States Embassy in the USSR during a ce_rtain perio,q \Vere Soviet_a.gents. 
Some of these6Yomen, in turn, married Americans_J and, as a result, now 
live in the United States. The FBI is advised of the identity of all these 
cy;ome~] The CI·staff,·•under official cover, occasionally goes out to inter­
vie\v these (;omenJ in an effort to convince them to reveal what they know 
about KGB operations. The effort was first to determine whether the 
\Vomen continue to be KGB agents, _and, if not, to gather infor~ation from 
them. The general modus operandi would be to tell[he womenJhat we know 
that at one time they were KGB agents and, \vhile we did not intend to take 
any action against them, to request them to reveal inf~rmation that they 
may have learned at that time concerning I<GB. operations. Generally, 
@ie \vome~\vould agree to do so. If th~ did not, .thehco12-tract would,· at 
least temporarily, be dropped. TheseL:vomen ar~/,usse~ra's "defectors \Vho.

Other e~s of going cases are: a journalist who had private contact 
\Vith George Blake, a former KGB agent in England; an American who 
\Vas tied into the Able case (in this instance, the actions are taken by 
the Bureau, but guidance\fgiven by CI staff); and a journalist who the KGB·, 
on three occasions, attempted unsuccessfully to recruit.~:~ 
Other files may relate to actions b~gun because of some kind of counter_­
intellig-ence implication in a particular situation. In these instances CI 
\Vould maintain the. files because of the particular sensitivity o_f the matter, 
even though action may be taken by another Agency component. 
~::Stein noted that the decision as to whether to utilize someone as a douple agent is -
made by the CIA. If the decision is affirmative, the double agent \Vould be handled by th~ 
Agency ( if he is abroad) or by the FBI ( if he is in this country). The only exceptions to 
this pattern \vould be where the double Agent is in the United States for only a brief time 
or ,where he has a special relationship with a particular CIA officer.
