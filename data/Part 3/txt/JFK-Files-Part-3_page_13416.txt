TOP SECRET 2205 
influencing American policy is a major effort on the part of 
almost every foreign office in the world. Wherever a dispute 
develops, the parties will each come in to try and get the 
United States to take their side, and so we are the target of

24 MR. RUSK: I must confess I am worried about a kind 
25 of euphoric and unilateral repeal of the Cold War in this countr
