QUESTION: 
MR. KELLEY: 
QUESTION: 
• 
•• 
Mr. Kelley, do you feel the oversight being conducted now 
between the ·senate and House is probing too deeply into the 
FBI--do you .feel that any of the operations of the FBI have 
been hurt by the investigations going on now? 
I do not construe the activities of the oversight groups 
as having delved too deeply into the work of the FBI.. We do 
on occasion feel that perhaps some matters need protection, 
particularly those involving national security, but I have 
no objection in the exchange in oversight groups of· any 
matter in which we are engaged. I think, as a matter of 
fact, that this is a proper balance insofar as keeping us 
in line and I also welcome it inasmuch as it gives us an 
opportunity to explain just what and how we do things. I 
do not object to the exchange, in other words. 
Mr. Kelley, you said that you're not attempting to preserve 
the image of J. Edgar Hoover and, apparently, you know 
what will be in the information that is to go out of your 
office in 10 days. Can you tell us, when that information 
gets up to the Hill and assuming it's made public, are there 
going to be some more bomb shells about the FBI that we 
haven't heard about or is this all information which has 
;' generally been made public? 
MR. KELLEY: I don't know of any bomb shells, so to speak. In the news 
media, there have been many things discussed, many reports 
made, and in those matters I think that just about every­
thing that we know apout has been already, at least to
