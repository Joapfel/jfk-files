) matte·r with· the .President who. had concurred •in the DCI 's 
3.ug~estlon-· that the b'riefi~g o~- the Board Panel be limited 
to proc~dural aspects of the Special NSC 5412/2 Group. ·. ·, • 
Dr. Killian I s ·reply to the DCI was to the· effect that this -·

that the abilf ty of the· Board to_ ·get complete information 1• 
concerning covert -ac,tion activities was· essential jf the Board 1 
were to be able to discharge its r~sponsibility to the President. I 
Mr. Clifford thought, that the gravi t·y of this issue with the J 
DCI was such that it warranted mention to the .President when / 
the Boa~d met w~th.the Pr~~~dent the foliow1ng d~y,· and the /. 
Pre~ident should be told the background of the problem and how / 
the matter had been resolved. •
