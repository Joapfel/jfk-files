OLSEN: Now., in addition to th.ose discus.sions th.at took place 
in Cuba early in 1959, when you were an officer of the Cuban Air Force, 
and the discussions that you had with Bernard Barker sometime in 1961 
about a possible assassination of some unnamed person at an unnamed 
-location, have you ever had any 0th.er discussions with. anybody whatever 
associated with the United States Government about assassinations? 
STURGIS: No, sir; not that I can remember at this:·time. 
OLSEN: You mentioned to me wh.en we talked over the telephone, 
Frank, that you had had some contact with. or some relationship with 
a planned assassination of Premier Castro in New York. What was that 
that you were referring to? 
' 
STURGIS: Th.ere was a time--t don't remember the exact date--
tb~t Fidel was in New-YOrk..; there was a conspiracy or at least talk 
of a conspiracy to want to kill him. Now as far as CIA is concerned, 
I don't believe that they were involved or any agents were involved in 
that conspiracy.wanting to assassinate Fidel. 
OLSEN: Was , this then something that was discussed among elements 
of the Cuban exiles in Florida? 
STURGIS: Yes, sir. New York. and Florida. 
OLSEN: Did you have any contact or know of any contact whatever 
in connection with. such. discussions of assassinating Premier Castro in 
New YOrk.-- did you have any contact whatever with anybody in the Government 
of the United States? 
STURGIS: That -ts very difficult to answer, 1'1r. Olsen, because 
of the dates.involved. t would think that 1 had contact with the AgencyJ 
but again I will state that whether they knew about or were involved in 
any conspiracy myself I do not know.
