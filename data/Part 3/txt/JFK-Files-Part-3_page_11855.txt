SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
·RE: PAYMENTS TO SECURITY INFORMANTS 
AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES 
S. MILLER: Present regulations allow for payments up 
to $400 with SAC authority on a COD basis 
, o individuals being developed as informants on security matters. (Manual 
of Instructions, Section 107, page 14.) Once the individual is paid $400 and 
it appears he will furnish information on a regular basis, recommendation 
.:.could be made to Bureau to pay him on "regular basis. " Such authorization 
is through usage of FD-401. After the initial payments are approved, every 
6 months an FD-401 is submitted requesting continuance, and, if approved, 
is stamped "approved" at the Bureau and returned. (Manual of Instructions, 
Section 107, page 15. )

ent Gvvefilli1ei1t-widG GG0:u.0m.y uio;·(:: a..r.J.d the Bureau rs 
own economy program, it is imperative that the field exercise great care and 
scrutiny in payments to informants to assure that payments on a "regular 
basis u are fully justified and are not serving as an administrative crutch and 
expedient in lieu .of payments under SAC authority. 
. A survey has been made of 80 files of informants who are presently 
being paid on a regular basis with respect to the date the informant was 
approved as a PSI, the date approval was given to pay him on a regular basis, 
and the amount paid the source under SAC authority before Bureau authority 
was sou_ght to pay him on a regular basis. 
In the following 34 informant files authority was granted to pay the 
source on a regular basis before the field used the full amount that could 
have been paid under SAC authority, repr~senting 42. 5% of the total cases 
reviewed:. •
