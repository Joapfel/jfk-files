How long have you been in 
the Bureau? 
Twenty-four years as. of 
June 25, 1975.· 
Where have you been-assigned? 
In Boston, Baltimore, New 
York, Tampa, and San Diego. 
The Bureau has indicated·.that· 
you were a coordinator of the 
COINTELPRO in San Diego. As 
such, what were your duties? 
The duties for the most part 
consisted of preparing letters 
to the Bureau asking for· • 
authority to take some specific 
action in the program; awaiting 
the reply from the Bureau; and 
then, if any action was taken, 
to advise the Bureau of the 
results of such action. ·rt 
is noted that many of the re­
quests to take specific action 
were turned do·wn by the Bureau. • 
Were you the focal point of 
the program? 
Yes, in.the sense that any 
idea for action to be taken 
in the ·program was trans-
mitted to the Bureau for 
approval by me and if approval 
was received, it would be re­
lated to whomever had suggested 
the activity. I would then 
report any results to the Bureau.
