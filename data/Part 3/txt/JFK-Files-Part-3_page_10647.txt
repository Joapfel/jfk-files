Through recent informat·ion furnisped by -­
it is nqted that the Sebring Xlavern is apparently dying 
out. ~l\ttendance at the:.~7eekly r::!eetings has .been very poor 
·with a maxiBUTil of 3 to 4 in attendance. On the last two 
scheduled meeting dates,, t~e only ones present were the

In view of the above, the Sebring Klavern w1ll 
p:r·eioabJ.y become ·inactive in 'the very nea:c future. It is 
felt that any counterintelligence move at the present time 
~ould possibly result in a renewed interest and regrouping 
by the members rather than the-desired results. 
Should the Sebring Klavern not disband in the near 
future, it is then felt that information could be confi­
dentially furnished to Highlands County She-rif·f O BROWARD-. COKER., 
Sebring, as to tiBe, date and location of the Ku.Klux Klan 
meetings. Sheriff's Department patrol cars could patrol the 
area in an obvious fashion in_order to disrupt the meetings 
and cause concern among those in attendance.
