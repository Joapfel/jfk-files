raised questions among many of our foreign individual and of­
ficial sou:r::_ces, and also among our personnel. Whether the 
Intelligence Community can continue its -contribution to our 
nation's security and welfare and the maintenance of peace ·in 
the world will depend on our ability to conduct this review 
without further exposures. Thus, I do not propose to provide 
\ 
these details, but if one becomes of particular importance 
to the work of the Committee, I will certainly consult with 
you and the ranking minority member to determine the best 
course of action. I stress this, Mr. Chairman, as we have 
but one chance to avoid unwarranted disclosures which can ruin 
.the lives or the futures of people and institutions which 
put their tru~t in our nation through its intelligence 
service. I believe that you and the Committee will want to 
fulfill that trust, and that this Committee's inquiry can be 
comprehensive and searching without violating it. 
Mr. Chairman, I have not discussed the newspaper al­
legations that led to this Committee's formation. I have 
reported fully on this to the President, to the President's 
... 
Commission, a~d to the Senate Appropriations and Armed 
Services Committees. I am submitting for the record of this 
Committee my remarks there and am, of course, prepared to 
expand on them. I believe it only appropriate here t<? deny
