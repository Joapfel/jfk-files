1. -The Problem:

Use of electronic survejllance falls into three broad areas: 
criminal, domestic national security, and foreign nati~nal security. 
Little policy consideration need be given to· use in criminal 
cases. Such use is prescribed and proscribed" in Title III of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, has been upheld by the courts, 
and has been used to great advantage under the current procedures and 
policy. In short, there is no policy problem in this area. 
Electronic surveillance in both domestic and foreign national 
security cases is primarily used for intelligence purposes. not evidentiarv 
purposes; however, it often produces information of evidentiary value. 
The only Congressionally approved electronic surveillance 
is for the sole ,purpose of obtaining evidence of stated crimes (Title III) . 
Foreign national security electronic surveillances produce a 
good deal of positive intelligence value to U.S. foreign policymakers, a 
good deal of information necessary· for counterintelligence activity, and, 
:. . rarely, information of evidentiary value. . 
Domestic nat_ional security electronic surveillances produce 
• • information valuable to law enforcement in thwarting murders, serious 
injury to persons, and extensive damage to property, and also, rarely, 
information of evidentiary value. 
Electronic surveillance in domestic national security cases 
which was previously approved by the Atto.rney General for the President 
utilizing his Constitutional powers has been prohibited by the ·Supreme 
Court in the Keith case_. i.e., held illegal without prior judicial approval.
