.However, th.e ·court order tci destroy the intelligence files excepted instances 
"where such information will be used to charge persons with specifically 
defined crimirial conduct. 11 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be 
I 
interpreted as dra,ving a distinction bchveen collection of intelligence 
. information ,\here political or social factors are involved and First 
. . An1end1nent freedoms ther?fore may be directly inhibited and collection 
of criminal intelligence information ,vhere the objective is the establishment

and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the. guilty and innocent alike, it 
is in1probable that the First Amendment wou.ld be stretched so far as to

A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further develop­

~or the .purpo~c of dev~loping evidence -of specific offenses characteristic

Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection 
efforts are m:.:inipulatccl to cause harhss1nent or where such activity conflicts 
with Constitutional rights, to that extent the crilninal intelligence program 
must be reforn1ed. • •
