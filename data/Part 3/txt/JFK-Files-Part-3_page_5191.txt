the number of PCI 'S since the last inspection. , We: have, also 
increased our payments to informants and.no instances have 
been found where we did not get value received from these 
payments to informants. We have achieved excellent sta:tistics 
from them as indicated by the fact that at the close of the 
last fiscal year we were ahead in all eight categories of 
informant accomplishments. -This is our continuing goal and 
we will make every effort to surpass these accomplishments 
in the coming months. The observations, instructions and 
suggestions· of the Inspector will be immediately complied 
with and this program will continue to receive close super­
vision il'l; order to get maximum results in connection with 
our work .
