One of the prime factors in the decision to-transfer these responsibiliil:i~s from the 
DID in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communist Party activity iri the 
racial ar~a although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such 
incidents after their occurrence. . : . I

Mr. Rosen was opposed to the transfer of the functions in questic:n to the 
General Investigative Division in 19·53 and his present position is consistent in that 
he maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan 
and other hate groups are priniarily ir~.telligence functions which should be handled 
by tlle DID ~s q11r:-rrr.\,:"?tor': h~T T\T~. ~~'?1r1~r!"',: "?i,'T~ ~("'\~')n f~;\1f""' :--:.,~+ .t.-: .. ,.. __ --.,,-1"1~ .. - ·""'""n

best keep abreast of the whole field b:;r having all angles of the racial field united 
in one division as suggested by Mr. Sullivano Mr .. Rosen points out that the 
development, supervision and administrative han~j.ng of racial and security 
informants are analogous. 
. Mr. Rosen feels that there is a tendency toward oversimplification 
.in blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groupso He points out that the 
murders of Iv1edgar Evers, Postman l\i1oore and even the assassination of President 
whereas 11:,. ;-:,,shgation showed that the 1ndiv1duals charged with the murders of 
:Evers and Moore were without organization affiliation and the Pres. dent was

:I Mr. Rosen and Mr. Sullivan both agree that the investigation of individual 
cases, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the 
General Investigative Division. 1v1'.,,r. Rosen feels that whether subject or victims 
• are Klan members, Communist Party members or completely without organizational 
affiliation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights 
violation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment, 
Bank Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act. 
Mr. Belmont disagrees with Messrs. Rosen and Sullivan and feels 
that while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative 
to t_he Domestic Intelligence Divis.ion is theoretically appealing, it is not a 
practical answer to our problem. _ He states that at the time of the 19 58 transfer 
of functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the 
activities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation. 
He feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over­
whelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with 
integration and civil rights. IVir. Belmont believes the transfer of fufictions would 
j create an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance 
; to break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through
