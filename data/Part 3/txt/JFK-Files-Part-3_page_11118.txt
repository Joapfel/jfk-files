The following items of interest were discussed: 
Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting 
with the Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Select Com­
mittee {SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members 
of a particular agency were being interviewed by SSC staff person­
nel. The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being 
!
receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon 
each agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific 
arrangements for such rep~esentation with the SSC. Hills also 
discussed the pro~iem of the unknown employee or former employee 
who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent 
agency. It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by 
Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff 
member, that the staff member attempt to,teriy.Ln~the ~¢J'~1' ~
