and one awaiting approval. This special coverage provides 
on a daily basis a wealth of intelligence information and 
is most productive so"urce for the 9penmg of numerous new 
cases in the black extremist field. With the added coverage 
we can expect a continuing increase in the caseload. 
In view of the above factors, there exists a dire 
need for two additional Special Agent Supervisors at this 
time .. 
7) In .evaluating personnel adequacy, we take 
into consideration not only the caseload which is compiled 
on a monthly basis but also results of periodic mail counts 
taken on a q.iarterly basis. Many of our cases on key figures 
in the black extremist movement such as; David Hilliard .

Huey P •.. Newtg.~-~~:£t~~--~j2j_;!f>~~~~~~?;="--i~~~~~"-~:t;, 
Emorx:..J),.£>~~~~z and others require a cons1derable amount of 
supervisory attention. 
As previously noted, the Department is attempting 
to develop a prosecutive theory against the Black Panther 
, Party and as a result it has been necessary to assign one 
Supervisor almost.exclusively to handle investigation of 
this organization. The investigations of other organizations 
require a great deal of supervisory attention and direction . 
. Analyses of current developments in the·. racial field, s~cial 
requests from other Government agencies.,, .preparation of 
s·pecial studies, and initiation of special. projects all 
require the expenditure of considerablz supervisory time 
and are take~ into consideration in evaluating the adequacy
