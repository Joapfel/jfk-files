demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the 
nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct 
at all times by the FBI. 
The Congress and the members of this Committee in 
particular have gained a great insight into.the.problems 
confronting the FBI in the.security.and intelligence fields, 
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without 
sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress 
itself. 
As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been 
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our 
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even 
to the Executive Branch. 
The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for 
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised. 
An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the 
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI 
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully 
committed to maximum participation with the members of that 
Subcommittee. 
I laud their efforts. However, ·those efforts are of very 
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history. 
One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee 
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex 
problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that
