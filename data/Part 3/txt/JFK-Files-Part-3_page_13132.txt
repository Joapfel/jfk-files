The MRR, an underground movement formed in Cuba in iitid-1959, 
was composed primarily of three larger groups: (1) the ACU, l.lnder 
Manuel F. Artime Buesa; (2) a military group under Major Ricardo 
de la Lorie Valls;· and (3) an air group, without planes, of 13 
experienced pilots under Major Antonio Michel Yabor. The ACU was in 
existence prior to the Castro regime as the Cuban Catholic University 
(CACU) student:·: organization. In November} 1959, under Artime•s 
leadership, the majority of the CACU membership joined with the 
Rebel A_rmy Officer group to become the MRR. In February, 1950, a 
coordinated.movement of anti-Castro exiles outside Cuba was formed 
in Mexico and named the MRR. Artime and Lorie were joint heads of 
this newly formed group. About the middle of 1960, Artime, who was 
in the US, reportedly began to act without authority from the MRR 
Directorate, which resulted in formation of the MRR splinter group,
