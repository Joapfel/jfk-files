.someone in the commission: of the crime as further proof, 
rather than re·lying on. one informant and some circumstantial 
evidence to prove the violation. 
Senator Schweiker. Well,. in this case,_t-hough, th~y 
even had a dry run.· They could have arrested them on the 
dry run. 
That's getting pretty close to conspi~acy, it seems to 
me. They had a dry run and th~y could have arrested them on 
the dry run. 
I' c1 like to know why -they didn't arrest them on the dry 
run. Who was this. Department of Jus,tice official who made 
that decision? 
nr. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official. 
Senator Schweiker. Next I'd like to ask back in 1965, 
during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you 
put it a few moments ago, I b~lieve the FBI has re.leased 
figures that we had someth~ng like 2,000 informers of some 
kind or another infiltrating the.Klan out of rough~y 10,000 
estimated membership. 
I believe these are either EBI figures or estimates. 
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Klan 
at that point .was _an informant paid by the government. 
And I believe the figure goes o~ :o indicate that 70 
l;J'; 
percent of the new members of the Klct:. t.hat year were FBI 
25 informants.
