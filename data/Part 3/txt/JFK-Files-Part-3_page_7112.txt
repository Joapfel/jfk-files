had established a possible timetable concerning hearings. He stated they 
are "months" awai7 from fQ_Wal he3:ri:ggs but that they expect to begin taking

Miller said these sessions will be conducted by a Member of the 
Committee but will basically involve questioning of various agency officials,

structure, legal basis, objectives and mission, and budget of the various 
agencies in which the Committee will have an interest. Miller was requested 
o give us $pecific notification as far in advance as possible concerning such 
testimony sessions so that we would have sufficient time to prepare the necessary 
material. Miller said this would be done. •

members already are working with th.e Selec:
