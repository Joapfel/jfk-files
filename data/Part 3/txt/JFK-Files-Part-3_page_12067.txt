which handles approximately 1,400 pending cases and is 
responsible for over 7,000 subjects on the Bureau's Special 
Indices. A moratorium on routine communist investigations 
in effect at the time of the last inspection, which curtailed 
the work of this Unit, has been removed and the case load 
increases daily. The removal of the moratorium warranted 
the expansion of this Unit from a two to three-man Unit at 
the time of reorganization but for all practical purposes, 
the Unit has functioned as a two-man Unit with the third 
man ~Sgqwartz~ on loan for the majority of the period to the 
Research Section for a special project. 
6. When Special Agent supervisory personnel 
currently assigned, temporarily on loan to other Sections, 
are returned, we will have adequate personnel to handle 
existing case load. 
7. In evaluating adequacy of both Special Agent 
and clerical personnel the following criteria were used: 
case load 
1nai l \;o u.n t 
name checks 
complexity of cases and supervision involved 
deadline matters 
special assignments 
experienced supervisors 
Administrative duties assigned Supervisors in 
Charge (reviewing mail, conferring with employees, organizing 
Unit) limit to some extent the volume of case assignments 
handled.
