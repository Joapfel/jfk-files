11. Problem - Should the FBI have foreign officers reporting directly to the 
Director'? . ~ , 
Polic'~. - The FBI has had Agents stationed abroad :in American Embassies 
since 19,10. This has not been a secret or classified fact. They are known 
as Legal Attaches and are not operational. 'I'hey do not conduct investiga­
tions but depend upon law enforcement and security agencies of the host 
government fol." coverage of FBI leads overseas. They maintain regular 
. liaison with such agencies in countries where stationed, as well as in other 
• . : ~ountrj_es that they visit on road trips. 
.. - .. 
Legal Attaches are regularly called upon to secure in-depth 
... cooperation from. fo1•eig--.a agencies on c1·imina! and security matters which 
are frequently of a complicated and sensitive nature. These matters fre-· 
quently include requests for surveillances, complicated interviews, informa-
r ti.on from normally confidential records of foreign agencies, apprehensions 
and in.fo:t>mal deportations. In order to handle such matters effectively, a 
Legal Attache must be proficient in the language of the foreign country 
involved and must have an extensive knowledge of its cultu1·e, customs and 
judi.cial process. On the other hand, he must have a thorough knowledge of 
FBI jurisdiction, regulations and policy. This knowledge, which can only 
be achieved through ·years of experience as an FBI Agent, is extremely broad. 
. , In addition, in order to maintain the cooperation of foreign 
agencies, Legal Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations con-
. • ducted in the United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign 
countries involved. These matters frequently involve major criminal cases, 
espionage and terrorist cases which are often of substantive i'r~terest to the 
FBI. ' . 
Numerous problems arise in connection with handli..'l'lg leads 
abroad and ·ma.tte1•s in this country on behalf of foreign countries. Since 
each country is different with regard to its laws, customs, ianguage and 
tradition, the FBI has found it necessary and in fa.ct invaluable to have a 
man stationed ·abroad, on the scene, who can insure that prompt and efficient 
action is taken and that cooperative relationships are nurtured and protected.
