Regarding the Government reseryations, {tis noted 
that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard 
to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these 
bases are Government employees contacted on an official 
basis, they are not considered app~opriate for development 
as Cis and are bound to furnish information as part of 
their a.uties. It is noted, hmvever, that the Hunters Point 
Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly Negro area and two 
PRis, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that 
location by SAs assigned to this squad . 
. • Regarding the air piracy and crime aboard aircraft 
violations, it is noted all major airports are located within 
Resident Agency territories and coverage at these locations 
will be covered there.
