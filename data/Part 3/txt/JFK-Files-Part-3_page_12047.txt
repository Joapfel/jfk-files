developed to the point they are accepted by Soviet-bloc 
officials and become operational Double-Agents. I am 
pleased we have increased the number of active Double­
Agents since the last inspection and will closely 
follow our progress in this field. : 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNAN,,/,,-I have c~refully noted 
(DEM:ekn 1-24-71) (fp ~he comments of the 
Inspector and also those 
of Mr. Moore. I certainly am aware that Double-Agents active 
against Soviet-bloc officials are a vital part of our 
counterespionage work. I share the views expressed by 
Mr. Moore and assure the Inspecior ,. I will closely follow 
the development of informants in this field and see that 
proper guidance is given the field to increase the number 
of active Double-Agents.

Soviet espionage is one of the greatest challenges we 
have in the Bureau today and during this inspection our review 
of your program was made with this attitude. I have reviewed 
with great interest the accomplisJ:nnents and progress which you 
have made; however, there were certain aspects of your operation 
which have caused concern. Specifically, your handling of 
"Potential Double Agents" does not nearly result from a review 
standpoint with the feeling that this phase of work is compatible 
with the challenges presented. Elsewhere in this inspection we 
·have discussed development of Double Agents in place as being 
highly desirable goals in our work, yet, we .. 1J4vE~.Jsi~~d su~ ... c..e.s.s_

I feel that perhaps foreign intelligence may not be that 
good and that by improving ourselves we may be able to accomplish 
our goals. In the above write-up it was my feeling that your 
Potential Double Agent program needs considerable attention from 
a critical self-analysis standpoint for the purpose of strengthening 
it consistent with its potential for providing valuable assistance 
both here and in the field.
