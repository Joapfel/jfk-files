relating to 32 countries. There are five Legal Attache 
(Legat) Offices located in countries handled by the Unit 
and each of these offices, except Mexico, covers more 
than one country. The Nationality Unit is responsible 
for matters relating to 101 countries. Eleven Legat 
Offices are locatedin the area of responsibility of this 
Unit and most of these Legat Offices cover more than one 
country. 
There is a high volume of material which is 
received daily in these Units consisting of intelligence 
information from other agencies and news media material. 
All of this material must be reviewed in order that the 
supervisors will be in position not only to handle inquiries 
from any source relating to matters of Bureau responsibility 
in the nationalities intelligence field but also to process 
the high level intelligence (HILEV) items which are 
received from Legats. The latter is a very heavy 
responsibility since we recognize that if one high-level 
item goes to the President and he acts on it, and it 
proves to be incorrect, not only the Bureau but the 
White House itself mign.i:, encouili..~1- :::n::Li.uu;:, _f,:i~ol;lE;ii",s. 
During month of August, of 106 HILEV items received from 
Legats, 51 were processed by the Nationality Unit and 
34 by the Middle and South American Unit. Each of the 
two units disseminated 30 HILEV items. Dissemination 
of each HILEV item consumes approximately one hour of a 
supervisor's time. 
' With regard to the Nationality Unit, which has the 
1owest average case load per supervisor, other matters 
handled in the Unit not reflected by caseload are:
