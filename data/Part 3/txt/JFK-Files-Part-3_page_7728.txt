The Attorney General 
NOTE: -
By memorandum 5/6/75, we advised the AG that the 
position paper in question was an internal deliberative document 
which was the direct basis for a formal statement on FBl 
authority to conduct internal security investigations embodied 
in a memorandum from the Director, FBI, to the AG dated 
8/7/73. On this basis, we felt it was inappropriate that 
the requested position paper be made avail~ble to the SSC. 
In conversation between Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General O'Connor and SA Daly, referred to above, O'Connor 
indicated that it was the decision of the Department to make 
this paper available to the SSC. Since we have already expressed 
our position concerning the paper to the AG, it does not appear 
that there would be any purpose served disputing his decision. 
However, since it is an internal deliberative document, it is 
felt that the paper should. be made available for review rather 
than given outright to the SSC. Also, we are setting a 
condition that no notes be taken during the initial review, 
subject to negotiation of further requests bY, the Committee.
