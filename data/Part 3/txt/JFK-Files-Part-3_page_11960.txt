THUMBNAIL SKETCH PROGRAM 4-H 
This program was initiated and authorized by 
SAC Letter 53-72(J) dated October 27, 1953, to insure that 
the field is using current characterizations of subversive 
organizations and to provide uniformity in characterizing 
such organizations. Those characterizatio11s deemed to be of 
field-wide interest are now to be furnished to the field by 
letter to all offices on an annual basis rather than by 
·sAc Letter as was formerly the practice, in accordance with 
approval of suggestion in memorandum J. J. Casper to Mro Mohr 
dated December 7, 1970. 
The background and value of this program is the same 
as it was at the time of the write-ups for the 1970 inspection. 
Upon receipt of the annual letters :from the :field in June,, 1970,

appropriate supervisory personnel at the Bureau. Those of 
field-wide interest were furnished to the field by SAC Letter 
70-62 dated Nqvember 3, 1970. The remaining ch~racterizations 
were returned to interested field offices following their 
approval by the Bureau. This program was last reviewed and 
analyzed and its continuance approved by memorandum R. L. 
Shackelford to Mr. C. D. Brennan dated October 12, 1970.
