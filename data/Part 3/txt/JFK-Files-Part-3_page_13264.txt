MR. STURGIS: When I told him that, I think I kind 
of stung him· a little bit. And he said, well, OK, all right~ 
Then, you. will go through with it: And I said certainly, I wil 
go through with it, ·I don't care· who -the hell it is. I said, 
you let me know. And hopefully, I was thinking of Fidel 
Castro, because I could have snuck into Cuba, I have done it 
so many times, and I .would have taken a crack at killing 
Fidel, . 
MR. ROETHE: I missed something.when I was out of the 
room. I take it you did not know the identity of the person 
·whom you were being asked to assassinate?

you see, I didn't.publish it, in other words, I was told.no 
publicity. I was told,. b~cause Sam say-s-, go ahead and work 
with him,.-~and he said,. let me· know what is progressing.
