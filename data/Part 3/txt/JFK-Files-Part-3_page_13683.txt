same. 
Mr. Johnston. Are you saying that the way you preparetl i 
it's possible that the second page and third page were prepared 
on different days? 
AML1\SlI Case Officer. No, it could ha_ve been at different! 
times of the day. If I had writen out the first part of the 
contact report and I hadn't finished it, the secretary could 
very well have started to type it, and then when I finished it 
I would have given her the last page to type because it was all 
on the 25th. 
Mr. Johnston. 1\re you saying 
A:1LASH Case Officer, Decause there's no date on the 
second page. 
Mr. Johnston. You're stating that your recollection is 
that that document was typed on one day by one person. 
1\MLl\SH Case Officer. Yes, probably.so. That's the 
usual case, I have no reason to doubt why it would have hcc~ 
done any differently. 
~~r . .Johnston. 1'1hat about the information on page 3? 
Is that the substance, in fact? Is that exactly what you wrot~ 
on Hover.iber 25th about the contact? 
N-tLASI! Case Officer. Yes, and in fact I draw your 
attention to the ~art on the secret writing material because 
we were very concerned as to how we would continue to comr:iunicat
