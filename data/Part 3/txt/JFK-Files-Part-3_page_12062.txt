ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRa$;AN: Attached find the Section 
AB~.jgr 1/15/71 ~/ write-ups concerning each 
O . category of .information 
request d by the Inspector relative to adequacy of personnel. 
These comments are current as of 1/8/71: 
The personnel assigned to the Division Front Office 
qonsists of one Assistant Director, two Inspectors, two 
Special Agent Supervisors, five stenographic employees and 
19 clerical employees. This complement includes the personnel 
directly assigned to the Front Office, those in the Division 
teletype room, Mail Room and messenger service, the Security 
Patrol Force in addition to five Agents. I have not as yet 
requested a replacement for a GS-4 clerical position in the 
Front Office, which was created with the resignation of 
..JJ.\nie§_..lL ..... ~~j;tingill on 12/24/70. I am attempting to absorb 
the work of this position with the present personnel comple­
ment in the Front Office. This is on a trial basis and if it 
isn; t sati•sfactol"y, :i will .i:•~couitneud a ·replaceI11ei1t. 
The overall authorized personnel complement of the 
Division at the beginning of the inspection was 116 Special 
Agents and 190 clerks compared to an authorized complement 
of 126 Agents and 186 clerks at the time of the last 
inspection. We now have assigned to the Division 116 Agents 
and 188 clerks. The clerical vacancies being the aforementioned 
· GS-4 position in the Front Office and a vacancy in the Mail 
Room, which was created when a clerical position in the 
Internal Security Section was filled. 
At the present time we have outstanding requests 
for two Agents to replace Special Agents George M. Quinn 
• • ,....;~~L~-<l'le.fi!G.::~~~r•~. 
and C. Edwin Enright, who are under transfer to the Inspection 
Division. \~fr~ve requests for two GS-2 Mail Clerks 
for the Divisiqn Mail Room to replace the clerk who was trans­
ferred to the Internal Security Section and the second to replace 
the GS-3 clerk who will be reassigned or rotated when the 
replacement is made available to the Division. The Racial 
Intelligence Section has submitted a request for an additional 
clerk for the Black Nationalist - South.and Racial Informant 
Unit. In addition, this Section is now making a request for two 
additional Agent Supervisors because of the heavy increase in the 
case load in the black extremist field. (Justification in 
Section write-up attached).
