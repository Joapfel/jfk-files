NOTE: 
Concurrence to pass the 2/26/70 letter, with Secret 
enclosures, from Richard Helms, then Director of CIA, to J. Edgar 
Hoover, then Director of FBI, was obtained by Liaison Officer 
Leon F. Schwartz from Walter Elder, CIA on 6/10/75. The response 
to requests set forth in Appendix c, Part I, Item numbers 7 and 
8 is being made in the same communication to avoid unnecessary 
duplication since the severing of liaison with CIA grew out of 
the RIHA matter.
