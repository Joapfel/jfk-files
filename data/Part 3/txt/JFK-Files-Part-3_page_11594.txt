The primary mission of this Section involves 
counterintelligence operations against Soviet-Bloc Intel­
ligence Services (SBIS). Counterintelligence, by definition 
and in·practice, is a reaction to initiative displayed by 
a hostile intelligence service. This factor largely inhibits 
bold and aggressive initiatives on our part and the major 
part of our efforts is spent in routine, programmatic, non­
remunerative work and patient, painstaking analysis of 
information developed. Positive counterintelligence 
achievement in the final analysis depends on the ability to 
detect and exploit in a timely fashion circumstances 
which arise naturally--contriving, to the extent this is 
feasible, to anticipate, encourage, or modify circumstances·

In this perspective, the accomplishments listed 
below are most noteworthy. These are highlighted by the 
current operation of four defectors-in-place and the 
identification of J:.bra1ee. "illegal" agents since the last 
inspection. From both a quantitative and qualitative view­
point, these successes represent an extremely high level 
of accomptishment in these two vital areas. 
In keeping with the Inspector's instructions, 
brevity will be stressed in the examples portrayed. Security 
and the "need-to-know 11 principle also requires. limitation 
of detailed information on many cases discussed. These • 
-matters, however, are identified sufficiently so that any 
additional data desired may be obtained from the individual 
f•ile. Accomplishments cited are restricted to the most 
sig~ificant and/or representative.
