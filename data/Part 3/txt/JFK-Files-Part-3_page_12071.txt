5. Since last inspection we have reduced one Agent from the 
complement of the Racial Reporting Unit as a result of various streamlining 
measures adopted relative to reporting requirements. This streamlining 
involved the elimination of a substantial number of letterhead memoranda and 
airtels previously required from each field office with regard to racial . 
conditions and the elimination of daily cover memorandum to our outgoing 
racial teletype to the White House. 
6. The authorized Agent complement for Section is considered 
adequate but not excessive at this time. 
7. Criteria used in assessing personnel adequacy in this Section 
includes a number of diverse factors. Case load figures are not applicable 
to work of this Section nor are there any other simple, quantitative measure­
m~nts of Section ts work. Work of this Section involves primarily research 
and evaluation and the preparation of a variety of documents aimed at providing

agencies and Bureau offictals. This Section seeks to .summarize into 
comprehensive and meaningful 11package" form information relating to current 
topics of intelligence interest and concern. The finished product is 
provided not only to other intelligence agencies and policy-making officials 
of the Government but, where appropriate, to our field offices for their 
information and guidance. The type of documents prepared varies from 
daily teletype summaries regarding racial disturbances and student agitation, 
to detailed monographs containing in-depth research into various facets of 
our work. 
During the past year there has been a continuing demand for 
various intelligence summaries and this Section has been faced with a 
number of expedite projects on behalf of Bureau officials, including the 
Director, the White House, the Vice Presidentts Office, and the Attorney 
General. Basis for this heavy work load has primarily been interest and 
concern in the explosive issues concerning racial and student disorders. 
The great majority of our projects have revolved around the preparation 
of material either for internal FBI use or for outs:j.de dissemination with 
respect to these issues.
