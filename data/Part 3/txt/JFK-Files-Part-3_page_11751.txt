PECTOR E. S. Iv.IILLER: It is understood that additional work 
1 • is anticipated as a result of 
ecutive Order 11605 and subsequent Congressional action. You are requested 
to advise what action you have taken to brace for this additional work and how 
much volume you anticipate. Also advise as specifically as possible which 
Units will be affected the greatest, and to what extent. 
Comments of Assistant Director reqwe ted. 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNAN The implementation of 
Executive Order 11605 will 
aff.ect primarily the work of the New Left Section, Extremist 
Intelligence Section and Internal Security Section. 
I have conferred with the Section Chiefs of the afore­
mentioned Sections and instructed them to initiate a review 
of leach of the cases which the Department has indicated it intends 
to proceed against to determine what additional investigation is 
required to develop the evidence necessary to present to the 
SACB. Administrative procedures for handling these cases have 
been worked out and since the cases are supervised in three 
different Sections, a Division Coordinator, who has had previous 
experience in preparing cases for presentation to the SACB, has 
been designated to insure that the cases are handled in a 
uniform manner in each of the three Sections. 
So far, the Department has indicated that it intends 
to initiate proceedings against the Black Panther Party, Progressive 
Labor Party, Young Socialist Alliance and Ku Klux Klan; however, 
we have not as yet had any specific requirements levied upon 
us by the Department in these cases. Based on past experience, 
it'can be anticipated-the services of one supervisor, full time, 
will be required to prepare each of these cases for presentation 
to the SACB .
