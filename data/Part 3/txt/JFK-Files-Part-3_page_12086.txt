his counterpart in Interna:l Security (306 vs. 356). It is noted in this regard that 
the Racial Intelligence case load raises the Espionage Branch figures, since the 
Nationalities Intelligence Section has an average of only 278 and Espionage 
Section of only 280 cases per man. The average in Ra'pial Intelligence Section 
is 350. 
We next conducted surveys to determine whether the complexity of cases in 
Espionage and Nationalities work was appreciably more complex to justify the 
above -noted differences in case load. 
All pending 65 classification cases (total 327) were reviewed and it was 
determined a total of 539 items of correspondence containing instructions 
or direction emanating from SOG were contained in these files or an average 
of 1. 6 pieces of correspondence in a 12-month period. Over half of this was 
somewhat routine and very short. 
We also reviewed the 100 most important (105s) cases and determined an 
average of 3. 37 pieces of correspondence originated at SOG in these files. 
62% of this was considered somewhat routine.

1/ determined the average case was 31/2 years old and contained only 1 piece 
of correspondence in over 3 years (subject of separate write -up). 
Other surveys revealed current active cases in these categories had an 
average of only 3+ pieces of correspondence in a 12 -month period . 
. 'It is felt that degree of supervision and the amount of instruction and 
direction given our cases can be measured in one way· by the fre,quency of 
correspondence necessitated by the individual cases. 
Another survey of mail signed out at Section level revealed that approximately 
57% of your outgoing mail emanates from the combined efforts of your New Left 
and Racial Sections. Espionage Section contributed about 8. 7% and Nationalities 
Intelligence about 15%.

On the basis of the above studies and reviews of files, I conclude that, if 
anything, due to the· intensity of the action that it requires more input to supervise 
• Racial and New Left than it does cases assigned in the Espionage and Nationalities 
Secttons. 
For this reason, I feei you still have an imbalance· in your Division which should 
be corrected. That is, you still have 5 men working Espionage and Nationalities
