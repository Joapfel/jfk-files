1933 
Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have 
one quick question .. 
Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500 
informers for black ghetto situations? 
Mr .. Adams. I'm not sure if that's the year. We did 
·have one yea:i; where we had a number lik~ that which probably 
had been around 6000, and that ~-1as the time when the cities 
were being·burncd, Detroit, Washington, areas like this.- We 
were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is 
violence going to break out, what next? 
They weren't informants like an individual penetrating 
an organization. They were listening posts in the community 
that would help tell ~s that we have a group here that's gettin 
ready to start another fire-figh~ or something. 
Senator Tower. At this.point, there are three more 
Senato~s remaining for questioning. If we can try to get 
. 
17 everything in in the first round, we will not have a second 
18 round and i think we can -finish around 1:00, and we can.go 
19 on and terminate the proceedings. 
20 However, ·If anyone feels that they have another question 
21 that they want to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.

record is now fairly clear that when the FBI operates in the
