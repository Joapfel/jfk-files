bookstores, to verify residences and employments of Agitator 
and Security Index subjects living or working in ghetto areas 
and to identify individuals responsible for extremist 
activities tending to increase racial tensions in the ghetto 
areas. We are also noting numerous instances wherein ghetto 
informants are being conv~rted by the field to regular racial 
informants furnishing information on black extremist 
organizations and individuals. As a valuable by-product 
we are also picking up criminal statistics through our contacts 
with ghetto informants. The ghetto informant program was last 
justified by memorandum G. C. Moore to Mr. w. c. Sullivan 
dated 7/17/70, captioned "Ghetto Informant Program, Racial 
Matters," and is scheduled to be rejustified in July, 1971 . 
. TRAINING 
A two-day conference of field supervisors handling 
racial matters investigations was held at Seat of Government 
9/17-18/70. Representatives from 39 offices and two Legal 
Attaches attended. The conference dealt specifically with 
investigation of the BPP and informant development therein. 
A number of recommendations and suggestions resulted from 
this conference and were implemented. Suggestions approved 
as results of the conference ar~ the subject of a separate 
write-up. Those in attendance were in agreement that the 
conference had been most beneficial to both field and Seat 
of Governm~nt personnel participating.
