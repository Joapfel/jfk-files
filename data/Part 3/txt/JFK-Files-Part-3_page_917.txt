·' 
of Db~ctor oi the FBI fo:c-n restricted te~m of office could s11ggest 
that p~rh.aps the confidence hereto.fore pl2eed in the FBI is no longer 
meritedo Vlhether this would ha.ve any impact on the confidenc;J and 
coope.raUon by the public would be problematic. 
After weighing the foregoing and eons!dering the• un!que 
role of and l"(<.gard for the Director of the FBI~ it is my eonclusion that 
the Nation would feel comfortable with tenure '1.or the Directol"' of the 
FBI!; and tenure wo,1td eontrfuute toward countering any construction 
that appointment of any' Director was political in the sense th.at the 
Directorship would not necessarily ch~m~ hands with each ~.dministr-ation. 
r feel the inC11mbent senses a greater independence throur,.h tenure. 
I feel that tenure shOttld be for a period sueh as nine yea?-s 
to mlnirnize the oecasio!L~ when appointive consideration wot;ia .coincide 
with a change ill administrations. Such a period wottld also provide the 
ineu.1nbent a sufficient feeling of independence. Hmvevar, this Bur~.).u 
defers to the Department on the subject o! length of timee
