SOCIALIST WORiillRS PARTY 
The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a revolutionary, 
Trotskyist--communist organization, which is headquartered in 
New York City. · Its purpose, as stated in its Declaration of 
Principles, is the overthrow of the U. S. Government and the 
institution of a dictatorship of the working class and the 
eventual achievement of a communist society. It was founded 
in 1938 and maintains close association with international 
Trotskyist organizations as a nsympa thizingtt group, but it 
denies formal membership in any foreign group to escape 
application of the Voorhis Act, which regulates certain 
types of organizations subject to foreign control. While 
the SWP does not openly advocate the use of violence at the 
present time to overthrow the U. s. Government, it believes 
that eventual violent revolution in the u. S. is inevitable. 
Its objection to the current use of violence is based on the 
ground that it believes violence is premature at this time. 
The SWP seeks to precipitate a revolution when conditions 
are ripe and to seize control of the revolution and to direct 
it when it occurs.
