The Security Informant Unit would be handling 904 cases, 
averaging 452 cases when reduced to two supervisors. 
Under the new case count system, these informant cases 
are largely cases with mail in hand requiring attention 
and close supervision because of funds being involved 
as well as the general sensitivity of these cases. In 
the event of sick or annual leave, one man could not 
possibly keep mail current and work loads in other units 
would, as a practical matter, preclude use of other 
personnel to carry out the work. The supervisor retained 
would reduce the case load in the Subversive Individuals 
Unit to a more reasonable and practical 533 case load 
average and also allow for a limited degree of flexibility 
in theinformant matters from time to time as necessary. 
This provides the seven me~ from this Branch. {This 
includes one man _from the New Left Section, as indicated.) 
New Left S.ection: Will make one man available 
as recommended. 
Regarding reallocation of Agent personnel to 
top priorities regarding the Espionage Branch, the 
following comments are made: 
Extremist Intelligence Section will make two 
supervisor.s available and absorb the 559 Klan and White 
Hate cases with no Agent personnel. It must be borne 
i~ mind this, in effect, constitutes a net reduction of 
four supervisors to black extremist matters at a time 
when these activities are on a definite upswing. This 
can be lived with on a short term emergency basis and 
as manpower becomes available from the inevitable winddown 
of McLek, appropriate recommendations will be considered 
within the Division as to reallocation of that manpower 
with this in mind consistent with overall Division needs 
at that time. 
Nationalities Intelligence Section will make two 
men available as recommended. With regard to the two. 
Units being reduced, it is pointed out that the Middle 
and South American Unit is responsible for matters
