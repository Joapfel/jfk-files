Memorandum w.o. Cregar to Mr. W.R. W'annall, dated t 
3/21/75, captioned as above, described in considerable detail 
problems concerned with coordinating responses to the Select 
Committees of Congress. One of the significant problems is .1~ 
the very short deadlines we anticipate receiving from the lt 
Select Committees. 
Responsive to the Director's question, should we 
get unreasonable deadlines from the Select Committees 
requiring extensive file reviews, our legislative liaison 
will personally contact Senator Church or Congressman Nedzi, 
pointing out ~~~e problems -attendant to the short 
deadline and e. 
0 1 
a •n - an extension in order that we may 
be completely responsive to their requests. _
