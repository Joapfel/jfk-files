by Supervisor Seymor Fred Phillips of the Bureau's Senstudy 75· 
Special Project. 
At 11: 20 a. m. ~]5,_S~ntinella tel'?phonica~ly contacted 
Phillips from Atlanta, Georgia, and ad:v:i,sed that he had·been tele­
phonically contacted earlier on the morning of 5/14/75 by SSC 
\ 
Staff Member Lester B. Seidel who had interviewed him 5/12/75. 
Seidel told Sentinella that h~ is b~ing 'subpoenaed to give sworn 
testimony before an Executive Session of the SSC 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, 
5/21/75. The testimony is to be~~given in Room G-308, New Senate 
Office Building. In response to specific qu~stions from Sen~inflla,
