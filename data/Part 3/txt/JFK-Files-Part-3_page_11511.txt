Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
naturally flow from our criminal investigations in 
these areas. With regard to determining the potential 
for civil unrest, Elliff postured that accurate infor­
mation in this field could be obtained through overt 
contact with civic leaders and not through covert use 
of informants. To support the latter position, Elliff 
quoted unnamed former officials of the now defunct 
Interdepartment Information Unit (IDIU) who readily 
stated the majority of the Bureau information furnished 
that Unit emanated from public sources. In essence, 
Elliff made the observation that he was opposed to 
domestic intelligence-type investigations as currently 
conducted by this Bureau and he advocated that any 
investigation of a domestic organization or individual 
be based upon criminal statute. It was noted t~at 
Elliff, though not equating "potential" with pll!obable 
cause, had difficulty specifically defining "potential" 
in the above context. 
RECOMMENDATIONS.: 
(1) That Legal Counsel Division maintain 
close liaison with John Elliff to obtain formal copy 
of approved agenda for scheduled 2/2/76 SSC Executive 
Session.
