So ...;_ 
Senator Mondale .. Would you agree that it would not be 
a proper basis for an investigation for the FBI or any other 
gov~rr..ment official to b~ concerned -about the success of ,the 
negro movement'? 
In other words, that. is not a valid 
Mr. Adams. I have no problam. 
Senator Mondal-e. All i::ight. So let us take the one 
ground that appears to have justified the investigation of 
Dr. King and the investigation of the women's liberation 
movement -- the fear that "dangerous influences might 
infiltrate these organizations." 
Suppose it'is true. ~uppose that a Communist did 
hay·e influence over Dr. King, or suppose an SDS memb-E;r 
infiltrated and· b~came a dominant influence in a_chapter of 
the women's liberation movemen~ and you established it as 
a fact. What would you do? 
Assuming that we can't get into this h~rassing and so 
on, you agree that that no longer has any validity. So what? 
·what do you have? 
Hr .. , Adams. ·we have potential violations which might 
arise, which rarely coma to fruition and haven't for many 
years, but we do have an intelligence responsibility under 
. ~ 
the dire.'ctives from the Prcsicler .. t and the Attorney General . 
That is, with a revolutionary group,·like the, Communist Party
