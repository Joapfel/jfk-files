The Jacksonville Office .has carefully noted the 
obvious intent of reBulet and agrees that there is a real 
stro:::ig :9ossibility for ta~ing soue counter-intelligence 
action agsinst the Klan t.b:Tough this- medium . 
.. 
-Jze--'~3 2 was re-contacted and he stated at the 
present time there is no additional informa~~on concerning 
the us:::: of °ty,o--r1ay rad.i0s nor has the local Klan in Jackson­
v~lle for~ulated any code4 This would indicate that at the 
?rcsant ti2e; ~hile a nu=ber of local Klansmen have radios, 
th3rc is no opportunity to introduce deceptive transmissions 
as the !{lan has no ll:rlissionstt on the planning board. The 
above lrtfo~sant h~s re~orted that it is anticipated addi­
tion~l Klans=en will purchase Eore two-way radio equipment 
~,-b.ich -r1ould ba indicative of an e:xpansion in plans of the 
IG2.n to usa this method of cors;1unica tion. To date there has,· 
been no operation 9f the Klan where two-way radio communica- ___ ___, 
tions have played an integral part. .-
This office th~ough its informants, 9articularly 
&:: 1~8 R-, will remain alert and will proµptly advise the 
:su:te2u w~enever infor-mation is received indicating the Klan 
h~s a sizeable ttm.issionrr in the planning stages wherein 
radios will play an i~portant part. Depending upon the 
purpose of the nmissionn plans could be formulated for some 
Q&ceptive attacks on the Klan itself.
