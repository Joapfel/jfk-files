Moore to Jenkins Memo {cont'd.) 
Re: CLYDE A. TOLSON 
Based·upon a request from Mr. Mohr to Mr. Callahan, 
a Bureau clerk did go to the residence of Mr. Tolson on the day 
of his death whereupon he delivered some 24 boxes and 6 rolls 
of tape. The clerk merely delivered the boxes and tape and 
then left the residence. We have no idea what was placed in 
the boxes nor how this story. started in the first place.
