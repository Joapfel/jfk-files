Hr. Kelley . I feel confident we can get it. I do not 
have it now, but if you would like· to have the annual cost 
for the investigation of Federal appointees --
The Chairman. Yes. Plus, you know, plus any other 
information thq.t would indicate to us what proportion of the 
time and effort of the FBI was absorbed in this kind of 
activity. 
2507 
Mr. Kelley. I can tell you it is relatively small, but 
I can get you, I think, the exact amount of time and the 
approximate expense. 
The Chairman. I wish you ·would do that because this is 
a matter we need niore information about. And when you supply 
that data to the Com.mi ttee, ·would you also supply the number 
14 of such ·investigations each year? 
15 You know, I don't expect you to go back 20 o~ 25 years, 
16 but give us a good idea of the last few yea:r:s. For example, 
17 enough to give us an idea of how much time and how broad the 
18 reach of these investigations may be . 
19 Mr. Kelley. Through 1 70? 
20 The Chairman. That would be sufficient, I would think. 
21 The other matter that is connected to this same subject 
22 that I 'v.:ould like your best judgment on is whether these 
23 investigations could not be liaited to offices of sensitivity. 
24 That is to say where legitimate national security interest might 
25 be involved so that there is a reason to make a close check on
