suggestion of Assistant to the Director W. c.\Stillivan to 
divide the Division referred to by the Inspector is that 
set forth in memorandum from Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Tolson 
dated June ·28, 1971. On that memorandum the Director stated, 
"I do not approve. We do not have any provision for another 
Assistant Director and all hearings before Budget Bureau and 
Congress have been concluded for Fiscal Year 1972.n In light 
of the current national economic picture, the Director's 
connnent is even more meaningful today. 
These disadvantages, with the exception of the 
economy factor, can be overcome to a large extent by utilizing 
current space in 9th and D Street building with a minimum of 
carpentry work involved. The Executive office space can 
easily be arranged to handle another Assistant Director and 
staff. The Mail Room and Steno Pool would require alterations 
involving additions of partitions. Extra-duty shifts involving 
4 p.m. to Midnight and Midnight to 8 a.m. can be arranged to

points. On the other hand, the biggest disadvantage is that 
tqe split definitely will serve to lessen coordination of 
cases having foreign ramifications as so many of our domestic 
extremist cases do. This disadvantage likewise can be overcome 
to a large extent if we make up our minds to be extra careful 
to make certain that coordination between the new Division 
is such that Bureau is not embarrassed. This could cause 
a certain slow down in the handling of mail and result in 
duplicative handling in some instances. 
6. It is felt current space is adequate to house the 
two Divisions with slight alterations as previously set out. 
Equipment for a new Assistant Director should not present any 
significant problem.
