inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific 
portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-
.ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect 
to such specifically designated portions of documents, 
the Comi~ittee staff will prepar~ appropriate excisions 
or summaries of the information; the summaries will be 
checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to 
ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI 
sources or methods; thereafter, the excised docum.ent·s 
and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices; 
the Committee staff may check back to the original documents 
as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated 
specific portions of documents wili not be removed from 
FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of c9urse, at.any time 
see the documents which the staff has seen. 
I believe this interpretation can serve as a ,,.rork-
able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive 
FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares 
your concern for the need to provide special handling tech­
niques to convey or secure any particularly sensitive 
information or materials, as indicated in the Outline for 
Inquiry Procedureso We nope this in~erpretation will 
facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the 
Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose .. 
I would appreciate ,+"eceiving your immediate advice 
to me as to whether any further interpretation of this 
matter is requiredo Any public·discussion of these arrange­
ments and interpretations should be ca:st in such terms as 
• will not jeopardize particularly· sensitive FBI sources. 
Sincerely,
