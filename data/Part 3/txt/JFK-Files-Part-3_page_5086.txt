Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in

fleeting author1.zat1.on by Attorney General Kennedy of a l.J/ '• 
wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during 
the investigation of another leak of· class·ified information. 
Furtper materials reflected authorization by Attorney General 
Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti­
communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation 
of a leak of class·ified information. The Committee has received 
materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney 
General Robert F. Kennedy of wir.etaps on at least six American 
citizens, including. three Executive Branch officials, a Con­
gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents 
•• for foreign interests. The materials also reflect· that these 
wiretaps· relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in- ) 
terests. to influence United States economic policies. f\ 
Elliff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Divis~!rr~ 
that an impression would be created by the -aforementioned .statement 
that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on 
Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate. The elec­
tronic surveillance concerning. the Congressional Staff Member was 
not located on Congressional· property·. Elliff agreed with this 
observation and indicated that he would check the material to 
insure the electronic surveillance in '!'.flTest±o~ot on Con­
gressional property and as ~greed, make a cha~ge in uhe afore-
