off? 
Mr. Adams. Absolutely not, and I think the Committee 
staff can inform you that during their review of ali of these 
matters they haven't come up with one instance of violence 
resulting from any of these actions, and in that ·.particular 
case there was a communication in the same file which I believe 
the staff had access to which showed that we did get informatio 
that one of these groups was going to put out a contract on one 
of the. others, .. and we _notified the police and th,e individuals 
of the fact that their life was in danger •. 
None of.our programs have.contemplated violence,tand 
the.instructions prohibited.it, and the record of turnd~wns of 
recommended actions .. in some . instances specifically say that 
we .do not approve. t:q.is_.action because if we taks it it could 
result-in. harm. to .. the individual ... _ ...... . 
So I think this is one.charge ~-.and the·staff·did not 
make such a charge,. I might add, when they presented the pictur 
but I think any inference that we were trying to result in 
violence is wrpng.
