•• /IN,SfECTOR E. S. MILLER: This case involves the publishing of parts 
~(~.· _E,. \Yh~te:bhg, 9/7/71). of the '':McNamara Studylf in June, 1971, 
, . by "The New York Times," The evidence 
r to date strongly indicates Daniel Ells berg is responsible for furnishing the 
classified data to representatives of this newspaper, and he has been indicted 
by a Federal Grand Jury for the unauthorized possession and conversion of 
these documents. This is the case simply stated; however, this matter is 
far from being so simple. From its inception, this case has been complicated 
by the enormity of the work to be completed and problems inherent in this 
unusual inyestigation. 
In regard to the amount of work involved, a survey was made 
to establish how many communications were dated during the period of a 
single week (Saturdays and Sundays included). As a result of this survey, 
the following represents the number of communications dated during the 
weeks noted below:
