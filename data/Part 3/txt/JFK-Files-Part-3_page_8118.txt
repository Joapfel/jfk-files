by Miss Gandy amounted to·one and one-half file drawers. Mohr 
subsequently advised Mr. Gitenstein of this correction. 
Additionally, Gitenstein desired to know whether an itemized 
list of the official and confidential files was made and if so, 
where the list was. Mohr told Gitenstein that he was sure a 
list was made (subsequently confirmed by Miss Gandy) and that 
the list accompanied the official and confidential files. 
In addition to the above, Mohr advised that Gitenstein 
asked about a requirement of all Bureau employe~s to turn over 
any confidential files in their possession ordered by Mro Hoover 
following th~ ~evelation that former Assistant to the Director 
Sullivan had turned over certain confidential files to former 
Attorney General Mardian. Mohr advised Gitenstein that Mr. Hoover 
had in fact levied such a requi~ement on Bureau employees and 
that all confidential files were to be turned over to Mr. Felt 
along with a memorandum explaining the nature of these files. 
Gitenste.in asked Mr. Mohr where these memoranda would be filed. 
Mohr responded by saying he presumed they were confidential 
memoranda and would have gone with the confidential files turned 
over to Mr. Felt by any Bureau employee maintaining such files.
