organization at that time, most of its officers and all of its

experience, it had some professionals like myself, it had 
lawyers, and Helms himself, before his oss period, had been a 
journalist, and it had a wide range of skills. I do not mean 
those skills were important to be used. I never used economics 
in the Agency, and Helms I don't think ever used journalism, b t 
my point is I think when it is engaging in the kind of business 
it is, it is better to have a variety of backgrounds, and not 
to have more than perhaps half of its personnel men who were

This relates to my remarks about official cover and 
its overuse. The pattern that I think was developing by the 
end of, by the beginning of the '60s in the clandestine service 
was that people more and more, its members thought of their 
careers as a little different in kind, and a little removed 
from Foreign Service careers. They expected to spend a life 
doing tours of duty in every case under official cover, and 
usually identified to the host government. And in short, to 
follow much the same career pattern as the Foreign Service.
