On August 12, 1968, USA THOMAS A.FORAN contacted 
SAC, Chicago, advising that WARREN CHRISTOPHER, Deputy U.S. 
A_ttorney General, desired to meet with the SAC, Chicago. 
As a result of the above request, SAC1 Chicago, 
and Supervisor RICHARD L. STRAIN met briefly with Mr. WARREY: 
CHRISTOPHF~ and Mr. WES POMEROY of"the U.S. Department of 
Justice, Washington, D.C., in the presence of µSA FOR.EN in 
his off ices. 
Mr. CHRISTOPHER was most congenial and expressed •.: 
his high regard fo::.:· the FBI and asked for a current evaluation 
of activities in the Chicago area which could possibly affect E 
the Democratic National Convention (DNC) being held the last-~·_,.., 
week of August, 1968. Mr. CHKISTOPHER was advised that all 
information has been previously furnishad to him by letterhead 
memoranda and was in his possession and be was assured all 
information coming to our attention would be immediately 
furnished to the Department and to the USA in Chicago. A brief 
discussion of current trends followed relative to current intel­
ligence regarding the activities of anti-war and Negro militant 
organizations which have proposed disruptive t 7ct.ics at the DNC .. 
At qne point in the discussion ment/4n was made of the 
fact that the{ IYouth International Party, aka/Yippies, was currently 
holding talks with the city administratio~ ~ an effort to obtain 
necessary par~ permits to have their followers live and sleep in 
one o~ the Chicago area.parks during the week of the convention and 
hold a "happening" which the Yippies referred to as the "Festival 
of Life." During this discussion USA FORAN confidentially advised 
that when he had received the FBI' s notification of the anticipated 
plans on the part of the Yippies, he had contacted certain city 
officials known to him and attempted to persuade them against the 
issuance of such a permit in view of the known moral conduct of 
such groups. USA FORAN· advised he had been assured that such 
permits would not be granted. He stated these 'permits have as yet 
not been granted and that his sources have indicated no serious 
consideration has been given ,to the request by responsible Chicago . ~f. . 1 ,.... ,-,.,.l: •·1· ' •
