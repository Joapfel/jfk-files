Rise of the Black Panther Party 
In May, 1968, the hard-core membership of the Black Panther Party was esti• 
mated at only 125, and Panther activity was confined largely to the San Francisco­
Oakland, California, area. However, because of the dramatic shoot-outs, the 
"Free Huey" Campaign, the funds established for the defense of both Newton and 
Cleaver, the widespread publicity, and the support given readily by white radical 
groups and individual sympathizers, the Black Panther Party began to grow rapidly, 
not only in membership but in militancy and influence. Chapters began to appear 
in major cities throughout the country. By the end of 1968, the membership had 
reached nearly 2,000, with additional thousands of sympathizers and supporters .
