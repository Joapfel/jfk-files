It should be noted that this memorandum indicates that. the :KSA, 
DI.:\., CIA and the military sen-ices basically supported the Huston 
recommencla.tions. .

,. Later, on September lS, 1070 ( almost 2 1.1onths after the. Prf'sident 
9laims the plan ,ms rescinded), Dean sent a. top secret memorandum 
to the .:-\..ttorney General sngge::ting certain proceuures to "comme·nce 
ow· domestic intelligence opc;rat ion o.~ qu.ic/.;ly as possible." [ emphasis 
added] This memorandum specifica.J.ly callell for the creation of an 
. Inter-Agency DomC':;tic Intelligence unit ,vhich had been an jnt~gral 
part of the Huston plan. Dean's memorandum to the Attorney General 
ob~erYed that ~-Ioov~r. was strongly opposed to the creation of snch a

prrn.te procedure. ,rnulcl b~ to decide on the type of intelli_;-3nce 
we need, based on an assessment of the recommendations of
