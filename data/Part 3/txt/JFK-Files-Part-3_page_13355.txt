•• 
Have you ever been to New Orleans? 
STIJRGIS: Yes, sir, r have. Several times. 
OLSEN: And do you know whether you were in New Orleans at any 
time in 1962 or 1963? 
STIJRGIS: 
OLSEN: 
STIJRG!S: 
r can't remember, sir. l don't recall the dates. 
What was tlie occasion for your being in New Orleans? 
r believe once or twice in leaving the country, one time 
I believe going to Panama, 
OLSEN: That is, you just flew to New Orleans in order to catch 
a flight to Panama? 
_.__ ... --~-~~ .. , 
STURGIS: To Panama. A dtrect flight to Panama. Also a direct flight 
to Guatamala wlien r went there to visit President Udios (?). 
OLSEN: And, on either of those occasions did you go into the 
City of New Orleans or did you just stay· at the airport between flights? 
STURGIS: r stayed at a motel, which I believe was one of the largest 
motels in New Orleans. I did go into the French Quarter in New Orleans one 
time--the date I don't rememaer. But it was on one of these visits. 
OLSEN: 
STIJRGIS: 
OLSEN: 
STURGIS: 
Was it just for an evening on the town, or what? 
Yes, sir. 
Just for social contact? 
Yes, sir. Because New Orleans is a famous city in the 
French Quarter and I wanted to at least if I had the time at that time at 
the motel to visit the French Quarter.
