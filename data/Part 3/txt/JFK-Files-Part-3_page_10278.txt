ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Miller also advised on 4-2-75 that their review of the Ellison 
investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and 
he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only 
real solution to the situation s.eemed to b~ that she not be added to the staff. 
Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard. 
This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the 
Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of 
Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient 
cause to question her suitability for assignment to the Select Committee staff. 
Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.

·These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated _ 
at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to 
purely administrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive 
or classified information in connection with her responsibilities. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
For information.
