QUESTION: 
MR ADAMS: 
QUESTION: 
create enough disruption that these members will realize that 
if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the 
Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if 
that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I 
will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence 
stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say 
20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately 
were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of 
violence because they knew.they couldn't control the conspiracy 
any longer. 
I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in 
1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto 
situation? 
I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year 
where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was 
the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington, 
areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the 
situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They 
weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an 
organization. They were listening posts in the community that 
would help tell us that we have another group here that is 
getting ready to start another fire fight or something . 
... Without going into that subject further of course we 
have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt 
was made to prevent crime when you had information that it 
was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where 
you have.
