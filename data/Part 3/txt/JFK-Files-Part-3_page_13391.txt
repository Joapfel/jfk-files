STURGIS: I received these blanks in the early part of the 1960's 
by Sam Jenis, which he asked me if I wanted to fill out the applications 
and become an employee of Central Intelligence Agency. I told him I did 
not; he asked me why. I told him that I did not trust some of the 
agents that CIA had working for them per seas agents, because I felt 
that some of them were double-agents; I felt that many of the agents had 
too much power in their hands where a good possibility that\their case 
officer or their station chief did not know totally what some of the agents 
. them were doing or orders that the agents were giving to underlings underAor 
people who were closely associated with them on a contract basis or what-
ever. 
OLSEN: Frank, we've had a rather lengthy interview with you now; 
you've covered a great deal of infonnation with us, and you've shown us 
records, photographs-- you've loaned to us some photogra?hs which we are 
going to have copied and returned to you. Is there anything else at all 
that you would like to present to the Commission, or have the Commission 
know about relating to your contacts with the Central Intelligence Agency 
over the years, or your activities on behalf of the Agency? 
STURGIS: I think I covered the area pretty good. I realize that 
it has been over many many years that I was trying to think about. As far 
as I know, I covered just about everything that I thought was important. 
If in the future that I would think of something or come across any documents 
or anything pertaining to any of my activities, I would gladly call you; and 
if it is necessary that you need copies of them, I will send them to you; or
