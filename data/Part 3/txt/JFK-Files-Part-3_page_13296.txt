Mexican intercept operations: Did CIA have recordings of calls 
between Cuban and Soviet Embassies in which Oswald is discussed 
or in which Oswald participated? Did we have a recording of 
Oswald's conversation with a guard at the Soviet Embassy?· 
Answer: 
CIA has transcripts of such calls, including a conversat~on 
• 
between Oswald and a guard at-the Soviet Embassy in Mexico 
City, which were made on 27 and 28 September and 1 October 
1963. These ;ranscripts were reviewed in their entirety by 
the Warren Commission at CIA Headquarters and in Mexico City 
at the Station in April 1964. Thi recordings were erased 
routinely after the transcripts were made. Oswald identified 
himself only in the course of the 1 October conversation, and 
a summary of that conversation was the first indication of his, 
presence in Mexico reported by the Station on 8 October 1963 
and disseminated by CIA Headquarters on 10 October 1963.
