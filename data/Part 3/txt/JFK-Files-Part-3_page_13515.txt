few mon~.::hs of 19G0, which ·would have been in the EisenhoH.sr 
Administration,any plans were developed within the Technical 
Services Dranch of the Agency to develop any kind of poison 
pills that might be used to ass~ssinate Castro? 
MR. BISSELL: 
I , 
I very nuch doubt if any such develop-
ment v1as attempted r,iith this or any other specific operation 
in visw, but the Agency did have and does have an on-going 
R&D program, and I am quite certain that products of this 
sort ·were ari1ong those that .j_t had available. 
I,11R nr;,I IM. .".L • J...J..:...J J 1..,"i • Do you have any other recollections 
. concerning the Castro matter at this ti1ne? 
MR. BISSELL: I am vague as to ~he final outcome of 
that attempt. I <lo not recoll9ct, I hava no rsc~llection of a

ho\v~?.v,sr, that \'le. probably did r::i.ovc to be in a position to, carry 
it out, or to authorize it if authorization were recaived. One 
of the reasons \·.rsrs, I believe that rv:-.y own r2coll-2ction of the 
final stages of tha~ pl~n . lS is that, as I hav2 already 
explained, what it conterr:pla::ed was £urnishin9 probably, furnish 
ing pro½ably s-o:ne. money and such i ter:ts as pills or other <levies 
through a nunber of to a group ·which 
we ourselves, of course, did not in any dirsct senss control. 
This ':lets not an op2ration of such a character tha.t the cornmuni-
\ 
ca·:.ions '\,1ould run t:!:1roug!1 Ac10ncy channsls, or that au-=.horization 
on the spot would b8 by Agency personnel, or that th9 Agency
