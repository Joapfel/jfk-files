The RCMP has shown that all .three missions can 
be' accommodated in one agency, although the distinctive 
character of each mission requires internal adjustments of 
policy, structure, administration, personnel con·siderations, 
and operations. 
. . 
Implementation of adjustments within the FBI 
is being considered at this time'.· : 
Consequently, based on above considerations, the 
FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement, 
internal ~ecurity, and counterintelligence remain with the 
FBI. •
