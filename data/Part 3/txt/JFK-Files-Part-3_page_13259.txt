iOP SEC;RET 
MR. STURGIS: No, sir. 
MR. OLSEN: Is it somebody who.you knew to be a 
contract agent of the CIA? 
145 
MR. STURGIS: No, . sir. All I knew is that he was an 
agent, and at . .a ·later date;· it was proven that he was an 
agent. So -·my··contac.:t:s- with this man throughout the years, how 
he worked, my close contact with him, in Miami, the way of 
operation, the way he· handles himself, the people that he 
was in close contact.with,that. the top political and military 
people· who were in exile that he was in touch with, the forma~ 
tion of the Bay of Pigs itself before the invasion,came 
through this particular man. He was part of the forming of 
this -- at least of the· Revolutionary Council. And I was 
approached by hirn·and I told· Sam aboQt it. I said,~ Sam, what. 
you think? The idiot -- I hope this never gets publicized. 
. MR. OLSEN: Trust us . 
MR. STURGIS: I said, this idiot took me·out, and 
~ 
we had some lunch, and he asked me if I wanted to do an 
assassination, or if I would do an assassination attempt for 
• the outfit. 
And I looked him square in the face and·I told him, 
-why did you come to me? And he says; well, Frank,· like, who 
else? You are a man that the Chief knows your background, and 
I know your background, and I know you are capable. And you 
~ a capable man. And if anybody can do it, you can do it.
