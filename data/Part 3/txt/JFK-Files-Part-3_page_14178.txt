c_ould get away w1 th it, however, they w0uld almost certain estimate that this 
could·not be done Without provoking a dangerous U. s. reaction; ru:d ~lthough 
tbe. Soviets may see. some m.ilit!iry advantages in Cuba, as a strat~gic .etr.ike base, 
the risk8 would be great and the political 1.mplicn.tions~uld. run counter to

g_~s retrospective comments on SNIE 85-3-62: ( 1) the judgment o~ the 
deBJ.iee of risk !1hich the USSR was willing to a.cc.ept was gravely in error and ,the 
community was virtually unanimous in support of this jud@nent (2) the deployment 
of ballistic misslles and nuclear weapons outside the USSR we.a unprecedented -
(3) while the first ballistic missiles "had, probably arrived in Cuba between

Soviet operations were moving and to the great probability that the new in­

Iraq and Ind,onesiP., a.nd for Cube. in the 1960-1962 period,. ·but there was already 
good evidence that the Cuban program bad. deJ:6,rled from this pattern (6) also -
the Indonesian situation had broken the Soviet pattern only a month before when 
the USSR showed itself willing-to· e.ccept a substantially increased degree of risk 
11for the sake of a political gain something leas than vital to. Soviet iuterests" 
(7) the USSR had shown in the Indonesian affair that it was "willing to. take· 
some risk of mili~:ry engagement with an ally of the United States, albeit the 
degree of .risk involved vas far leas than in the Ctiban venture, and (8) " .....
