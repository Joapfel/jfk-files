Dear Mr. O'Connor: 
Pursuant to Section III. A. of the notification· 
attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I am 
forwarding herewith an additional-request for materials 
which relate to this matter. 
' :· 
The specificity of this request is not, of 
course, intended to limit in any way the agreement to come 
forward with all relevant information and mater:i,,g.J.§,,_ includ­
ing documents, whether or not they have been brought to the 
Committee's attention or have been spec~fically requested 
by the-Committee. 
-~ i 
As Mr. Schwarz and I indicated in our meeting 
with you a few days ago, there are still outstanding sev­
eral items relating to this matter which the Committee re­
quested some time ago. This request should in no way delay 
.further the availal:::>ility of the previously requested items, 
and we would expect that individual items will be supplied 
whenever they become separately ready for submission. 
Your cooperation is appreciated. 
Sincerely, ~ 
ry}u.Y.EPAJ/ • V J<;>hn T. Elliff".
