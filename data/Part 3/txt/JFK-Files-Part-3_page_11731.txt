Recommendation 
. . It is recommended that this office continue. 
It is possible that a change in leadership may be necessary 
as indicated by the Inspector's findings and recommendations 
concerning this will be made as soon as it can be determined 
whether or not there has been an improvement. 
TEL AVIV 
This office was opened solely as a source of 
HILEV material and it has proved fertile in this respect. 
There have been some unexpected fringe benefits in that an 
.• organized crime figure has taken refuge in Tel Aviv and 
• the Legal Attache has been able to secure the cooperation 
.of the Israeli police in affording coverage to the anti-Soviet 
. Jewish Defense League, which has proven so troublesome in 
: _the New York City area. As the office has only been open 
• .. during the current year, it is too early to assess accurately 
ei th.er its potential or its achievements. • • 
Productivity 
Eigqt persons wanted in the United States have 
been located in Israel and 3 "informal deportations" arranged. 
~he case load as of 6/30/71 was 69, which is considerably 
below aver.age on a per agent basis. Forty-four HILEV items 
have been submitted of which 27 have been used with 1 pending~ 
This is substantially above average, and the Director recently 
noted the .Legal Attache's excellent production and he has 
-been recommended for commendation. 
Personnel 
It is• too early to make an accurate assessment a.s 
to future personnel needs. One agent could handle the present 
case load but we do not feel that the full ·potential of the 
area has. yet been reached and any reduction.:~;_,_,; would result 
in two one-man offices at the end of the Mediterranean with 
accompanying problems of relief. 
Recommendation 
• ••. Continue tor the time being.
