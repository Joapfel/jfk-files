source by CIA policy. We were of the opinion that CIA's 
policy could be modified to allow us direct access to 
the sourco in tho United States when such was necossary. . I , . 
As of 1954, CIA had interest in various 
organizations such as Radio Free Europe and others and 
from time to time the Bureau would get involved in 
investigation of organizations only to learn they were 
being supported or guided by CIA. Our opinion was that 
if we had been appropriately notified of CXA's interest 
considerable investigative time and manpower could have ✓ 
been saved and in addition we would have been in a position 
to notify CIA when. anything of interest came to our 
attention. 
Concerning CIA investigations in the United 
~ States, we readily acknowledged CIA's right to investi­
gate its own applicants or consultants. ·we did object 
to CIA's undertaking any investigation in this country 
when the facts indicated the case was clearly within 
Bureau jurisdiction and pointed out that the Bureau had 
·,recently become involved in investigating an individual 
suspected of espionage activity. ·we were in contact with 
CIA and had-solicited its help concerning certain aspects 
. in tµe case but it was a few weeks before we learned CIA 
had con.ducted a very close investigation of this same 
' .. ind:1.vidual. We made the observations . that close and open 
cooperation between the Bureau and CIA was- vital to the • 
-proper handling of espionage cases. 
. The Bureau pointed out that as of 1954 it had 
received little or no significant- inforri1ation concerning 
espionage' or sabotage agents coming .. to the United States. 
We excluded diplomatic personnel,in this matter but clearly 
indicated that CIA should be in a position to give us some
