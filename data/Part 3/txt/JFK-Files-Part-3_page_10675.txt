Knoxville territo:ry does not lie 1:rithin the t:::-aditional::..)· 
d2ep South, there is, of course 1 some syw~athy for organizations 
such as the klans within the territory as evidenced by the 
in.creased growth and activity of these organizations.in recent 
years. Within the Knoxville territory the1~e have been no acts 
of violence v,i thin i~ecent years which were attributable to_ the

in any counterintelligence 09eration in this area.
