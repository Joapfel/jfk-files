SUGGESTION !\.IBMORANDUM 
RE: YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE 
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST (TROTSKYIST) 
I 
From a review of the matters being 
handled by the New Left Section, it is 
evident that the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), the youth group of the 
Socialist Workers Party (SWP), is the fastest growing subversive youth 
group in th:is country. In August, 1970, membership was estimated to be 
1100. During the SWP convention which was held in August, 1971, it was 
determined that YSA membership had grown to 1500 members. 
It is noted YSA played an important role in the activities of the 
National Peace Action Coalition during the April - May., 1971, antiwar 
demonstrations in ·washi11gton, D. C. • 
; 
j YSA has numerous chapters throughout the United States, primarily 
on campuses. In addition, the Student Mobilization Committee to End the 
War in Vietnam (SMC) has chapters on many campuses. The SMC is 
nothing more than a front group for the YSA and is dominated and controlled 
1;:>y YSA. • 
YSA claims it had recruited 450 new members into its ranks during 
the Spring of 1971. 
Its leaders have called for aggressive YSA recruiting among colleges 
this fall and have set a goal of at least doubling their present membership. 
YSA leaders have called for student strikes on campuses this fall 
i~ order to close them d_own and attempt to organize them for antiwar work. 
The SwP is attempting to place its candidates on ballots in 32 states 
and YSA is being called on to assist in a vigorous election campaign. SWP 
and YSA plan to use this campaign as a means of recruiting new members 
to their ranl<..s. It is noted YSA is planning to hold its national convention 
in Houston, Texas, late this fall.
