that would provide ~ny basis for oversight? 
How can you, from among other things, be protected from 
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't 
do something that some politician tried to pressure you into 
doing? 
Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senatdr, that ten years 
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be 
criticized for doing that which today is construed as very 
acceptable. 
Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy 
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in. 
Mr. Kelley. And the Director. 
Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is 
why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines 
as sharply defined as possible, so that when you are pressured 
to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20 
hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say 
well, here.are the standards that you gave us, and they specifi -
ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by 
the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me 
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's 
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to 
be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what 
you should have d~ne. 
Don't you fear that?
