• 'Ille meaning of "de~d" is not_. :indicated. beyond subpoena., in 
the C.F .R. sections :inµicated. mus omission creates a need for an 
interpretation, for purposes o~ uniform Department of Justice reaction. . . . , 
Outl:ines for inqu:irJ proqeedings were agreed upon between the 
White House and the Senate Select Conmittee on June 13, 1975, and a 
copy of those procedures 1~s furnished to the Department on June 16, 
197:>. untle.e tl:cse gi_.,j nel:ines, there is a general underta.ld.ng by the 
Co."Jnlittee to identify witnesses to tne Agency a reasonable time before 
the intervie\·ts occur. This general rule includes current and former 
employees; ·certa:L~ exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in 
t'he guidelines. The Committee is J::equ:ired to provide the witness with 
a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oatr..s or 
agr'eements for the purpose of this inquiry". Tne Corrmittee is required 
to give prior notice ·of an :interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub­
ject area; (b) pericxis of errployrnent; (c) the date set for the intervili:w. 
Since these structured proced{u.es, taken with the rules of the 
SUbcorrmittee, w.ay create a requirement of test:imony upon .witnesses, it 
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., s 16.21, et. seq., 
which refer to 11dei-nand11 should be interpreted to include any request 
by ?l1Y Committee staff merrber to interview any erqJloyee, former employee 
or other person conne_cted with the' Department o.f Jl!5tice. _ • 
'Iltls :interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit­
ness be authorized to speak under§ 16.23 by an appropriate Cepartrr.ent 
Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designat 
I woula think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI shou 
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, :ln coordia.'18.tion
