Ji~Ci?kcTOR EDWARD S . MILLER: Your concurrence with this 
1 suggestion on a trial basis is considered forward-looking, 
part·icular;I.y since you have used this type of handling with 
marked success in your Racial Intelligence Program. 
/ 
It is felt, however, that a six months' period is 
not an adequate period to measure the effectiveness, considering 
the time required to reach full implementation of the program 
in the field. For this reason, it is strongly sugg~sted 
you make your trial period at least one year. 
Comments of Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan 
requested. 
ADDENDUM 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. 
(JAS:sjr - 1/22/71) 
BRENN(/)(/In li~e with the Inspector's 
suggestion, we will implement 
. the program involved and 
evaluate it at the end of one year.
