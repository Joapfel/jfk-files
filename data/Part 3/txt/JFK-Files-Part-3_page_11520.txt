Dear Mr.. Lawrence;-
Thank you fqr your recent letter, the cop~-of your 
letter to Senator Morgan and the newspaper clippings.· 
I am not among ·those Members of Coµgress ·who have . 
been criticizing the FBI and CIA. tn my judgement 
both agencies are vitally essential. Tt is coin­
cidental that you included the editorial, 11Is 
America Gming .Madtt from U.S. News and World Re-
port~ This editorial made such sense to me that 
last week I _placed a copy of it inthe Congrssional 
Record along with my own comments of agreement. 
Enclosed is a copy of my remarks for the Record. 
along. ·with a copy of a news release which I mailed 
to all news media in the Eleventh Congressional 
District .. 
I know that Senator Morgan will read you~ letter 
very c~refully and will welcome the opportunity 
it affords him to respond to you directly.
