It is my understanding that the continuing efforts of 
staff members of the Executive and Legislative Branches to 
prepare standard guidelines for witness interview procedures 
are continuing this week. While that process continues, the 
Depart~ent of Justice is, of course, continuing to cooperate 
in an ad hoc and responsive manner. In order.to ensure our 
attention to these c~operative efforts, I hav~ designated 
K. Willia~ O'Connor as Special Counsel for Intelligence 
• Coordination and as such he will be the\principle liaison 
.. officer of DOJ in this effort. I unders~an..ci..,J:hac-y'our Chief 
Counsel and· .members of his staff are new dealing with 
Mr. O'Connor in the execution of their responsibilities . 
. In the meantime, in an effort to expedite the coopera-
~ive provision of appropriate information to SSC, it would be 
most helpful if the Committee Staff would ensure that the
