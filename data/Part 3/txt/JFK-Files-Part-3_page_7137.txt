To facilitate interviews by the Commission Staff Officers· 
wifb.C.:tA employees, I have advi~ed the Commis-sioµ. that employees 
are authorized to furnish classified.information with certain 
. . 
·exceptions. · My· letter to -€:.he Vice President, the Chairman of ... . . 
the Commission, is attached. It sets forth guidelines for the . 
furnishing of class~fied information. 
The 9ooperati~e spirit .of our relatiqnship with the Com-
. . 
mission and.its Staff must at.the same time take account of the 
: rights of Agency employees. Like. other citizens, they have the· 
right to remain silent·.. The Commission Staff will advise .. 
employees of their rights at t~e beginning of any interview.or 
other appearance. 
My own_ belief, after careful review of all activities in 
question, is that legal action will not be taken against •• •. ,· 
individuals. The final deci 9ion, however, must rest with the 
Department of Justice and other legal authorities and risk of 
. . . 
. such action is a judgment each employee must make £or· himself· ..
