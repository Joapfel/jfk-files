Mr. Johnston. Would you agree, at least~- from that summary 
of the document, that really he's asking you to get intelligence 
type information from AMI.ASH? 
Is that correct? 
AMLJ\SH Case Officer. Yes. 
Mr. Johnston. And given the October 5th, 1963 meeting whe 
a AMLASII sort of indicated he didn'.t want anything to do with 
9 that, this would be very inconsistent for someone who was 
lO knowledable about AMLASH.

AMI.ASH Case Officer. What are the dates? 
Mr. Johnston. October 5th, 1963, is when AMLASH complaine 
13 about the low level espionage requirements.

AMLASH Case Officer. He did not want -- he did not say 
that he would not surface intelligence requirements. He did 
not want to excluR!.vely be that type of an asset. 
So therefore it would be perfectly normal, regardless of 
what he thought himself to be, or what even· we may have though 
for him to be, that if he had access to information, we were 
going to levy the requirements on him. 
Mr. Johnston. My direct question is, then, having read 
the summary apparently prepared by Mr. King, and sent on 
February 2nd, 1964, do you think that Mr. King knew about the 
AMLASII operation, the events of October and November? 
AMLASI! Case Officer. If he sent us a memo giving us
