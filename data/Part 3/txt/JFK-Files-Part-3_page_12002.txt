SECURITY INDEX - CUBA 
(Bufile 100-358086-210) 
Background and Date of Inception 
4-H 
This program was instituted in November, 1960. 
By that date it was obvious that Cuba, whose Government 
had been taken over by Fidel Castro in January, 1959, 
was a communist state posing a real and present threat 
to the internal security of the U.S. In 1962, at the 
time of the Cuban missile crisis, a Supervisor at the 
Bureau was assigned the specific responsibility for 
administering this program to assure the apprehension and 
special handling of the individuals included therein in

Scope and Desired Objectives 
As of 12/15/70, there were 419 individuals 
included· in the Security Index - Cuba Program, divided 
in.to two categories: 
1. Individuals p_laced on the Security Index 
solely on account of their pro-Cuban activities. (Cuban 
Special Section - 96 persons). 
2. Persons already on the Security Index 
because of other subversive connections and activity who 
would warrant special attention in the event of hostilities 
with Cuba (Security Index subjects tabbed "Pro-Cuban'' -
323 individuals). 
Program is designed to maintain an up-to-date 
record of location and activities of individuals included 
therein, by means of established Security Index procedures 
and reporting, in order that we are in a position to move 
swiftly should the apprehension or special handling of 
these persons become necessary.
