Certainly, the items mentioned by Mr. Sullivan :la.re 
such as to be handled by the Bureau on an intelligence basis. The 
racial field is a most fertile field for Communist Party and other 
subversive groups. There are indications of this such as in the 
cases of Martin Luther King and Michael Schwerner, one of the 
missing civil rights workers from Philadelphia, :Mississippi, and 
other situations. Also there are reports of foreign funds being used

to support the current actions of Malcolm X. The racial strife and 
disorder are of such major significance as to have international 
aspects and this. is tailor-made for the disruptive tactics of subversive 
elements both right and left. 
We cannot afford to divorce the national racial program from 
its possible international aspects. The devices and tactics presently 
in use in the security field should be utilized to the fullest in 
developing intelligence information regarding national as well as 
international developments in the racial strife. The tense racial 
potential in major cities is a fertile field for subversive activities 
both right and left. 
We have seen from the killings in the South, for example, 
the killing of Medgar Evers, that such appear to be isolated incidents 
usually carried out by one man or a small unattached group occurring 
on the spur-of-the-moment, such as the killing of the Lieutenant Colonel 
near Colbert, Georgia, and the assaulting_ of a minister in the streebt tJ-' 
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. r . [nEc-n.~ / ' / , -- ' ()i . yf ~ "t -r f\ j\ ~ . ~ li> I .

The investigation of the Klan and.hate groups as well as the 
development of informants in such organizations must, out of:::mf'eleBSity;t'4 
be handled as a whole. The following of the informants cannot be isolateq__ _ 
from the over-all investigation of the organizations just as theinformants 
in the Communist Party cannot be isolated from the organizations they are 
connected with.
