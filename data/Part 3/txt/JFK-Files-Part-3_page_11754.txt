Division (DID) be divided into two separate divisions. In order that this matter 
can be analyzed during this inspection you are requested to furnish: 
1. Complete table of organization for each of two new Divisions as you would 
organize them if suggestion were adopted. Do not use names of supervisors, 
Section Chiefs, Front Office administrators. Use only position designations, 
Section and Unit designations and number of Agents and clerks designated for 
each Unit and Section. 
2. Irr the event you feel wm~k now b.eing.handl.ed, by another Di,vision should 
be realigned in the event above suggestion adopted, so indicate under appropriate 
new division. 
3. Following each of the two tables of organization for the above new 
divisions', set out Section by Section and where appropriate, Unit by Unit, 
yoqr reasoning for placement in division. In this regard, it will be necessary 
_to take into a:ccount and balance both volume of work and nature of work being 
handled. 
4. Indicate advantages in adoption of above suggestion. 
5. Set out disadvantages you feel apparent in dividing DID. Also indicate 
how such can be overcome and resolved. 
6. Since adoption of above would involve possible realignment of space in 
some instances, you are requested to advise what new space would be necessary 
and what other movement of personnel and equipment would be involved.
