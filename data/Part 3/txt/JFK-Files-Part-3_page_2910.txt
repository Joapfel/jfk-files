protect me or any successor from this type of thing. I think 
that would be splendid. I have not reviewed the guidelines 
as prepared to the present date by the Department. It might 
be that they are well defined in there. But I welcome any 
consideration of such directives. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. Do you think this is a probler;1 
Mr. Kelley. No, sir, not with me. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. Do you think that it has been 
a problen for the people that preceded you? 
Hr. Kelley. I think so. 
Senator Hart of Colqrado. And that's a problem the 
Congress ought to address? 
Mr. Kelley. I think so. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. The Committee received a 
letter from the Department of Justice a couple of days, the 
Assistant Attorney General asking· our 9ooperation in carrying 
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi­
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther 
King, Jr. , ·in order to determine whether that investigation 
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked 
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all 
material provided to the Cor~aittee by the FBI which relates 
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart­
ment asking this Comnittee for FBI files?
