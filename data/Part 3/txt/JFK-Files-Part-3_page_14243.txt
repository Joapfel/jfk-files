Mr·. Gentile s·aid that much remains to be done, including (1) a co 1.:aplete

the ;examination of the North Wing of the

Embassy, and (3) the initiation of a 
s~arch o~ the South Wing. 
Mr. Bannerman observed thAt a key factor is the tremendous disadvantage 
to the U. ~. rcault~g from· Soviet control of the construction of buildings to 
be occupied by u. s. ·personnol.
