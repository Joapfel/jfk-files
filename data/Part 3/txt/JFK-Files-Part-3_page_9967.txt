By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field .!II'!~ 
, investigations regarding SSC staff personnel. These have extremelyA'-\ 
short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded @ 1 
Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential ~~1 
treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress. The~\!) 
Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Special Inquiry~ \ 
Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling u • .11 
these requests. Senator Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimatef.II ··' -~ 
that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investf~ } 
gation. As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 such 0 '~£-­
investigations from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in U -~ 
sight. They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which m ~ 
is not the even flo_w expected and presents an additional burden 1 ~ :1 
In addition it is expected that similar requests wi}l~ 
forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a simflar: ) 
agreement with it . Congressman Nedzi , Chairman of the HSC, ·fias • ~ \. 
estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be 
hired." It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short 
actual receipts. 
Since there is no charge for these full field investigati'. s 
they will have to be considered in the budget. It is noted the , 
current charge for a ful~fJ--x_ld inve_stigation, where applicable, is~-

ACTION: For information. Since it appears the nucleus of the 
Committee has been formed, it is suggested Sen~C'fft:ifiblf t,e=,con­
tacted and queried regarding a more realistic (30 day) deadline on 
the remaining investigations concerning future&ti\lP:B mdmSElrs and 
their replacements.
