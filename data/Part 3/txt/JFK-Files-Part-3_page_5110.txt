Re: Senate Select Comm.ittee 
It should also be noted that certain Manual changes are being 
recomm.ended in connection with Section 12, in relation to absences for 
m.aternity purposes. In Section 12, page 10, we are recom.m.ending that 
the phrase "absence for m.aternity reasons" be used in all instances where 
we have previously used the phrase "m.aternity leave. 1 ' These recomm.ended 
revisions have already been approved anq; are being processed. In 
Section 12, page 8, we are recomm.endmg a revision indicating that 
em.ployees resigning for m.aternity purposes can utilize accrued sick leave 
during their period of incapacitation and are not setting out specific tim.e 
elements as previously utilized. Mem.orandum. is attached recommending 
this change. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
That this m.emorandum. be furnished to Intelligence Division; 
with three copies to Legal Counsel Division, setting forth that the 
Adm.inistrative Division has no objection to the m.aterial set out in • 
Sections 10 and 12, including proposed revisions, of the Manual of Rules­
and Regulations being referred for review-~ (
