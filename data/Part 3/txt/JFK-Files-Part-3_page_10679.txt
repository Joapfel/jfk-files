Knoxville territQry does not lie within the traditional~J 
c.eep South, there is, of course, some symp2.thy for organizations 
such as the klans within tl;le territory as evidenced by the 
increased grov,th and acti ;,;i ty of these orga;1iz3:tions in recent 
years. Within the Knoxville territory th01~e have 'been no acts 
of violence within recent years which were attributable to.the 
klan. Although there may not be any public sympathy for the 
klan in this area, there is certainly no antagonism toward 
the organization and many persons have a passive feeling 
-'coy:ard its member.ship and acti.vities-.. In some instances,, 
politicians have solicited ~he support of the klan in local 
elections o Just recently, .. one of the informants .of the Knoxville 
Office, who is a high official in the DKA, KKKK, reported that 
one of the can.di dates for- U. -S .. Congress running from the 
~(noxville district had c9ntacted him and soli_citeci the support 
of 1::lan membe:rs on his behalf~ ,., 
Because of such factors as the above, it is not beiieveJ 
that the cooperation of individuals can be utilized for plans 
of -dis::..~uptj,ve action such as might be available if. the -.targets 
were Cor,mmnist front ox:_ganizations or related groups. In this 
reg.a::.~d, al though ne-ws media are very cooperative with the 
Bu1~eau in. this territory, it is not believed that in a program 
such as this -i,;:.a-s, it would be feasible, to utilize news media 
in any counterintelligence operation in this area. 
This matter has been discussed with Agents handling 
investigations o:f ·the klan organizations in the IG.-i.oxville 
·-Division and -'che follov,ing ·plans have been suggested_ as £ea.sible· 
• for ope1~ation against the DK, KKKK ·and T.JIC4., KKKK in 'this terri-
t9ry: ' 
It is suggested that anonymous telephone calls be made 
to eBPloyers ·of klan members inferring to the employer- that 
his company or business must be following a racist policy in 
• view of the f2ct that he has· an employee (giving his id~nt_i ty)
