give any direction to the Bureau in the matter that you know of? 
Mr. Adams. Yes, sir. I know that, of course, on th~ 
wiretapping on Martin Luther King, it ~as approved by the 
Attorney General. I know that the President of the United States 
and tp.e Attorney General specifically discussed their concern 
with Dr. King over,Communist influence on him. I do know there 
was concern, but I don't tie in this date, 1965. 
Senator .Tower. Do you know whether or not.Mr. Hoover 
9 ever sought direct'authorization from Mr. Katzenbach for this 
_ 10 very sensitive surveillance.of,Dr. King? 
11 Mr. Adams. I don't know .. Attorney General Kennedy approve 
12 the actual.surveillance that was instituted on Dr. Ki~g. I 
13 don't know of any correspondence between Attorney General 
14 Katzenbach 
15 Senator Tower. Or any.personal communication between them 
.. -16 that would have indicated the level of the Attorney General's 
17 involvement? - . 
18 Mr. Adams. No. 
19 If my recollection.serves me.correct, as far as Attorney 
20 General Kennedy was.concerned, .he requested.coverage on Dr. 
21 King. The Bureau .responded.with a request in writing, which 
22 is our normal procedure~ 1Ie declined to approve that request, 
23 and then we came back.later, a few months later and requested 
24 it again, at which time he did approve. That is my recolle_ction 
25 of that.
