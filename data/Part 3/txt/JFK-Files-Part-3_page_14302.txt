• N:, another point in the meeting the Board 11eard comments 
from Mr. Roger Hilsman, Director of the Bureau· of· Intelligence 
and Research at tpe pepartment of State. Among other things, 
·Mr. Hilsman felt that the lJ. S. Government was·not making· 
full use of cove:rt action operations in providing assistance 
to foreign political paities. _ He thought that such opera-· 
tions were important and could be 9elpful-if done skillfully. 
Mr.· Hilsman. expressed ·criticism of the fact that the Depart­
ment of State was brought into CIA' s _planning·_ in the NSC 5412/2 
area only at the las~ moment, which made it d±fficult for 
the ·State Department to take a position .without knowledge 
of the extent and nature of the CIA resources that would be. 
involved. Mr. Hilsman went on to say that he favored r~organi­
zing the CIA.along the .general lines of the British Intelligence 
System; he would placie clandestine collection and· covert 
political action operations under the Department of State; 
and he would req.,uire that the State Department·exercise policy 
control over all aspects of intelligence including politica~, 
psychological, propaganda, paramilitary.and.related covert' 
activities. 
Meeting of July 18, 1961: 
In the course of this meeting, Mr. Bi!ssell of CIA was 
invited to discuss with Board members his views on possible 
reorgani~itiph. steps that might be takert with respect to the 
CI.A. At one point il'). the discussion Mr. Bissell volunteered 
the suggestion that perhaps a 9tep might be taken by the . 
Pre•sident to obtain a better public understanding and acceptance 
of the CIA's responsibilities. Mr. Bissell suggested that 
perhaps: the President could make an.appropriate announcement 
\which would include recognition· cf the ·.exis.tence of the body 
known as the Special NSC 5412/2 Group, telling of the Group's 
duties and who compose it, without giving the public any 
infor~ation on th~ actual nature of the tovert operations per­
:formed by, the CIA.
