Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
National Security Council Intelligence Committee (NSCIC) 
with the AG as a member. The President's 11/5/71 memorandum 
stated the NSCIC "will give direction and guidance on national 
substantive intelligence needs and provide for a continuing 
evaluation of intelligence.products rrom the viewpoint of the 
intelligence consumer." Assistant AG Robert Mardian attended 
a meeting of N-SCIC on 12/14/71 as the AG1 s representativ•e. 
We cannot document it, but the recollection of FBI personnel 
involved in NSGIC affairs is that Mr. Mardian reported thereafter 
to the AG that NSCIC activities did not concern the Department 
and that neither th~ AG nor Mardia~ were subsequently involved 
in NSCIC affairs. On 4/24/74, the AG was still listed as a 
member of ~SCIC. However, in August, 1974, FBI inquiry of a 
member of the U. ~. intelligence committee staff elicited the 
opinion that the AG was no longer considered to be a member 
of NSCIC because the AG's office had not been participating in' 
NSCIC affairs or attending its meetings;·further, the AG was 
not among the addressees of papers beiU:g sent out in preparation 
for the ne~t NSCIC meeting·. However, it appears that the AG 
.lilay still be n9minally listed as a member of N'~CIC. (5) It 
might a],.so be useful for Mr. Ulllla.n to consult Mr. Kevin Maroney 
of the Internal Security Section of the Department inasmuch as 
Mr. Maroney has ~qng been involved in matters relating to 
internal ·secµrity and foreign intelligence, and may be aware 
of the extent of the AG' s inv·ol vement. 
~?"i' ACTION: 
~ I With your approval, Office of Legal Counsel will 
!--~rfr convey the information in the preceding paragraph to Mr. Ulman, 
/ I':\\ who said he can be contacted by c:elephone on 187-2051. He 
i~ ~ requested an expeditious response.
