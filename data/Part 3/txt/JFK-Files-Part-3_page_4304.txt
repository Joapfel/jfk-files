by unknm·m blae:k assailants as well as information of

I • 
On May 21, 1971, two New York City,police 
officers were shot from behind and killed by two 
unknown black male assailants. while returning to 
their car after responding to a legitimate call in 
the Harlem section of New York City. Two days prior 
to these murders two other Ne,;,, York City police 
officers were wounded by black assailants and a 
letter to The New York Times said that the shooting 
was for revolutionary_justice for black people 
against ''fascist pigs." !Weapons of the' same caliber. 
were used in both shooting incidents which may have 
been related. In this crime, with the type of motive 
in'.'"olved, telephone surveillances of selected persons 
are most valuable and neGessary since a remark during 
a conversation or a contact often results in leads 
to the solutton~of-~he crime which would not otherwise 
be available. t~eajJ has been selected as a pers9n 
likely to lead to the solution of these murders.
