TESTIMONY OF PAUL O'NEILL 
MR. O'NEILL: Very quickly, Mr. Vice President and 
members, I think 1t would be useful if I would try to give 
you some perspective about how 0MB does its work with other 
agencies of government; that is to say, with agencies outside 
of the intelligence area, and specifically outside of the CIA 
area, so that as you come to the,direct testimop.y from my staff 
member, Mr. Donohue, you will have a background in mind. 
I know many of you have had lots of business dealings 
with the government, -and you· have some _appreciation of how 
0MB works, so I will indeed be brief. I think I was just 
looking at some testimony that I am going to be giving· in the 
next couple of days on OMB's budget, and I was looking at the 
historical membe.rs that show,~ow many staff people are in 0MB. 
And I think maybe that is a useful way to come to the subject. 
In 1947 0MB had about 550 total staff people .. Today 
we have 580 total staff people, including 380 professional staff 
l 
people who examine the budgets and the programs and activities 
of everything in the Federal Government. And that means this 
year, as you know, over $350 billion worth of axpenditures. 
I think the budget function is a familiar one. We 
look at the amount of dollars that we are spending and compare 
it to what we have spent in the past.' W,e look at equity 
considerations between groups that are served by Federal 
programs. We try to look at efficiencies, we try to look at
