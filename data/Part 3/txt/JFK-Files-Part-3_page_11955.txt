SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM 4-H 
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS 
February, 1969. Many of these persons had changed residence 
and/or employment and their whereabouts were unknown. It can 
thus be seen that the lifting of the moratorium was an 
aggressive, timely and precise step toward fulfilling Olll" current 
responsibilities, especially in knowing the whereabouts of 
these individuals. Implementation was directed by airtel 
November 3, 1970, to all offices, and in doing so we took a 
realistic step in permitting the field to stagger the reopening 
of these cases so that they would be spread out over the period 
.' November 3, 1970, to June 30, 1971. This was considered 
essential in view of our approximation that it would be necessary 
to reopen approximately 7,000 of the Priority II and III types. 
EXTENT AND NATURE OF CURRENT SUPERVISION 
Rosponsibili ti 1 for adm.:i.n.:i strative handling of tp.e .:;3~ 
rests with the Special Records Unit of the Research Section. 
Responsibility for individual cases rests with appropriate 
supervisory personnel. I personnally follow this matter closely 
to insure it is current and that necessary changes are made 
where desirable. This program receives constant supervision . 
. JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE 
This is a major internal security program based upon 
Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and is to be 
implemented in the event of a national emergency to minimize 
acts of espionage, sabotage and subversion. 
FREQUENCY OF EVALUATION 
The SI Program is ·constantly being re-evaluated. The 
most recent justification is contained in memorandum from 
Charles D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan dated January 8, 1970, and 
as of instant date (January 12, 1971) a current rejustification 
memorandum is in preparation.
