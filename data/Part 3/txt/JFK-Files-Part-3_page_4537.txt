RE: GUS ALEX 
ANTI-RACKETEERING 
It has been reported by the Swiss Central Police 
Bureau that Alex's employer, De Luxe Cigarette Service, 
Incorporated, certified that he has worked in their publicit~ 
department since 1957 and has never given any reason for 
complaints. • 
It is noted that Alex claims income from this 
company which company for years has been reportedly controlled 
by hoodlums. Alex now is reportedly in charge of this company 
having taken it over from a close friend and fellow hoodlum, 
Edward Vogel. Alex on numerous occasions has been observed 
at this location with his chauffeur and body guard Nathan 
"Butch" Ladon. 
In 1958 Alex was summoned to Washington, D.C., to 
appear before the McClellan Senate Rackets Committee investigating 
hoodlum infiltration into labor and business in Chicago. 
Alex refused to cooperate and furnished no information, taking 
refuge behind the 5th Amendment. He refused to answer all 
questions except for his name and address.

of Alex for years and of Alex's affiliations with the De Luxe 
1
Cigarette Service, Incorporated. Duffy stated that Alex 
has been completely uncooperative and that there is no question 
concerning his involvement with Chicago's underworld in 
organized crime.
