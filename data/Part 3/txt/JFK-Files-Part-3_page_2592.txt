"Use of the resources of the FBI to gather 
political intelligence. Our review disclosed 
a few documented instances in which the Bureau 
at times during the course of an election 
campaign was requested to provide -- and did 
indeed provide -- information which could be 
used as political intelligence information. 
In one instance, this involved a check of FBI 
files on the staff of a campaign opponent. 
b. "Improper use of the FBI in connection with 
the political process. In a few instances 
recorded in Bureau files, an incumbent Presi­
dent caused the FBI to gather intelligence 
relating to a political convention under cir­
cumstances that although cast in legitimate 
law enforcement terms could-- and some would 
say should -- have been suspected of being 
politically motivated. • 
c. "Use of the FBI to report on certain activi-
ties of critics of an Administration's policies. 
The FBI files document a few instances in which 
an incumbent President caused the Bureau to 
report on certain activities of Members of 
Congress who were opposed to and critical of 
his policies. 
d. "Use of information in the FBI files to respond 
to or discredit critics. Again, the Bureau 
files document a very small number of instances 
in which derogatory information legitimately 
obtained by the Bureau was disseminated to 
other members of the Executive Branch to enable 
them to discredit their critics. 
e. "Use of the FBI in connection with other legiti­
mate law enforcement activities. There was one 
documented instance where the FBI was used to 
conduct an inquiry for what might be described 
as political purposes, relating to an investiga­
tion properly conducted by other Executive 
Branch officials." (C.23.)
