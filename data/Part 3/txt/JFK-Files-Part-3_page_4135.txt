justify prosecution is not obtained. However, there is no 
leg~l-reasoh why the pros~cuto~ cannot request that the inves­
tigation continue indefinitely as long as there i's information . .. . . . 
that viol~nt activities ahd plans for violence are stitl under-
way. The degree of evidence needed to justify a prosecution 
is certainly greater than the degree of evidence needed to 
just~~y an investigation. 
All th~~ is not to say that no further standards are 
-needed to guide regular criminal investigations when t?ey may 
toucJ.1 on sensitive F_irst. Amenqment or. other constitutional 
interests. This is especially true of ·criminal investigations 
of -individuals or groups engage_d both in la-wf~1l politica~ o:r 
social activities and in unlawful violence or plans for vio-

lence. To what extent is the advocacy of violence a proper 
basis for initiating an investigation? Should an investigation 
be initiated on·the basis of allegations or other information 
that an individual is a member of, or has. expressed public . . 
support for, an organization which has as one of its objectives 
the use of violence? Should an investigation be started on all 
members and public supporters of an organization, some of whose 
members have acted in concert to use violence? 
These questions are addressed in the draft Attorney 
General's guidelin~s for domestic intelligende investigations 
under the heading "pre.l;i.minary investigation~".
