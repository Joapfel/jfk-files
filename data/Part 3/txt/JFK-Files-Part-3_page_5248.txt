In regard to your answer to this 
write-up, the ~allowing is 
1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that 
all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts. This is completely 
inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise·, 
bas to be judged on the merits of the individual case. In 
the r~view of 140 cases there was not one single instance 
wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to 
determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not 
entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified. 
2. Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the 
file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months 
old in which no FD-302 is in the file: 
FILE NUMBER DATE OPENED 
15-11918 8/14/70 
15-11816 7/6/70 
15-11814 7/2/70 
~ 15-11947 8/26/70 
15-~11818 7/10/70 
15-11902 8/25/70 
15-11939 8/28/70 
15-11933 8/21/70 
Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to 
you-did not contain FD-302 1 s and the files had not come 
up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this 
number of files without FD-302 1 s the Agents are not receiving 
adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper 
preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.
