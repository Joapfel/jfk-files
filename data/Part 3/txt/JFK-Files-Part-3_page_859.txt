430 F.2d 165 (1970) and the United States District Court, Central 
District o"t California in United States versus Smith, 321 F. 
Supp. 424 (1971)) have held that 11warrantless surveillance ... 
·may be constitutional where foreign powers are involved.". 
The argument that even foreign related electronic• 
surveillances should be subject to initial judicial review is 
based on the argument that this is the only guaranteed method 
of protecting the Fourth Amendment rights and right to privacy 
of aliens, -and United States citizens who might be involved. 
The argument on the other side is that the nature and objective· 
of the activity, viz., foreign intelligence gathering,· the needs 
of security, the many nonprosecutive factors to be considered, 
and often the time element, do not lend themselves to effective 
or efficient initial judicial review; consequently, the Govern-
. · ment must be granted a measure of confidence to utilize this 
• . technique on its own authority, with the safeguards of protectio~ 
from conviction or the remedies of a civil action available to 
any target of an electronic surveillance,· if the Government 
• abuses this authority. . • .. 
This area-is still in limbo, the same condition as 
. prior to Title III and Keith. Until Ivanov and Enten, or more 
likely until a post Section 2511(3) espionage case, actually 
built on electronic surveillance evidence, are decided by the 
Supreme Court, the Government, to be safe, must be willing to 
·sacrifice a criminal prosecution to obtain electronic surveil­
lance int~lligence.
