The above chart, showing numbers of double agents at 
the time of the last inspection and at present tells only part 
of the story. It does not show that there is a continual 
p~ocess of review and analysis of double agent matters and 
close attention to field activity in this regard. We are 
constantly striving to weed out any "deadwood" and to introduce 
fresh blood into our counterespionage efforts. Presentation 
of precise figures on the turnover among double agents during 
the period since the last inspection is not feasible, becauBe 
various offices have different reporting dates on which they 
• inform the Bureau of additions and deletions of double agents 
in the various nationality fields. However, the following 
available figures clearly indicate desirable turnover. In the 
Soviet field, from March 1, 1970, to December 1, 1970, we added 
.4J_active and potential double agents; a net increase of ..,.3.0r •­
In the other countries currently supervised in the Espionage 
Section, we added 28 active and potential double agents and 
-rlrnppAd 17. a net gain of 11. Several of those dropped were 
used up "iir' counterintelligen""'c"e actions which terminated their 
active usefulness, and some left the country. 
3. Counterintelligence and Other Significant Operations 
In our eyes, counterintelligence activity is activity 
designed to disrupt and hamper the operations of an opposition 
intelligence service. Although it may involve harassment at 
times, it is for the most part much more serious and worthy of 
our efforts only when it inflicts actual damage on the effective­
ness of the enemy. To this end, we.employ our own capabilities 
and, whenever indicated and possible, those of other U. S. and 
other Government agencies. Following are some examples of this 
activity since the last inspection. •
