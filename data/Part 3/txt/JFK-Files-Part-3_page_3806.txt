SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON :nn'ELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
RE: DECF.IA.J3ER 18, 1975, LETTER TO nIE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FROM SENAI'ORS MONDALE AND BAKER 
It is this Bureau's belief that all pertinent 
material pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr., for the 
period January l, through April 4, 19689 has· been made 
available to the SSC responsive to previous requests. With 
regard to the Poor Peoples' Campaign and the Sanitation 
Workers Strike in Memphis; Tennessee, it is not clear 
whether the letter is requesting access to the entire· FBI 
file on these two activities from ~he period January 1, 
through Apr11~4, 1968. It is recommended that a clarification 
of this request can be accomplished during the previously 
proposed meeting between Mr. John Elliff and representatives 
of the FBI. 
Item 7 requests all materials pertaining to_ 
11Project OVershoe. 11 
-A check of indices of the FBI regarding t•Project 
Overshoe," as well as the word overshoe, fails to contain 
any reference to either. Without additional information 
·regarding iiProject 'Wershoe," this Bureau cannot be 
responsive .to this specific request. Again, it is suggested. 
that,-during the forthcoming meeting with John Elliff, 
clarification of "Project nvershoe 0 be obtained.
