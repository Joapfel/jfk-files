NOTE: By letterhead memorandum dated 7 -1.6-75 we made available to 
the Committee a summary of the Inspection Division inquiry into the 
ttofficial and confidential" files, along with making available in 
Bureau space a list of peoplo knowledgeable concerning the "official 
and confidential" files who were contacted du.ring the Inspection Division 
inquiry. We have now been requested to forward this list to the Committee's 
offices. It would appear to resist this ;t"equest would not be in the best in-
terests of the Bureau. Especially in view of the Departmentrs prior reluctance 
to resist requests of this Committee.
