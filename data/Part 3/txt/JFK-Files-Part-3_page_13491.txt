information that the Internal Revenue Service has, and this to 
m~ is just nonsense. I believe in the right of privacy. I am 
for keeping the Internal Revenue records private. But I am not 
for telling the whole world about what is going on in the 
intelligence community. And right now there seems to be no way 
to stop this proc2ss, and, i·::-. is not that one worries about so 
much having people know what the Agency is doing, but people's 
lives·are being put in jeopardy, and people's lives are' going·to; 
be lost as a result of some of these disclosures. The DCI . 
is by statute charged with the protection of sources and methods 
of intelligence gathering. This absolutely destroys his statute y 
authority. He cannot protect sources and methods if anybody, 
any disgruntled former employee can write a book. 
So.without being specifically familiar, I think there 
is legislation pending, or I know Director Colby has proposed 
\ 
specific legislation to help alleviate this situation. I don't 
hope for, although I would welcome, an official Secrets Act 
such as we have in Britain, but then that is breaking down the 
old system, it's not working so well anymore, but I do believe 
/ 
that we ought to have some way to deter and punish those who 
deal lightly with the national security. 
MR. BELIN: On the subject of the DCI, do you have 
any opinion of the problems that the DCI has as th~ Chief 
intelligenca officer? 
MR. GRAY: Yes. We have wrestled with this problem
