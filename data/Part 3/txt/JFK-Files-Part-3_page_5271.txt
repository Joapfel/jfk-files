'Yherein CIA believed som: of its activities may have exceeded ,}Qh · 
1. ts legal mandate. Portions of this CIA document were 1-1 • :J 
furnished this Bureau and referenced memorandum requested 
documents pertaining to a particula~ Bureau division and/or 
Intelligence Division section be reviewed to identify the 
subject matter and make an assessment as to whether any 
compromise to this Bureau's operation is involved. Those 
portions of the CIA document pertaining to the IS-2 Section . 
of the Intelligence Division are pages 29, 30, 171, 190, /.,,' 
191, 193, 194, 197, 198, 203, 330, and 482. 
A review has been made of the material, supra, and 
the following comments apply: 
Pages 29, 30, under the heading "Merrimac," refer 
to recruitment and handling of "several Agents" to covertly 
monitor dissident groups in the Washington area and states 
one was so successful the '~gent" was turned over to the FBI. 
We have no idea who the "Agent" was and in absence of identi-
fying information no compromise exists to B4reau ope~ati~ns__. 
REC-102 ll ;;L- -/ / t~ -J. 1 ~' Page 171 refers to CIA producing a document titled 
"Restless Youth".in two versions. The version dealing with 
radical students in America was sent only to the President 
and two other high officials. Page 171, itself, in--n-0 J.Va,y __ 
compromises Bureau operations.

Pages 190, 191, also deal with the "Restless Youth" 
document, which disclose the document only went t~e"'-· 11•:b 1e:, ~ 
,~readers, : "a copy may be in the Johnson Library," anarefers 
to updating of the document. These pages, themselves, in no 
way compromise Bureau operations.
