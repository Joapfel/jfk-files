Who was the unidentified man at a meeting with Richard Helms 
on 12 March 1964 who would have known if Oswald had been a 
CIA informant'! 
Answer: 
The unidentified man who accompanied Mr. Helms to the 12 March 
1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then Chief of the Soviet 
• 
Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the Tab 9 memorandum 
of record of this meeting for Mr. Helms' reported remark that 
he and Mr. Murphy were the two Clandestine Services officers 
who certainly would know whether or not Oswald had been an 
agent for CIA in the Soviet Union.·
