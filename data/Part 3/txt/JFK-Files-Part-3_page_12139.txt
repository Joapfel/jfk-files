It is our policy to develop as many assets of all 
types as necessary to provide coverage of the activities of . 
active Polish intelligence personnel. The Manual of Instructions, 
Section 107A, page 3, defines various types of sources (confi­
dential sources, potential security informants, security informants, 
an~ double agents) developed for use in these types of .investi­
gations& The term "potential double agentu is not a status 
defined in the Manual. It is rather an administrative term 
used to distinguish a source being used against an intelligence 
officer when the. source has not as yet been solicited to handle

by the Bureau on 7/7/70. The Manual of Instructions, Section 
io1K, 7, page 13, provides that correspondence in security 
informant and potential security informant cases should be 
strictly limited to the administra~ive handling of the informant 
·and should not contain information more properly furnished under 
the substantive case caption. The six-month justification for 
the subject's status as a potential security informant (per SAC 
Letter 68-47, 8/20/68) is contained in WFO letter 1/19/71. 
The relationship of Bokinsky to Klasa is developing 
in a normal pattern and at a pace consistent-with avoiding 
• suspicion that he is under our control. Bureau supervision 
has determined this through the case on Klasa, the Polish 
intelligence officer against whom the potential security informant 
is targeted. In th~t regard, a 90-day evaluation letter in the 
Klasa case was submitted by WFO on 9/8/70 which stated that 
attempts were continuing to have the potential security informant 
placed in contact with Klasa. The potential security informant 
was to contactJflas~ and ,advise him of his new employment at 
Fenner Pontiac, Rockville~ Maryland. Again, by 90-day evaluation·
