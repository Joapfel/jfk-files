criteria, do we have a·~egal ·basis for them, and we have guide­
lines, committees which have been established in the Department 
that meet every day on.questions of what is even an overwhelmin 
problem of collection and maintenance of information. What 
do we ·get, why do we get it, what should we do with it. 
• I" feel there is a very active program going on in that 
regard, and I feel· certain that it will continue to make sure 
that we are aware of everything and take appropriate action. 
Sena.tor Schweiker:~-Iwonder if.you might share some of 
these with.the staff so that we can have an advantage of taking 
a look at those, too. I am glad to·see this being made. 
Mr. Adams. I would have to secure·-the approval of the 
Attorney General.on the guidelines. He did tell the House 
Committee which originally raised the question on maintenance o 
information, that once we get something and they _are nearing 
completion in th~ Department, that he does intend to take it 
up with Congress. So I am sure there would be no problem at 
that point.in bringing it to this Committee.as well. 
Senator.Schweiker. Because.it.seems to me this is where 
the problems in the past have arisen, in not having clearly 
defined or maybe if you measure it -- you can measure it in 
terms of today's standards versus standards of before, but I 
think this is the crux of it.
