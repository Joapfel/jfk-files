files of 0MB, it is interesting to note that back in the 1950s 
there were some 45 people examining the programs of the Veteran' 
Administration, and they were examining them then in a way that 
was more like an audit function, because it was possible to do 
that because we did not have the great number of programs we hav

terms of the size of the budget? It must be what, about ten tim s 
as big? 
MR. O'NEILL: I think it is probably a lot more than 
ten times as big. It has really grown by leaps and bounds. 
guess I do not think so, but it depends very much on one's 
philosophical view as to what 6an be done at the center when 
you have anrexplosion of governmental function. 
My own feeling is that an audit function, and
