l-1R. CORBI!J : I believs you testified that you discusse, 
+-hP· '- ~· sxacut.ive action capability with either 
.l'.v1r.. Dundy or Hr. Ros tow d Did I understand that correctly? 
M.R. BISSELL: 
MR. CORBI't·T: 
11 '+-? as you reca i~-
MR. BISSELL: 
Correct. 
Who ~.-1as it tha"t first raised this subject 
I can't -- I . have n~recollection of 
My belief is that this ·would have come 
up as a subj~ct very probably in conversations between myself 
and Mr. Rosto\•-T, and the r-ea.son I give that as my b·9lief is that 
I had on a nurnber of occasions discussed ,.,.,ri th Mr o Ros tow the 
various kinds, various kinds of capabilities, and especially 
unconventional ones -that the Agency should or might develop. 
At a somewhat later stage, for instance, he asked me and I · 
asked for a small intsrdepartrnsntal group to exarnin2 the ways 
of improving our military capabiliti~s, and his thinking ran 
along the lines of developing these tools of action. And I 
think, therefore, that it is very probable that this came up 
in conversations with-hi~, but which one of us would have 
coined the phrase, for instance, I don't know. 
MR. CORBIH: So far as you recall it, were there any 
plans for such a capability being developed at the Agancy when 
you had your first conversation with him? 
MR. DISSELL: Oh, I'm reasonably certain the answer 
is negative to that.
