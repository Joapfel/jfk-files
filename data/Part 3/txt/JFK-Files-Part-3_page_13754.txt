by contributing both to his security at home and to his capability 
for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base 
crisis, tqe effect of Castro's subversive activities will depend not 
only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the 
Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments 
to take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably 
be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade 
Cuba. 
C. We have examined how Castro's subversive potential would 
be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba: 
(1) virtual wi~p,drawal of support; (2) continuation of eco:&omic 
and military sµpport ranging froi:n present up, to substantially 
increased levefs. We· believe that course (i) would considefably 
reduce Castro's subversive potential, and that the Soviets are 
unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would 
maintain Castro's poten~ialfor subversive action at leastat presi 
ent levels or actually raise it to the • point where he could under­
take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against 
close-in targets. • • • •
