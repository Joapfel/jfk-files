Finallf., legislation may be needed to ma-ke clear that 
.the FBI is not authorized t? conduct investigations of organi­
z~tions or individuals for .the specific purpose of co_mpiling 
.·a body of data to be used in connection with name checks under 
the Federal Employee Security ~rogram. The same principle· - . 
applies to FBI "assi~tance" to the Secret Service,· under the 
present FBI-Secr·et Service agreement. 
A statute must also address the FBI's current practice 
of maintaining an Administrative Index (ADEX) of the prime 
subjects of current domestic ~ntalligence investigaiions. The 
past history of the· FBI's Secu~ity Index and other target lists 
{Key Activists, Agitator Inde:c, key Black Extremists) suggests 
the need to enact legislation banning the compiling of lists 
of persons by the FBI, unless such persons have been arrested 
or convicted for specific crimes and the list is used in con­
necti.on with the investigation of such crimes.
