With regard to press allegations concerning the use 
of polygraph, it was noted that during July 1971 the President 
was alleged to be furious with unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information relative to the SALT Talks as disclosed 
in the New York Times. The President directed a sweeping 
investigation to determine the source of the disclosure and 
this was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and 
others of the White House Staff. 
A subsequent article in the Washington Post dated 
September 3, 1971 stated that a State Department spokesman 
had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department 
employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT Talks 
in July. This statement is not accurate and the Director of 
the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) denied this allegation in a letter 
to the Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations 
had been conducted by another agency. 
As noted in the CIA notes in fact, it was CIA that 
conducted the polygraph examination in conjunction with the 
State Department and the FBI was not involved in any way in 
these polygraph examinations. It is recalled that FBI 
officials had been called to a White House meeting headed 
by Mr. Krogh in which it was indicated we might have to 
conduct some polygraph examinations and were so alerted. A 
subsequent call from the White House to the FBI instructed 
that the FBI polygraph examinations would not be required. 
In view of above, it does not appear the FBI would 
incur any damage to its reputation or recognized use of the 
polygraph in carefully selected criminal and security matters 
in which we have jurisdiction.
