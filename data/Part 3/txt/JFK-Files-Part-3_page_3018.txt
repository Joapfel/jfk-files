whose telephone is being tapped is not ,aware and there is., 
and neither of the two parties talking had· agreed that their 
conv~rsation could be monitored. • 
Senator Mathias. r find that one difficult to accept. 
If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is takin 
place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceiv d 
by the· two people who are talking, ·.in effect they haven't 
consented to my overhearing my conversation·. The;n they consent 
if they believe that I am their friend or theii, a partisan 
of theirs. 
But if they knew in fact that I was an i11formant for 
someone ~lse, they wouldn't.be consenting. 
Mr. Adams. Nell, that's like I believe Senator. Ilart 
·14 raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this 
15 distinction with no difficulty~ but that doesn't mean that 
16 . there may not be some legislative compromise which mig'ht be 
17 addressed.

Senator Mathias. Well, I p~rticularly apprc~iate your 
attitude in being willing to work on these problems because 
I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from 
these hearings, so that we can actually look at the Fourth 
. ~ 22 Amendment as the standard that we. have t•:• achieve. But the 
23 · way we._ g.e.t there is obviously go_ing to ; ,iw -1 lot easier if we 
24 can work toward t)1em together. 
25 r·just have one final question,~£. Chairman, and that
