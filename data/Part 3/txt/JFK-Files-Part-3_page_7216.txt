Intelligence Community might be improved so as to open a new 
era in American intelligence. In this context, I believe this 
Committee may want to focus particularly on the role and pro­
cedures of intelligence in the future as well as in the past • 
. 
First, Mr. Chairman, I believe it essential to clarify 
for the Congress and the people of America, as well as the 
personnel in our Intelligence Community, the authorities, the 
limitations, and the mission of American intelligence. When 
President Eisenhower assumed full responsibility for sending 
a"u-2 over the Soviet Union, and President Kennedy for the Bay 
of Pigs 1 they repudiated in the name of the American people 
the old concept of intelligence being disowned. I am confident 
that our people not only support but insist upon an effective 
intelligence apparatus to protect their security and welfare. 
! believe, however 1 that they want the role of intelligence 
clearly spelled ·out, they want controls adequate to pre-• 
vent abuse, and they also want necessary secrecy protected. 
In my confirmation hearing, I suggested the word "foreign" 
be inserted each time the word 11intelligence 11 appears in the 
charter of the CIA, t:o make.,,prys,:t.al clear its proper function 
~ ·, 
and to end any possible "gray area" in its authority. Legisla­
tion was introduced in th~,last Congress that would do this 
and would also clarify the proper role of the Agency within 
the United States. I welcome such.clarification of our authority
