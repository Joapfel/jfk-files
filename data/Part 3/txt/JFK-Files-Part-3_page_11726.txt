of northern South America, together with the numerous 
territories a·nd independent countries in the West Indies. 
It is essentially a road trip office and affords the Bureau

·upon the Department of State and the Central Intelligence 
Agency for' the handling of our leads. Our Legat, who 
.started out with a semihostile Ambassador, has won the 
latter's respect and has made a gratifying start at

effectiveness of his liaison is demonstrated by his ability
