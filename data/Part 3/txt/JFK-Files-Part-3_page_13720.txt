requirements for ... nimum he had to know that we had 
an agent with this pa;tic\l~:ar access. But he knew about the 
operation,~ Not necessarily so. 
Mr. Johnston. Do you find this consistent with the 
nature of the operation as of November 22nd, 1963? 
AMLASH Case Officer. Explain that. I don't understand. 
What aro you -- what is your question? 
Mr. Johnston. As of November 22nd, 1963, you were now 
9 involved in coup plotting with AMLASH, and were delivering or 
10 planned to deliver the equipment, rifles, sights, explosives, 
11 to assist him in that coup. It seems inconsistent, suddenly in 
12 February, to go back to trying to get espionage information 
13 from him. 
14 AMLASH Case Officer, First of all, I have to address 
15 that question from this point. Receiving a memo from King at 
16 that time d~esn't necessarily mean that we are going to levy 
l'/ the requirements on AMLASH. 
18 Mr. Johnston. Oh, I agree with that. 
19 AMLASH Case Officer. So, to clarify the other part of your 
20 question, that if we needed intelligence after the October 
21 '63 meeting in which he said I'm not going to be strictly a 
22 source for intelligence, I want to do something more for my 
23 country, it would not be in any way out of the orderinary to 
24 ask him to send information that we felt was. required on the 
25 outside.
