was subsequently removed from the Central Staff ~nd he 
rcsig-ncd from tho party in Scptcmbor, 1970. 
·' He is in no way involved with tho DPP, or· other 
extremist activities, at this time nor does ho have any plans 
to resume his association With the BPP, as he feels ''The BPP 
and other organizations are being duped by white intellectual 
revolutionary hobbyists, who are taking advantage of the 
hop~lessnoss and frustrations of the Black community to 
exercise their theori~s on political and social d~mocracy." . 
Junior clnims to have no knowledge of any BPP 
underground, now or in the past~· but admits that :preliminary 
discus$ion regarding an underground'cell of the BPP was had in the 
early development of the Illinois BPP, but that plan like most 
others never got off the ground. 
The BPP was, and is, a big disappointment to Junior 
in thnt they departed from their original concept of neighborhood 
protection against polic~ brutality, to one of international 
identification with communism. He maintained his association 
with the BPP in spite of this change in philosophy because. 
of his respect and confidence in Fred Hampton, who 
rationalized that in order to further the cause of neighborhood 
control they 9dneed the financing and good will of governments opposE' 
to people oppression, no matter where these people were. 
Junior feels that the BPP is dead in Illinois and 
blames its demise to its ident if icat ion with communism and 
coalitions with white revolutionary groups . 
. 
He has three things to show for his membershi'p in the 
BPP; (1) probation on the Federal Firearms charge, (2) three 
years probation on State narcotics case (which he claims was a 
frame by police, but. to which he entered a plea, "as part of a ! 
donl", nt .the urgoncy of his BPP attorney); and· (3) an outs:tanding
