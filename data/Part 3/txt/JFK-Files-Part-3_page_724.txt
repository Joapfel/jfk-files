Was contact with the police 
formal or informal? 
Contact was personal or telephonic 
contact and at one time, informa-
tion furnished to individual officers 
was confirmed by letter to the 
Ch:Ef of Police. It is not re-
·called if this was the policy 
-during the time COINTELPRO was 
assigned to me. 
What happened to SA Roy Burns? 
He was transferred to the Butte, 
Montana Field Offi~e. 
Did he do anything wrong? I 
understand Agents were sometimes 
transferred to Butte as a disci­
plinary measure. 
SA Burns wanted to be transferred 
to Butte and requested the trans­
fer. The Special Agent in.Charge 
(SAC), Mr. Evans, ,,ms transferred 
there and may have helped SA 
Burns get moved there. 
How old is Bob Baker: 
Probably 51 or 52 years old •.
