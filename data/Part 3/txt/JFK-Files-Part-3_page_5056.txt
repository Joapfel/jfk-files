This will confirm our conversation on J 
November 26, 1975, wherein you authorized the Bureau 
to use a videotape recording of your n1ive 11 telecast 
concerning the appearance of Deputy Associate Director 
James B. Adams before the Church Cor.unittee. You 
indicated that this was authorized for the exclusive 
viewing by FBI personnel. 
This is to advise you that the videotape 
of ttr. Adams' testimony is being restricted solely 
to FBI personnel. We certainly appreciate your 
consideration in this regard. Thank you for this 
authority.
