On April 28 I wrote to you concerning certain allegations 
contained in Newsweek magazine pertaining to the removal from 
the FBI of certain "personal and confidential" or "official and 
confidential" files belonging to former Director J. Edgar 
Hoover. The Select Com.mi ttee did not receive any aclu1owledgment 
or :Cespon;:;e to -the letter- until one month later on May 20, at 
which time we received a memorandum from the FBI. That memo­
randum. was unsigned and stated, in essence, that the FBI had no 
knowledge of the matter although a former employee might. A 
copy of my letter of April 28, the FBI memorandum and a letter 
of transmittal are attached. 
As a result of conversations between members of my staff 
and. representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBI, the 
Select Coni.mi ttee understood that the May 20 memorandum ended the 
matter and that neither the Department nor the Bureau intended 
to investigate further. We made it clear that we would proceed 
with our investigation. In its May 14 comprehensive request of 
your Department, the Committee had already specified several items 
(items 21-23 of Appendix C) related to the so-called 
11
0fficial 
and Confidential 11 files which you had described in your testimony 
of February 27, before the House Judiciary Committee. Further­
more, members of our staff have interviewed a number of persons 
knowledgeable about the files maintained by Miss Helen Gandy, 
Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover, part of which apparently were 
the 110fficial and Confidential" files which you had described 
in your testimony. 
On June 8 an article appeared in the New York Times ind' 
ing that the Department of Justice was undertaking an invest
