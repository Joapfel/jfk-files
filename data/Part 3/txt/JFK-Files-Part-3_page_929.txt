STUDY OF FBI PROGRAN.iS AND POLICIES 
Reference is made to your letter Of December 5, 1973, 
captioned as above. 
I fully support the idea of a study being launched for the . 
purpose of considering the need for additional legislation to enable 
the FBI to counter violence in the time of crisis such as existed at the t 
.time the FBI implemented the COINTELPRO - New Left. ~-~ , 
~ ~ \?'-. 
As you know, the FBI has conducted an in-depth study ~ . 9 ~'\ 
of the scope of FBI jurisdiction and authority and it was concluded , G.i M \J 
that add~tional legislation is needed to enable us to more fully ~ I~ , __ , 
discharge our responsibilities relating to the national security. , .::::_ 
Copies_ of this sµidy have been furnished to the Department. ::,-.... \ . ,

As for the general study of programs and policies of the -...s ::S 
FBI. which was initiated by _former Attorney General Richardson and I 
former Deputy Aii:orney General Ruckelshaus, we have completed ~ 
compiling most of the inform~.tion requested. However, as pointed 
·out during our meeting on-December 5, 1973, information requested • 
in item No. 'l relating to Investigative Techniques was so broadly ~ 
requested by Mr. Ruckelshaus th~tt it encompasses extremely sensitive 0 
foreign intelligence collection techniques. Such information is· so o 
closely held in the ·FBI that it is handled on a strictly need-to-know basis. ~o 
We therefore do not feel that the information shO"uld be included in a 
study of this type which will be beyond the control of the FBI. M z
