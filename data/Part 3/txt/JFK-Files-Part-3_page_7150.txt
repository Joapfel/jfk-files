RE: SENSTUDY 75 
62-116395 
Attached is a copy of the paper Colby provided to the White 
House responsive to this request. It does encompass recom­
mendations of member agencies of the Group including the FBI. 
At a subsequent meeting Mr. Colby had.with unidentified 
persons at the White House, the above list was . cussed. Colby 
pommended the Intellig nee Community had ~-~:?·tJ2ns.J~~~y

(B) hav~- the President refuse\to authorize the release of such 
information~ presumably through the exercise of Executive Privilege, 
or (C) the President could call_ t_h~ 11!,~_jQri t.y ==tt1d:-mlpQr.i.t.y. ,·1e~ders 
of the congressional committee-to the White House, furnish to them 
the answer to the question with the added caveat that they were 
the only persons being informed of the answers and, therefore, 
would be personally accountable for any leak of information. 
Representatives of the White House were not very enthusiastic to 
the option~ put forth by Mr. Colby and indicated that they would 
be calling a meeting at the White House of senior officials of 
the Department of Defense, Justice Department, CIA and the FBI 
to review what position the Intelligence Community should take 
in responding to a request for extremely sensitive and highly 
classified information. 
(3) Members of the Group were allowed to read an 
internal memorandum from Mr. David W. Bel,t'in, Executive Director 
of the Commission on CIA Activities Within the u. s. (The Rockefeller 
Commission), to Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President. 
This memprandum reports the results of a conversation between 
Mr. Bellin and Mr. William Miller, Chief of Staff for the SSC. 
The memorandum revealed that Miller believes that within two weeks 
his staff will be in three-quarters gear. He plans to have a total 
staff of about 40, 10 to 12 of whom will be lawyers. The initial 
. work of the staff will concentrate on a review of documents, 
~ 
interviews, and what Miller called "depositions." Miller does not 
plan to have any hearings of the SSC for several months and believes 
the September deadline could not be met, rather that the investiga­
tion would take at least the rest of the year.
