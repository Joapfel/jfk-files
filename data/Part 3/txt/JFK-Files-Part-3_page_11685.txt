I COMMUNIST INFLUENCE OF BLACK EXTREMIST GROUPS 
100-442529 
This intensification was initiated in August, 
1964. The subject matter was previously reported in a 
subsection of the Communist Party report,·but the volume 
and importance of this information made it necessary to 
follow this communist influence in a separate investigation. 
This investigation includes not only the influence of the 
Communist Party but also that of the Trotskyite groups, 
splinter groups and others including the New Left. 
• The ov-erall objective in this and related 
investigations is to protect the internal security of 
the United States by submitting information relating to 
possible Federal violations to the Attorney General for 
Drose.cuti.on .... We also have the responsibility to develop .a;: - ~ -
intelligence information and disseminate to interested 
Government agencies. Additionally, we tak~ measures to 
neutralize the communist influence in the black extremist 
field whenever feasible. 
. Reports are submitted quarterly and t~e inv·esti--
gation is 'evaluated upon receipt of each report. Pertinent 
information is disseminated to the White House and the 
Attorney General. 
The year 1970 saw continued influence by 
communists and other subversives in extremist groups. 
In fact, the communist attempts to influence the black 
extremist Black Panther Party were so insistent that the 
Panthers have become_wary of the motives of the Communist 
Party. This has not diminished in any way the Communist 
Party's efforts to influence and support the Black Panther 
Party,. the communist tactic being to support the Panthers 
whether they want it or not.
