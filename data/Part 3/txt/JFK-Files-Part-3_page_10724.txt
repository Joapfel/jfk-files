This new counterintelligence effort will take advantage 
of c~r. experience with a variety of sophisticated techniques 
succ~ssfully applied against the Communist Party, USA, and related 
organizations since 1956. Primarily, we.intend t~~-~to pupJic -~ 
scrutiny the devious maneuvers and duplicity of the hate groups; i\ 
t.2 f.rustrat~_any_.e:f:f.or.ts or plans they may have to consolidate l}· 
fl t~eir forces; to discourg,g~ their recruitment of new or youthful v 
adherents; and t.9 di~runt or eliminate their efforts to circumvent 
,or violate the law. Our counterintelligence efforts against hate 
_groups will be closely supervised and coordinated to complement 
·our expanded intelligence investigations directed at these 
organizations. 
We are :furnishing general instructions to 17 field 
) offices (14 Southern offices responsible for active investigation 
o:f 17 Klan groups and 6 hate organizations, and New Yorl~, Chicago 
and Baltimore, \<l10 have active investigative responsibilities 
for one hate organization each) relating to the administration 
and prompt enactment of this new counterintelligence program. 
Briefly, these instructions require the 17 participating off.ices 
to submit to the Bureau on or before 10/15/64 an analysis of 
possible counterintelligence operations, including any specific 
recommendations for action. Thereafter (commencing 1/1/65) the 
part:ts5ipating offices will submit a 90-day status letter setting
