··individuals and groups in the United States because of 
possible security implications. The-report indicated the 
FBI possessed considerable information concerning many 
individuals and groups but this information had been obtained 
primarily with security r~ther than intelligence considerations· 
in mind and was not normally given the kind of interpretation 
or dissemination that intelligence required if it was to be 
properly used. It was also noted the FBI was, in cases where 
it had a security interest, reluctant on security grounds to 
have intelligence exploitation by outside agencies. The general 
result of this situation, according to the report, was that an 
important source of intelligence was not being fully exploited.· 
The report noted that the question of the 
exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign groups and· 
individuals in the United States was a clear example where 
the Intelligence Advisorr Committee, with the FBI being added 
~as a member, should establish principles and rules for 
coordination. 
In diccucaing the admini~+.~~~ive bandlin~ of 
espionage and counterespionage matters within the CIA, the 
report noted the FBI was charged with all counterespionage 
responsibilities in the United States except those affecting 
. personnel of the armed services, The Dulles Commission 
· •.-· • . recommended the counterespionage activities of CIA should be 
increased in scope and emphasis and that closer liaison in 
. this field should be established with the FBI. 
The only effect the Dulles Report had on the FBI 
was its inclusion as a member of the Intelligence Advisory 
Committee by amendment to HSCID Number l dated July_7, 1949.
