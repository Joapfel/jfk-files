coordinated. This would be most important if the 1 
individual in any way was connected with or associated 
with an intelligence serv~c~. 
2) DOD is anxious to have freedom to assess 
and recruit Bloc diplor.iats not known to be engaged in 
intelligence activity. On the surface, this does not 
appear to pros~nt a problem, but realistically speaking 
it is impossible for us to know that a Soviet diplomat, 
not known to be engaged in intelligence activity one 
day, appears on the scene the followine week as an agent 
or coopted agent. To give CIA wide latitude in this field 
could. create a truly undesirable mess. \'le believe that 
if CIA is permitted to move on such targets it should be 
done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination.

deficiencies, such as lack o:f discipline,(poor internal • 
coordination, unsatisfactory records, all\introduce head­

years. \ 
4) There continues to be an element of mistrust 
and misunderstanding between the two organizations because 
of the historical reasons described above .. 
5) Continuing laclt of one. agency's appreciation 
.for the other's objectives, responsibilities and operational 
philosophy. 
6) The absence of a clearly defined Bureau policy 
and objectives in the field of foreign intelligence collec­
tion. CIA really does not know the nature and the extent 
of our interests, and consequently this lends.to confusion 
and misunderstanding. : , ., ..
