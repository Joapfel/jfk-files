On 3/7/75 Mr. Mintz and I called on Senator Church and his 
staff director, Bill Miller, to further discuss the procedures for 
investigating and clearing staff employe-es -octne- Commfffee;-·particular ly 
where infornration -might be_._deveioped raising a question as to the propriety 
of a clearance. It had previously been approved that the FBI would conduct 
the background investigations, furnishing the results to Senator Church, 
and after his determination that the individuals met the required criteria 
for access t0 classified information he would notify CIA of his determination 
and intent to employ the individual involved, at which time CIA would grant 
the necessary clearance based on the certification by Senator Church. 
In discussions between CIA and FBI representatives, we raised 
the question as to whether CIA would review the results of the investigation 
prior to granting clearances and CIA representatives indicated they did 
not intend to and were reluctant to inquire of Senator Church as to whether 
they could be furnished the results of any investigations involving derogatory 
information. 
In discussing·this matter with Senator Church, I inquired whether 
he had any objection to our bringing to the attention of CIA any questionable 
cases in order that CIA representatives, who have the responsibility of 
granting the actual clearances, would be in a position to advise and counsel 
'
with _senator. Church on those individual cases. He had a?sol:1-tely no objection 
to this and, 1n fact, felt there should be an open commun1cat10n between 
FBI, CIA and his Committee to insure that no one was appointed and cleared 
who did not measure up in every respect from a security standpoint. 
• I discJssed with him the particular case of Stanley Rawson Sloan, 
the results of wrt'ich I had brought for delivery to Senator Chureh . .Sloan was
