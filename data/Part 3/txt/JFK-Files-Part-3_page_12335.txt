Attached is a copy of the SSC document request 
served upon IRS which I received on June 3, 1975. Since 
some of the items may relate to DOJ/FBI functions, I 
thought you should be aware of the scope of the request, 
as a matter of information. 
The Topical Task Forces may need to be alert to 
this request as a matter of prospective coordination.
