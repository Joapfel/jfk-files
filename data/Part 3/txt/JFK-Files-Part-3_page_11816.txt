I (6) The Special Agent complement is:2i including 
·the Section Chief and Number One Man, an increase of one 
since the last inspection. The Division was reorganized 
December 17, 1970, on the basis of approximate case load 
per Supervisor -0f 279. This figure was based on the 
October 1, 1970, case load figures. As of January 1, 1971, 
the case load stood at 349 per Supervisor and a request for 
two additional Special Agent Supervisors was approved. The 
opening of cases on Black Student Union-type organizations 
and leaders thereof on college campuses across the Nation 
in December, 1970, showed up in our case load figures during 
the early months of 1971. These cases have been handled and 
closed by the end of the 1970-1971 school year. As of 
August 1, 1971, the case load stood at 5,428 or an average 
of 271 per Supervisor assigned. These cases represent hard­
core extremist individuals and organizations and require 
extensive supervision. 
Additional factors dealing with the adequacy of 
p2rso:nnel . is -a specie.l the:t i:•ras receiYed in t-l')e Se<::'tion on 
May 29, 1971; involving the killing of two police officers 
i~ New York City on May 21, 1971, which the President instructed 
the FBI to investigate and solve. The supervision of this 
investigatio~ occupies the full time of one Supervisor. In 
addition, one Supervisor was placed on loan to the Nationalities 
Intelligence Section on July 19, 1971, and a second Supervisor 
. was placed' on loan to that Section on August 13, 1971. 
-With the return of these two Supervisors to the 
Section, I consider the supervisory personnel as adequate. 
• There are several factors that would :indicate that 
our work in tle black extremist field will increase in the 
innnediate future. With the reopening of school in the• 
innnediate future, we.can foresee an influx of cases involving 
' extremist Black Student UNion-type groups and leaders thereof.
