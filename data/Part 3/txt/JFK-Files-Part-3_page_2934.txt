occasion, be a designation of -a special task force made up, 
perhaps, of division heads. That _is most unlikely, but it is 
handled internally at present. 
Mr. Smothers. Would these internal determinations be 
5 reviewed by Justice, or do you think that is a necessary 
6 step? 
7 I guess what we are searching for here is, first of all, 
8 I think you answered that, well, to what extent does the 
9 Bureau police itself,· and then secondly, is the Department of 
10 Justice involved in the police determinations?

the assertion that only the higher up officials who ordered 
the action against King should be the subject of investigation 
and maybe prosecution? 
How does the interplay work there between you and Justice? 
Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those 
activities which we construe as imp~oper or possibly. illegal. 
There is a possibility that the Department, having been·advised 
of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own 
investigating, and ~his is something that we feel is a 
decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we 
have within our own organization sufficient capability to 
handle that . But we do not protest it . It is handled 
independently of us. 
Mr. Smothers. Thank you.
