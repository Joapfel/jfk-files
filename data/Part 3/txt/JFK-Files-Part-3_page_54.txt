SUBJECT: 
NOT TO CONTACT LIST 
The Not To Contact list is a card index of 33i in-
dividuals whose statements or attitude,generally when contacted 
on official business, gave rise to doubts as to the advisability 
of contacting them again. When a person was placed on the 
Not To Contact list, the Field Office covering the residence 
or occupation or both was advised that this particular individual 
should not be contacted without prior Bureau authority. Thus, 
the Not To Contact list did not prohibit future contact, but 
specified it could be made only after clearance with the Bureau. 
Examples of the type of individuals on this list
