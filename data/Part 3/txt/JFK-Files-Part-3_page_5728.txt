c. In instances in which civi•l rig!:ts :,,ay he i:.volvt>d or in which 
a racial incident m:.v involYe a.tact wi:icil constitutes a criminal 
violation.over which-~he Bureau has jurisdiction, be guided by 
instructions co .. cer:iing the specific violation. Likewise, if the 
incident involves a oombing or attempted bombing having religious or 
:nacial aspects •or•,im.·olvir.g a religious or educational institution, 
be guided by the specific instructions relating to bombings and 
attempted bombings. 
d. In instances in which some subversive influence is determined to

the specific subversive influence involved-. 
e. CAUTION. By their very nature racial matters are extremely delicate 
and great care must be exercised in the approach to.such matters. 
Procedures 
a. Information dealing ~ith general racial matters, such as proposed 
or actual activities of individuals, officials, committees, 
legislatures, organizations, etc., in the racial ·field, must be 
f.urnished to· the Bureau expeditiously by whatever means of comn.unicati:on 
is warranted by the specific najure of the information and the cir­
cumstances i"nvol ve,j,. 
b. Pertinent information bearing on general racial matters which 
,would not otherwise be availabl.e to· interested. liovernment agencies• 
iuch as that obtained through sources and informants, and which is 
of such a nature that it would normally.be furnished to the Bureau 
by letter or airtel must be transmitted to the Bureau in form 
suitable for dissemination. In general, .pertinent information r. 
bearing on general racial matters appearing in newspapers or \. 
pub1ications need not be fur~ished to the Bureau in form suitable 
for dissemir:atio:i. In such iastances o.erely submit copt<?s of 
pertinent news paper a7."ticles and publications to the Bureau• Of 
course, if such data is•clearly of a nature as to require contacts 
with .appropriate sources, such as informatjon of unusual local or 
national importance, submit same expeditiously in form suitable for 
dissemination. Concisely summarize the pertinent a~ticle and include 
therein the results of contacts with appropriate sources .• 
c. Wa,intain contact with per~inent informan~s and sources and keep 
Bureau and local intelligence agencies advised of any additional 
pertinen~ developments. Unless circurastances clearly indicate 
necessity for more expeditious handling,furnish such additional data 
to the Bureau promptly in form suitable for dissemination. 
d. In many instances situations involving members of the Negro and 
Caucasian races result in violations of criminal statutes over which 
the Bureau has. investigative jurisdiction. While such matters are 
to•be handled in accordance with instructions pertaining to the 
substantive violation involved, the Bureau h~s the additional 
responsibility of disseminating pertinent information concerning 
any racial aspects of such situations to appropriate Government 
officials and agencies that do not ordinarily receive reports in 
criminal matters. Therefore, the submission of a. report ccncerning 
the criminal violation involved alone is insuf~i6ient. In general, 
pertinent data concernin& tht racial situation involved must be 
submitted immediately to Bureau in form suitable for dissemination 
in order that it may reach interested a~encies as soon as possible.
