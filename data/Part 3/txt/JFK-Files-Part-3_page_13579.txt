of information. 
MR. LEMNITZER: Would it include proposed covert 
operatio~s specifically? 
MR. DONOHUE: It would include in most cases a covert 
" action operation that would be continui~g during the coming 
fiscal year. · 
MR. LEMNI1rZER: New ones? 
MR. DONOHUE: Generally it would not include new ones, 
because•it would be nine months in advance at least of the 
beginning of the fiscal year, and it would be doubtful that 
new ones would be known that much in advance. In most cases 
the covert action projects would begin in a shorter time frame 
than that, and they would not be budgeted for in advar1ce.
