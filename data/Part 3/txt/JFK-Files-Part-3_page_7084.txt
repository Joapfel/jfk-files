Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
I 
As a result, Mr. Mintz and Mr. Cregar will attend the meeting 
of the Group on Wednesday, 3/19/75, at CIA Headquarters, at 
10:30 a.m. 
Senator Towers had requested the Bureau to conduct 
a counteraudio sweep of his personal office inasmuch as he 
anticipated having sensitive conversations in his office: con­
cerning the business of the SSC. Mr. Cregar was asked to raise 
the question of a counteraudio sweep during the executive session 
to get an expression from the Group as to whether counteraudio 
/
sweeps should be done. Both Mr. Silberman and Mr. Buchen felt 
it was desirable to conduct such sweeps and strongly recommended 
that they be done. No commitment was made as to who would do 
the sweeps at the time. However, after consultation with Assistant 
Directors Wannall and White, Mr. Adams and Mr. Callahan, it was 
agreed that the Bureau should do the sweeps inasmuch as it was 
a domestic matter. Mr. White indicated that he did have the 
personnel and the equipment to conduct such sweeps. As a result 
of that decision Mr. Clarke was telephonically advised that the 
Bureau would conduct counteraudio sweeps of the personal offices 
of both the Senate and House Select Committees providing such 
was in accord with the desires of both Committees. Our Legisla­
tive Liaison is currently contacting both Senator Church and 
Congressman Nedzi to confirm that both Committees desire this 
l
counteraudio check. It is to be noted that these sweeps will not 
include the outer offices of the Senators or Congressmen and will 
not include the offices of the employees of both staffs. 
ACTION: 
For information and record purposes.
