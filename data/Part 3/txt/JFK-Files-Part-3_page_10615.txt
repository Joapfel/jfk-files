Xlonvocation of United Klans of Am2rica at Birrningh~rt on 
9/5-6/64~ This is to be sold to m~mbers for $2 each and 
there is apparently cons~d~rable demand for it. Since it is 
not apparent to the h4"1i ti~~ that it has anything to do 
with 11 the Klan," it ·is expacted that members.will wear it 
openly as a secret recognition signal~ If it does become 
widely adopted and worn, consideration should then be given to 
giving widespread publicity to the fact of what it represents~ 
This should have the result of discouraging some persons who 
do not want th-air Klan 1112mbership publicly known.,

way of discour 9ging m~rtbership, or causing existing members 
to withdraw, is to establish that someone in the organization 
is g~tting rich off it, or embezzling the proceeds~_ Charlotte 
is endeavoring to develop information along these lines, hut 
not~ing specific has yet bee~ developed.
