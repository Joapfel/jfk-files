I do not see how it would 
because there would be no way 
anyone could determine whether 
or not Wallace was, in fact, 
cooperating with the FBI. He 
was probably removed by the 
BPP as a precautionary measure. 
I cannot recall whether or 
not Wallace "was removed while 
I was coordinator of the program. 
Was COINTELPRO successful? 
I was not too impressed with 
its success in San Diego while 
I had it assigned to me be­
cause it was a new program 
and it took some time to get 
it established and working. 
Most of the success was probably 
due to information obtained 
regarding criminal violations, 
mostly loca1 in nature, which 
was furnished to local law 
enforcement officers, causing 
the arrest of BPP members. 
This would have be-en done 
whether or not we had a 
COINTELPRO. It was necessary 
to prepare a letter to the 
Bureau asking authority to 
take action and then wait 
for a reply authorizing the 
activity. Many times suggested 
COINTELPRO activity suggestions 
would be turned down.
