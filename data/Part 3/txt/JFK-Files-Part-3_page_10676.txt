be concerned about t_he picture they present to the public con­
cerning racial matters. 
r~ view of the previously expressed desires of the 
officials of the Knoxville Police Department to maintain· 1~acial 
har!nony in Knoxville, it is believed that ar1~angements could 
be· nade with the Chief of Police to have one or more squad·cars 
visible in the vicinity of t.he meeting hall of the Knoxville 
:::~L:.ve:rn on the nights of their rn.eetings. It is believed that 
if the members s2:w these squad c2.rs parked _in the vicinity on

and would 2.ct as a de"'ce1·rent_ to their activities, as well as

licanse :plate v;ith a confederate flag metai insignia or ·with· 
a =acsimile. 0~ occasions, both the rear and front license 
plates have been obscured or usually only the front license 
obscured. It is believed through the-cooperation of the High­
•::ay Pat1~01 on a command level, that patrolmen might be assigned 
to the area whei~e the meeting is held so that if the klan . 
r.181:1.~ers le2ving the :meeting continue to have their license plate 
00scui~ed 7 .they may be arrested for violation of the state law 
prohibiting such. 
In connection with the informant program of the Knoxville 
Office, certain persons are interviewed to ascertain their 
cooperation and their potentials as a possible informant .. 
It is believed that in such cases where antagonism is shown 
to the Age::.1ts t contact, that a later anonymous call might be
