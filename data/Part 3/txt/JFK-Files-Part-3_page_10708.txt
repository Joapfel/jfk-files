Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of 
· information between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions 
in that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information 
are brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which 
I each Division is-primarily rt:sponsible. However, it ::H~E:mf:;th~ 1·eal issu~ today 
just as in 1958, is where does the weight of the interest lie in the racial question. 
In 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, accorciing to 
information available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had 
racial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although 
the Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also, 
in 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations. ,,.. 
·" Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic 
Intelligenc~ Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest 
in the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be 
exploiting it to an ever-incr·easing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights 
and other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite 
need for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as 
to keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more 
properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division. . . 
Analysis was made by Ihspector relative to coverage of the Klan and other 
hate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of 
pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed 
the field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key 
Klan figures, lave interviewed at least once all known Klan members{ all Klan . .• 
leaders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations 
have been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A 
weekly progress airtel is being obtained from field conce~ning inf?rman~ development. 1·· 
However undoubtedly additional coverage is needed particularly m the Klaverns 
t have' been formed since the ~ivil rights bill passed. There is no questio~ about -.
