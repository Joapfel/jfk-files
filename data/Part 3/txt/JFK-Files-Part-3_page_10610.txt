continued~ This has a thTee £old purposeo It lets the klansmen 
know the FBI is interested and will be around. It also enables 
FBI to know frd-,-- '{.:,hereabouts on that day, become better .

r2garding the person being interviewed. ·In several instances 
during such interviews· it has been possible to convert certain 
kl.2.nsmen into informants. During inte1.-views of klansmen who 
az-e compkte],y unco-operative and who want to know how we got 
their name and why they are being interviewed ·we can flip 
through the cards and pick out a name of another klansma; who 
is completely unco-operative. This is a disruptive tactic 
·which can breed suspicion among themselves o
