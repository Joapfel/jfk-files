MR. KELLEY: 
QUESTION·:: 
• • 
who gave the OK. Did this come from President Johnson . • . 
or Pr¢sident Nixon or was this a decision made by Attorney 
General ..... 
This matter will be discussed in subsequen~ hearings 
and in reports, and further than what I have stated, I 
cannot comment. 
Mr. Kelley, were these directed against Americans or 
foreign persons? 
I would prefer not at this· point to .make any comments 
further and particularly not in particularity as to who 
may have been the ones against whom they were directed. 
Well, were they all conducted in this country o~ were 
some conducted overseas? 
I know of none overseas. 
,. 
Sir, going back to prior to 1966, why was the procedure 
changed in 1966? 
By virtue of the feeling of Mr. Hoover that, under the 
then-prevailing philosophy ·and the feeling that possibly 
in the context of the times, this was not a viable 
procedure--they were stopped. It was Mr. Hoover's 
decision. 
Sir, can we infer that there were quite a number, a 
large number, of burglaries prior to 1966, but fewer 
since then?
