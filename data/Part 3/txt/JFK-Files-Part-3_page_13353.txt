STURGIS: Yes, sir, Mr. 01s.en., l am ~i:lli:ng to take a polograph 
on tfre subject 0£ ei~her conspiTacy, on 111r·part or the attempt on the 
attempt to assassination of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King, 
Robert Kennedy, or any official of the United States Government. Plus, 
I am willing to take a polygraph on what I have just told yau about 
Bernie Barker.asking me about an assassination attempt. 
OLSEN: You're talking about these two conversations now that 
you had with. Bernie Barker in which. -- · in about 1961. -- he approached you 
about youF willingness to perfonn an assassination on some unknown person 
at some unknown place? 
STURGIS: 
OLSEN: 
Yes, sir. I'll take a polygraph on that too, if neces.sary. 
Ts there anything else, Frank, that you would like to 
reveal to the Commission, that you would like to talk to the C01mnission about, 
{ relat~ng to the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency in any respect 
whatever? 
STURGIS: Yes, sir. l would like to make this statement. I think 
that there are elements in this country who are trying to destroy the Central 
Intelligence Agency. r believe in order for a country to have some defense 
or to protect our national security we do need an agency like Central Intelli­
gence Agency. r do feel that the!e may be elements within Central Intelligence 
Agency who prop ably who have exceeded their orders and so forth, that may have 
went off on s-ome ·things of their own that probably either their Station Chief 
or sometimes the Case Officer or anyone higher than whoever the.people a~e 
that may have or would want to do certain illegal activities. 
OLSEN: Okay. We are going to have to break again here because we 
are at the end of another belt.on the dictating unit, but I do want to r'Jme 
back to one 0th.er question that I want to ask you on anothe::~ case.
