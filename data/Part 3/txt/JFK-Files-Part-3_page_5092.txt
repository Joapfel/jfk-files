bhis matter pertains to an alleged plot in 
1972-73 to assassinate former Vice President Spiro Agnew 
and the Director of CIA by using two Latin American 
revolutionaries. A CIA informant abroad reported that 
one Elizabeth Boynton Millard, a New York City resident 
known for her Communist associations and her involvement 
with Latin-American revolutionaries, was scheduled "to 
finger" top United States Officials for assassination. 
The plot was allegedly conceived some time prior to 8/19/72, 
in Chile and was to be carried out sometime between 10/25/72 
through 11/7/7:] The FBI investigated this plot thoroughly (S) 
and closed its investigation on 2/2/73, when it was 
concluded that none of the individuals reportedly involved 
had any connection with such activity. 
ASSESSMENT: 
No compromise of an on-going FBI operation. 
RE: Page 00282, "28 October 1970." 
During October, 1970, United States Government 
officials, including Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, who was then 
assigned to The White House, received cryptograms indicating 
bombings would occur in various cities of the United States 
on 11/29/70. The Soviet Military Attache, Washington, D. C., 
received a similar cryptogram reporting United States -
Chinese activities against Russia. The sender of the 
cryptograms was identified and during our investigation 
other government agencies, including CIA, were requested 
to furnish the original cryptograms for fingerprint examination. 
ASSESSMENT: 
No compromise.
