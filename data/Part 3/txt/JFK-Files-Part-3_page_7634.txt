From a survey of the books, 'all books can be removed from the 
library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books 
and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maint..1.ined at FBI 
Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters. 
From the survey, it was determined these books can be_ m~n,taiped ju two roo~s ••••

In the library is a lending library which has about 100 mernbers .. 
These me'mbers pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have thG privilege 
of usiD:g tlie library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, I am proposin 
that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the 
books at the end of that period to Quantico.
