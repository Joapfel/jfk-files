ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
•MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICAN UNIT 
The President and other policy makers have 
a continuing interest in current political matters 
affecting Central and South America. We have provided 
officials in the Executive Branch of the Government 
on a continuing basis with information concerning the 
activities of political figures and leftist groups in 
a number of Latin American nations. Of particular 
significance was information concerning the activities 
of Ar.iiu.J.f.9.....A:rJ,..~g.d4..~o.tj,~~R9.S.~d-J>Anama,n.,ia.n-P..t;._e~sJ...d,e,nj;, 
residing, in Miami, Florida. who is planning the over­
throw of the current Panamanian Government. In an 
effort to provide the President and other policy makers 
with even more such information, we have recently 
expanded our coverage in the Chilean, Peruvian and 
Bolivian fields. 
The unit continues to be successful in 
thwarting plans of militant anti-Castro groups which 
have sought to infiltrate Cuba and to attack ships and 
property of foreign nations eng~ged in trade with Cuba. 
Successful development of key informants who have 
infiltrated anti-Castro groups under Bureau direction 
has enabled the Bu~eau to keep abreast of their activities 
and often to have advance knowledge of the plans of these 
groups enabling us to take appropriate action to prevent 
such activities. An outstanding example of our success 
in this area was the thwarting of two militant anti-Castro 
r attempts in July, -1970, to infiltrate Cuba and the seizure 
of boats, arms, ammunition and miscellaneous military 
equipment valued at $64,500 by u. s. authorities.
