Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of 
I informati. on between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions 
I· m that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information 
I are brought to the attention of each other as they arise from n1atters for which 
each Division is primarily responsible. Howeve1:, ii see.rri::; ihe x·eal issue-today 
just as in 1958, is where does the weight of the interest lie in the racial question. 
1n 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, accorciing to 
information available to tlie Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had 
racial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although 
•. the Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also, 
,1hn 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations. 
I ~ 
, • Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic 
I lntelligenc~ Division that the· Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest 
jn the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed there:in, and appears to be 
' ,exploiting it to an ever-incr·easing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights 
and other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite 
need for an :intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as 
to keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems 1nore 
properly the function of the Dome!3tic Intelligence Division. 
Analysis was rp.ade by Inspector relative to coverage of the Klan and other 
hate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of 
pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed 
the field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on _certain key 
Klan figures, lave in~erviewed at least once aJl known Klan members(" all Klan . • 
.leaders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations 
bave been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A 
weekly progress airtel is being obtained from field conce~ning inf?rman~ development.
