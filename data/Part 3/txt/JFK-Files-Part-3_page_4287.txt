MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RE: tyoUNG LORDS PARTY =7 
LINTERNAL SECURITY -.YOUNG LORDS PARTYJ 
Reference is made to this Bureau's memorandum dated 
November 6, 1970, requesting authority to reinstitute telephone 
surveillance at the[National Office of the Young Lords Party (YLP), 
1678 Madison Avenue, New York City2ffor a period of three 
months. You granted such authority on the same date. 
Construction in the vicinity of the(y•LP National Offic;-/ 
prevented installation of the telephone surveillance due to an 
unforeseen effect upon telephone company facilities-necessary 
,for the installation. While. awaiting solution of the technical 
problems, our New York Office determined relocation of the[YLP 
National Offic~was imminent. The[YLP National Office is now 
located at 202 East 117th Street, New York City] 
• [YLP]continues to esp~use a doctrine of revolution. 
Past telephone surveillances of itsliiational and Bronx, 
New York, office~enabled us to identify many members and pro­
vided advance information concerning demonstrations and other 
violence. It is expected reinstitution of telephone surveillance 
of the [National Office, YLP) will again provide valuable data 
of this nature. 
The monitoring of this surveillance will be conducted 
in accordance with instructions contained in your letter dated 
July 14, 1969, captioned "Electronic Surveillances."
