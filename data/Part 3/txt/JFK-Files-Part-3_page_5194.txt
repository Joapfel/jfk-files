H. WO]WARTH: I am extremely aware pf the need to 
develop Cis and have had a total of 
nine PCis in San Francisco during the 
time I have been in ~a~ ~rancisco • 
. 
. I arrived in the san'Francisco Division, 
7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to be noted 
that I developed CG 7215c in 1967. This in.fo~mant had either 
worked for or was close to the top men of org~nized crime in Chicago, 
Miami and New Orlea_-r1s. At one time, through ?-·court order, this 
informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so 
information could. be obtained in a.n Obstruction of Justice case. 
I had at least one other informant while I was handling the 
above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicagoc 
The potential of the four PCis which I 
opened ·on 8/24/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears 
promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop 
into a CI in the near future. 
. My assignmentci i11 tan h::·~ci!=c0 hB-V~ 
been :mainly !TSP - FBW investigations which a.re complicated and 
·involve reviewing recopds and interviews with banks, brokerage 
house and other business officials. +~had one ex~c llent 
opportunity .to develop a good CI when~LOUIS ¥".LARDER Las Vegas 
furnished me on 2/27/70 and 3/2/70 the o~iginal i ronnation which 
led to the recovery of $650;000 worth or Avco Thrift Certificates 
at· 'Las Vegas. ~ARDEEVa.s recently as 10/27 /70, furnished me 
valuable in.formation. He cannot be developed into a CI because 
he lives in Las Vegas and is under Federal indictment in Miami. . . 
my part happenedo
