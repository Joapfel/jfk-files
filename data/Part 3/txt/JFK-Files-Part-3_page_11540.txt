to the documents in question and has additionally revealed his early change from 
"hawk" to 11dove." It has also revealed his contacts with individuals at high 
levels in Federal Government attempting to persuade them to put before American

Investigation at Boston has uncovered activity by Neil and ~'¾.~fill 
Sheehan 1 employees of "The New York Times," in late March, 1971. This 
activity has included extensive details of sessions where duplication of portions 
of the "McNamara Study" were involved. Revealed have been details identifying 
the printing companies utilized by the Sheehans, considerable travel between 
these companies and apartments available to or utilized by Ellsberg. We have 
• uncovered extensive detail of Ellsbergts contacts from his Cambridge, 
. Massachusetts, residence with members of the news media. Also revealed has 
been contact by Ellsberg with factions of the New Left and anti-Vietnam peace groups. 
We have recently expanded our investigation in attempt to uncover details 
of dissemination of the "McNamara Study" by Ellsberg to other newspapers in 
which articles appeared attributed to the "McNamara Study. 11 This investigation 
has revealed at least three newsmen from the Washington, D. C., bureaus of 
'the newspapers involved were in the Boston and/or Cambridge area during the week 
immediately prior to Ellsbergts surrender on 6/28/71. -rne have learned that at 
least one newspaper had been contacted by an unknown individual in Boston who had 
offered the "McNamara Study" instructing that if the newspaper involved wished to 
avail itself of the offer, the classified documents could be picked up in Boston 
after contacting- a given telephone number in that area for more detailed instructions. 
We are pursuing this facet of the investigation vigorously to pin down exact activities 
of the newspaper personnel involved and when this is done, we contemplate 
.interviewing them for additional details. • 
Extensive investigatfon has been afforded the possibility that Ellsberg 
benefited from considerable assistance from other individuals in his attempt to 
disseminate the "McNamara Study" to the news media. Along these lines we have. 
detected early reports of Ellsbergts cooperation with elements of the War Resistors 
League and have identified individuals in that organization described by Ellsberg 
as the principal influences on his change to a militant opposition to the U. S. -
Vietnam policies. Investigation is continuing along these lines to establish if any 
. individuals in these dissident groups may have assisted Ellsberg in his alleged 
violations of the statutes noted.
