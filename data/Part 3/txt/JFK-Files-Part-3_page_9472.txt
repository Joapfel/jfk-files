Memorandum to Mr. Adams 
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc. 
Other minor changes were considered and an effort will be made 
to correct the language so that the agencies will be obliged to make reasonable 
efforts to comply with all Committee requests instead of being required to 
furnish 11all information 11 absolutely. 
Mr. Wilderotter advised on the morning of May 28th that the 
comments described above will be discussed with Frederick Schwarz in an 
effort to finally resolve this matter. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
For information.
