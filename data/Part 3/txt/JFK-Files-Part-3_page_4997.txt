SUBJECT: • DEMCON 
As the Bureau is aware, I" am gravely concerned ov€~ 
the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during 
the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences 
August 26 1 1968 and the days immediately preceding this 
convention. Had the convention occurred within 30 days after 
t~e President made his announcement that he was not going to 
run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started 
in Paris, I feel that we might not haye had serious violence 
as these two occurrences took much of the steam out of many of 
the organizations comprising -Lhe !!New L~ft''. Ti1eir 1:iLce(; Lion 
at that tir.1e was prinrn.rily against President JOHXSOi'.{ and 
i against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their 
:programs following these two announcements. . .. -
' 
It is our observation, however, that these "New Left", 
organizations have now had time to redirect their programs 
and are now concentrating primarily o~ demonstrations and 
activities against Vice President HUi'.lPIIREY, characterized 
by them as the "Dump Humphrey C..tmpaign". The fact that the 
lwar still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis 
to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti-
, Viet Nam. I am thinlcing- particularly of such organizations 
jas the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet 
!Nam, Students for Democratic Society, Student Mobilization 
iCommittee to End the War in Viet Nam and the Youth International 
Party (Yippies).
