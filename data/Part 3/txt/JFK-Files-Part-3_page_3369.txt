Dear General Levi: 1/~-

We have been -asked to chair a special subcommi ¾t~e ~ l 
of the Select Committee on Intelligence which will con- ,tjl I 
centrate on matters relatinq to domestic intelligence rt/V I. 
activities of the Federal government. Our mandate is to ~ 
prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft I 
report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses /J~~ 
by the· FBI and other-domest1c•intelligence agencies; the • J 
causes of such alleged abuses or excesses and recom.mendatioJr ~ , 
which the Committee might make to remedy the problems we t 
have ·uncovered. i 
We are aware o~ the fine work in which your· staff has t 
been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be i 
available to work with the Commit,tee staff on these matters. ( 
However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs i 
to be supplemented in several important respects and there- ' ; 
fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to f 
the FBI for further information which we hope will be 
treated on a priority basis so that the Subcommittee can , 
meet the deadlines set by the full committee. These and i 
future requests which will be handled between the two f 
committee counsel or Mr. Elliff, Domestic Task F9rce Leader, i 
and Mr. Shaheen, Specia'.b,C<?il~sel for Intelligence Coor- i 
dination, will pertain ~J:tem information necessary for i. 
us to formulate 1!1eaning~u~ _r~qommendations an~ to pur~ue / Y f
