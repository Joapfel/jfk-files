Ras CIA had any contact with Marina Oswald and are there any 
CIA records on her not p,reviously turned over to the Warren 
Commission. 
Answer: 
CIA has had no contact with Marina Oswald. Our records show 
that a complete set of HTLINGUAL documents on Marina were 
• turned over by hand to Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI on 
23 November 1963 for use by the FBI in the course of their 
investigations. One other HTLINGUAL document received after 
that date was passed to the FBI in September 1964. To date, 
we have found no record indicating that CIA also passed these 
documents to the Warren Commission; nor do we have any record 
of how they were used by the_FBI during the Warren Commission 
investigations.
