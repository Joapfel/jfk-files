4-E 
of the White House Staff and other highly placed United States Government 
officials began receiving cryptogram messages which, after decryption, 
disclosed implication of bombings of certain major cities on 11/29/70. 
Content of the messages revealed that the writer was privy to intelligence 
information and possibly had knowledge of United States nuclear weapon 
deployment. The receipt of these messages was the object of extreme 
'concern by the recipients and resulted in our investigation. 
Through outstandingly aggressive and imaginative investigation 
and with a dearth of investigative leads, the Los Angeles Office 
successfully identified the typewriter on which the messages were 
being prepared as being located in a library in the..S .. ama.J1~ 4, area. 
Discreet and productive surveillance was conducted, which resulted in 
identification of ,IbP.TT?-..R~<lP.-and his neutralization as a point of anxiety 
and concern on the part of the highest level of officials in the executive 
branch and in the intelligence community. We are now a waiting a 
decision as to prosecution after review of the details of this matter 
by the Criminal Division of the Department. 
The President has noted the paucity of positive intelligence 
information available to him for high-level policy decisions. We 
have recognized our responsibilities in this area through intensified 
coverage in the nationality fields supervised by this Unit as illustrated 
in the increase of establishments being afforded sensitive coverage 
. and through the increase of our live informant coverage targeted 
against the nations involved. Three of the six new foreigp liaison 
posts established recently by the Bureau involve countries within 
the area of responsibility of this Unit and information from those 
liaison posts should add to the production of our foreign intelligence 
information in response to President Nixon1s requi:r:ements.
