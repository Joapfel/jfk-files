Mr. Wannall. Mr. C_hairman, that is not FBI data that you 
have quoted. That was prepared by the Genera;I. Accounting 
Office. 
Senator Tower. That is GAO. 
Mr. Wannall. Based on a sampling of about 9 3 ca_ses. 
Senator Tower. Would that appear to b.e a fairly accurate 
figure. 
Mr. Wannall. I have not seen any survey which the FBI 
l9 itself has conducted that would confirm that, but I think that 
20 we do get the principal portion of our information from live 
21 sources.
