H. Levi 
We have been asked to chair a special subco!mnittee 
of the Select Committee-on Intelligence which will con­
centrate on matters relating to domestic intelligence 
activities of the Federal government. Our mandate is to 
prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft 
report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses 
by the FBI and othe+ domestic intelligence agencies; the 
causes of such alleged abuses or excesses and recommendations 
which the Committee might make.to remedy the problems we 
have uncovered .. 
t"!e are at,1are of the fine \•1ork in ,.t1l1ich :l·cur ·staff 11as 
been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be 
available to ·work with the Coninii ttee staff on these matters. 
However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs 
to be supplemented in several important respects and there­
fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to 
the FBI for further information ·which v7e hope will be 
treated on a priority .basis so that the Subcc,:nmittee can 
meet the deadlines set by the full committee. These and 
future requests which wi.:..l be handled between the t\'lO 
com.raittee counsel or Mr. Elliff, Domestic Task Fc,rce Leader, 
and Mr. Shaheen 1 Special Counsel for Int~lligence Coor­
dination, will pertain to both information necessary for 
us to formulate meaningful recommendations and to pursue 
matters on certain specific alleged abuses which remain 
unsettled. Among the future requests will be questions 
pertaining to your guidelines on nnomestic Security Invcs­
tigations
11 
and on man)?ower and budget statistics for the 
FBI's domestic intelligenc~ program.
