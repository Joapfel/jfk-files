Today, in line with the request of the President, I called at the 
\Tuite House at l:.45 p.mo, and present at the conference were the President, 
the Secretary of State and myself. The Pres:i.dent related to the Secreta.ry of 
State his concern ralative to CoJ.wciulist activities in this co1..u~try, as well as 
t-Fascist activitiesA He stated that he was very desirous of having a survey 
made of these conditions and informed the Secretary of State that this su..."'Vey 
could be made by tr.e Department of Justice ii' the Secretary o:f State l"eq_uested 
the Department to conduct the inquiry, as under the Appropriation Act this 
Bureau would have authority to make such investigation if asked to do so by 
, NW 313'600 
the Secretary of State. The President pointed out that both of these moye­
ments were intern..;.t,ional in scope and that Communism particularly v;as directed 
from Moscow, and that there hc.d been certain indications that Oumansk.r, at­
+.s:il"hAn +.n thP. Russ::.2.n Soviet :B~mbassy. was a leading i'igure in some of the 
activities in th.is country, so consequently, it was a matter which f'el.L witni~

viriting. The Pre;:;iclent incd.cated t}1at it .§h..oJ.lld....lli?_~·oe since he desired the 
matter to be handled quite confidentially and that it would be sufficient that, 
,J~½e President, the Secretary of State and I should be the ones aware of this 
request. 
The Secretary of State asked that the investigation be made ar.d then 
made s·ev_eral sugge.stions - one:, relative to the making of a protest, ei fuer 
formally or infor:wr,1ly, to the Russian Government relative to its interi'ere:rrce 
with affairs in this country. Discussion was also had as to the infor·TI!El.tion 
obtained indicating that the Third Internationale had indicated preference for 
Roosevelt as against Landon. It was the opinion of the President that so:r:ie 
statement should be made along this line by the Attorney General at an early 
date.. The President asked that I speak to th,e Attorney General, upon his re­
tm~n to. the city, about this matter, and he suggested to the Secretary of 
State that he talk over the technique to be followed in this particular aspect, 
with the Attorney Ueneral.
