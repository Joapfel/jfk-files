TOP SECRET I 2214 
wanted to go in the direction of Diem must go kind of thinking, 
and we pulled back on it. Now, we did make an effort in·the 
months immediately following that, to try to persuade President 
Diem to get his brother Nhu, and I111adarne Nhu, out of the country .. 
We told the President to send him as Ambassador to Washington, o 
Paris, or give him any kind of a job that would get him out of 
7 the country, becaus~ it was his brother, we felt, who was the

9 alienating the Buddhists, the military, and the s.tudents, and 
10 we felt that Brother Nhu.was going to bring President Diem down. 
11 I do recall vary specifically that Ambassador Henry 
12 Cabot Lodge had instructions that if a coup should develop, 
13 that he should do his best to insure President Diem's personal 
14 safety, and, indeed, I understand that on the morning of the day

16 Diem and suggested some arrangements to Diem that would insure 
17 his ~ersonal safety. Diem refused those suggestions and tried 
18 to get off into another part of the country where he thought he 
19 had some forces that might be loyal to him, and on the way was 
20 captured and killed. 
21 MR. BELIN: Is it your testimony, then, that you don't 
22 know of any actio~ by this government, or any agency of the 
23 government.which contributed, directly contributed to the death 
24 of Diem? 
25 MR. RUSK: It was not the policy of the United States
