Personnel 
We recently recommended that one agent and one 
clerk be added to Madrid in the event of a futu;re expansion. 
While the present complement can handle the normal FBI 
cases, the emphasis on HILEV items can best be satisfied 
by an additional agent.

.MEXICO CITY 
·Our-operation in Mexico is unique in.that we 
are actively developing informants and working most closely 
with the cooperative Mexican officers who handle our cases. 
there. This is our largest office both in terms of case 
load and personnel. Unlike Canada where practically all 
our work is hand1ea by one agency, we are aealing with a 
number of different agencies in Mexico most of which lack 
the training and sophistication of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) hence the disparity in the personnel 
.required to handle our work north and- south of the border. 
In an effort to streamline our operations in Mexico, the 
Legal Attache has been·instructed to·reduce the number of 
informant~ he is operating and to cut back on his investigation 
in certain areas such as the American Communist Group in • 
Mexico. ._ 
Productivity 
Two hundred and eighteen persons wanted in the 
United States were located by the Mexico City Office during 
fiscal 1971. Thirty "informal deportations"wer.e arranged and 
53 stolen automobiles were recovered. The case load as of 
6/30/71 was 627 which is below average on a per agent basis. 
As of 8/23/71, the office had submitted 37 HILEV items of 
• which 28 were actually disseminated~ This is substantially 
. above average. 
Personnel 
We feel the present complement is adequate until 
the Legal Attache recommends additional "Resident Agencies."
