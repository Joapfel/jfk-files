to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's CounterintelligenQe 
Programs has reported that in th~ five basic ones it- found 
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI 
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370, 
less than three fourths, were approved. 
I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were 
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era 
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative 
matters per year. 
Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed 
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate 
and understandable. 
The question might well be asked what I had in mind when 
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it 
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an 
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people .. 
What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is 
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what the 
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney 
the Congress, and the people of the United States. 
Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and 
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige 
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and 
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such 
acts of violence from New England to California.
