contemplate the initiation of sensitive operations today 
under proc~dures that require their exposure to a large num­
ber of re~iewing bodies. The issue of whether we should 
again adopt Secretary Stimson's view that "gentlemen do not 
read each other's mail 11 (and that we live in a world of 
gentlemen) should be faced squarely and openly by the Con­
gress and not through irresponsible individual exposures. 
IV. Cooperation with the Committee 
Mr. Chairman, I assure you, as I did on t~e telephone 
when you were named, of my most sincere intention to cooperate 
with you and this Committee in its work. I look forward to 
your; as well as our, contribution of ideas to the shaping of 
·the new era that American intelligence ,:an have if we do our 
work well. By my presence here I indicate my intention to be 
as open and public as I can be during your proceedings. There 
will be, however, many matters which, I am sure you will agree, 
can only be handled effectively in executive session. For this 
purpose, your staffs have been given appropriate clearances by 
the committee, and I urge that you take steps to insure not 
,, 
only that the:r will abide by the Committee's rules but also that 
-~~,,.,~ .......... 
you have the legal ability similar to the one we use for our 
employees to require any later exposure of such matters to occur 
only af±er you have had a chance to review whether they may 
improperly reveal sensitive information.
