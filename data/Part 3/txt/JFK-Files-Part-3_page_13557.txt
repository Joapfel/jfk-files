after the 
and other 
retaliate 
failure of the Bay of Pigs, that the three of you 
people in the Agency would have had a motive to • 
against President Kennedy. 
Could you describe for us what you know of your 
relationship and that of General Cabell and Allen Dulles with 
President Kennedy after the termination of your respective perio s 
of service with the Agency? 
MR. BISSELL: I can't say very much about the other 
two gentlemen. I am sure that Allen on occasion saw the Preside t, 
and I have every reason to believe that it was a friendly 
relationship. I rather doubt whether General Cabell had any 
direct contact with him after that. 
I did have contact with him on perhaps two or three 
occasions . He asked me quite soon after I left the Agency to 
lend a he1ping hand to the then head of the rather new Alliance
