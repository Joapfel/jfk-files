administration. Since terrorist activities sudh as bombings, 
riots and the like are in violation of statutes under Bureau's 
investigative responsibility it behooves us to make certain 
that our supervision is as tight and effective as possible. 
Inasmuch as DID is actively investigating the 
terrorists who are in violation of these laws, it follows 
that DID is better prepared to handle these criminal 
investigations and handle final prosecutive actions. Not 
only would duplicative supervisory action be avoided but 
the DID supervisor has at his fingertips a feel of the case, 
necessary background data and a full knowledge of sources who 
can develop needed evidence. 
In 1968, crimin•l prosecutions of these violations 
were handled for most part by Department's Criminal Division 
but now the Department has moved to invest the Internal Security 
Division with the overall responsibility of prosecuting terrorist 
activities regarding above-mentioned matters. Similar reorgani­
zation on our part would certainly enhance more effective 
superviston. Of course. any transfer of cases to DID would 
require transfer of personnel from GID now handling these matters. 
In view of the foregoing, it is recommended that 
supervisory responsibility for all violations of Antiriot Laws 
and substantive violations of Explosive and Incendiary Devices 
! ·"-, Act (Bombing Matters) involving extremist and political 
• , terrorists be transferred from GID to DID together with 
required Agent personnel.
