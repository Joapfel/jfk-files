ANSWER: 
When you were an Agent did you engage in any 
break-ins or were you aware of any break-ins? 
Insofar as the matter which you are now discus­
sing, I think that we·can give substantially the 
same answer to this. This is a matter which is 
being investigated by the Department and is being­
investigated by the various committees, particu­
larly the Select Committee of Congress and, I'm 
not saying that Clarence Kelley engaged in such 
activites, or did not engage in these.activities. 
I'm merely saying that these have been presented 
for review and they will, thereafter, be discussed 
at some length and any public•i ty that might be 
given them will be that which will be given by 
those more knowledgeable than I. 
Mr. Kelley, to your knowledge have any members of 
the FBI been involved in the planning or execution 
of assassinations? 
No, sir. I know of none. 
Mr. Kelley, how about the break-in of embassies 
here in Washington. Have any members of the FBI 
gained surreptitious entry into any embassies in 
Washington? 
Without naming or designating victims or insti­
tutions, I can only say that there were a few 
concerned with counterintelligence--fore.ign in 
nature--subsequent to 1966G Further then that 
I cannot say. 
A few is 10, 20, 100? When you say few, I'm sure 
that I'm lost as to how few is a few. 
Not many. 
Was a lot of this done in Washington as opposed 
to other cities in the country? 
There were not a lot, I'm confident of that. And, 
frankly, I don't think that all of the few were 
confined to Washington, D. c., but I can't tell 
you absolutely that that is true.
