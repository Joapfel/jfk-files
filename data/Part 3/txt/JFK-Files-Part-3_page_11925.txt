It is obvious that despite the sophistication and 
security-consciousness of the Sov±et Intelligence Services, our 
efforts to direct double agents against them continue to meet 
with conspicuous success. Examples of the productivity of our 
double agent operations appear elsewhere herein. 
Some declines in the number of double agent operations 
against the intelligence services of countries other than the 
USSR handled by this section have occurred since the last 
inspection. In part, this may be a reflection of a change of 
emphasis in direction of our efforts, ~h ... e~s,,,r~.~ul~ .. i~ .

double agents has been in the,Cz,_g~h_.i.ig,l,s....~ This is attributable 
primarily to two factors. 
Followi~g the occupation of Czechoslovakia (CSSR) by 
Soviet bloc armed forces in August, 1968, which resulted in the 
fall of the liberal Alexander Dubcek regime, the Communist Party 
of the CSSR began a critical analysis of all party members who 
had supported Dubcek. This analysis included individuals 
assigned to diplomatic posts in Washington. and New York and 
resulted in the recall of about two-thirds of such personnel. 
A number were expelled or suspended from the Party. Of those 
recalled, severa 1 have not yet been replac.ed. .Th.e_CJ:l,i..~Cze£_h

the Czech personnel in Washington and New· York and that morale 
dropped to rock bottom and, as consequence, little intelligence 
work was carried on during the current year. Naturally, with 
the_CI$ agents missing or dormant, otropportunities to target 
double agents ~gains~ them diminished. Th-is unsettled political 
situation, together with the overt defection of a CIS officer 
in Washington on 6/29/70, resulted in the CIS assuming a

considered by them to be fully trustworthy. Indicative of the·
