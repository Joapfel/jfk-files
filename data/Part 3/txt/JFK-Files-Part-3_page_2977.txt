Mr. Adams. Well --
Sena tor Hart of Michiga·n. Or iJ; you were to rerun it, 
·would you. do it • ? again. 
Mr. Adams. Hell, not in 1975, compared to what 1969 
was. The problem we had at the time was where we had an 
informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was 
going to take place and it was going :to be the Daily World, . 
18 which was the east coast communist newspaper that made comments 
19 about it. They formed an organizational meeting. \'le took 
20 a quick look at it. The case apparentiy was opened in Hay .28, 
21 1969 ~nd closei;.l June 5 ~ayi:ng there was no problem with th-is 
22 organization. 
23 Now the problem we get into is if we take ·a quick look 
24 and get.out, fine. We've had cases, though, where we have 
25 stayed in too long. When you !.re dealing t\l.ith security J ;· :i :-; ] .i): 01
