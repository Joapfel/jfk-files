The key to investigations of this type is the 
initial interview which is conducted after the field office 
covering t4e alien's residence has developed sufficient

., .. • . designed to have the subject personally verify information 
.. :. .• .... ·he may have furnished to U. S. authorities at some time in 
,. =;··,•···-the past and in cases where significant discrepancies are · 
. , •• _disclosed through the interview, we will intensify the investi-
. . ,.• gation, looking toward the possibility that the subject is n9w 
.' • .. • · • ·.-unable to recall a previous cover story. In the event the

· • .• . -. • • to being reopened after two years for a second interview. The •
