Re Los Angeles phone call to Assistant to the 
Director JAMES B. ADAMS, 12/9/75. 
On 12/3/75, the attached article appeared in the 
Los Angeles Times under the byline of reporter JACK NELSON. 
As indicated, the headline and lead paragraph which 
is based on ADAMS' testimony, clearly reflects that the FB 
did nothing to prevent lQjiu..,vipJ.faRc.e-although we knew of 
the contemplated violence. After discussing this matte with 
Mr. ADAMS and reviewing the actual testimony received in 
the Los Angeles Division on 12/8/75, SAC ELMER F. LINBERG 
and I met with Editor BILL THOMAS and National Editor ED 
GUTHMAN at the Los Angeles Times. 
I advised these gentlemen that I was aghast when I 
read the headlines and the lead paragraph of this article 
and could not believe that JIM ADAMS did not refute informant 
ROWE's testimony that we took no action relative to con­
templated violence since I knew that this was contrary to 
the rules, regulations, policy, and philosophy of the FBI 
in 1960. I then c9-'lled Mr. ADAMS in Washington, D. C., and 
he likewise, was ,upset over the headline and lead paragraph,
