r1~ll'"o 
Rc~erence iS made to a lettor✓ from the Senate 
Select CQmmittee dilted March 191 1975, requesting certain 
documents and other information from the FBl. 
Attached for your approval and f~rwarding to the 
Committee is the original of a memorandum which responds to 
a specific request by the Committee for a position paper 
da_t~.d July 31 1 1972, concerning the ''Scope of F.llt :Aufhority, 
Jurisdiction and Responsibi1ity in Domestic Intelligence 
Investigations." A copy of this memorandum ;is enclosed for 
your records. 
You will note that the position taken by the FBI -~;--~~ 
is that the requested position paper of July 31, 1972, is an 
internal deliberative document which is the direct basis for 
a f-0rmal statement on FBI authority to conduct internal 
security investigations embodied in a memorand1,1m from the 
Director, FBI, to the Attorney General dated August 71 1g73. 
On this basis we ~re stating in our response to the Committee 
that we fee.l it inappropriate that the July 31 1 1·972, paper 
be made available. We believe that this position is completely 
sound and a proper precedent to set with respect to the ambit 
of the Committee's mandate. We also fee1 that it is consistent 
with the position which l1as been expressed by io?-• .~ _,. .-; ;J ,£.!~-.#·-~
