development of plans inside of the Agency with a specific pJan 
or goal of the assassination of any particular foreign leader? 
MR. BISSELL: Yes, I was aware of investigation and 
planning to that end. 
MR. BELIN: Will you please enurnerate before the 
Commission which foreign leader or leaders were involved? 
MR. BISSELL: There were three cases I remembaro· One

involved Lumumba, and the third did involve Castro. I am not 
giving that order chronologically, I don't remember what the

21 of creating a situation in which the potential agent would have 
22 access to the target, and because the plan never reached that 
23 stage, it was never, so far as I am aware, discussed outside 
24 of the Agency with a view to obtaining approval or authorization
