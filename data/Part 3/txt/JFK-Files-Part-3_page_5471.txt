Re page 188 
This page reveals CIA began to follow Caribbean 
black radicalism in earnest in 1968 and as a result CIA's 
Directorate of Intelligence published studies on 8/6/69 
and 6/12/70. This page revealed in each of these studies 
there was a single paragraph devoted to ties with U. S. black 
power movement and primarily concerned visits of Stokely 
Carmichael and other U. S. black power activists to the 
Caribbean. The second study was to pay special attention to 
links between black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates 
of black power in U. S. This page reveals these studies 
did not provide meaningful evidence of important links between/ 
militant blacks in the U. S. and the Car}bbea1://t .,._ .~ ., _.,,,,,, qQ
