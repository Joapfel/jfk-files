Mr. Baron. Wasn . • e uction from the fact . . ' 
that he was part of ·the Fair Play for Cuba Committee? 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. It could have been, but I haven't 
seen that. 
Mr~ Greissing. He had come out pUblicly in interviews 
stating that he was for Castro and would defend Castro if the 
u ,S, took action. / 
AMI.ASH Case Officer. Well, probably so, but I never had --1 
Mr. Johnston. And in fact, Oswald had visited Mexico CitY.+l"c!. 
on November 25th, the very day you wrote your contact reportJ ~ 
½he Mexico City chief of station cabled headquarters and remind 
them about the Castro speech threat, and I assume that our info 
tion is that Mr. King was handling the activity in Mexico 
City, 
AMLASH Case Officer, Yes, 
Mr. Johnston. So on November 25th he was aware of the 
threat, reminded of the threat. 
I think it is fair to say that Mr. King knew that Oswald 
had visited the Cuban embassy in Mexico City, He knew that on 
November 25th. 
Another CIA document indicates that Chief of Station Wynn 
Scott -- I don't know whether you knew him -- in Mexico City, 
on November 25th read a message to the President of Mexico 
in which he said, Mr, Scott's memo says there are still some 
important questions concerning Oswald and his visit to Mexico
