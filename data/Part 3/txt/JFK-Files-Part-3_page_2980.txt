Mr. Wannall .. S~nator ilart, that was a case that was 
opened on Novcml:>er 14.and closed November 20, and the informati n 
which caused us to be -inte·rested in it were really. tw? particul r 
items. One was that' a member of the steering committee there, 
was a three mc1.n stee:i:;-ing committee, and one of_those members 
of the national conference was in f:ctct a national officer 
of the VVZ\W in whom we 'had suggested before we did. have a 
legitimate investigative interest.· 
Senator Ha.rt of I-lichiryan. \·7cll, I would almost say so wh1t 
at that point. 
Mr. l·7annall. The second r0.port we had was that the 
WAW would actively participate in an 'attempt to pa9k the 
confere11ce to take it over. And the third report \ve had --
Sena tor Ha,rt of I•lichigan. And incidentally, all of the 
information that your Buffalo informant had given you ·with 
respect to the goals and aims of the WA\v gave you a list of 
goals whi<::h were completely within Constitutionally protected 
objectives. There wasn't a sin<Jle· item out of that VVA~v that 
jeopardizes the .secud. ty of this country at all. 
Mr. Wannall. Well, of ··course, we did not rely entirely 
on the Buffalo infoDnant, but even·there we did. recej •·
