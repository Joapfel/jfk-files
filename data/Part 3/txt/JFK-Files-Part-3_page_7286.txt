tJ. S:~R 4 1915 According to the Senate Resolution a~~ed l~ii/~ 
relating to the investigation and study of .if)Jfft?t::11S119H era-
tions with respect to intelligence activities, the SSC is going 
to involve all agencies of the Intelligence Community. In 
anticipation that Bureau representatives will be called to testify 
and asked to supply some extremely sensitive doeuments regarding 
our investigative activity in the U. s., it is believed essential 
that we have an input into how such documents and testimony are 
going to be hanaled by staff personnel of the Committee. Unless 
we participate in developing security standards, we may find that 
sensitive documents and tes:t.imony that we are called to provide 
to the Committee cannot be adequately protected from public 
scrutiny.
