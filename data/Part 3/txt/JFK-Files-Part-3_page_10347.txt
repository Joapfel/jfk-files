This pro.posed use of sanitizatron as a special arrangement_ 
to protect selected issues contained in. material provided to Select 
Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not 
practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.· 
It is essent~al to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt 
to ·empioy the same criteria for sanitization and coordinate as 
. required. This paper can serve only as general gui~elines on 
··sanitization.
