On July 12, 1968, Ahmad's former landlord at 
Ithaca, New York, advised that the subject told him that 
he would travel to Vietnam in September, 1968, in order 
to study and report upon the war. Ahmad reportedly said

since he has been conducting research on guerrilla warfare 
1 and revolutions.

participants in a local "teach-in" on the war in Vietnam 
to be held on Mary 15, 1965. One of the speakers was 
identified as Eqbal Ahmad, assistant professor of political 
'science who was described as an expert on guerrilla and 
internal warfare who had worked with the anti-French FLN 
guerrillas during the Algerian independence struggle and 
who reportedly had studied guerrilla movements all over

,Ahmad's file cites numerous instances of Ahmad's 
involvement in antidraft and anti-Vietnam demonstrations 
and activities as well as numerous anti-American statements 
made by him. During his subsequent association with the 
ECCSL, Ahmad has been one of the prime movers in the plot 
to kidnap a high Government official and appears to have

advisor of the ECCSL. I •

suggestions are set forth for your cons~deration and 
appropriate action:
