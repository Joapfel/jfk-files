THE CHINESE UNIT 4-E 
As a result of our close cooperation with RCMP, 
that agency, in 12/70, provided us with details of one of 
its double agent operations which clearly depicted intensi­
fication of Chinese communist (Chicom) intelligence efforts 
directed against the United States. We learned that the 
Chicoms have funded travel of the RCMP source to New York 
and Washington, D.C., where the source undertook to fulfill 
intelligence contacts and development of data for the Chicoms. 
·As a result of getting this information, we learned that 
Chicoms desire to lay the foundation to get "our people" 
(Chicoms) into the United States under suitable cover, . 
probably when the Chicom Embassy ••pens in Canada in the very 
near future. The Director's letter to the Commissioner, 
RCMP, expressed appreciation for RCMP information. 
During August, 1970, three of our Chinese informants 
made contacts with Chicom intelligence representatives in
