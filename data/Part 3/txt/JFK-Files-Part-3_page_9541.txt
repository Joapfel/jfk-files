The purpose of Mr. Todorovich 1 s conference with the District 
Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres­
sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Dr. Joseph Smiley. 
He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he 
would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of 
the CIA and the FBI, thereby eliminating further adverse publicity. 
Mr. Todorovich affirms that before going to District Attorney 
McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott 
Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests. 
He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him to the District 
Attorney. 
Mr. Todorovich states that Mr. Werner refused absolutely to 
cooperate in this matte1·. Instead, Mr. Werner engaged in an oral 
exchange during which he remarked that our representative in 
Boulder was 11lying 11 and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of 
Mr. Todorovich. Subsequently, Mr. Todorovich conferred with 
the District Attorney alone. He was successful in persuading the 
District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had 
the effect of putting this issue regarding Dr. Smiley and oL11.er rumors 
to rest as far as the public was concerned. 
I have carefully reviewed the statements of Mr. Todorovich. 
I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in 
question to Dr. Smiley and later to the District Attorney. This should 
only have been done with specific FBI approval. I wish to assure you 
that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, and I am 
taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency 
officials.
