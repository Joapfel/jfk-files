After Artime's return to the US, he used his influence with 
the US Government to obtain an interview with President Kennedy in 
Palm Beach, Florida. He was to continue as head of the MRR. Artime 
made a good appearance, spoke English, and had charmed US Government 
officials who were in charge of government policy between the US 
and Cuba. He was extremely ambitious and would _like to be the head 
of the CRC and probably the future President of Cuba. (Higinio

Manu~~Artime and Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, head of the CRC, for 
critfcism, declaring they were using the Brigade for their personal 
benefits. Both Artime and Miro Cardona denied this. The Brigade,
