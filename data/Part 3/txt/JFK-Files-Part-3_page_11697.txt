IV. Extent and Nature of Current Supervision 
Periodic reports on individuals and organizations 
as well as informant coverage relating to BOCOV are 
analyzed and correlated by SA Bernardo M. Perez. Involved 
is review of incoming letters, memoranda, reports and 
semiannual progress letters detailing informant coverage 
and subversive strength. Analysis of this material 
provides a basis for detecting weaknesses and making 
arrangements for counterintelligence moves. 
Current Justification for Continuance 
BOCOV continues to fill the above-described 
intelligence void and, in addition, is coordinated with 
other intelligence programs originating in the border 
area, in particular the SECOMEX program. 
VI .. Frequency of Evaluation and Date of Last Justification 
Program is evaluated.annually and was last 
justified January 8, 1971.
