Memorandum to Mr. J.B. Adams 
RE: SENSTUDY 75, FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON 
ASSIGNED INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
_62-116395 
the entries to the GTR, have been reconstructed to make them 
readable on this Xerox. The memorandum copy, which is being 
ret~ined in the Voucher Unit, is readable. The markings on 
the reverse side of the Xerox have no bearing on the date of 
travel but are merely entries relative to the payment to National 
Airlines. It might be noted that the issue date of this GTR, 
11/21/64, has been determined to be a Saturday, which is the 
day of the week Whitson recalled making the trip to _Miami. 
According to Cox, the Bureau does not maintain copies 
of the actual vouchers and ~here is only a bare possibility that 
a vouc~er over 10 years old, such as the oa~involved in this 
matter, would be maintained anywhere in the Government, such 
as at the Federal Records Center. 
ACTION: 
None. For information.
