It is my desire that the secrecy agreements signed by 
our employees shall not impair the necessary work of the 
Select Committee. To accomplish this, and in recognition 
of the security protection contemplated by the Select 
Committee, I have determined that disclosure of otherwise 
protected information to the Select Committee or its designated 
staff members will constitute an authorized provision of infor­
mation within the meaning of the secrecy agreements. This 
letter may be used to indicate such authorization for any 
Agency employee or ex-employee to furnish information to 
the Select Committee or appropriate staff members on matters 
which would otherwise be covered by their secrecy agreement, 
but which are not among the particularly sensitive matters 
such as mentioned abovec With r.espect to those particularly 
sensitive matters, different procedures are obviously neces­
sary. Accordingly, where any matter included in these sensi­
tive categories would be involved in responding to the Com­
mittee, the employee should express his concern and, if 
possible, propose a way of responding to the Committee without 
exposing such sensitive details. If the Committee believes 
that a disclosure of those aspects is nevertheless nec·essary, 
the matter will be discussed between the Committee and the 
Agency. I am prepared to consult with the Committee at any 
time to avoid difficulties in this area and quickly determine 
together the appropriate course of action to be taken. 
With the good faith evident in our discussions on these 
matters, I believe that these arrangements will enable me to 
discharge my responsibilities to protect intelligence sources 
and methods from unauthorized disclosure, while at the same 
time to provide the Select Committee with all the information 
it needs to accomplish its tasko 
As we have agreed 1 it is in the national interest as well 
as that of the Select Committee and the Uc~• intelligence 
community to ensure that your review proceed as smoothly and 
as expeditiously as possible. Toward that end, I have in­
structed all CIA personnel to respond in a spirit of coopera­
tion. 
Sincerely,
