Memorandum w. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran 
RE: SECURITY SURVEYS - SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON IN~ELLIGENCE 
ACTIVITIES - HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES -
CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT 
At the conclusion of this conference, Chief Powell expressed 
his sincere appreciation to the Bureau for the excellent help ?Jld 
guidance extended to him and his staff in this matter of mutual interest, 
and expressed the hope that he could call on us again in the event he 
or his staff needed to tap our resevoir 0f knowledge. The Chief was 
assured that we would be available if needed in this capacity. 
It appears that the Capitol Police Force has been forced into 
the untenable position of handling this responsibility for the Congress, 
and as a result are attempting to establish some degree of self-reliance 
and outward credibility being completely inexperienced in this area of 
technical expertise. Because of this, ,it is felt tp.at the Bureau should 
move cautiously in any continuing liaison with the Capitol Police 
concerni~g security survey matters. 
, RECOMMENDATION·: 
It is recommended that any continuing liaison with the 
Capitol Hill Police Force be handled by mature and experienced 
Special Agent Supervisors, who are completely familiar with security 
survey matters.
