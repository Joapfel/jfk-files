MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING 
At 4:35 p.m., today I telephonically contacted ASAC 
Morley, Denver, and advised him that an article concerning the 
Riha case had appeared in the Sunday News (New York) 4-3-70. 
This article was a general rehashing of the Riha case. 
I told him that the Bureau desired that SAC Wern~r· 
contact the District Attorney to determine the developments ~ 
of his investigation in this case and also determine what tl 
conclusions had been reached. Morley said this would be done. (/! 
Morley was asked if Denver· had information concerni g 
a professor who had gone to El Paso, Texas, or New Orleans, 
Louisiana, and he advised this probably referred to 
!)r .. Joseph Smiley 1 :fo'.'..·me:i. .. Pre73idef'lt ~t Colorado ~Univeri:::j ty 
who was there when Riha disappeared. He said that Smiley 
is now President of the University of Texas$" at El Paso, Texas. 
He said Denver had no information that Dr. Smiley has any 
current information concerning this matter. 
SAC Werner called at 5:30 p.m., today to advise· 
that he had been unable to get in touch with the District 
Attorney but also was following up on this and would contact 
the District Attorney today and get in a teletype tonight.
