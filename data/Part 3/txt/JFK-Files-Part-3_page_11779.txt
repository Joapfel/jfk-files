method of periodically assessing ·work loads and manpower

these figures would serve as a guide for possible manpower 
changes to meet fluctuating and ever-changing problems, it was 
·e~sential that figures presented be accurate and equally 
ess~ntial that like matters be t~bulate_d uniformly.

On August 6, 1971, I instructed that a study be made
