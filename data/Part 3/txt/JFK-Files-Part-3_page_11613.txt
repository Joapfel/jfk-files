taken at the instruction of the President for the specific 
purpose of developing high-level political intelligence and 
• ~ach such item submitted is identified by the code word 
"HILEV." After a slow start in January, when the new 
offices were just getting underway, the production of HILEV 
items has increased to the point that during July, 1971, 73 
such items were submitted of which 53 or 72.6% were actually 
disseminated to Dr. Kissinger and the Attorney General. 
Through August 17, 1971, a total of 245 items have been so 
disseminated. By letter March 3, 1971, Dr. Kissinger, 
·:i;-eferring to our work, stated "it is gratifying that efforts 
•. ·thus far have been so fruitful" and 11your contributions in 
,· .the foreign area are deeply appreciated. 11 In June, 1971,

.again expand our foreign liaison in view of the valuable 
information which had been procured by the ~ureau in its
