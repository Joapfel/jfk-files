I would like to suggest that you appoint a member of your staff - say, 
Ben Mar shall - as a focal point for handling compartmented information 
access approvals and assign him the responsibility of insuring that these 
security standarcls are met by persons selected to participate in this 
•' ·,sensitive area ..

The CIA operates a Compartmented Information Branch as a service 
of common concern to the intelligence community which records the names 
of all individuals in the Govermnent with access to compartmented information. 
Your personnel would be similarly recorded which would considerably ease 
the access certifications to all organizations £or the duration of your inquiry .. 
As indicatedt I am prepared to discuss this wit?, you at any time . . - ... _. 
Sincerely~
