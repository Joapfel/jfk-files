One final question from Epstein. Is there anything 
else about this case that you know that has not come out 
because I did not ask the right question or asked a question 
in the right way. I advised I felt he had done a good job 
in asking the questions. 
Additional answers to questions. I did not 
know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's remarks about 
King's association with communists. I did not attend all of 
the meetings at WFO concerning the King installation. My 
best recollection was that the monitoring was in rooms one 
floor above the rooms occupied by King.
