SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM 
ADDITION OF SUITABLE DESIGNATION 
TO CAPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS PER­
TAINING TO CERTAIN RACIAL INFORM­
ANTS TO INSURE PROPER ROUTING OF 
SUCH CORRESPONDENCE AT SOG. 
I / . .1 • 
INSPEC G .~;LLER: Prior to the reorganization of the 
v v Y( Domestic Intelligence Division on 
~- 12-16-70, all informants reporting 
on racial matters and white hate groups (including Ku Klux 
Klan) were supervised by the Racial Informant and White 
Hate Unit of the Racial Intelligence Section. ,All such

As a result of the above, the Racial Intelligence 
Section is receiving mail concerning racial informants who 
are reporting on white hate group activity. This mail 
should be reviewed and handled by the Internal Security 
Section. At the present time, it is not possible to 
determine to which section such mail should be routed without 
reviewing the content of the incoming correspondence since

informants indicate only that a racial source is involved. 
The type of activity-on which the informant reports -- black 
·nationalist as opposed to white hate groups -- is not set

In view of the fact that over 40% of the cases 
pertaining to racial sources involve white hate groups, it 
would appear desirable to identify such matters clearly in 
the caption of communications submitted to the Bureau by the 
field. This will permit such mail to be routed directly to 
the Internal Security Section and will save an appreciable 
amount of time in getting the mail to the section where it
