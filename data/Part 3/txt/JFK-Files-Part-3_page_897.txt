• ~He argues that Section 605 itself, its legislative­
history, and subsequent case law do not indicate that Section 
605 intended to ·prohibit the President from utilizing elect=c~ic 
surveillance to gather foreign intelligence or to use the

not aimed solely at securing evidence to convict a pe~son c=

interpretation of Section 605 is not applicable ·to this ki::d 
-of case, and argues that in view of the breadth of the 
?resident's authority in foreign affairs, Section 605 should 
be interpreted to limit that power only if Congress' intent 
to do so is clearly manifest, which he argues it is not. 
Judge Adams then addresses the cqnstitutional 
q~estion avoided by the majority, viz., does the 4th ~,.e~c..~e~~ 
allow the President to authorize warrantless electronic s~~·;ei:-. 
lances in foreign intelligence cases. He concludes tha~ it 
does. He argues that constitutional rights are n·ot absol~~e; 
they must be weighed against competing rights; and the 4tn 
Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures.
