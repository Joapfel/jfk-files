Numerous areas have been identified in your 
territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie 
elements, many wi;th a high incidence of crime. To provide 
a better over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and

convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to 
this information, you should consider preparing a large wall 
map of th~ San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it in a 
central secure position in the office. In addition to criminal 
informants, you should include the location in which racial 
and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish 
information and you should identify the location of all these 
~ informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference 
to an index showing the agent to whom the iniormant is 
assigned and the coverage which informant can be expected to 
provide.
