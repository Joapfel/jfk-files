·Mr.Chairman and Members of the Committee 
This Committee's inquiry and its conclusions and recom­
mendations- can open a new era in American intelligence and 
even in the intelligence profession worldwide. Historically, 
the intelligence act;i.vities of a state have been considered 
an essential function, bµt one conducted outside normal Gov­
ernment processes. Indeed, one foreign official recently 
expressed some surprise to me that our intelligence rests 
upon legi.slation enacted by the Congress and is subject to 
oversight and annual appropriation by the Congress. He com-
rnen-i:.eci i:.:i:1a.i:. i1e riaci alw·ays cons_idereci it ·a lria.tter· private to 
the Executive. This Committee's charter demonstrates the 
contrary in America. 
America has made many innovations in ~he intelligence 
_process 1 and I believe we have brought ours to the highest 
peak of efficiency of any intelligence service in the world. 
Our Government's policies can now be based on factual in­
formation and demonstrable analysis rather than on hunches, 
circumstantial evidence, and overly qualified judgments

With the assistance of my Intelligence Conrrnunity col­
leagues, I hope to give this ,Committee the broadest possible 
look at these intelligence efforts of the United States.
