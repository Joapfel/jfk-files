CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE 
CAPABILITIES IN LATIN 
AMERICA 
To describe and evaluate Castro's capabilities, with Soviet help, 
for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin Americ::: after 
satisfaction of all US ·conditions relative to the withdrawal of 
strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com­
mitment not to invade. 
NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro's raw ca.pabilities, 
taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin 
American capabilities for counteraction. 
SUMMARY 
A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through­
out much of Latin America is the product of fundamental" in­
equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of 
Castro and the Soviets. Castro's efforts, with Soviet help, r,o 
exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage nc:1ve 
not produced significant. results. Propaganda exploita.tid1 .. .:·,f 
Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer more 
effective to qate than other subversive activities. Castr:,:y.,·· in­
fluence in Latin America had waned by the time of th:2:· missile 
base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he 
had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil anj 
by the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them·. 
B. Implementation of an agreement between the US anc the 
USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be w1th­
drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with r,,t~e 
will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom
