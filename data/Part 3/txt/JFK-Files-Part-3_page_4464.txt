As previously set out a lead was outstanding to 
contact JOHNNY ROCCO for interview regard_ing his connection 
with ANGELO BRUNO in disposing of Cuban currency. It is 
pointed out that ROCCO has not been interviewed because 
of active investigation of him for violations of ITSMV 
and ITSP Statutes. Process is outstanding in the BDPA on 
ROCCO for these violations and he will be interviewed at 
the earliest possible date when the interview will not 
interfere with other investigation.
