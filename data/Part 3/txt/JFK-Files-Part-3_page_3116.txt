Senator Mondale. Thank. you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I have always supported the FBI. It is clearly the finest, 
most prof es_sional law enforcement agency -in the nation .and

kidnappers, catching fugitives, the FBI has an outstanding 
record.

10 count~r-espionage.

. 
testimony that can be imagil:.1.ed in a free society. We heard 
21 evidence that for decades the institutions designed to enforce 
22 the laws and constitutions of our country itself has been 
23 engaging in conduct that violates the la.w and the Constitution. 
24 We heard that the FBI, ·which is a part of the Department of 
25 Justice, took justice into its own hands by seeking to punish
