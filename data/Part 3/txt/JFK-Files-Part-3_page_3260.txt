E. Optio:ri Four §etting Sta~dards ior Dom~stic·rnielligence 
The FBI. should. be authorized by ."statute _to conduct 
dom~stic.iptelligence in~estlgations oply if Con~ress finds . . -- . 
(1} that· regul?i-r cri~inal" i~v·estig.ations as described above 
,• . 
would not provide information to anticipate or prevent the use 
of violence in violations of federal law, and (2) that the inci­
dents of the use of violence in violations of federal law are 
so numerous afft so serious as to constitute a significant threat 
-t6 the internal Security or domestic tranqu~lity of th~ United 
States. 
The fact. that there are individuals and groups who 
engage in viol~nce, a~vocate violence, o~ believe tn the desir-
~ . " . . 
ability of the_ultimate use of violence to· advance their 
poliiical or social objectives is not enough t9 justify ~BI 
domestic in tellig-ence authority. There must be additional 
findings that regular criminal investigations ar·e ·inade.quate 
and that the overall t_hreat o·f violence constitutes a serious 
danger to 'the country. 
Furthermore~ if FBI domestic intelligence is authorized 
by statute, it should be an annual authorization which mu.st. be 
renewed each year upon reconsideration by Congress and the 
-Attorney General of these factors. Past experience indicates 
that the annual appropriations process does not provide an·. 
appropriate forum for considerin~ the FBI's basic authority .
