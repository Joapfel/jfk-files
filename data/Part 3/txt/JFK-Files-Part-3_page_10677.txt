Additional ideas and tactics were discussed but were 
not considered feasible. Many of the ideas were discarded· 
because it was believed that other actions proposed would 
greatly jeopardize our present informant coverage. As the 
Bureau is a:ware, this office has inform.ant coverage in these 
o:cganizations on a very high level and we have been able to 
secure detailed information on .membership rolls and appli­
cations, as well as detailedfinformation on.personal activities 
of m~mbers, -as well as- detailed activity -of the mern,bership as 
a g1.~ou:9. The Blli.~eau has .previously been a,dvised that the program 
of ·interviewing 1-:lan :mGmbers at the time of the assassination 
of President KENNEDY an¢!. J.ater in connection with the bombings 
in Birmj_ngham tended to jeopardize our informant coverage,

the klan membe1~s felt that the information in the possession

AgeD.t personnel responsible for the klan investigations 
are continuing to give this program thought and.attention, and 
as ·the invest~gations progress, expect that additional ideas

and benefit of Bureau suggestions.
