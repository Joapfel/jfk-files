BLACK STUDENT GROUPS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES 
On October 29, 1970, the Executive Conference 
approved a program to conduct discreet preliminary inquiries, 
limited to established sources, on Black Student Unions and 
similar groups, their leaders, and key activists to determine 
if the activities of these groups and individuals warrant 
further active investigation. On November 4, 1970, 
instructions were sent to the field to implement this 
program. The number of campuses involved is about 500, 
representing approximately 750 black student groups. The 
officers will represent about 2,500 cases and the key 
activists another 250. The potential for new cases in this 
program will approximate 3,500 cas·e·s. This program includes 
junior colleges and two-year colleges as well as four-year 
colleges.
