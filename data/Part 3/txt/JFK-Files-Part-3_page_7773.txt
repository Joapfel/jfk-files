Our intelligence-type investigations, however, should 
meticulously adhere to guidelines which would clearly pr6hibit 
any intrusion or abridgement of an individual's rights guaranteed 
under the Constitution, particularly the First, Fourth and Fi.fth 
Amendments. To assure that the proper guidelines are drawn we 
should request the Department of Justice to issue them and then 
afford the closest possible supervision of investigation, both 
in the field and at Headquarters to see that our intelligence 
investigations are kept within these guidelines. The voicing 
of this need does not indict our existing guidelines or careful 
supervision, but merely recommends that our responsibilities be 
described and, where necessary, circumscribed by the Attorney General 
whose duty hnder the law is to supervise our activity. 
It appears that the most effective means of laying to 
rest the persist~nt complaints of various critics that the FBI 
engages in political surveillance (investigations) in violation of 
First and.Fourth Amendment rights is to have definitive legislative 
enactment carefully state what the FBI must do to protect the 
national security. Such could be resolution or statute, but should 
cover in complete detail what acts should be investigated by the 
FBI, and, in particular, that the FBI must conduct preventive or 
intelligence-type investigations to protect the national security. 
Under th·e political climat.e existing in the country today, 
however, the passage of either a statute or a resolution of the 
type needed is very remote. Because of the misconceptions and 
misapprehensions surrounding investigations relating to subversion, 
there is an atmosphere of suspicion in congressional circles that 
would likely stifle any attempt to formulate any such legislation 
at this time. We should, however, recommend to the Department that 
consideration be given immediately to sponsoring some comprehensive 
legislative enactment along the lines needed. 
In the meantime, for the benefit of the FBI, the 
Department of Justice and the rest of the Execut~ve Branch of 
Government, including the staff at the White House, it appears 
that the next best thing is to have a comprehensive Executive 
order issued, under the inherent Executive power, outlining 
exactly what responsibilities the FBI has in the protection 
of the national security and in furnishing the President 
the data he needs to fulfill his responsibilities under.the 
Constitution. 
To be effective such Executive order woul~ have to 
clearly define the FBI's intelligence collection responsibilities 
and would necessarily have to contain language which woul~ 
satisfy the courts that First and Fourth Amendment rights are
