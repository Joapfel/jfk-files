'------This is to record meeting of Task Force (TF) ~;r~;t~:n;.:.:·..= 
leaders with Mr. James Wilder otter, Associate Counsel to the 
.President, at the Executive Office Building on 6/13/75. 
Aforementioned meeting was called and chaired by 
1\11:'. Wilderotter, and was attended by representatives of The 
White House, Justice, Defense, FBI, CIA, and State. Project

Manager W. o. Cregar and Supervisor J.P. Thomas, Section CI-2,

111:'. Wilderotter reported that the Senate Select tJ ./ 
Committee (SSC) has agreed to specifically identify a limited / 
number of "abuse areasu which it will investigate from top to 
bottom. "Notices" should be issued to agencies very shortly 
defining certain terms and specifying the SSC targets. If 
I/
these areas can be fully investigated, with assistance of the 
intelligence community, the SSC agrees to not extend its inquiries 
beyond the specified areas. If the SSC does so limit its 
inquiries, this will be to the advantage of the intelligence 
community in that it will minimize the SSC's straying into 
~ various nonpertinent matters; the TFs can present the intelli-
1 .-gence "'community's side on the topics examined; the TFs should 
~ be able to expedite the Committee's inquiries and thereby limit 
-~-.., the duration of the SSC investigation. 
The FBI has responsibility for the TFs on "Politi'c-al 
Abuses," TF leader Insp. H. E. Helgeson, and "Use of Notional 
8-..cganiza tions," TF leader Supv. J. P. Thomas. we cannot fully 
address either topic until receiving the SSC notices defining 
the extent of the proposed inquiries. 
\ 
Contrary to the initial concept of the TFs, they will 
not prepare comprehensive papers regarding their to.pies, but in 
some areas it may be advantageous for a TF to prepare an J. 
"opening statement" type paper for the SSC. ",&
