The case involving Army Sergeant Jack E. Dunlap, 
a former employee of the National Security Agency who was 
a Soviet espionage agent, was thoroughly revicwod by the 
prcsent.PFIAB in view of the most serious r~mifications it 
presented. This case concerned the penetration by the 
Soviets of the National Security Agency. yhe report which 
emanated from the PFIAB study included proposals which affect 
the responsibilities and activities of several agencies within 
the intelligence community. All of the twenty-one recommendations. 
of the Board dealt with various aspects of achieving a 
strengthened counterintelligence capability to g.uard against 
penetration of our security establishments by hostile intelli­
gence agencies. Nineteen of the recommendations of the Boa.rd

directly to Bureau activity.· They are as follows: 
#18: "That steps be taken to assure that the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation has adequate 
agent resources to effect the required domestic
