MR. ADAMS:

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they 
decided to do something, he couldn't be.an angel. These are 
words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't 
take the lead but the implication is that he would have 
to go along or would have to be involved if he was going 
to maintain his liability as a ---
There is no question that an informant at times will 
have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights 
that take place but I believe his statement was to the 
effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do 
not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with 
chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with 
a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is 
one thing being present, it is another thing taking an 
active part in a criminal action. 
It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut 
apparently. 
How does the collection of information about an 
individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming 
involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for 
law enforcement or crime prevention. 
Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that 
they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge 
concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any 
value whatsoever.
