At another point in the Board meetihg there was a 
_discussion of the need for identifying the President

One Board member suggested that in any event the public . 
\ 
. P~Obably has an ideij· that the tresident is fu~ly aware I 
. of covert actiohs_undertaken. by.otir Government; however, 
Mr. Clifford·pointed out that an att-empt has always been 
made to maintain a separation of the President from iritelligenme 
agency operations all down· the line in ·Government, and this 
separation should be preserved. 
. • ' 
. Chairman Killian- observed· to Board memb:ers that when 
the DCI ~rrived at the Board meeting later in the·day the 
. matter ofpreviouslywithholding information from the Board 
concerning covert· operations would not be brought up unless 
the DCI himself; should bring it up for discussion. Dr. Killian 
added that steps should be taken by Mr. Coyne to contact the· 
DCI and re-schedule the·CIA briefing of the Board Panel on 
Covert '--Actions, preferably within the next two weeks.

said that he anticipated no such problem in the Bureau of the 
Budget in the future, with the recent appointment of I1r. Robert .
