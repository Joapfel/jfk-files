-·-----i 'INTERNAL SECURITY CZECHOSLOVAKIA. 
; On 2/10/70, SAC Werner, Denver, demanded that Jlike 
._19sl?_ro.~_1=c.h, Cen:t;-al Intelligence _Agency (CIA) representativ.~.,, .. 
_Denver, - ident°i:fy Bure·ai.t·Agent who allegedly told a CIA officer 
that the subject's disappearance was merely a marital matter 
and that subject, in fact, was alright. Todorovich refused 
to do so. The Director instructed that we protest to CIA ~ 
regarding Todorovich's actions. 
' 
. On 2-17-70, Liaison Agent Papich vigorously protested 
,Todorovich 1s actions to CIA, charging the Agency with impeding 
our inquiry. He pointed out that Todorovich ts stubborn· refusal 
to divulge the identity of the Bureau Agent involved was unac­
,ceptable because we had no information to support the statement 
~attributed to our Agent. As a result of Papich's protest, a 
CIA official telephoned Todorovich and demanded that he a1vulgc 
the identity of the Agent. ~odorovich refused and stated that 
he considered this a matter of personal honor and thnt unless 
there was reason to believe Bureau operations were being 
~adversely effected, he would not make the identification. . 
. CIA officials subsequently advised the Liaison Agent· that :-ri 
!they had reviewed the entire case and learned that District 
• 1\ttorneyiMcKevitt publicly stated on 2-14-70 that the sfat'e­
: ment a tt.ributed to Dr7\Smiley ('which allegedly came to- h~l!\-
1 via 'l'odorovich .from our Agent) was based on an '.'honest mistake" 
;and that 11cKevitt felt this cleared the air and no furtl}_~~ 
1clarification was-needed. ~ - -··· ...... ··----·--~~---~~---~
