Mr. Myers referred to ~he difficulties of effecting agent penetratioo 
of North Vietnam and Lllos. South Vietnamese locals.are being tr~ined for 
infiltration ·into Nort~ Vietnam at- -the present time. (Mr. Myers conclud~d 
his briefing of the Board at thie point.) , . 
.. 
Mr. McCone answered a question from Mr. Murphy by saying that he feels 
that the intelligence situation in- Saigo,1·is unsatisfactory. When Diem was 
overthrown, the new regime ~olled up th0 former agents of Nu uho were operating 
under CI.A ·supervision in a penetration of th,a Viet C~ng. . One of the prob letn8 
is that U. s. military elements in South Vietnam are less interested in broader 
national intelligence objectives·and are more interested in such data ss ocder­
of-batt le information; howev'er, . USMACV is planning to drop 6-man tea.ms into North Vietna.r.i. · '---··-····•-"·--•"·~ .. • ·- ·"· •· · • • · • ·• ........ •••••••••• .. --·

•with regard t~USIB consideration of increased intelligence coverage of 
China, Mr. McCone referred to the·scheduling of'.satellite missions and to the 
beginning effort in the field of clandestine agen; coverage. H0wever, Mr. McCone 
observed, China is a difficult intelligence targ, ;. Ther1;; appear l..:i be few 
chances for exploitati~, of dissensions among the Chicomsp even though the 
econ~-:ny is a ohambles, and even though the military are not being supplied with 
the equirment they have been expecting. At the same time, the Chicom.s seem to 
be forging ohead in an effort to ~chieve missile and nuclear capability. 
In answer to a question by Mr. Paco, the DCI said that COMINT has proved 
to be of. great value in cov·ering Chicom troop deployment, i.e., traffic analysis 
of Chicom communications·has produced such information. ·Mr. McCone agreed with 
Mr~ Murphy's COIIlllent that.the abs~nce--of an··intelligence capability out of '!'aiwfm 
is a disappointment~ particularly in view of the fact that large numbers of the 
Chicorn military force were once under the-comm.and of Chiang. Mr. McCone s&id 
that during the last 6 months the Chinats have lost a dozen 6-man intelligence 
teams sent into China. 
Turning :o the recent .discovery of ~udio penetration of the U. S. Embassy 
in Moser:,:-, Mr. McCone noted that the Bos.rd had heard from Mr. Bannerm&n on this 
subject earlier in the.day. The DCI said that he was astounded as anyone else 
at this devc:lopment, because he·had received-the impression that technical sweeps 
were made of• the Ea.:bassy. CIA feels that there was an audio penetration of our 
communications. He said that the problem·of fixing responsibility is still 
being studied, and that as yet no one has gotten to the bottom of the matter. 
Dr. Lnnd wondered whether there should not be an over-riding.responsibility and 
authority to d~al with sue!) pro?lems, rather than leaving them to the individual 
agencies to solve. Mr. McCone said that he is still studying th~t question but 
is not yet ready to make recommendationo._ He said that there is a need for 
. centralizing research and development efforts in the a~1dio field (For instnnce, 
Mr. McCone· pointed o·ut that CIA had. developed a pctint which could have ,prevented 
the audio penetration in Moscow, but·c~·could not get it approved for use 
because the color did not appea_l· tc,-some \1sers). • H~ said that State, Defense 
and CIA have differing vfews OI_l how.to proceed in the audio field, and there are 
several NSC directives which. Mr:•· McCone wishes to sort out before he makes any· 
recoumendations. CIA has found. that security instructions were ignored by 
officials and other personnel of some agencies, e.g., sensitive information was 
dictated and was subject to audio intercept. In the DCI's opinion, great damage 
was· done to the U. S, by the Soviet Technical penetration of the Embassy in 
Moscow.
