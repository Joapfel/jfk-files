no reticence, and that I think that he should be chosen very

Senator Baker. Could you stop for just a second? Who 
does he work for? Does the Director, in your view, work for 
the President of the United States, for the Attorney General, 
for the Justice Department, for the Executive Branch?. 
Who does the executive.of the FBI, the Director of the 
FBI, be responsible to, who should he be responsible to? 
Mr. Kelley. Jurisdictionally, to the Attorn~y General, 
but I think this is such an important field of influence that 
it is not·at all unlikely that we c~n expand it to the 
judiciary, the legislative, and of course, we are under the 
Attorney General. 
Senator Baker. Do you have any problems with t~e idea 
of the President of the United States calling t~e Director of 
the FBI and asking for performance of a particular task? 
Does that give you any difficulty? Or do you think that 
the relationship between the FBI Director and the President 
is such that that is desirable, or should it be conduited 
through the ~ttorney General? 
Mr . I~e llcy. I think it should be in the great majority 
of the cases conduited through the Attorney General. There
