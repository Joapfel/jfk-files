• Panther "'Justice" • 
Recalcitrant members of the Black Panther Party are sometimes victims of 
Panther "justice." As one example, Panther Chairman Bobby Seale was brought 
to trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the torture-murder of Panther Alex Rackley. 
Rackley, a Panther suspected of being an informant, was scalded, murdered, and 
dumped in a swamp. 
For a variety of reasons, many members have been purged from the Party. 
These incidents are usually written up in The Black Panther in special articles 
accompanied by photographs.
