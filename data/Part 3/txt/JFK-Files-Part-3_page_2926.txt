Mr. Kelley. Removing him· from his position or whatever 
is necessary in order to make it impossible or at least as 
impossible as possible to perpetuate this thing. 
Mr. Schwarz. You mean have him lose his job or 
Mr. Kelley. I don't know what it would be. 
Mr. Schwarz. Isolate him in some fashion. 
Mr. Kelley. In some fashion perhaps. 
Mr. Schwarz. Now, for such activity and for opening 
an investigation into a domestic group, could you live with 
a standard which said you would have to have an immediate 
threat that someone was likely to commit a serious federal 
crime involving violence? 
Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out 
so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation. 
Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit 
you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from 
what you think would be an acceptable standard. 
Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might 
be, by virtue of the word "immediate 11 that he's going to 
do it the next minute. In that case it may be necessary for 
you to, not with the presence or the possibility, not able 
to do anything except put him under arrest or anything. 
Mr. Schwarz. Of course, of course. 
And nobody would at all disagree·with that kind of action. 
Mr. Kelley. I don't think they would either.
