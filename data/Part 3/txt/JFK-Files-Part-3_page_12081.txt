Memorandum to All Bureau Officials and Supervisors 70-13 dated 
7/29/70 noted that the Liaison Section of Domestic Intelligence D:tvision was 
being abolished effective im1nediately. This resuited ip. .a cut-back of one 
S'3ction Chief plus eight supervisory Sp,3cial Agents who were engaged in 
domestic liaiso:i .fu:1ctions. Calls from other U. S. agencies formerly handled 
by these nine men are now handled by Agent personnel throughout the B1.1reau -

the majority of such calls are handled by Agent personnel presently assigned 
to Nationalities Intelligence Sectio:i. In addition, representatives of other 
agencies who were contacted in their offices prior to discontinuance of 
Liaison Section frequently call at D::>mestic Intelligence D-lvision for 
cons1.1ltation. Arrangements ware made for couriers representing certain 
other sensitive agencies, snch as National Security Agency and Central 
Intelligence Agency, to call at Domestic Intelligence D'lvision fo:c the purpose· 
of delivering or receiving mail requiring protective services of armed couriers.
