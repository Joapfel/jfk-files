RE: Page 00361, captioned "Memorandum for: Executive Secretary, 
CIA Management Committee. 
In addition to the "Chilean Project," the contents 
of this page also refer to FBI technical coverage of diplomatic 
establishments of Israel. It is pointed out that Watergate 
Defendant James McCord telephoned the Embassy of Israel, 
Washington, D. C., after his arrest, believing that his 
conversation would be overheard and he would be able to 
challenge tainted evidence. The date of his telephone call 
to the Embassy of Israel is not known but it is pointed out 
that our technical coverage of the Embassy of Israel was 
discontinued on 10/16/72, at the specific request of Secretary 
of State William Rogers. This matter is also public knowledge. 
ASSESSMENT: 
No compromise of FBI operations. 
RE: Pages 00457 and 00458, concerning Item Number 3. 
According to CIA, this matter involved surreptitious 
entries by CIA into a French diplomatic establishment, 
Washington, D. C., during the early 1960's. As :is evident 
from reading Item number 3, there is no FBI involvement in 
or knowledge of such activities by CIA. Cs)
