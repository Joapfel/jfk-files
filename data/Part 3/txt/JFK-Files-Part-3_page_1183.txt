U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT 
ROBERTS. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
• 
Mr. Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the 
San Diego Office of the FBI had furnished information to the 
Los Angeles Office of the FBI for transmission to local auth­
orities concerning a group of BPP members from San Diego who 
were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral. 
Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an 
incident occurred and that information was furnished stating 
that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying concealed 
weapons. He said he thought the furnishing of this information 
resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los 
Angeles. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker could 
recall someone from the FBI in San Diego visiting the mother 
of a girl who was an alleged member of the BPP in San Diego, 
and whether the FBI went to the mother to put pressure on 
another member of the family. 
Mr. Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a 
case but could not recall the details and could not be 
certain this had occurred. 
Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any 
technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego. 
Mr. Baker stated that he knew of none and added that 
such coverage was not needed in San Diego because there were 
good sources in the BPP who could furnish excellent coverage. 
Mr. Baker stated that he believes he would have known of any 
such installations covering the BPP in San Diego. 
Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker knew of San Francisco 
using any such techniques against the BPP. 
Mr. Baker replied that he believed that San Fran­
cisco had used such techniques.
