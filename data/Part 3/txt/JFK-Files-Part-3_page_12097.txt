! The fact that the work on a desk is measured by more than just 
! caseload can best be illustrated by citing figures of incoming and outgoing 
mail for Special Coordination Unit, Nationalities Intelligence Section, for 
which no case load is reported. In that Unit there were 1173 items 
consisting of 1777 pages of regular incoming mail; 52 items consisting 
of 137 pages of other incoming mail; 117 items consisting of 233 pages of 
outgoing dictated mail; and 290 items consisting of 456 pages of outgoing 
nondictated mail. ' 
As can be seen from the above, since the time of reorganization 
when equity in caseloads was established and manpower assignments made, 
there has been no decrease in the amount of work responsibilities in the 
Espionage and Nationalities Intelligence Sections. The December, 1970, 
reorganization resulted in the assignment of significant extra work to those 
two Sections. The substantial increases in caseloads in Racial Intelligence, 
Internal Security and New Left Sections have resulted from the opening of 
new investigations on members of basic revolutionary groups and the 
removal of the moratorium on Security Index reporting, approved l;>.y the 
Director, plus increased efforts in these areas by the field.
