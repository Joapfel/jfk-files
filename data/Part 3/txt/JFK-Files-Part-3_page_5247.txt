·~SAC ROBERT E. GEBHA' :he ~SA adv~led t:is office by 
\ \ I l letter dated! 7 / 16 / 6 9 that the 
FBI should no longe~ present minor theft c~ses to the USA's 
office and that these cases should be defetred to local 
courts. The office has followed the polic1 set down by the 
IBA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case. 
• 
In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor 
theft cases, as the local business community has been made 
aware of the policy of the USA and has ndt been referring 
minor cases to the office. / 
Occasionally some minor case is received from 
someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not 
prosect+ting case~ having a value of less than $100. In the 
future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft~ 
the case will be imrnediately presented to the USA and after 
his declination~ the office will advise the comulainant and 
the USA's offic~ in writing and where appropriate, refer the 
complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdictio~ 
over the violation. This procedure will be in line with t'i1e 
r-cqui~cments in the Haw.1a.l- o.f Tnspect;ion: Section 94 .
