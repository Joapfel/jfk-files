_That is what we meant by~ free governm~:.nt, and our 
forefathers were convinca4 that·it can exist o~li through the 
greatest tolerance of· ·spe.ech and opinion. They placed th-eir 
faith in the people to remain alert to ~ncroachments on their 
liberty.· 
The found~rs of our country kne~ that. the greatest 
dange~ to freedom comes from the efforts of government to 
suppress the opinions of its opponent~. They ~et up a 
sys_tem which limited the. powe-rs of -government,-. bound it in 
the.constrain~s of the law, and pro~i~it~d it from i~fringing· 
on the rights.of p~ople to free ·expression~ And through 
the. separation of power., the ·system . o~ c~e_cks and balances, 
they tried to assure·that the Executive would·be accountable 
to the people through the Congress . - . . 
For tb,e 200 years-of our existence as a nation the 
preservation of liberty has.been a constant struggle._ Whether 
. 
it has, been the Alian and Sedition Acts during the French 
Revolution, th~ Red Scare and the Palmer Raids of World War 
I, or McCarthyism after World War ,-:r;r, or Army_ spyi~g during 
the Vietnaiu ~?ar, tjle gov_ernment .has let a· fear .of unorthodox 
opinion lead it into the trap of infringing upon the 
Constit~tion in the name of internal security. 
The issues we confront today are a part of a continuing 
drama of ~..merican democ~acy. lt is proof, if we aver needed 
it, that the price of liberty is ·eternal vigilance.
