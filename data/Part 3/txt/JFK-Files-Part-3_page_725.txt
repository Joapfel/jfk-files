Did he retire early? 
No. He ·was in a position to 
retire and retired because he· 
wanted to take advantage of a 
cost of living increase by retiring 
prior to a certain date, such as 
June 30. 
Were the BPP and US, Inc. both 
violence oriented groups? 
Very definitely. There was extreme 
friction between the BPP and US, 
Inc. at all times. 
Do you recall some cari.catures 
used in connection with COINTELPRO? 
Yes. 
Who had the program at that time? 
I believe SA Burns had it theno 
What were the cartoons? 
I recall seeing them but do not 
recall any specific cartoon. 
Do you think anything done in 
COINTELPRO could have had a 
reaction causing someone to kill 
an individual in the other group? 
Because of the extreme antagonism 
between the two groups, anything 
we did would have had about the 
same effect as a gnat biting an 
elephant. I do not think COINTELPRO 
thad that kind of impact.
