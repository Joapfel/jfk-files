Isn't this an awfuily overwhelming quant~ty of people.

you shouldn.' t have informants in. the Klan and know what's 
going on .. for vio"lenc~.' bu:t· it seems to me that· thi.s is ,the

and th~t here· we had 2 ~ 000. just in the Kla-n -alone. 
Mr .. Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did inc_lude all 
-racial ~atters, informants a~ that particular time~ and I 
think the ~igures we tr~ed to ·reconstruct as to the actual 
number of IUan informants in relation to Klan members was aroun 
6 percent, I think, after we had read some of the· testimony. 
Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a 
group called the Action Group. This was the group that.you 
remember from Mr~ Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-
ter the meeting. He attended the open meetings and heard 
all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information, 
but he never knew what was going on because each one had an 
action group that went out aI).d con.sidered th.emselvcs in the 
missionary field. 
Theirs was the violence. 
In order to penetrate those, it takes, you have to direct 
as many informants ~s you possibly can against it_ Bear in
