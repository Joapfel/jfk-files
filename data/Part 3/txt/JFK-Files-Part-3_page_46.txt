The Director has inquired concerning the proqedure which~~=~~~~,.;: 
was followed in the Atomic Energy Act applicant case whereby ~!

ii,~~= ! 
the Washington Field Office was not alerted to the fact that ~t;:~~s.-:..­
Harold Ickes, ~hose name was give~ as a reference, should not b 
interviewed o 
There is attached a memorandum dated December 20, 1949 from 
Mro Rosen to Mro Ladd with respect to the specific Atomic Energy case 
mentioned~ namely Fred Ernest Schnepfe, who had given Harold Ickes 
\ 
as a reference on his PS(J or: application fo1·m. From a reading of tlu( 
attached memorandum which was prepared by Section Chief G. C. Callan:· 
of the Applicant Section., it; is ·obvious that the Supervisors who handJe 
1 
applicant matters .in the- Investigative Division do not have any policy 
with respect to the interviewi,ng of references, former employers, 
associates or others except where the Bureau has sp~oifically indicated 
that certain individuqls should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele 
Commager, personnel Dy/ CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the • 
present policy in effect at the Seat of Government concerning applicant 
investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandum 
indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past in conne.c­
tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative 
crt·t;it1.:,de.. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken 
with respect to the supervisory personnel at the Seat of Government con­
cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Washington Field . 
Office ·for interview in connection w~th th.e Atomic Energy Act case~ 
mentioned o 
r' 
As you know., at the Executives Conference the Director's wishes 
with. regard to interviewing persons who· _have demonstrated hos ti le -
attitudes to~ard the Bureau have been considered in the past ~nd no 
instruc·tions have been issued to the Supervisors .at the Seat of Govern­
ment o~ to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in­
di~iduals· whose names have been sent to the field in the recent past 
-in an SAG Lettero This matter was called to the attention of the 
Executives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Oonf~r­
ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau to embark upon a pro­
gram of advising the field to not interview certain •indiu~duals in 
connection with various types of investigations conducted by the ~ureau. 
The ]pxecuti ves Conference realized that the ho stile a ttttuje toward -the 
Bureau stems not j'rom our criminal investigative ·work but from the • 
Eureau's inve?tigative activity in the J'ield of appJ.:ican·t inuestiga.tions• 
and the Loyr;i,l~y Progr·am. The Conference j'eels that· 'the, blaclclistin.g . 
of individuals is fundamentally bad and will ultimately result in ex­
tren;e embarrassment to the Bureau. Iit£i~:, also fel~. i,.t .. ~.s, :~tremely
