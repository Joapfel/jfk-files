HR. GR7\Y: In n.arch ths station cabled the rs.quest 
of r-lro Dearborn, who was then Counsel General, that Trujillo's 
rela~ions having been _severed, cabled his request for three

a spscific prohibition imposed by the Special Group, and the 
\, 
Agency would not on its own authority have considered it possibl· tc
