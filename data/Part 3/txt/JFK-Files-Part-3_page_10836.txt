might be of interest to us either u.s subjects :for \ 
investigation or as potential-informn.nts. This liaison 
at the field level was deemed desirable so that we 
could get information at the "horse's mouth" rather 
than wait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which is 
often prolonged and, when transmitted, is sometimes 
stripped of pieces of information. This occurs 
because of the involved and sometimes complicated 
.maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA.

In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its 
Domestic Operations Division (DOD), which was to be 
• responsible for any clandestine development of sol.U"ces 
in the United States. Prior to the establishment of 
'this Division 1 CIA, ;'lctiv:i.ty i.n this field was managed 
:from each individual area division at Washington 
headquarters., The pressing need f,or more clandestine 
sources, coupled with the recognition of the vast 
potential in the United States, prompted CIA to create 
a new division which would be responsible for all of 
the area division interests., DOD has headquarters 
at Washington.I'D. c., and currently has field offices 
at New York City, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington 11 D. c., proper. 
Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assigned to 
the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment 
of positive intelligence sources, primarily in the 
diplomatic field. Some of the personnel are assigned

DOD is also responsible for the handling of 
CIA agents (informants) who have been recruited abroad 
and who come to the United States for assignments either 
on a temporary basis or for the duration of a normal • 
diplomatic assignment.
