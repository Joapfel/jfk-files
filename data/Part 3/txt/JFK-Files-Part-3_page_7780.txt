Space required should be sufficient to accommodate 
three desks and three chairs plus two or three file cabinets; 
') rt ' and including the necessary desks, chairs and cabinets. 
dVt1 Space should approximate that currently used to accommodate 
1' Section Chief •s offices in the INTD. 
~ Because the SSC Staff has already commenced some of 
'
its review of Bureau material and has already engaged in some 
briefings, it is essential that urgent attention be given this 
request. INTD has already surveyed its space and would be · 
unable to accommodate the need involved. 
ACTION: 
Upon approval, Administrative Division will 
immediately take necessary steps to provide for the necessary 
space and equipment described above.
