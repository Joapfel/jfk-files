The wires from tht: microphones ran.· out. inside the exier ior building -wa l rs •

acces·s· to the sounds of m~chines and c·onveraations in the ·Embas·sy up·:to· ·the.;;

rooms where u. s. int~rcept operations were going on. Th.:?. s'tate Department Is 
resident security technician on the scene (Mr·. Musser) is stU.1 surveying: the 
situation, ·including. th~ significan~e .of the· coax.ial cables and grid··antenn'a 
which have been uncovered in the walls of the Embassy. There is as yet; no.:,·· 
real evidence that the Soviets' were able to pick up b_;:_~_sh s·parks from the u·. S. :/

(There was an operable ·microphone; right next to the printer locati.on prior to 
.-installation of the shielded room.) 'J:he microwave signal which is know:o to 
have been beamed at the Embas gy since 19 5 7 may be a diversionary activity, o'r it 
could be illuminating passive devices. (TheJt;rouble is that Mr. Hus t:1 er does 
not have the ;-esourcas. to determine the use to which the sign~l is being p·u·t.) 
An effort should ½e made to intercept the· signal outside the Embassy building 
in a l!.ne· with the direction of the beam 1;.rhtch is coming from a Soviet"."guarded 
apartment building nearby. (For a, J.ong time n

Dr •. Wie'sner said that even. if our Embassy secui;itY. people :had dug a'• fr~rlih 
arourid·the rooms where microphones were.installed this -woui<l probab\y not ·have

Dr. Wiesner feels that Mr. Musa er is an able mnn ,,but. doesn I c: have the 
resources·to help him do the job. There is a need for trained people to ui:se 
adequate detection Jevices, and experts to oversee the job. There should.be 
installed such equipment: as a standard video alarm'in Embassy rootn.:J, and it . 
should be possible to develop arid use transistorized devices to det2ct rHdirition. •

(Mr. Musser stated his belief that there could be. a dupli'cate of the Soviet • 
system as y~ t undiscovered.) Pr-. Wiesner thinks thst ,the te le type machines are 
well protected in the electto-shielcled rooms. But Mro Musser needs· help .which 
·/ ~1.e seems r2luctant to ask for because "hit-and-run" visits by varioua experts 
would h{nder the efforts he.is now trying to makei 
Chairman Clifford asked what measure8 Dr. Wiet3ner would take 1.f he 
were ~hargedwith responsibility.for security of the Moscow Embassyy Dr. Wiesner 
said that he would (1) complain to the Soviets about the microvave signal (2) 
do a ·more thorough tearing down of a.room to see if other _systems are present, 
and (3) scan the walls snd floors ·,,.;rith. rJl appropriate radiation device, e.g.;

be sure even.then that an:eavesdropping systemwao not installed. He arided
