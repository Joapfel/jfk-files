TOP SECRET 2212 
MR. BELIN: With particular reference to the Trujillo 
assassination, do you know of any approval that was ever given 
by the State Department for American participation with any 
group that might be involved in overthrowing the government and 
assassinating Trujillo in the process? 
MR. RUSK: t11lell, I knew that our intelligence people 
7 were in touch with a variety of Dominicangroups,·both·.in:.the 
8 Dominican Republic and abroad, and any one of them :::.would have 
9 been glad, I think, to assassinate Trujillo. But I was not 
10 aware of any operational involvament of the United States 
11 government in his assassination.

MR. BELIN: If records were to show any cables going 
from the State Department under your name to any Ambassador in 
the Dominican Republic, would you state that those indicated 
personal knowledge on your part? 
MR. RUSI<; Well 
MR. BELIN: And I don't know, by the way, whether or 
18 not such cables·existed. I am using it as a hypothetical 
19 example. 
20 MR. RUSK: During my years, over 2,100,000 cables 
21 went out of the Department of State with my name signed to them, 
22 and I had seen only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of them before 
23 
24 
25 
they went out~. Now, I am responsible, I mean I cannot avoid 
the responsibility for what was done in a·Department of which 
I was Chief.
