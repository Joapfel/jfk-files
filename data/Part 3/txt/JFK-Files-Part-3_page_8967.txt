Reference is made to Legal Counsel memorandum to 
Mr. J.B. Adams, 3/12/75, and my memorandum, 3/25/75, both 
captioned as above. 
'

'-I} 
By referenced memorandum dated 3/12/75, Legal Counsel '-
recommended that the Intelligence Division (INTD) discuss with '-
representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other j 
members of the intelligence community procedures for clearing t'-\~ 
staff members of captioned committees for access to classified ~ 
information when questions as to the individual's trustworthiness 
have arisen in the course of the FBI's background investigation.~\\ 
Following such discussions, Legal Counsel recommended that a ~ 
Memorandum of Understanding concerning these matters be prepared~ 
by the INTD which might be used by both Senate and House j / ~ 
Committees. V/ 8 
By memorandum 3/25/75, the INTD submitted for approval 6' 
a draft of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding concerning ~ 
clearance procedures for staff members of captioned committees. g 
Special Investigative Division disagreed with several features ~ 
of our draft memorandum and has prepared a revised memorandum, z 
which is attached for ~pproval. ~ 
The INTD has coordinated this matter with the Special 
Investigative Division and interposes no objection to the text 
of the revised memorandum; however, it is suggested that considera­
tion be given to adding the words "by the FBI" at the end of 
paragraph five on page one. Paragraph five, thus modified, would 
read: "Where there is a question of trustworthiness for access 
to classified information, th~ Committee Chairman will have the 
summary memorandum :·furnished to the Di;rector of Central 
Intelligence (DCI) by the FBI." i/.,. t
