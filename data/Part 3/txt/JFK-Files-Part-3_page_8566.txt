MEMORANDUM FOR: Director 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
SUBJECT RIHA, Thomas 
" 
• 1. Reference is made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of 
27 October 1958 concerning an attempt by a member of Czech 
Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the 
latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives 
en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as an East-West 
Exchange Student. The following report describes further 
action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and 
was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source. 
2. Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the

the CSR in Prague last summer. According to our sour(:e, it 
was apparently an accidental meeting at a 1vioscow railroad 
station as the Czech was returning to Prague. The Czech was 
delighted to see Subject, and introduced him to a Soviet 
official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first 
name and a telephone number, both unknown to our source. 
The Soviet described his work as being in the American 
Section of the :MVD. 
• 3. This Soviet 6fficial has been cultivating Subject 
(trying to see him as often as possible, sometimes twice a 
week) since their introduction in December, by offering such 
blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine 
into forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter­
tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible 
archives, the use of private country villas and all the 
"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want. 
Subject has further-been promised the opportunity of returning 
to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future 
date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his 
expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the 
Soviets.
