NOIE: Addresses are most recent available in personnel files of these former Agents. The Newark teletype mentioned was sent 
up with an informative note advising that we had checked with Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, and 
he :i,itterposed no objection to our contacting former Ag0r;,ts who 
;,a ... :,~ici4tated. i~ the special S<JU:ad we had at Atlantic. C:Lty ~n 
8/64 and advising them they might be approached for interview 
bf the SSC. Assistant Director Mintz concurred in the Intelligence Division recommendation that we, on approval, contact the former 
Agents as indicated in this outgoing teletype. Deputy Associate 
Director J.B. Adams advised of his agreement with this recommen­dation and for instructions to go forward to the field. 
Howard J. Wilson one of the former ~ents designated to be contacted, resigned for family reasons after being censured, 
s.uspended, placed on probation, and transferred for unsatisfactory 
work performance detected during an inspection of the Newark Office. 
&wever, there is no evidence in his personnel file suggesting 
1{4lson is hostile to the Bureau and the INTO believes he should be 
irteluded among those former Agents to beceontacted.
