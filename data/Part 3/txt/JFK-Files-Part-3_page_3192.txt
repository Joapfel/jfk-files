: 1804, 
of?· 
Mr. Adams. l don't know what oth~r agencies have, but 
the FBI does not have such a list, does not have such a 
c~pability to interface wit~ such.a list if such a list­
exists. 
Senator Goldwater. Do you feel rather safe in saying 
then that no agency of gov~rnment has put together such a 
computerized total of all the information on the people that 
you have surveilled? 
Mr. Adams. Oh, I think it is safe to say I don't know 
of any. Today I am not saying what does exist or doesn't 
exist elsewhere. 
Senator Goldwater. -In addition to the 500,000 ri::cords 
that you 4ave, would I be correct in saying that you have 
50 million data cards and that. there's $82 million spent on 
intelligence in the Fiscal year 1975 in maint~ining this 
library? 
Mr. Adams. No, I don't think that-:is correct. I think 
the figure of $82 million is what our budget people have 
drawn up as being the total cost in a given year of our 
intelligence operations, ~ecurity, criminal, organized crime, 
the whole intelligence field. But I don't relate it to the 
~aintenance of any data _cards . 
Se-nator Goldwater·. Now one other. area, and I think it 
probably, according to th~ records, it does go back to '-7-0 .
