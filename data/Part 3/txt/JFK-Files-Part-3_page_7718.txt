Dear 
I have just today received your letter dated May 28. 
It apparently reached the Department·of Justice on June 8. 
' It requests "the delivery forthwith to the members whose 
names are listed in the attachment hereto of any files on 
them or documents concerning them that are in the possession, 
custody, or control of the Department of Justice, including 
the Federal Bure~u bf Investigation.TI 
The Department wants to cooperate with you on this 
.matter. But I think we first ought to clarify the scope 
of you:i:- request.

Dep~rtment. I would suggest that we can 
reach an understanding on issues of this kind by consulta-

+ions be-t;wee_n us. 
, Your !letter says that "Whether as a matter of agree­

for the proposed withholding balanced against the Committee's 
need to exercise its mandatre." 
I take that to mean you would like us to go over the 
files and to raise with the Committee such problems with dis­
closure as may or may not exist. I realize this request is
