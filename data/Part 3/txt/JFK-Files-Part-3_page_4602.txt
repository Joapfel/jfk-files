tt Minor Role 
"Miss ARCHER became involved in the Cuban revolution 
through Cuban friends she had met during visits to 
Cuba and Miami. Her part was only a minor one, she 
says. 
"She is reluctant to publicly bring up her past asso­
ciations with the Cuban revolution, but agreed only 
to convey to Americans the message that the Cuban 
people simply have nothing against Americans. 
" 'More and more people are breaking away from the 
CASTRO regime each day. They are escaping into the 
hills and out of the country by any means possible. 
Thousands have been granted political asylum in this 
country.' 
"Miss ARCHER said she holds high hopes for the future 
liberation of the Cuban people. Although she said 
she is not associated now with revolutionary movements 
and knows of no specific plans to overthrow CASTRO she 
added it is readily known that such movements are 
active. 
" 'Many of the groups have been organizing in Miami,' 
she said. 
"Friends she had been associated with in aiding the 
revolution have all defected from Cuba since her visit 
last fall. It is for this reason, she said, she would 
not dare return to Cuba as long as CASTRO is in power. 
ti 'Crazy With Power' 
"When asked why CASTRO has failed to keep his promises 
and to bring freedom to Cuba, Miss ARCHER replied that 
'he has perhaps gone crazy with power.' 
"She added that his luster as a hero is wearing_ off. 
"Miss ARCHER is employed as a hostess in a Shore restau­
rant. She was born in Newark and moved here about 14 
years ago. She lives with her mother, Mrs. ANNA ARCHER."
