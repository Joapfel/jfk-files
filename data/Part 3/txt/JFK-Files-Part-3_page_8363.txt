It appears that we are proposing to give the copy of the Gale .... A, .. f" 21\ , 
memorandum to the Senate Select Committee in response to their (J t'j11>1~f~ 
request by letter dated May 14, 1975, for a memorandum prepare('by'\J 1,' ,{t~ 
Gale relative to the subject matter of the 1964 memorandum. ;J ~i 1r.-. · . ~ 
]4y, reading of the memorandum revealed that it_ is a purelJ (~ 1,.-
deliberative document which quotes personal views of Mr. Sullivan, lY~t 
r. Rosen, Mr. Be moiw, and Mr. Gale. I am concerned that the V / 
release of such a memorandum containing not only the personal views of / 
Bureau officials, but also identifying them by name could have an impact 
on individuals in the future who may be asked to furnish their opinions. 
concerning policy matters in the FBI. As indicated by the Attorney General 
in his speech in New York, it is essential that the Executive Bianch have a 
degree of privacy concerning policy discussions and expressions of 
personal views by officials in order for the Executive to function properly. 
I do recognize that we may not be able to resist giving the 
Committee access to material documents that bear on particular issues 
under investigation, however, I do reco~end that when we are required 
to produce deliberative documents, the names and other identifying data 
relating to inclividuals furrµshing views be deleted. ~ ,_,,,,,.
