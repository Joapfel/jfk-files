r 
obnoxious than the one originally proposed. The Directive 
noted, in part, ''CIG field representatives will establish 
and maintain.liaison with the intelligence officers of local 
-Army and Navy headquarters and Air Forco headquarters, if 
present, through th~ medium of local intcragcncy offices." 
The analyzing memorandum ~ointed out, ''If this. means the 
CIG is going to maintain field representatives in the United 
Stat0s or establish offices, it certainly is something new and 
a provision that we did not understand was intended i~ the 
Presidentts Directive ... Attached to the proposed Directive 
is a discussion which is more or less the same as was attached 
to the original-proposed Directive. It, however, makes the 
following statement which the Bureau cannot subscribe to and 
it would seem must oppose, that is, 'Foreign Intelligence 
Information related to the national security, although it may 
be collected from sources whose headquarters are within the 
limits of the United States,and its possessions, is definitely 
a part of the national intelligence mission, the coordination 
~-of which is specifically a function of the National Intelli­
gence Authority under the provisions of the President's letter 
of 22 January 1946. '" 
In pointing out the Bureau's objections, ·the 
analyzing memorandum of August 22, 1946, stated, "Ther~ 
is now involved in this Directiv~ the fundamental question 
of just what rights the Central Intelligence Group has with 
reference to operations within the United States. Carrying 
to a logical conclusion the statements set forth above contained 
in the discussion, they could cover all foreign embassies in 
the United States, take charge of double agents we are operating 
or radio stations we are operating as double agent set-ups, etc., 
because essentially these operations engaged in by the Bureau 
do not directly involve enforcement of the laws but rather are 
concerned with obtaining information in the nature of foreign 
intelligence which, of course, is related to internal security 
as is all foreign intelligence. Essentially, the Bureau's 
domestic operations in intelligence involve the determining 
. of the aims, intentions, and activities of foreign countries
