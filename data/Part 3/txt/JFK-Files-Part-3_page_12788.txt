to Its knees. Tbe dams, power

for carrying out routine business, 
and are an extremely Important 
{actor, In the fascist reaction lo

Ue within the capabilities of urban 
euer111as. 
The dlsruptlon of Ibis system 
would hamper and cripple not only 
the fascist military llut would also 
effect all Industrial 011tputs. 
The fascist rullng cllqne realizes 
the wnerab!Uty of their trans­
portatloa networks, yet au fas­
cist mllltary forces and Industry 
utlll ze tbe railways, the state and 
Interstate highway systemsandthe 
airports. Urban euerlllas can cut 
and constantly harass these Im­
portant links, 
Urban guerilla teams hlgbly mo­
tivated have already begun to put 
their theory Into practice. Lists 
are belnc compiled and are con­
stantly lll)dated on fascist and all 
enemies of our people, becallse 
the location and ldentlflcatloa of 
the enemy Is an extremely vital 
task of urban euerlllas. This basic 
Intelligence Is necessary for plan­
D!ngretallamr:,strlkes acainst our 
enemies. Where their killer 
rroups, for the most, will be un­
able to locate guerillas, urban gue. 
rlllas Will, In every attack bit the 
fascist squarely on \lie cllln. Urban 
guerillas, being one with the peo. 
pie, must attack like skilled brain 
surreoas--cuttlnc out thedlseased 
tissue while perservln1t the good. 
Their dual purpose Is that of 
destroylnc all fascist forces and 
their lackeys, while protectlngand 
servtnr our people. The fascist 
rullnr clique fears this, They know 
the Party Is preparlltg to fight 
unlU the last of our enemies bites 
tbe dust. Tbe Party has dared to 
take the vancuard role In the strur-
11e and will surely defeat u.s A. 
fascism no matter what the odds, 
no matter haw great tlie sacri­
fice. 'I1>e Party Is awa;e that the 
fascists will never lay down their 
arms of their own accord. And 
also aware of the dlrecUon that

In Brazil, the cuerUla forces 
found through social pracUce that 
they could best achieve the eoal 
<Sf liberating their people from the 
stronr-nota Imposed by the fas­
cist Brazilian oligarchy by warlnc 
urban cuerllla warfare. Brazil's 
development as an Industrial fas­
cist nation and the ecoaomlc and 
social backwardness of the Indig­
enous peasants made the revolu­
tionary !orces adapt the strateey 
of urban guerrilla warfare. The 
urbAn guerrlllas moved to mobl• 
llze lhe workers, and Implement 
urban cuerrllla warfare within the 
context of their historical exper­
iences with the working class and 
the fascist rullng class oligarchy, 
The revolutlooary forces have Im­
plemented this type of struggle 
which Invariably catches the fas­
cists with lllelr pants down. The
