4-E 
Information we furnished to the Department of State 
apparently has prevented the return to the United States of two 
Polish commercial officials formerly assigned to. New York City. 
°1'{e told State how the one, a Polish military intelligence 
officer, with the assistance of the other had since mid-1969 
been very active in trying to purchase electronic equipment of' 
defense significance and ship it to Poland in violation of 
export licensing requirements. On 3/27/70, State informed the 
Polish Ambassador to the U. S. that the activities of these two 
Poles must cease. Both left the country. We have subsequently 
learned through our sources that one 1 expected to return to 
• U. S., has been reassigned and will not return. The other has. 
not returned. Thus, the usefulness of two Polish agents in the 
U. S. was destroyed by our investigations. 
2. Double Agents 
One measure of our effectiveness in countering the 
activities of the intelligence personnel among the hundreds of 
communist bloc representatives in the U. S. is our ability to 
continue to develop and operate double agents against hostile 
agents. T4is is a matter of vital concern and continuous 
attention in the Espionage Section. Since the last inspection 
we have continued to improve our position in this regard, as 
the following chart shows:
