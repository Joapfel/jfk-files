1].'he collection process involves acquiring open informa­
tion wherever this is possible. This information largely comes 
from abroad but also here in the United States from knowledge­
able citizens and Government officers whose missions are well 
understood and accepted in international life, such as Foreign 
Service Officers, Defense, Treasury, and even Commercial and 
Agricultural Attaches. To this is added the information col­
lected by technical means. Today these give us access to 
areas never before seen. Electronic marvels identify details 
we never hoped to know, and computers select and store masses 
Af aet~il never before manageable. These ways to collect are 
supplemented by clandestine collection for those matters and 
in those societies where open or technical collection cannot 
provide the secret war plans, the research idea before it is 
visible, or a perception of authoritarian political dynamics. 
After the material is collected, it must be processed 
or analyzed. Again the electronic and computer worlds have 
added new dimensions to our potential to extract valuable 
information from hitherto incomprehensible indicators, al-,. 
though, alas,~ the computer··has .,also increased the incompre­
hensibility of some of the systems we try to identify.
