out of the question. Vle definitely would require .... / 
increase in supervisory personnel in the Domestic ru 
Intelligence Division. In addition, there would be a 
need for more manpower in our Laboratory to handle 
expansion in tho technical surveillance field. There 
would be a need f~r additional personnel to be assigned 
for the develop;:nent of live sources in the field. It 
would b0 necessary to have field p0r~onncl assigned to 
technical surveillance installations on a continued basis 
and, of course,·there would be a need for support related 
to such activities as preliminary security surveys. 
It is outside the scope of this Committee's 
·competency to outline any specific administrative re­
organization and propose what personnel, equipment and 
facilities would be needed. We feel that this could be 
best handled only after the objectives of the program are 
·approved. At that point, officials from the Seat of 
Government and the field could meet to map out the necessary 
reorganization. The extent of reorgaaization will hinge on 
our decision as to the pace we should set. We recom..~end 
that ·we proceed at a steady, even pace, making certain that 
\VA J ~-Y solid ~roundwork for all of our activity. We should 
refrain from becoming involved in a rrcx-ash" program unless 
national security interests obviously warrant such an 
approach. 
In connection with any planning for reorganization, 
it would be unwise to proceed without first obtaining a 
reliable inventory of our current resources. Such an 
inventory would encompass the following: (1) The number 
of Agents curTently assigned to strictly positive intel­
ligence collection; (2) Our foreign language capabilities; 
(3) Our current sources.and informants with an objective 
assessment; of capabilities; (4) Number of supervisors at 
the Seat ·of Government currently handling positive ·intel­
ligence matters.
