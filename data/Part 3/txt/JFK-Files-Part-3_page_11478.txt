THE HUSTON PLAN: 
• 
Here again, considerable information has appeared 
in the press regarding the Huston Plan. This Plan originated 
in the White House during former President Nixon's administration. 
After a series of meetings which culminated in an implementing 
order from the White House, Mr. Hoo.er objected to the Attorney 
General which resulted in the White House recalling the 
implementing letter. 
NSA WATCH LIST: 
The NSA Watch List also has been the subject of some 
press coverage. It involves a list of American citizens 
maintained by the National Security Agency for the purpose of 
monitoring messages carried over international communications. 
This procedure is also the subject of a current investigatdon 
by the Department. 
/ 
The call for a temporary prosecutor by Senator Church 
is not being addressed in this memorandum but will be the 
subject of a separate memorandum prepared by the Office of 
Legal Counsel. 
ACTION: 
For information.
