' 
everyone·is concerned about the murder qf the civil rights 
workers, the· 1.ini6 Kent. ::ase, th~ Viola Liuzzo case, the 
bombihgs o.f the church ·in Birmingham_. We wer.e 'facied wi:th one 
tr.eme~dous problem at that time. 
Senator Schweiker. I acknowledge that. 
.Mr. Adams. Our only approach was through informants 
and through the use of informants we solved these cases, the 
ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have 
never solved. They are extremely difficult.· 
These informants·, a~ we told the Att.orney General, and 
as we told the President, that we had moved informants like 
Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was ti1e bodyguard to the 
head man. He was in a position where he could iorewarn· us 
of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and 
yet we knew and conceived that this could.continue forever 
I: 
unless we can create enough disruption t..hat these members will 
realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers, 
even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are 
in on it, if that were the case and with some of them it was 
the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and 
that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure 
and just like you say, 20 percent, they thought 50 percent of 
their i'nernbers ul tima-tely were Klan members c;i.nd they didn't 
24 dare engage in these acts -of violence b~cause they knew they 
25 -couldn't control the conspiracy an¥ longer.
