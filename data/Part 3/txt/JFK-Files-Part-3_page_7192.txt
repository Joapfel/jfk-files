usually espionage. This subordination degraded the function 
to its lowest level, to such necessary but elementary work 
as nametracing and operational bookkeeping. But these 
are only the elementary building blocks of the masonry of 
counterintelligence. If it is restricted to nothing more 
than that, American counterintelligence will inevitably 
degenerate to parochialism and departmentalism. It will 
not be responsive to a central and v~tal philosophy. It 
will tend to yield the initiative tprthe adversary and to 
the writing of damage reports after 1~e have been hurt 
instead of seeking the adversary out and engaging him 
before he can hurt us. 
In summary, the value of counterintelligence as 
an integral part of national defense requires a continuity 
of doctrine, an organization of experience; a-nd must be . 
sustained by a full-time~ experienced caare of specialists 
with continuing emphasis on interagency understanding and 
coordination.
