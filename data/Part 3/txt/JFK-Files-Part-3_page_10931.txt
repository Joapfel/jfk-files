e. The Director's Stand Over the Years 
The Director's stand over the years with respect 
to jurisdiction concerning foreign intelligence matters 
within the United States is reflected in numerous comments 
he has made dating back to the days when the Central 
Intel:I.igence Group_ .(CIG) was being formed. 
In June, 1946, General Vandenberg, then head of 
CIG, sent a memorandum to the Director proposing that the. 
National Intelligence Authority issue a directive extending 
the powers and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence, 
which position General Vandenberg occupied. The memorandum 
was analyzed on June 21, 1946, in a memorandum from C.H. 
Carson to D. M. Ladd in which it was pointed out that it 
was inevitable.that CIG must enter into the domestic 
picture because of sources of foreign intelligence in that 
• ... field. An addendum was placed on the memorandum by Mr. Edward Ao 
• Tamm and.Mr. C. A. Tolson which was followed by comments by 
the Director which is most pertinent to the subject matter .. 
u.uila:.: G.iscuss ion. Tho ~ddondu.~ re2..c!: • 
0 Mr. Tolson and Mr. •ramm do not concur with 
the conclusion expressed in this memorandum that 
'It is inevitable that the Central Intelligence 
Group must enter into the domestic field picture 
·insofar as intelligence'is concerned because of 
the sources of :foreign intelligence existing in : 
that field.' They feel that a coordinated pro­
gram for the exchange of information between the 
Central Intelligence Authority and the FBI, 
permitting a free and comprehensive exchange of 
information in matters of mutual interest, will 
enable the Bureau to work in the domestic field 
without interference from the Central Intelligence 
Authority in· the same manner that the Bureau works, 
for example, with local police departments or other 
. governmental agencies within defined jurisdictiona.~ ..... lines. We believe that the attached letter to · 1 -· ~-:·::;:--•"· ·,:,-., ••• ,_, •• ,.
