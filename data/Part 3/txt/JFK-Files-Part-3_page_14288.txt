CIA at present is providing $5,000 to the PNC Party made 
up or anti-Jagan Africans in Guiana, and CIA is sending a Negro 
cover representative from New York to_ aid the African Party.

Chicago, is the brains and guts of the Jagan operation.) • 
Haiti 
CIA has surveyed the intentions and capabilities-of 
various Haitian exile groups and has supplied them with token 
amounts of money to test them out. Efforts of. the groups to 
form·a united front have failed, and in the Dominican Republic· 
Juan Bosch·has reversed his -intention to help unseat Devalier 
for t 1he present. Ten days ago CIA dropped 100 rifl~s and 
ammunition to one Haitian exile group which has been given 
sanctuary by a Dominican Republic commander stationed on the 
border. 
Dominican Republic 
In this country there is a lack of democratic institutions, 
political party structure, labor unions, or cooperatives of an 
effective nature. Juan Bosch spends more time debating charges 
by political opponents than in performing the administrative 
. job of running the country. • 
Bosch is an extreme conservative, economically, and refuses 
to spend moneys in excess of assured revenues. A twenty per cent 
unemployment figure is a major problem. Bosch has strengthened 
his Cabinet at the urging of the u. s. Ambassador, and has made 
peace with church elements {with CIA1 s help). 
Opposition to Bosch is from the right and from parts of 
the Army. He has met individual Communis·t moves as -they arise 
(e.g., an attempted infiltration of the Planning Conun1ssion), 
but he is not pursuing an over-all anti-Communist program or 
crusade. Although Bosch is 6onsidered by CIA to be anti-Castro 
and anti-Soviet, he has not clamped down on returning trainees 
from Cuba. 
The twenty per cent unemployment situation provides the 
basis for a coup in the months ahead. Meanwhile the Army 
strong-man Ernbert (one or -Trujillo 1 s assassins) waits in the 
wings. •
