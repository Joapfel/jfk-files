cc;; ZCUi.iL\CJWJJiia.zac. 
It is suggested that consideration be given to issuing 
instructions to the field to institute an intertsive 
full field investigation of this subject particularly 
with respect to his national origin, travel and residences 
in foreign countries and involvement in foreign political 
activities. 
If investigation abroad so justifies, it is 
suggested that consideration be given to intensifying 
our investigation of the subject to include the establishment 
of sources or informants close to him. Physical 
surveillance and the development of highly confidential 
sources should not be overlooked in effecting full 
coverage of Ahmad's current activities. 
This background investigation should insure that 
emphasis is placed on developing information concerning 
.{\J:m1ad i,,$,,income and financial af:t'airs, verification of 
subject's travel to South and/or North Vietnam in 
1968-69 and subject's activities in the Los Angeles, 
California, area during the period of his attendance at 
Occide11t~~ ... PP,lt~,ge Lats.~~~ 
You should insure the field aggressively intensifies 
-this background investigation, y~t it should be emphasized 
that utmost discretion and good judgment should be 
exercised to avoid unfounded charges of 0 harassment" being 
directed against the Bureau.

all-inclttsive; however, you should insure that this matter 
receives close personal supervision.
