RE : SENS.TUD.Y• 7 5 
• 
• 
. 
The .second pos.ition paper :whi'ch was ·prepared by 
John T. Ell·iff begins by a six-page .statement and analysis 
of. the Bureau Is current .author.i·.ty to. conduct domestic in­
telligence investigations. He then lists· four options for 
the Committee. • 
Option 1 is £or Congress to pass legislation ratifying 
the .existing FBI .authority as .se't forth 'by Presidential dir.ectives 
and Executive :orders.· 
Option· 2 .suggests. Congres·s· might g.ive s·erious ·con­
sideration to. creating a separate. S.ecurity· Intelligence Agency 
within the Department ·of Justi.ce. In this Option·, Elliff .sug­
gests: that :the FBI .i ts:e'lf has ·considered this Option as part of 
·the.larger question ·of separating .all FBI intelligence functions 
from law .enforcement .functions ·of the Bureau. • 
Option 3. consider.s the elimination ·of FBI domestic 
inte.lligence. In hi:s· analysi·s ·of this pos.i ti·on, it might be 
poss·ible for the Bureau to. develop the necessary intelligence 
information through :its: normal criminal investig.ations and 
thus remove. the necess:ity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations ·as presently conducted. • . " 
Option: 4 .considers. setting .standards· ·for domestic 
inte·lligence .. investi:gati·ons. In this. Option, Elliff .state·s 
that .the: FBI. should. be .authorized by .statute to. conduct domestic 
intelli·gence "investigations only as Congress· ·finds. that regular 
criminal· inves·.ti.gatlons would not ·.pr.ovide information to an­
ticipate: or pr.e.v.ent .the: use: of. violence in violations of Federal 
law .and that incidents· ·of the use of. violence in .such violations 
are of a .8'erious ·nature .and thr.eaten the se·cur.ity of the. country. 
For .purposes. ·of. the Direc.tor' s ·appearance .on 12/9/7 5 
before the Senate: Select Committee, .it is beli.eved his- response· 
to, .questions. ·concerning. the aforementioned position papers should 
be that the Bureau has -received copies ·and is :r.eviewing. the. vari·ous 
roposals ·and that .it :would not be appropriate .at ·this. ·time for 
he Director to. comment :r~gardi~g. the .substance ·of. the proposals.
