Senator Hart of Colorado. Every group ·that was placed unde 
the effo~ts of the COINTELPRO supported the violent overthrow 
of this country? 
Mr. Adams. The concept of COINTELPRO was directed toward: 
those organizations. I would have to refresh my memory on each 
one of the organizations that were targets of it, but they were 
basically New Left, Communist Party, Socialist Workers Party, 
New Left, black extremists, white hate groups, those were the 
five basics. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. The Southern Christian ·Leader­
ship Conference? 
Mr. Adams. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 
I don't know if it was involved specifically in COINTELPRO. 
Three minor actions were taken against the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. Well, its. leader-,. I"'"think you

minor actions. 
Mr. Adams. That's right, and that gets into the other 
area that the activities taken against him were primarily 
COINTELPRO type activities but weren't really under the control 
of

25 net of the five COINTELPRO nets supported the violent overthrow
