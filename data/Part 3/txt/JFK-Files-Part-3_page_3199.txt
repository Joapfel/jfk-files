of this country? 
Mr. Adams. Well, not just the violent o.verthrow of 'the 
government. It would have been organizations that were threate 
ing and fomenting violence. I. ~don't believe it had to be, 
related to the actual overthrow of the government. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. Is a street demonstration 
violent? 
Mr. Adams. It depends on where you are in relation to 
what is taking place. If there are a lot of activities in 
connection with street demonstrations that are not violent, 
11 ·and there are a lot of street demonstrations that have reported 
12 
13 
in deaths, so it just depends on activity taking place and 
the circumstances. 
14 Our problem is we are given the responsibility by the 
15 Attorney General to monitor demonstrations which have the 
16 potential of violence. The question is, how do you find out, 
17 at what point do _you get in and monitor demonstrations to deter 
18 mine if that has a potential violence?

Senator Hart of Colorado. Well,.obviously what we're 
told was here is, we have received testimony to the effect 
that the FBI went out of.its.way to foment violence itself, 
to encourage -disruptions internally, to encourage hostilities 
and.conflict between.and among these groups in the hope that 
.. 
violence would occur, and therefore you could,say,go back to 
the Director or the press or whomever and say look, this is
