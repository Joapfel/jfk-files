tools of law enforcement to protect people from subversive 
or dangerous: ideas, which I find strange and quite profoundly 
at odds with the philosophy of American government. 
·r sta~ted in politics years ago and the first thing we 
had to do was to get the commu~ists out of our parts and out. 
of the union. We did a very fine job. As far as I know, and 
I'm beginning to wonder, but as far as I know, we had no help 
from the FBI or the CIA. We just rammed them out of the mee·tin .s 
9 on- the grounds that they weren't Democrats and they weren't • 
10 good union leaders when.we didn't want anything to do with them 
11 And. yet, t-ie see time, ancl time again that we' re going .to 
12· protect the blacks from Martin Luther King because he's 
13 dangerous, th.at we've going to protect veterans from whatever 
14 it is, and we' re going to protect the Council of Churches 
15 from the veterans, and so on, qnd it just gets so gummy and 
16 confused and ill-defined and dangerous, that don't you agree 
17 with me that we have to control this, to restrain it, so that 
18 precisely what is expected of the FBI is known by you, by the 
19 public, _and that you can justify your actions when we ask 
20 you? 
21 Mr. Adams. I agree with that, Sena tar, and I would like 1 
w . vi 22 to point out that when the Attorney Gt:neral ma<le his statement 
23 
24 
Mr. Hoover subscribes to it, we foll:.-·:ed that policy for about 
{<"f 
ten years unt,il the President· of the .. .i.te<l States said that· 
25 we should investigate the Nazi Party.
