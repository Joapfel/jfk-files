individu~l peculiarities and governing principle will be positive 
intelligence weighed against intern~l security factors. CIA may, 
however, continue its contractual relationship for purpose of handling 
t.raining, Ed)curement of positive foreign intelligence, (under-
lining adde fuliillment of CIA commi~ments to ~he agent and 
preparation :f<:>r next assignment abroad. .) 
:f. Where CIA will be handling its agentiin U.S .. , CIA 
will service FBI security or counterintellige~ce:requiromcnts and 
will provide FBI all in£ormation b0aring on counterintelligence or 
internal security matters. Where CIA servicing is inadequate for 
FBI intern~l security interests, FBI will have direct access to 
agento (Comment: Rules (d), (e) and (f) represent greatly expanded 
• and ~efined version of rule (c) of January, 1964, agreement. q1d 
,ground rules provided considerable latitude with regard to who\. 
would handle CIA source in ·the U o S. and this has led to some ·, 
disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules clearly provide 
for CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training, 
financing,_ etc., but also for "procurement of positive foreign 
intelligence." In aqdition, they make it clear ;that the FBI should 
not ask for direct access unless there,.· is a specific internal 
security need.} 
4. In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have 
·reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; namely, our recent 
agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the U.S. 
By way of background, there are a number of Soviet exchange students 
currently attending various UoSo universities. Each·student, of 
course, is not only a possible Soviet intelligence agent·but also 
a potential source for the UoS. after he returns to his homeland. 
Accordingly, both FBI and CIA have an interest in these students. 
. . 
Per memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64 
that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to Soviet 
students here. FBI will take responsibility for collecting material 
·regarding each student on expedite basis, furnishing r~sults to 
·I 
CIA as developed. At logical point FBI will confer with CIA to 
decide on case-by-case basis re possible recruitment. If Bureau 
recruits Soviet student, we will resolve· whether we should turn 
. him over to CIA before he leaves U.So Under this procedure, CIA . 
will not make any. inquiries (through its sources in UoS.) unless !
