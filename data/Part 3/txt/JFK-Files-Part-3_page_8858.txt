Reference is made to Bureau letter to The Attor:~• 
General 6/20/75 captioned "United States Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)," forwarding 
letterhead memorandum for approval and forwarding to SSC. 
The Director asked if we have any amplification 
this instruction (to submit items with unusual twist or 
concerning prominent personalities for dissemination to the 
President under the INLET Program) or do we know of ?nY 
submission responsive to this which illustrates interpretation? 
There has been no amplification of this instruction, 
nor any submission under INLET of an item on prominent 
p_ersonalities that would show the interpretation of this 
point. 
With respect to the observation that this matter 
should cause a congressional furor, it is noted that INLET 
has already been afforded considerable publicity, beginning 
in February, 1973, after an office memorandum on the subject 
reached the news media. This publicity is why the Senate 
Committee asked for documents on INLET. The White House and 
Senator Bob Packwood inquired about the Program. A detailed 
defense of INLET appeared in the Cor1:gressional Record. 
By way of background, the INLET instruction that has 
received the most publicity--items with an unusual twist or 
concerning prominent personalities~-was recalled by the author 
of the INLET Program initiating letter as having been 
spepifically dictated by then Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan.
