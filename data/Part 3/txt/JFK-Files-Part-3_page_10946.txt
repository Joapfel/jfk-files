Telephone Surveillances with 
At present, Bureau has only one microphone surveillance in • 
foreign intelligence field and this is in connection with a special 
National Security Agency project di~ected againstlTurki~coded • 
communications. Concerning technical survoilln.nc6s, we aro now 
operating about 70 foreign intelligence installations on various 
diplomatic establishments in this country. T~e majority of these 
are in Washington Field and New York with scattered instal-l~tions 
in Chicago, Miami, P:i.ttsburgh, San Francisco and San Juan. Under 
current Bureau policy, we are limited to 80 foreign intelligence· 
technical surveillances and no microphone surveillanm with the_· 
exception of one on the~rkish United Nations Mission 
In addition, during recent years, we have maintained 
approximately 50 so-called "telex" surveillances on the teletype 
facilities of various foreign establishments. This has been done 
at the specific request of the National Security Agency, in 
connection with its efforts to break foreign codes and to read 
foreign government communications. 
We have had excellent results from these technical 
installations. Any compilation of items of value to the U~S. 
Intelligence Community and policy-making o~±iciais cteveiopeo 
through this coverage would run many hundreds of pages. The results 
have ranged from information regarding plans and activities of 
key foreign countries in the diplomatic tield to information 
regarding intelligence, political, economic and military develop­
ments in the countries concerned. In many instances, we have been 
able to forewarn the White House, the State Department and other 
interested agencies of impending developments and to furnish data 
•giving an insight into the thinking and strategy of key foreign 
officials and governments. This coverage has proved specially 
valuable during crisis periods such as the Cuban missile crisis of 
• 1962 and.during the tense negotiations involving the Panama Canal 
in 1964. On many occasions, top-ranking United States officials 
have commented on the effectiveness of this data. The particular 
importance of this information has been its timeliness to current 
events as well as the fact that it represents a penetl&tion of 
foreign diplomattc circles which is only infrequently available .,·· 't·hrQugh··· 1i ve •s,ources .· · , •· · ,· ...... ·' •· ·· • .-· · · ·' · ·:•· ., · : ._ .. ,._ .. _ ,,. , :._,. : ·· , .. ,: . .. · , · •·. •·, ·. ··,•; ,. ,..,, .... -
, tn some instin6es, of course, thi~ type coverage on a 
particular foreign establishment or official has not paid off. 
We have had cases where this technique has been unproductive for 
·sustained periods of time on a·particular country. This is to be 
expec~ed and we have sought.to overcome this by rotating our.· 
• installations, correlating our technical operations with shifting •• 
international developments and putting coverage on those countries 
which appear to offer the most promise-for worthwhile intelligence.
