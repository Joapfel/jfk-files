It ts realized the above survey reveals ·only a; small part of the 
Division's produ~tion; however, it gives some insight into the amount of 
actual supervision and direction being afforded the field as an overall 
consideration. It is not felt or implied that a "letter writing" program for the sake 
of writing letters be instituted as obviously this does not relate to supervision. 
It may indicate, however, among other things, the amount of intensity of positive 
supervision being afforded, as an over view and is being furnished for ){)Ur 
information as we 11 as for mine. 
The above analysis (manpower) reveals in your Division a need for 
9 men on the McLek case, 2 for Chinese matters and one for Special 
Coordination Unit. On a priority b_asis, inspection surveys reveal the manpower 
is arailable as indicated. It is felt your Chinese program must "get going now" 
in view of impending.developments. 
In addition, our proposals will allow you to assign men permanently 
to McLek and make other necessary shifts in manpower to get away from 
the temporary assignment basis you now nave and which is disruptive to ail 
Sections involved. It is also acknowledged some of the realignment 
indicated has been proposed by your Division in studies made by you prior 
to this inspection.
