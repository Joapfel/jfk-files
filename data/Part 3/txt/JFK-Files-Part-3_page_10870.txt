Relations with Other Agencies ( 
If this program is adopted, other intelligence 
agencies would be officially apprised of the Presidential 
authority granted to the FBI to collect foreign iiltelligence 
in the United States. Other agencie.s would be informed 
:rogardinr.; tho n::i.turo und tho extent of the authori.,~y boin~ 
delegated to the Bureau. It would be necessary to make 
clear that the Bureau was not assuming responsibility for 
the clandestine collection of all foreign intelligence in 
the United St ates, bu·t we were taking a constructive step 
in an effort to incTease the production of foreign intel­
ligence through assets available to us. We would clearly 
point out that the FBI was not talcing this approach as a 
solution to all of the problems relating to foreign intel­
ligence collection·in this country. We would emphasize 
that we would move against targets in line with established 
priorities and that we would do so on a selective basis. 
We would have it understood that operational activities 
would be properly coordinated \:!herever it was obviously 
necessary. 
With regard to the handling of the product of 
technical surveillances, it ~ould be necessary to effect a 
working agreer.1ent with NSAo r.ro do this we might be obliged 
to discuss this at the USIB level so that NSA could obtain 
the required authority to support the hiring of additional 
personnel and purch2se of equipment for the processing of 
our product. Our arrangement with NSA _would include ground. 
·rules for processing, translation, and classification·and 
dissemination. 
Since any announcement that vie were in the foreign 
intelligence field would prompt unusual interest and very 
. likely queries, we should brief CIA regarding the objectives 
of our -program. Our plan will not abrogate the existing 
ground rules which permit CIA to assess and recruit positive 
intelligence sources in this country under certain conditions . 
• -, Since both· Agencies will have. foreign intelligence sources 
in the U.S., we undoubtedly will find it useful to work out 
-an ~greement wh~~eby one Agency kno~s that the.other· has 
coverage in a particular area or establisr..ment. We already 
receive the identities-of CIA sources.· It would not be 
necessary for us to identify our sources, but we could . ••
