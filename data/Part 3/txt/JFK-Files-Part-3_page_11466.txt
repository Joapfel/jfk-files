apparently indicates Cointelpro actions llirected to cause hostile 
action to a target, probably by third parties. Categqries 5 and 6, 
Faetionalization and Propaganda, repr.esent approxim;ately 1, 550 
of the total actions, appert.r to relate to efforts of the FBI to cause 
dissension within organizations or to. expose through publicity the 
activities of .a targeted group or individual. The seventh category, 
Cominfil, undoubtedly is a reference to FBI efforts to expose or 
disrupt communist efforts to infiltrate a non.communist organization, 
it J:;,eing noted this category is only tabulated for the Communist Party, 
USA, Progl'anl. 
The SSC categories differ :from those of the Petersen 
report in that the first three clearly are in terms indicating a viola­
tion of First Amendment rights with possible criminal and/ or civil 
liability. The four other categories do not necessarily indicate 
criminal or civil wrongdoing, but probably indicate actions outside 
the charter of the FBL Reg~ding ~he Comin.fil category, the SSC 
has been cx-itical of our use ()f "Communist Inflltrationn which the 
Committee views .as a pretext for such investigations as those 
involving the Southern Christian Leadership Confer.enee, 
r~arttn Lutber King, Poor Peoples JM:arch, and \Vomen's Liberation 
I~ovement.

This chart consists of five individual charts representing the basic 
domestic Cointelpros and graphically illustrates the characterizations 
of actions conducted in each program. 
The five-charts illuetratethe differ.ences in the figures 
for Cointelpro actions as tabulated by the Petersen Committee and 
the SSC. These are as follows.
