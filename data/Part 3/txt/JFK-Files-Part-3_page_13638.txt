Mr. Johnston. As I mentioned; there was another.meeting 
on or about October 13th, where, as I understand it, AMLASH 
made his demand or his request to meet with Robert Kennedy, and 
he made that request to meet with Kennedy by name. 
Is that correct? 
AMLl\SH Case Officer. Yes, he did. 
7 Well, he said somebody such as, somebody high in the 
8 administration, again, to receive the assurances that we were 
9 prepared to -- that we were serious about developing and 
10 organizing a coup.

Mr. Johnston. After that meeting, you were recalled to 
Langley for discussions, is that correct? 
.I\MLJ\SH Case Officer. I was traveling back and forth 
between Paris and Langley, yes. I don't recall if I was 
recalled at that particular time, but I would go there -- I 
was TDY. 
Mr. Johnston. I want to set the stage. There is a 
message from the Director, 1S~Rj, to London, directing you to 
return to headquarters for discussion of all facets of the 
case. 
'l'his. is after you reported that AMLASII wants to meet 
with someone like Robert Kennedy. 
Do you recall that flow of events? 
AMLJ\Sli Case Officer. Yes. 
Mr. Johnston. What discussions did you have at Langley,
