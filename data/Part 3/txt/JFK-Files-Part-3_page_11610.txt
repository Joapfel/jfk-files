In relating to the accomplishmel!litS of the Extremist 
Intelligence Section, conm1ent must be made, 4oncerning the 
contributions regularly heing made by the Inspection Division 
during their analysis of extremist matter~ ~n the various field 
divisions. ·rn addition to acting upon inifom.mation furnished to 
them by this Section, the Inspection Staff,. through their on-the­
spot review of extremist matters in the fieilid, are often able to 
detect weaknesses not apparent at the Seat 0f Government and 
offer constructive assistance to the offiee· involved in 
strengthening their operation. 
The information furnished in the, Inspection reports 
is used by this Section to do a comprehensjj.v:e analysis of every 
field office operation and to furnish the: nesults of the analysis 
to the field divisio.ns by communications eap.tioned "Administrative 
Review." These reviews have been most hellpful in strengthening 
the various field office operations. 
Since the last inspection, infomnant coverage has 
improved in the Boston, Charlotte, Cincimira.11:i, Cleveland, Ne·waI:k. 
and New Haven field divisions and this iEjp3J~vement can be 
attributed in part to the Inspector's anaJlysis of the above 
operations.
