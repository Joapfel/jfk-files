Has CIA engaged in any activities regarding critics of the 
Warren Report, including dissemination of information about 
them? 
Answer: 
Tab 11 contains a copy of Book Dispatch 5847 which transmitted 
guidance to certain CIA stations and bases concerning the 
• 
countering of criticism of the Warren Report. This guidance 
for the field was prepared in response to a rash of books 
and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. It was 
sent out in April 1967. Our investigations to date have 
turned up no other guidance or activities undertaken in this 
connection.
