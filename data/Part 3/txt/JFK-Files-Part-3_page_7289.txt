Memorandum for Mr. Wannall 
RE: UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE 
BOARD (USIB) 
MEETING OF 1/24/75 
1 
Colby advised that any examples member agencies 
or departments could provide CIA wherein the acquisition of 
inte_lligence proved useful to the development of u. s. 
policies or programs would certainly be appreciated. Colby 
stated that in this regard Mr. John Clarke as the over-all 
coordinator would be in touch with the designated representa­
tives of USIB departments or agencies to further clarify this 
point. 
With regard to the BR.C chaired by Vice President 
Rockefeller, Colby advised that CIA has already obtained an 
agreement from that Commission that any documents furnished 
to the Commission by CIA would have the names of CIA employees 
and/or CIA sources deleted from the document. The purpose of 
this deletion was to avoid such names from appearing in press 
releases. Colby also hopes to obtain the same agreement from 
the SSC. 
The Intelligence Division believes that the Bureau 
should also attempt to obtain such an agreement from the 
BRC and the SSC if at some time FBI representatives are called 
to testify or are called to produce FBI documents. This matter 
has been discussed with the Office of Legal Counsel and it 
coneurs in this recommendation. 
ACTION: 
(1) If approved, Section Chief William o. Cregar's 
name will be provided to Mr. Clarke as his point of contact 
within the FBI 'l 
~1-1->t..· 
(2) Should Bureau representatives be called to testify 
before the BRC or the SSC an agreement be obtained to delete any 
names of FBI employees and/or sources with the understanding that 
the identities could be made available to either the Commission or 
Committee if either felt such names were absolutely necessary.
