This memorandum recommends that Breau ~.n.a~~ be ~ 
• provid~4 3enate Select Committee (SSC) Staff for review of i' 
Bureau material and interviews of Bureau employees. f t, ,~1), 
SSC Staff is in a phase of its inquiry Goncerning c, t \ [) 
Bureau operations which includes (1) review of considerable (J • . " 
FBI material (sections of manuals, forms, SAC memoranda, etc.), 
(2) interviews of Bureau employees; and (3) briefing of Staff 
members by Bureau officials and supervisors. For many very ~~ 
sound reasons it would be to the Bureau's distinct advantage i'°J\.: 
to provide limited, but suitable space within the J. Edgar /" 
Hoover Building to the SSC Staff. Because we have been able / 
to obtain the Staff's agreement to review much of our material 
at FBIHQ, rather than its insistence on turning the material 
over to the Staff, we are in a position of insuring the 
security of our material by maintaining it in our space at all 
times. Also, by having the SSC Staff _conduct its review of 
the material in our space, we can have personnel readily 
available to answer their inquiries, thus precluding the 
necessity for preparing otherwise needless correspondence and 
eliminating the necessity for having our personnel present 
throughout their reviews if they took place elsewhere. 
Further, from a psychological standpoint, it is to our 
advantage that our employees be interviewed in our space rather 
than in SSC offices. Finally, space made available to SSC 
Staff will also provide a desirable site for the various briefings 
our people are giving to them. It should be note.d that the 
/
providing of the space which this memorandum recommends is 
similar to what we have already done for the General Accounting i 
Office in connection with its audit of our ope~~~::•~<.- ?f1 r:·
