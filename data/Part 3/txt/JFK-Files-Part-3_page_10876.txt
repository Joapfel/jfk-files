current situation and, in effect, adopt a ttstatus quon 
approach. We are opposed to this. As indicated in this 
study, U.S. Government needs for foreign intelligence 
are growing on an almost daily basis and CIA has made 
definite efforts to move more activoly into this field. 
If we were to adopt a trstatus quo" attitude, it is only 
a question of time until this matter comes to a head; 
for 0::-:ample, in the U.S. Intelligence Board or the 
J?rcsidclrc' s Foreign Into1J..igonco Advisory Board. If and 
when this occurs, ·the decision as to the FBI's role would, 
of course, be subject to the thinking and aims of people • 
outside the FBI, possibly including individuals who are 
not sympathetic to our views. We would not be in a position 
to maintain control of developments.
