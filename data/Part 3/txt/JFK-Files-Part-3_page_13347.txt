OLSEN: Nell, when you say you had some contact with somebody 
from the Agency, did you have some contact with somebody from the Agency 
about such an assassination? 
STURGIS: No, sir. No, I did not. 
OLSEN: Was there any contact that you have had of any nature 
relating to any assassination any place with any official of the United 
States Government, other than the ones that you have already described 
to me? 
[ off the record] 
OLSEN: All right, we are going back on the record again. Mr. Sturgis having 
said he was having difficulty- thinking about exactly what answer he would 
give to the question that was posed because he didn't want to use up tape 
time while he was engaged in his thinking process. He has--while we have 
been off the record--explored the subject with us further and is now prepared 
to answer the question. Go ahead, Frank. 
STURGIS: After that meeting with Barker, I, as far as I know, with 
the Cuban friends of mine who were working with the company or who was working 
under the company, there was a great deal of talk among the Cubans about wanting 
to assassinate Fidel C~stro in New York, inside of Cuba, or 1n Latin America 
because Fidel did make several trips. There were talk, but as far as I know 
I don't know if CIA sponsored any of the Cubans in any attempt to kill Fidel 
or finance them in any attempt to kill him, nor supported any attempt by the 
Cubans to want to kill hL11, or whether these Cubans were simply patriots or 
were working for or associated with CIA. 
OLSEN: You don't know then, Frank, whether any of this conversation 
( about killing Fidel Castro was ini. tiated or promoted or sponsored in any 
fashion by the Central Intelligence Agency?
