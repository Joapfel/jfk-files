Later in this Board meeting, during discussions with the 
DCI, ·Mr. McCone wa-s asked whether the terms of the U. S. -Cuba 
Prisoner Exchange Agreement were of ·a nature which would affect 
the conduct of present or future U. s .. intelligehce and covert· 
operatioris wtth·respect to Cuba. The DCI replied that Castro 
had hot -imposed any conditions which wou_ld preclude the U. S ~ 
from th~ conduct of· such activities. 
. Th~ Board was briefed by Mr. Desmond Fi t,zgerald of CIA. 
Mr. Fitzg~rald said that the intelltgenc·e tearris that CIA was 
sending into Cubi-were primarily conf1oed to intelligence­
gathering missions rather th?n covert,action, although the 
teams would h§ve missions in◊olving ''low key resistance and 
subtle sabotage".· The CIA representative stated that month.ly · 
plans of the CIA for. infiltrating the~e teams into Cuba ~ere \ 
approved by.the Special NSC 5412/2 Group. Mr. Fitzgerald added 
that CIA vras not receiving· poliCy • guidance with respec·t to 
positive covert action'programs of a specific sabotage ~ature, 
and he indic~ted that a decision regarding this was being sought 
during the coming week. • 
The Board meeting was joined by Mr .. C_ottrell of the D.epa-rt­
ment of State who explained that he was serving as Chairman of 
an Inter-Departmental Coordinating Committee established at the 
directioD of the President, to provide .a £ocal point fo~ co~ .. 
ordinating policy recommendations and tbe·execution of approved 
policies with respect to Cuba. Mr. Coyne raised the question 
which had been .brought up earlier by Mr. Fitzgerald concerning\ I . . 
the absence of policy guidance with respect to covert actions 
conducted by CIA. Mr~ Cottrell said that with the release of 
prisoners in CGba, in··his opinion, t~e time had come for more 
aggressive sabotage operaticins with respect to Cuba.
