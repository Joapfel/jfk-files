MR. BELIN: With regards to the question, of staff, 
do you think a Joint Committee of Congress might.have too 
powerful a staff so far as the effective operation of the 
Agency is concerned if we were to adopt that approach of 
Congressional· .oversight? 
r 
---MR. RUSK: Well, if they approach it on the same •• 
basis as they approached the Joint Atomic Energy Conunittee, I 
think that would_ not be all that much of a problem. 
MR. BELIN: You mentioned the Miami area. To your 
kno~ledge, did Castro had any penetration of what went on in 
the Cuban exile community in Miami? 
MR. ~USK: I forget the detailed evidence, but I 
always assumed that he did have them penetrated. 
MR. BELIN: Are there any questions by any members 
of the Commission? 
MR. GRISWOLD: One. of the things that has come to us 
17 is the explanation for some of the things which the CIA did 
18 from 1966 to 1973 domestically which had caused concern with . 
19 . a result of pressures from the . ,President. 
20 Now, how can the CIA be guarded against pressures

from the President? I recognize this is an extraordinarily 
difficult question. 
MR •. ~.RUSK: It is a difficult question, and in trying 
to find the right answer to that question you don't want to 
create a situation where CIA is independent of the President.
