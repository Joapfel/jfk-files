INTERNATIONAL NEW LEFT AND SEDITION UNIT 
(Prior to 12/16/70, part of Protes~ Groups\and International 
New Left Unit.) . · A prime responsibility of the Bureau and the 
intelligence community is to develop intelligence relating 
to efforts of foreign governments, organizations, and 
individuals to influence, direct, or dominate the New 
Left movement in the U.So In this regard, over the years, 
there have been a number of international-type conferences 
often sponsored by international front-type groups frequently 
under the directiop or control of the Soviet Union. 
Late last summer this Bu+eau received information 
that the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam (SCV), an organiza-
=·' tion established in 1967 which is controlled by the Soviet 
dominated World Council for Peace, intended to hold a World 
Conference on Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in Stockholm, 
Sweden, 11/28-30/70. As the SCV, since its inception, has 
been a major sounding board for anti-u.s. propaganda, partic­
ularly that of the North Vietnamese 9 we dispatched~'Z..7..'Z=...$_. 
to attend the World Conference. The informant's attendance

directed plans of the Conference to discredit the U.S. at the 
Paris peace talks. J».1.Qrmal\~ als,Ror9~,.,Y,e.looed the nature ·of 
the international propaganda attack to be directed at the 
U.So, worldwide action planned in support of the communist 
• position in Vietnam, and plans to "expose" the "criminal" 
position and actions of the U~S. as relate t~ Vietnam. 
Our cover~ge of this Conferenc~ was of value to 
officials of other Government agencies and undoubtedly 
assisted in the formulation of positive U.S. policies 
relative to the U.S. position in Vietnam. The excellent 
coverage also resulted in our being able to directly pin-
tpoint the foreign influence of the domestic subversive 
movement .and resulted in a number of important investigations.
