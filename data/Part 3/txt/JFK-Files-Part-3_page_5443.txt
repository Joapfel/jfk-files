Re Senstudy 75 memorandum dated 7/24/75. 
Pages 521-522, Item 5 and Item 6, of a CIA 
memorandum entitled, "Items For Possible Use in Briefing 
the DCI," contain references to CIA participation in ¥BI 
training and FBI participation in CIA training. Co~ents 
appear below in regard to each item. 
Item 5. It is true that since late 1972 CIA has 
participated in numerous f.oreign counterintelligence (CI) 
in-services put on by Intelligence Division (INTD). CIA 
has participated in all seven of our basic CI schools held 
to date. 
"I) It should be noted that CIA's input into these ~ 
programs has been highly valuable and productive and is 
desig.ned to give FBI Agents a better insight into the Soviet, 
Satellite and Chicom target based on CIA' s overseas,.• experience, 
against these targets. Two of the lectures usually given at 
these courses include the structure, function and role of CIA, 
and the structure, function and role of the Domestic Collection 
Division and the Foreign Resources Division. 
These lectures have been beneficial in teaching our 
Special Agents about the mutually complimentary roles of CIA 
overseas and the FBI in the United States in working against 
hostile intelligence targets. 
CIA officers who lecture to our classes have been 
careful to emphasize CIA's experience against these hostiles .. 
from an overseas perspective and their ove1s~as er~erienges. tJ~f . · . BEC-102 (.p cl :1 I/'.. ~: -::. - - Vf ef)t 
CIA's presentations can in no way be in¾erpreted as 
being an attempt on their part to teach us how tokwork C!.t'.1"1~ 
the United States, nor does CIA attempt to persua<.l.,e our Sp~cial 
Agents to adopt CIA overseas methods or tactics t~u&~~e@ $tates
