it to the Commission. It may require no further ·answer. 
Here are one or two additional thoughts 
J have. 
(a) that we study the use made of post office 
bpxes in connection with Oswald's activities and crimes 
end also ascertain the terms·and conditions under. which 
post office boxes can be rented, and whether there are 
uniform regulations or whether it is left more or less 
to the whim of local postmasters. Oswald's ability to 
hire a post office in a fictitious na~e and to use it for 
the.receiot of firearms seems to have facilitated his criminal ... 
-activities. Later the Co:nrnission might possibly wish to 
lllAke eome·suggestions on this subject. 
{b) I should be glad to see the conclusions of 
the recent report outlin_ed a few days ago in The NE·W York 
Times gi"ring arguments for the shifting of the Narcotics 
Bureau from the TrE:_asury Department . .,,. 
. 
(c) Do we have an adequate study by the State . ' . 
Department of their policy, of any legislation affecting 
it. with regard to.the terms and conditions of the registra­
tion· of undesirables? I assume that an American citizen ' . ~ 
who has not forfeited his rights as such ms an undeniable 
right to return to the United States, but I 2m not clear 
whether this ia under law or merely established practice. 
(d) Do we have any recent study available ·as 
to the extent to which, under the Constitution, the rights 
of citizens (or residents?) to acquire and retain firearms -
apart from the.question of· legislation with regard to the 
bearing of concealed arms? ;.
