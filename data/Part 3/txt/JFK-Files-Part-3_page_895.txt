The Court of Appeals recognizes that the President 
has constitutional powers to defend against foreign intellige~ca 
activities and to obtain foreign intelligence, and ass~.es,' 
solely for the sake of argument, that he had the constitution~: 
power to authorize-these surveillances; however, the· Court of 
Appeals draws.the distinction, that was drawn by the Govern-
ment for years, between the President's power to authorize 
such surveillances and the power of the Congress and Court to 
make an evident_iary rule excluding evidence obtained from such 
surveillances in criminal proceedings. 
The Court of Appeals holds that the S.upreme Court
