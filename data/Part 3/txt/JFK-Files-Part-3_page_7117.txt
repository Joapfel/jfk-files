We have received the enclosed letter dated 1-29-75 from Senator 
Frank Church (D-Idaho) writing in his capacity as the Chairman of the recently 
established Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Senator states that to 
carry out the task of the Committee, it will be necessary for the Members and 
designated staff to have access to the most sensitive classtUe4' :rnateria:h-He• 
said the Committee is in.the·p·roc·ess of gathering a staff,· adding that it is likely 
many members of the staff will not have current _$ecurity clearances. He stated 
he would"be most gratefu.fI!"Tfie"ltBfcofild eID2edite ciearan£_~s .Qn_qesl~E..c:~ed 
staff so that work can proceed as expeditiously as possible. He points out the 
standard clearance agreed upon during debate on the resolution creating the 
Committee would be the equivalent of a "Q" clearance.

William E. Colby, as Director of Central Intelligence, is //kJ 
coordinating the compilation from various agencies of the intelligence community / 
suggested guidelines dealing with clearances and the handling of security information 
to be presented for consideration to the Select Committee. FBI representatives

it was agreed that the Intelligence Division representative. should explore with

Associate Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence. Cregar advised Clarke
