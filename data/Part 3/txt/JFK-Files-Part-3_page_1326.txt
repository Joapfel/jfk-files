WASHINGTON, 0,C. 20510

Dear Mr. Attorney General: .; 
I would like to bring to your personal attention 
a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to 
establish the relevant fact? with respect to one.of the 
areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry 
pursuant to S .. Res. 21. 
I have been informed by the staff that numerous 
materials which have been requested during the past sever.al 
weeks ·which pertain to the. FBI '.s activities with respect to 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have been withheld from the­
Committee by the Department because of concern expressed 
by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and 
estate, as to the appropriateness of the Department's 
"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations 
monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King. 
Upon reviewing the lists of materials requested, 
I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could 
conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel, 
especially in view of the fact that our letters of requ~st 
have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-
.cripts should not be supplied. 
Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to 
place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all of 
the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King 
matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeLoach's 
August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain to th~ 1964 
Democratic National Convention, and (2) thos.e portions ·9f any 
other requested :materials which actually summarize or quote 
from conversations moni·tored during any electronic surveill-
ance of Dr. King. • r.;,~ ON COMTAINEO •
