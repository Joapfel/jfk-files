INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
(SSC) 
INTERVIEU OF SPECIAL AGENT 
(SA) LAURENCE Fe :!IRICK BY 
NW 38ti-Oa Docld:32989ti40 
we made c.ertain requests to conduct sor!le types 
of counterintelligence against the BPP, but I 
do not recall that the Bureau ever authorized any 
counterintelligence. act which might be productive. 
Change? COINTELPRO is not being utilized to the 
best of my kno·wledge and has not been for some time. 
I believe that in about t·wo or three years Congress 
will be frantically asking the FBI ·why ,·1e did not 
furnish them intelligence, advance knowledge of a 
demonstration, a riot and other •civil unrest a:nd 
elimination of the COINTELPRO has been another step 
in the direction of placing the FBI and other la-tv 
enforcement agencies in a position where ·w·e cannot 
react to the activities of groups such as the BPP 
which have been formed ,•;rith the main purpose 
of overthro·wing the. United States.
