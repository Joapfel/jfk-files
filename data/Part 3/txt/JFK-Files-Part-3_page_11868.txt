BLACK NATIONALIST PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM ~­-~~.,, <~~1!/;-
·tJ/.rn· il TORE. s. MILLER: The Black Nationalist Photograph Album 
~ (BNPA) was approved and established 
1968 and at this time contains the photograph and biographical 
data of 472 black extremists who travel extensively in this 
country and abroad. Each field office plus Legal Attaches, 
Ottawa and Mexico City, maintain this Album to assist in coverage 
of movement of black extremist individuals in the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. The Album appears to be an excellent 
investigative aid by making immediately available photograph 
and background data on individuals traveling from one Division 
to another or out of the co~ntry whose activities must be 
followed. 
A review of files discloses at least lQ individuals 
who are included in the BNPA traveled to Paris in the recent 
past. It is noted a favorite route of Black Panthers traveling 
to Algeria is through Paris. In view of the increased activity 
on the part of-~he Cleaver Faction of the Black Panther Party, 
it can be assumed tliat'travel of individuals affiliated with the 
Cleaver Faction to and from Cleavar's headquarters in Algeria 
witl continue or increase. In ~i~ew of these travels, the 
Legal Attache, Paris, could utilize the BNPA to facilitate 
expedite coverage of these extremists while in France. 
A,review of the BNPA itself reveals that some of the 
photographs attached to the FD-432 in this file do not have the 
names of the individuals photographed on the back of the photo­
graph. These photographs should have the individual's name on 
the back in the event the photographs become detached from the 
FD-432. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. That Legat, Paris, be provided with a copy of the 
BN!?A. 
2. If a further pattern of travel develops into an 
area covered by another Legal Attache, consideration should 
then be given to making available a copy of the BNPA to that 
Legal Attache.
