there has been 
a continued merging of racial activists an• extremists with 
pro-Chinese communist groups, Trotskyites, _the Students for 
a Democratic Society, and similar groups. In October, 1970, 
Elb3rt H.2,~~~ ...... a Black Panther Party functionary, stated that 
the Black Panther Party is composed of Marxist-Leninist 
revolutionaries and no longer confines its interest to 
black power or black nationalism. He added that in the 
future the Panthers will encompass all revolutionaries 
regardless of race. We can expect this merger to continue.
