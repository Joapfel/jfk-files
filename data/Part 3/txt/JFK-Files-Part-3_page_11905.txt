KLAN AND WHITE HATE GROUP UNIT 4-E 
Membership in Klan-type organization~ and other 
white hate groups has experienced a continuous decline for 
the past four years. The Klan reached a post-World War II 
membership high of approximately 14,000 in 1966. From that 
point on, there has been a continuing decline in membership. 
At the present time, we·have 18 Klan organizations made up of 
225 Klaverns (units). There are, of course, in addition to 
·the membership, many thousands of sympathizers. Investigation 
in the white extremist field for organizations other than the 
Klan is centered around the Minutemen, the National States 
Rights Party (NSRP), and the National Socialist White People's 
Party (NSWPP)o. There are numerous other small groups which 
likewise fall within this category. This reduction in Klan 
and other white hate group membership is attributable to the 
conti-nuous attention given tlme investigations by the;.Y, Seat of 
Government and the field, with specific attention giventb: ha~a~­
~1ttir.g investigations~ counterintelligence programs directed 
at them, and penetration of these groups· at all levels by our 
racial informants. 
The year 1970 showed a continuing decline in the 
membership and effectiveness of the various Klan and white 
hate groups throughout the UoS~ As of January, 1970, Klan 
membership totaled approximately 5,300. Our present figures 
indicate that Klan membership now totals approximately 4,300. 
The largest Klan group is the United Klans of America, Inc., 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (UKA) under the direction of 
ImP.,er,i.aJ __ ~~~~-fil_le~t_9]l,.~ ... The membership of this 
_group in January, 1970, was approximately 4,100 whereas it 
now numbers 3,500 members, or approximately 80% of the member­
ship of all Klan organizations. These recent figures 
represent an approximate decrease in overall Klan membership 
of 17% and 15% decrease in UKA membership. Membership in 
white hate organizations other than the Klan which has always 
been relatively smaller membership-wise has likewise experienced 
a relatively similar decline.
