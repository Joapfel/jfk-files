·nr. King or anyone else? 
. Mr. Adams. It is where you have information indicating 
that the Communist Party_ is· and has made efforts to try 
to influence an individual. 
I would say that that would normally bp considered 
within the current criteria. 
Senator Mondale .. You would consider that to be a 
valid purpose for·· investigating today? 
1:tr.· Adams. ·Excuse me, what? 
Senator Mondale:. You wo1+ld consider that to be a 
·valid basis for investigating today? 
. 
·Mr. ·Adams. The movement itself, but not th-e individual. 
$enator Mondale. How do your1nvestigate a movement 
1.4 • without investigating. individuals?

Mr. Adams~ You do get into a gray area4 The main. thing 
would be if we had an organization 'today that ·we saw the 
Communist Party grav~tating to,tr~ing to work in.positions 
of leadership,_ We· w.ould be interested:_in opening an i~vestigati n 
on Comm~nist infiltration of that organization to see if 
• it was affecting it. 
Senator Mondale .. All right, now iet's go back· 
specifically. 
I gather there never was any question raised about 
whether Dr. King wa·s a Communist. That. was never charged. 
~tr. Adams. Not as a Communist Party member, no, sir.
