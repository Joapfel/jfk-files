(SSC) 
Epstein asked if the Atlanta Office participated 
in the COINTELPRO retrieval project and was advised by 
Haynes he thoughtso; however, Haynes w~s not familiar enough 
with the particular project he had in mind to be sure. Haynes 
explained he had in mind a project around the first of 1975, 
which had to do with declassifying certain previously identified 
COINTELPRO correspondence and subsequently classifying some 
material also connected with COINTELPRO. Epstein wanted to 
know if any COINTELPRO information regarding King or SCLC was 
included in this information and he was informed Haynes had 
no knowledge of such, but the details of the project were· 
handled by another Agent under Haynes' supervision. Haynes 
was requested to identify the Agent and replied he would have 
to have a few minutes to consult with an FBIHQ representative 
in the FBI Office· prior to answering this question. Epstein 
contacted the FBIHQ representative in the Atlanta Office 
telephonically, requesting him to come down to Senator 
Talmadge's office and conferred with him for approximately 
five minutes, during which time Haynes was not present. At 
the conclusion of this conference, upon advice of the FBIHQ 
representative Haynes informed Epstein the Agent who handled 
the above-mentioned project was SA Edward A. Shea. 
Epstein terminated the interview at 3:10 P. M.
