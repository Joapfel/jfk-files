• • 
When an allegation is received that a group 
may fall within exi·sting jurisdictional criteria,· FBI 
Headquarters is immediately notified and a 11preliminary 
investigation 11 along the lines already indicated is 
undertaken. Again, approval from FBI Headquarters must 
be obtained to continue this "preliminary investigation" 
beyond 9 0 days to res·o1 ve whether jurisdictional· standards 
are met. If met, .a full investigation is conducted 
upon approval by FBI Headquarters. 
Internal security investigations are also 
conducted on the basis of specific instr.uctions from 
the Attorney General (pursuant to Presidential Directives) 
to the Director of the FBI. Until the instr.uction is 
complied with,· these matters remain pending. 
Every effort is made to maintain proper 
administr.ative control over domestic security investigations 
and to insure full compliance with ·the law. In this 
regard, Bureau rules require Agents to limit investigations 
to relevant matters. Supervisory personnel in the Field 
and at FBI Headquarters review the progress and relevancy 
of these investigations, and reports ·are forwarded to 
the Department of Justice. Agents also receive legal 
instruction on a continuing basis in order that they 
may be fully able to recognize relevance and safeguard 
individual r~ghts. • • 
These Bureau procedures have been devised 
in an honest effort to carry out with maximum effectiveness 
and propriety our vital domestic se-curity responsibilities. 
Over the years, the FBI has handled these responsibilities 
and protected the domestic security of our Nation with· 
great dedication and, I believe, with great distinction. 
·we will continue to vigorously carry out these duties 
with .all due regard for individual rights and liberties. 
I believe the procedures I have outlined are in full 
accord with ·this purpose.
