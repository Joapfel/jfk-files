As a result of dissemination of advance information developed 
by this source, authorities were able to further control 
these demonstrations and reduce the violence arising out of 
such activity. 
With reference to the complicated Weatherman 
investigation, much progress has been made recently in the 
development of information on the technical aspects of the 
actual operation of the Weatherman underground, particularly 
its use and methods of obtaining false identities, its 
courier system, its use of radical attorneys in covert 
support roles and in the movement of its suppo~t personnel. 
Effort is continually being_ made to develop ne;-1 techniques 
and approaches to facilitate this investigation. A 
11
stop 
index" program in NCIC, for Bureau use only, concerning 
extremists on Priority I of the Security Index was initiated 
in June, 1971. This program enables our field offices to 
receive prompt notice by teletype when police agencies make 
inquiries about these subjects._ :t;!l. a9-di tion, new procedures 
have recently been devised whereby the Identification Division 
can better disseminate to the field arrest information on 
Security Index subjects for whom no fingerprints are on file. 
This is accomplished by periodic submission by the field of 
Security Flash Notices to determine if fingerprints have been 
received since the last check.
