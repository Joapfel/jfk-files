Recommendation number 17 emphasized that CIA 
should place emphasis on the establishment of unofficial 
cover throughout the world; recommendation number 20 was· 
that CIA should increase intelligence support to unified and 
component commanders by direct dissemination from pertinent 
:field stations. 
I The report noted that CIA's main requirements 
problem related to clandestine collection and concerned 
the great number of requirements served on the Agency .... 
The main tone of the report was that greater 
cooperation was required between the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
(JCS), Department of State, and CIA in carrying out foreign 
• intelligence collection missions. The recommendations of 
the Group were all directed toward this end and had no 
bearing on internal espionage or counterespionage activities 
within the United States. 
In commenting on the coordination duties of the 
DCI, the Group pointed out that USIB had been officially 
directed to "establish policies and develop programs for 
t11e guidance of a.11 departments and a-gGii.Cl'2:6 00110"1rfo2:J; thG 
DCI is authorized to make such surveys of departmental 
intelligence activities or the various departments and 
agencies as he may deem necessary in connection with his 
duty to advise the NSC and coordinate the intelligence effort 
of the United States." The report interpreted these official 
directions to indicate that USIB should assume a greater 
proportion of the actual direction and control of the 
intelligence community of which the Bureau was noted to be 
a member . 
To strengthen USIB position as a director, 
coordinator, and controller of intelligence effort, the 
Group recommended (recommendation number 30) that the USIB 
should be reduced to four members·wno should be the DCI 
(chairman) and representatives of ·secretary·of State, Secretary 
of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The FBI and the Atomic 
Energy Commission would be relegated to ad hoc representation 
-on the Board. • . . •
