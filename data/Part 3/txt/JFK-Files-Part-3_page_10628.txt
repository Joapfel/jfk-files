cut that tha KIG{ was striving for a lawful settlement 
of the difficul-ties bxought on by the National _t;.ssocia-
-: :tion fo:r the Advancement of Colored People (NA.t~C) and 
that it is opposed to violence~ This leaflet £urther·set 
forth that this ·was a chartered, legalized movement and 
it is no more.illegal.to oe a member of it than to be a 
member of other o:rganizationso 
At various times in the past the klavern has 
attempted to organize "actionn groups within the· klavern, 
but on each occasion the project h~s died from lack of 
interest,. 
In line with ~ureau policy of dissemination of 
iriformation, the main activities regarding the Pine Bluff 
Klave:rn have been disseminated confidentially to Cr-.... ie.f

department in uniform to check the location; record

that the klaveTn members would know that he was checking

:klavern follm 11 a line of legal activity o It has -also 
resulted in the mo:re responsible leading citizens of the 
co~~~unity being made aware of certain klavern members, 
causing these klavern members to be discredited in the 
eyes of the publica This was boxne out in the recent 
school board election on 9/29/64 when tvio klave:rn members,
