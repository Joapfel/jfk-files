C 
1. Reference is made to our CSCI 3/751,690 of 27 October 
1958, and our cscr 3/754,303 of 14 April 1959 .in which are re­
ported the attempt by Czech Intelligence to induce Subject, a" 
Czech-born naturalized American, to repatriate to Czechoslovakia, 
and the further cultivation of Subject by the KGB in Moscow 
where Subject is an Exchange Student during 1958-59. The 
following report describes further action by the KGB to recruit 
Subject, and his adamant refusal of any such offer. This latest 
information was recently received from RIHA by a sensitive 
and reliable source. ,

. . ,, ' . . . . 'l· 2. During April 1959, the Soviet Of:t:1c1.ar-T.;1rn-·s-a1.a--•l11j·-•--·-
was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been 
cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the_..•·1a tte_r to make complete 
and regular reports on r--!ichael M2.rtin.,;.··~-µ_t.J:.I.E.R-,··· one of the other 
American Exchange Students at -fvioscow'University. Subject was 
asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to 
report where he goes, what he does and with whom he associates. 
If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official 
said he would make available certain material from Archives 
which Subject has bien unable to get permission to use altho~gh 
research in this material is vital to his having a successful 
yea~ academically in Moscow. 
3. Subject alleges he flatly refused this ''deal", saying 
that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would 
be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet 
Official then told Subject he should enga~e in such observation 
and reporting to the Soviets to lose some "naivete" about how 
the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program 
for intelligence purposes. To back up this assertion, the 
Soviet Official told Subject about a "spy nest where spies deposit, 
things for one another" which he said had recently been uncovered 
near a university/entrance frequented by still another ~~erican 
student, Wal ter.,..;_QLEMENS, who, the Soviet implied, was not engaged 
in academ1c work oniy-while studying at Moscow University.
