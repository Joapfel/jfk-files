bound to gather a great deal of information about some 
individual that is useless as far as the intent of the intelli­
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras 
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any 
-
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's 
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific 
purpose unrelated to this information. 
Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to

that these files are kept in the agency? 
Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework, 
too. 
Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done. 
Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to

President of the United States from calling up the head of 
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement 
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give-direction 
to the agency. 
But how about that? What about White House personnel
