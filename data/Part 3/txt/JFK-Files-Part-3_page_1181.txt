U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT 
ROBERTS. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER 
Mr. Baker replied that this was not true but 
that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO 
case because his case load was such that he was able to 
handle the program. 
Mr. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy 
Burns was transferred to the Butte Office of the FBI for 
disciplinary reasons. 
Mr. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns was 
originally from Washington State and had wanted to be trans­
ferred to that area. 
Mr. Seidel asked if the Bureau encouraged Agents 
to participate in disruptive programs and then rewarded them 
financially for their efforts. 
Mr. Baker replied that the Bureau had an incentive 
award program, and if an Agent did a good job in any field, he 
could get recognition through an incentive award. Mr. Baker 
stated that he could not recall any award being given as a 
result of CO-l!NTELPRO activity. 
Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he could recall any 
infonnation concerning the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP. 
Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that the operation 
of the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP was followed through 
sources. They advised that some of the BPP officials were 
stealing money from funds which were to be spent on the 
breakfast program. The breakfast program was served at a 
local Catholic church. Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that 
an official of the Catholic church in San Diego was contacted 
regarding the priest in charge of the church where the break­
fast program was being held, who was reportedly an alcoholic. 
Mr. Seidel was advised that the priest was transferred from 
the church.
