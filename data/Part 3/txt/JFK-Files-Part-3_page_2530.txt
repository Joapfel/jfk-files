Seymour Hersh has been the subject of an FOIA request by IVforton Halperin. 
Wilderotter advised that attorneys for CIA had prepared the material for 
release and that the material was now in the possession of T'he 'White House 
for their review. He suggested that inasmuch as the FBI was mentioned 
in some of the material that it would be desirable for the FBI to review the 
material prior to its release. 
• SA Fred J. Cassidy of the Intelligence Division reviewed this 
material in Room 110 of the Old :Gxecutive Office Building on 
1
7/7/75. This 
review determined that the FBI is mentioned throughout the material being 
made availaole to Hilperin and that most of the references to th~ FBI 
included in the matarial appear in the Rockefeller Commission Repor~ which
