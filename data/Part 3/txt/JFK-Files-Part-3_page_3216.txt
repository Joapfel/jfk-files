your own admission 
Mr. Adams. I believe this report had some subsequent 
pages that aren't included in here that did show some additional 
activity or influence. 
The Chairm~n. I a~ ~~ld ~y the staff that this summary is 
accurate, and the only other thing contained was that these 
women had affiliations with an organization that had prote·sted 
the war in Baltimore. 
Mr. Adams. I think there were some other items. 
The Chairman. That is the only other association that 
11 we have been able to determine. 
12 Now, in a case of this kind, do you still carry -- you say 
13 this has been closed. ~pparently the Women's Liberation move-
14 ment is no longer under suspicion by the FBI and the case has 
15 been closed. What happens when the case is closed? Are those 
16 women's names still left in.the files? 
17 Are they forever more contained?

Mr. Adams. Yes. 
The Chairman. In the system? Yes. There is no -- yes. 
Mr. Adams. Yes. 
The Chairman. Pretty soon you will have us all in the 
system. 
I mean., if there is no way, even after surveillance has 
been terminated to term~nate the refer~nces of individuals 
25 through the files of the system, you will one day have us all,
