in this program do not require the use of much personnel 
or many man hours by the New York Office.

4. The detection of Soviet illegals is one of the most 
difficult problems facing the Bureau in the security 
field. It is felt this program still has a good 
potential in uncovering illegals because it is logical 
and has a sound basis. Past experience has shown that 
Soviet intelligence will use the same modus operandi 
continuously. if successful. 
5. This program is evaluated on an annual basis.
