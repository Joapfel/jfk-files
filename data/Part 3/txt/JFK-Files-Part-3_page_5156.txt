who had cooperated with the FBI in the COINTELPRO operations, 
be interviewed by SSC Representatives so that a more accurate 
picture could be obtained concerning possible harm to 
COINTELPRO targets. He indicated there was a deadline set 
for completion of COINTELPRO phase _of SSC investigation and 
J
time did not allow for extensiv•e interviews; however, he 
estimated that given no deadline a maximum of 36 such contacts 
would be made ~nd~in view of Ehe deadline, 8 to 12 interviews 
of the type indicated-to be more realistic. Mr. Elliff isolated 
three cases which he suggested might most easily lend themselves 
to a compromise on this point and suggested they ~e considered 
by the Bureau. If the Bureau saw fit to agree in these 
instances, he suggested further deliberations be made to 
select further cases in which the cooperative sources' identities 
could be made available to the SSC. 
SAs Cregar and Larson emphasized to Elliff that the 
principle involved here was not whether or not the cooperative 
source was of great and current value to the FBI but that the 
~U_!= was_'t;he EB,I.!_s o,,bliga:tion t,o_the sou::9<;, ..... t9 .... 12,rot .. ec,:t .!,he , ..,_ 
~nJ.id.en_tj,_fr!-_~:t-Y ....,,,e.! t_hu.tlc:1lls..~sh!~While professing to 
acknowledge tne vaf"idity of the Bureau position in this regard, 
Elliff, nonetheless, was adamant in his ~tanding that the SSC 
be allowed to contact these sources without the FBI first 
contacting them to ascertain their amenabiljty to such interview. 
)
It was stressed to Elliff that prior contact of these sources 
by the FBI would be mutually advantageous since it would 
satisfy FBI obligation to the source and, if the source then 
agreed to interview, would provide the SSC with a forth-coming 
cooperative witness. Finally, after much discussion, Elliff 
\
suggested that the three cases presented by him be approved and 
following this he would be willing to c~nsider negotiation 
concerning further disclosures of identifies of sources based 
on FBI proposal of prior contact. The three cases proposed by 
Elliff are briefly set out below:
