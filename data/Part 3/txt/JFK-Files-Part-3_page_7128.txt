This reports information received telephonically 
from Mr. Robert Gambino, Office of Security, CIA, on the 
morning of 3/1/75. 
Tolophono Rm._ 
Director Sec'y _ 
According to Mr. Gambino, a CIA officer employed 
by CIA's Office of Security, Mr.· Richard Kuh, has been 
called to testify before the R.ocKefeiler- .. eommission on 3/3/75. 
The purpose of this testimony is to discuss CIA's re~~q!t~ent 
of approximately 10 dJ§~_!d~nts. The dissidents were to be 
infiltrated into extremist-and revolutionary groups active in 
the Washington, D. C., area in 1967 in order that CIA could 
obtain firsthand knowledge as to whether any of these extremist 
or revolutionary groups were planning any physical damage 
or attack on CIA installations throughout the Washington, D. C., 
area. --
In preparation for this testimony CIA was reviewing I 
all records in their Office of Security. In this connecti~ 
they came across a note from CIA Security Officer Paul Gaynor 
reflecting a conversation he had with myself. During that time 
I had liaison responsibilities with CIA's Office of Security.

I have reviewed all possible Bureau records in an

effort to locate any memoranda that might have been prepared. 
I have found no such memoranda and am inclined to believe that 
I did not make a record of my conversation with Mr. Gaynor in 
view of the quotation, "They never heard ~f this fa;t~~• :'< ·=~ 3\ 3
