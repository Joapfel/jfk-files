a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Presidential warrantless 
• foreign intelligence electronic surveillances. Consequently, 
toe Government probably will either ask for dismissal of the 
·case or appeal the Third Circuit's ruling t~ the Supr~me Court. 
. If Ivanov is appealed the Supreme Court will face 
three possible issues, the 4th Amendment issue of the legality 
of warrantless foreign intelligence electronic surveillance, 
the d1sclosure issue, and the Section 605 evidentiary iss4e. 
The Court could seize onto the Section 605 evidentiary issue, 
not considered by it in Alderman, to dispose of the case withcut 
·.-. reaching the 4th ll .. n1endnent .or disclosure questions; or it could 
• :· • stand on its instructions to the District Court and rule on tne 
·District Court's remand finding that the surveillance did not 
.... · ·. 
violate the 4th Amendment. 
. If the Supreme Court found the surveillance illegal, 
presumably Alderman's requirement of full disclosure would a?ply, 
and the case would be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to 
exclude any electronic surveillance evidence, and the Section 
605 issue would be avoided. 
. If the Court found the surveillances legal it could:

3) not require disclosure at all if the Govern~ent

intelligence, possibly arguing that since the defendant's rig~ts 
against unreasonable search.and seizure were not violated, he 
has not been injured, the Government's case is not illegally

therefore,.disclosure is not necessary, and, ac.ci::::..c::­
ally, disclosure would be very dw~aging to national security. .. 
Even if the surveillances were found legal, however, 
the Section 605 evidentiarv issue would remain. A Heari~c o~ =~
