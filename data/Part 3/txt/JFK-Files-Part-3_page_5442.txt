QU~STION: 
MR. KEL:L,EY: 
• 
•• 
There is no question whatsoever because that which I say applies 
to othe~s should also apply to me. But, I do feel that I have 
0 
control of the organization. I have known of no disruptive tactics that 
might have ·bee~r launched to_ unseat- me and again were there any . 
evidence of that and found, in my opinion, to be one which is well 
grounded, I would. immediately leave; 
Mr. Kelley, if I can return for the moment to the subject of 
break-ins·. You saiq that conditions of national security and 
foreign intelligence--there may have b~en other areas. I wonder 
if you can be a little clearer on whether there were any break-ins 
• that were not related to foreign intelligence or national security? 
I know of none. 
Thank you Mr. Kelley.
