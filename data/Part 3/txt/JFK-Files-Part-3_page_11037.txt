At 3:17 p.m., 4/22/75 former Special Agent Li h Whitson 
who for many years was a supervisor in the Intelligence Division 
telephoned me to advise that he had received a request to appear 
for an interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate 
Select Committee. The interview was scheduled for 4/23/75. 
In response to a question by :Mr. Whitson, he was advised 
that to the writer's knowledge this was the first former Bureau 
employee who had been requested to appear for an interview by any 
member of the staff of the Select Committee. Whitson stated that 
he was proceeding on the basis that he would respond to questions 
propounded to him but he had some reservation in his mind concerning 
answering questions which would involve material which he knew to be 
classified at the time he retired. He commented he had noted in thex· 
news media that staff members of the Committee were reportedly to be } 
granted clearances through TOP SECRET - Q (Atomic Energy Matters). r ·.~ 
Whitson was advised by the writer that while it was true 
staff members were being granted clearances, the Bureau was endeavoring 
to establish procedures through the Attorney General whereby highly 
sensitive and classified material could be revealed on a restricted 
basis in response to Committee inquiries; for example, in some 
instances we would request that only the Majority and Minority leaders 
on the Committee be furnished certain .types of material and in other 
instances only the Senators themselves as opposed to

Mr. Whitson said in view of ~llit \vas his :i.ntefit'ton or'be 
as responsive and candid during the interview by Mr. Epst~in as he 
could be but if any questions arose in his :m,ind with r.e-spect to 
revelation as to what he, Whitson, considered to be sensitive material, 
he anticipated he would express his concern to Mr. Epstein and advise 
him he felt it would be appropriate to check with the Dwooasa· &inc~.­
