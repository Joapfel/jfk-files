MR. BISSELL: Until February of 1962, if memory serves 
MR. BELIN: And after leaving the Agency, then what 
did you do? 
MR. BISSELL: I joined the staff of United Aircraft 
Corporation in East Hartford, where:I· had·a very unrevealing 
title of Director of Marketing and Economic Planning. It really 
"' 
was a co:r:,porate ~-planning responsibility. 
MR. BELIN: Wasn't that 1964? 
MR. BISSELL: Yes. 
MR. BELIN: Before that you worked for the Institute o 
' 
MR. BISSELL: Yes.· I'm sorry . I skipped over two 
. 12 years as President of the Institute for Defense Analysis. It 
13 is to that that I moved ~irectly from the CIA. 
14 MR. BELIN: And _'you retired from the United Aircraft 
15 
16 
17 
in 1974?' 
~MR. BISSELL: That's correct. 
MR. BELIN: Mr. Bissell, during the time that you 
' 18 were with the Agency, did you ever have any discussions with 
19 anyone in the White House concerning the planning of what was 
2o called an Executive Action Capability, which was defined in 
21 substance as a capability of the Agency carrying out assassina-
22 tions, if required? 
23 MR .• BISSELL: My recollection of this is far from 
, 24 clear. But I am satisfied that very early, in_ .the Kennedy 
25 Administration I did participate. in such convsrsations .
