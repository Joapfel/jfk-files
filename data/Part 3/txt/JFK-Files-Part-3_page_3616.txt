The Attorney General 
On November 6• 1975~ 'Wick again telephoned this Bureau 
and advised that he had been rather annoyed at Epstein's 
initial approach to him; pa~ticula.rly, because Wick had tried 
on more than one occasion during the telephone conversation 
with Epstein to pry from Epstein the subject matter of the 
interview but Epstein persisted in not advising him. 
This Bureau's representative who had determined from 
Epstein on November 5, 1975, the subject matter of the inter­
view has advised that ·when he m,o.de the inquiry of Epstein, he 
asked Evstein why he had not told Wiek the subject matter. 
Epstein s reply was that Wick had not asked him, a statement 
directly contradictory to Wick'$ advice to this Bureau., 
Th¢ second suetested impropriety is th€i.t Epstein 
contacted Wick prior to advising this Bureau of his intention 
to interview Wick,. an aetion which is contrary to procedures 
which have been agreed upon between the SSC and this Bureau.
