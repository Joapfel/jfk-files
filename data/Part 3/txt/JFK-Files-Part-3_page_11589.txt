The development of a highly placed informant, 
PH 122?~., within the pro-Be.I.,;:~~ forces is also a significant 
accomplishment. This individual has gained the confidence of 
leaders in the .Berr,i,g~ movement and is privy to information 
not available from any other source. The informant has furnished 
a wealth of" information regarding fund raising and strategy 
and tactics planned by movement leaders to propagandize 
their position and to attempt to gain public support for 
the ,8-,.,,~Ai:i..cause. In the course of this coverage, the 
informant furnished information concerning plans of the group 
for action in the event parole was not granted to~ilip and 
Daniel Be,JJ:i~on 7-28-71. He also furnished plans of the 
group to mount an attack on the Bureau of Prisons which 
culminated in a hunger-work strike at the Federal Correctional 
Institution, Danbury, Connecticut, on 8/6-7/71. This action 
resulted in the transfer of eleven inmates to the Medical 
Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield,- Missouri. We 
furnished plans of this proposed action to the Bureau of 
Prisons, and in a letter to the Attorney General dated 
8-11-71, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons noted that 
the action of the inmates confirmed our intelligence reports 
received several weeks prior. 
PijJ;.~~ also furnished information concerning the 
intention of the group to embarrass the administration by 
having Daniel Berrigan prepare the text for~ composed 
by musica1=4:.4lE(fl..g~'!ff~e .. cz .. 1l~~<LJl~ .%!!~,~~l~..§§. is to be part of th·e dedication ceremonies for the Kennedy Center for 
the Performing Arts in Washington, D. c., and is to be performed 
on 9-9-71., The words prepared by !m,!lk,el,_~~r.J;.,i$~E.., were to have 
· been i1n. Latin and were to follow an antiwar theme. The group 
anticipated the President and high ranking administration 
officials would applaud the work and subsequent publicity 
would be to the effect that they had applauded antiadministration 
views. This information was furnished the White House and, 
according to the news media, the President h~s declined to 
attend the ceremonies on 9-9-71. 
PH 1a2...i3,;;,.~-has also furnished information showing the 
.B¥.J:1.ia.Rsupporters ~re interested in obtaining classified 
material such as that publicized by Danie,l_E,.,l..1--~J.> ... e..!:,~. in an 
effort to embarrass the Government. The individual who is 
to attempt to get these papers is Lind~.u~1law f~nl~,.an 
ardent supporter of the ,g~~~.n, cause. Her target is the 
Lyndon B. Johnson Library at the University of Texas, Austin, 
which is the repository for former President Johnson's papers. 
We have a separate espionage investigation underway regarding 
this situation.
