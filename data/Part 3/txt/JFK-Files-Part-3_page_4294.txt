RE: '[ioNAL~ LEE JAC~soii} •• 
. . 
Reference is made to your letter dated May 6, 
1969, concerning the Omr~bus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968. 
. [Ronald Lee Jackso~-is an active member of the 
b1£"~ck extremist Stu::.ent Natior...al Coordinating Committee 
(SNCC) which organization advocates the use of violence to 
achieve its goal of black liberation.· l]acksoii}serves as 
editor of SNCC1 s revolutionary publication, has numerous 
contacts among black eA-tremists and has reportedly prepared 
instructional tapes concerning the waging of guerrilla warfare. 
In connection ·w:i. th our efforts to effect a solution 
.of. tb°e ease involv-iI¥; the murders of two police officers in 
1-:ew· York City on May 21, 1971, it is felt a telephone 
sm.:--veiJ.lance at /Jackson 'j residence could be of assistance 
.. in identifying fhe ur:knm-m black assailants. It is possible 
. th:.t conversations of flacksori]and other leading SNCC officials 
,-;rould be intercepted by a telephone surv·eillance at[Jackson I iJ 
residence and it is possible that any of these -~ndividuals 
may becoJ1e th= su½ject of either local or Federal cr~minal 
violations. The existing live informant coverage off]ackso.;;J 
and the SNCC organization is limited and it is felt these 
·informants are not in a position to develop the necessary 
data regarding these murders.
