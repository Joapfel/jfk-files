Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall 
Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
Inquiry of Intelligence Division personnel, who 
might have pertinent information, developed the following 
information which might be offered to Mr. Ulman: (1) The 
only specific instance in which we are aware that the AG is 
involved in consideration or approval of activities of the 
FBI regarding for~ign intelligence is that when we desire to 
effect electronic coverage, for ourselves or on request of 
another agency, for the purpose of obtaining positive foreign 
intelligence information or foreign counterintelligence 
purposes, we seek the approval of the AG. Other agencies 
might do likewise. (2) The National Security Act of 1947, 
approved by the President 7/26/47, created the National Security 
Council (NSC). NSC Intelligence Dir,~ctive (NSClD) No. 1 was 
revised on 7 /7 /49 and added the FBI as a member of the • '~ 
Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). By a subsequent revision 
of NSCID No. 1 on~~ IAC became the United States 
'Jntelligence Board (U.SIB), with the FKI still a member. USIB 
concerns itself with foreign intelligence matters. However, 
inasmuch as the FBI itself is a member of USIB, and historically 
the FBI has not coordinated USlB matters with the AG; the 
Bureau's role in USIB is not considered pertinent to the 
inquiry regarding the involvement of the AG in foreign intelligence 
matters. (3) Our records indicate tha.t prior to the establishment 
of the NSC, former FBI Pirector Hoover recommended that the 
AG be a member of the committee which later became the NSC. 
l\pparently the National Security Act of 1947 did provide for 
the AG to attend NSC meetings as a member if the President s9 
desired. Our records indicate the AG did attend some NSC 
meetings as a member during the 1947~48 period. However, by 
memorandum 8/19/49, .AAG Peyton Ford informed Mr. Hoover that 
the AG could no longer attend NSC meetings as a member because 
of the amendment to the National Security Act made by Section 3 
of Public Law 216, 81st Congress, appi'oved 8/10/49. (4) On 
11/5./71, the White House announced the establishment of the 
*ex~ept in important policy matters 
such as the recent revision of 
NSCID No. 9. - 2 -
