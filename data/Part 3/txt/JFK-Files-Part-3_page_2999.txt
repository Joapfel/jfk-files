law again .. You're.trying to defend apples with oranges. That.'~ 
the law. ·You can do that. 
Mr. Adams. That's right, _but how do you find out which 
. . . 
of the 20:;ooo -Bund members might have been a saboteur .. You 
don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can 
direct an intellig~nce operation against the.Getman-American 
Bund, the same thing w.e did a:fter Congress said -.-
• senator Mondale.. Couldn.'t ypu get a. war.tij:1~t for- that?·­
Why did you object to·going to court for authority for tiiat'P:­
Mr. Adams. Because we don't have probable cause to 
go against an individual and the .law doesn't provide for 
probable cause to investigate an organization. 
•- . . .. . ~ •• ..• '.· 
There were activities which did take place, like one time 
they outlined the Communist Party 
Senator 11ondale. What I don't understand is why it 
wouldn't be better for the FBI for us to define authority 
that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under 
court authority you can investigate where there is probable 
cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the res~. 
Wouldn't that make a lot more sense than_ just making thes~ 
decisi~ns on your own? 
Mr. Adams. We have expressed c~nplcte concurrence in 
that. We feel that we 're goi_ng to g,: ,;-11 :;eat to death in the 
next 100 years, you're damned if you ;0, and ·damned if you 
don't if ~a don't have a delineation of our responsibility
