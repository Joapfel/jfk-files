The President has no warrantless power to authorize 
purely.domestic national security electronic surveillances. 
He may have the power to subject·domestic targets to electronic 
surveillance, but these electronic surveillances must be 
subjected to prior judicial review, i.e., a warrant, before. 
installation. Admissibility of evidence obtained from such 
electronic surveillances is a correlative question, not yet· 
directly considered. Presumably, such evidence would be 
admissible.

The legality and admissibility of evidence issues 
have not yet been directly considered by tpe Supreme Court. 
The issue of "legality,
11 
based on whetper prior judicial review· 
is required (key issue-in Keith), was resolved in the Govern-
·ment 1 s favor by the United States District Court, District of 
. New Jersey, in United State·s versus Ivanov. Following an ex

the court sustained the authority of the Attorney General to

. The United States Cour·t of Appeals for the Third 
~ircuit reversed and re:::anded, a·ssuming, arguendo, that the 
President did have such authority and that therefore any electrc~i= 
surveillances in the case were legal. Further, the Appellate 
Court felt it had- to ass~a1e

in the present posture" of the case, 
·that the case was in fact built on electronic surveillance 
evidence. Consequently, the Appellate Court held that since 
the case arose prior to 9assage of Title III, Section 605 of 
the Federal Communicatio~s Act of 1934.applied, and it prohibitec 
"divulging" of electronic sur~eillance results as evidence in 
court. 
The issue of t~e legality of foreign national security 
electronic surveillances is also currently under advisement by 
the United States Court~= Appeals for the District of Colu.~bia 
Circuit in the case of e~ited States versus Enten. In Keith, 
the Supreme Court speci=~cally noted that two lower courts (the 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Clay,
