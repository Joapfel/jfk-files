SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) 
RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO TiiE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER 
there will be no investigative file but merely a coDDIJUnication 
from a field ~ffice reporting•infoxmation furnished by a 
source of the FBI on which some preventive action was 
predicated .. It is possible that the acts of violence 
reported by the source could involve a violation over which 
the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction. In such cases, 
the local field office would have merely furnished the 
information to the appropriate law enforcement agency and 
ru, investigative file would exist. • 
We are continuing our efforts to attempt to 
isolate those files which document preventive actions. 
Hnwev~r, because of the problems attendant thereto, as well 
as those problems raised in the_subp~r~raphS. of. Item.l, • 
it is reccmmended that a meeting ~a-arranged between Mr. John 
Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director, and representatives 
·~f this Bureau to discuss possible alternatives to some of 
these requests. 
Items.2 and 3 concern the September 24. 1975, 
report to the House Judiciary Committ~e by. the Gener.al 
Accounting nffice. Th~ F~I is in the process of preparing 
a response and it will be made available to the Committee 
as soon as possible. However. it is noted that the FBI 
prepared no analysis at all on the findings of the General 
Accounting Office contained in their report of September 24, • 1975. 
Item 4 requests the anm.ial reports from the 
office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investiga~ion 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr .• in 1963 through 1968, ~ 
the Women's L~beration Movement for the years that organi­
zation was under investigation. Item 4 also requests amrual 
• reports available on the investigations 11about which 
materials were supplied pursuant to John Elliff's request 
of nctober 28."
