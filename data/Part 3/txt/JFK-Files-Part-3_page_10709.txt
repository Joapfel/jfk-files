the fact that the DID has had broad ex .erience in the penetration 'o ,1s1 J-V.-~rsive

, Under the proposed transfer of phases of. the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence 
• Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions, Mr. Rosen 
to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and 
other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no 
problem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled 
r
in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the adlninistrative haro.ling 
of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Spec:ial Investigative 
I Division·which includes the informants being utilized on General Inveftip;ative 
l Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles 
u the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General 
Investigative Division handles key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy, 
Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment 
violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing 
Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in­
solub"le problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble 
problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information 
bet:ween the General Investigative Division and the DID. 
, In any event there will certamly be no lessening of pressure and. 
. supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents 
in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However, 
it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their 
broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration 
tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt 
that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the Klan certainly 
merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series of fie id con-
• ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.
