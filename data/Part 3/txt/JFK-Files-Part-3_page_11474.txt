Re: Senstudy 75 
62-116395 
Upon Senator Mondale's departure, SSC Chief 
Counsel Frederick A.O. Schwartz, Jr., acted as chairman. 
Mr. Shackelford read into the record a statement concerning 
the need for continued Bureau investigations of domestic 
organizations and individuals calling for illegal 
overthrow of the Government even though the threat is 
not imminent. Following numerous questions and answers 
in this area, the Session was adjourned at 1:00 p.m., 
with no date set for further discussion.
