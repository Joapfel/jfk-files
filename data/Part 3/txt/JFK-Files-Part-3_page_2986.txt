warrant. ~t seems to b~g-the question . 
Assuming that you ·say.· that. since we,, use informants a·nd 
investigate groups which may·. only engage in lawful activities 
but which might engage. in activ-ities that can result in 
violence or illegal a·ct:,s., a.11d you ci;ln 't use the warrant, but 
Congress could say that the use of informants is subject to 
such abuse and poses such a thr_eat to legitimate activity, 
including the willingness of people to assemble and discuss 
the anti-ballistic missile _system•,' and we don't want you to 
use them unless you have indication of criminal activity or 
unles·s you present your request to a magistra·te. in the same. 
fashion as you ·are required to do with respect to, in most 
cases, to wiretap. 
This is an option available to Congress. 
Senator Tower. Senator Schweiker. 
Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential 
security informant and a security informant? 
Mr. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator· Schweiker, 
·that in developing an jnformant we do a preliminary check on 
him before talking with him. and then we do a further in-depth 
background check. 
A potential security informant is someone who is under 
consideration before he is aprroved by· headquarters for use as· 
an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.
