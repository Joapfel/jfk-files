.I appreciate that the Bureau has constantly been 
-· alert to this problem and •is currently submitting intelli-
gence reports to us about riots and about_ the activity of 
I 
certain grqups and individuals before., during and after 
a riot. Indeed, the President has said both publicly and 
privately that the FBI is conducting extensive and comprehen-
sive investigations of these matters. . • · 
•There persists., however., a widespread belief that 
there is more organized activity in the riots than we 
·presently knm:t about. - We must recognize., I believe., that 
this is a relatively ·net..-r area of tnvestigation and intelli­
gence· reporting for the FBI c:nd ·the Depa~tment of Justice_. 
We have not heretofore had to deal with the possibility 
?fan organized pattern of violence., constituting a 
yiolation of federal lav•r., by a group of persons who make 
the urban ghetto their base.of operation and whose 
activities may not have been-regularly monito_red by 
~xisting intelligence sources.: • • 
. In these circumstan-<ces., we must be certain that 
every attempt is being- me.de to get a,11 information 
bearing upon these prob I ems; to take every step possible
