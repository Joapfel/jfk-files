But the thing ~s, would you be interested? 
And I said;- yes, I would be. 
MR.OLSEN: Did he talk to you about a sum of 
money? 
MR. STU~GIS:. No, no money was -- the discussion 
of money was not involved in it, because I would not do any­
thing for money .. And he knows better- than to ask me, unless. 
it ·would ·be, Frank, what do you need for your expenses? 
MR.OLSEN: Who was the target of this assassination? 
Was i'-t Fidel Castro? 
. MR. STURGIS: No. I don't know. What happened was 
that I had another meeting with him, and he said he would 
contact his Chief, and he_· would -- and he -·told me to contact 
·him later on, and I think he gave ·me a certain day to contact 
him, and_ ·I_ said OK. You must .remember that,how I know this 
man as an agent,- because he does the same things·as I do, 
in. his wife, he types • away·, or at least,.. he has a wife who 
, 
types away, he makes all the reports, and stacks them in a 
file cabinet. Ihave heard-him talk to his case officer •On 
the telephone ... And to me that was very stupid .of him in doing 
that even to me who was his friend. That is a stupid way of 
doing things. Because he did not suspect that I was- in touch 
with Sam, he cannot know. And· the only time that he suspected· 
that I had anything to do with CIA is.when we were in pris~n, 
and the man on the television said, yes, he used. to work forte
