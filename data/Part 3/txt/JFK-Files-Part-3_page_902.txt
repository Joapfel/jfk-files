. ~he constitutional issue here is, as was the issue 
in Nardone, a policy question. Given today's climate and 
public attitude .towards electronic surveillances in general, 
unchecked Presidential (White House) power, the distinction 
between use of electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes 
:vs. use for criminal prosecution, and the Supreme Court's 
tradition of avoiding constitutional issues if it can deci·de 
a ca,se on lesser issues, I am inclined to think the Court woul9, 
.,. grasp the "out" of the Section 605 e~identiar~ issue, thus 
.. leaving the constitutional issue unresolved and allowing 
··:· , .. P.residentially approved for~ign intelligence electronic surveil­
.. · . .. lanqes to co~tinue for the time betng .. • • ·. ·•_; . . . 
The practical result of this of course would be only 
.. , - to reverse the conviction of one man, Ivanov, presently at hone 
,.· .: ·_ .. ·_.-.in the Soviet Union. This ruling would not preclude post 1968 
•• • prosecutio~s based on foreign intelligence electronic surveil-
- .lance information, since 2511 ·(3) presumably expresses 
·\· Congress' intent to negate the evidentiary effect of Section 
.l 605 with respect to such cases: "The contents of any wire or 
oral communication intercepted by authority of the President in 
! -~·the exercise of the (powers enumerated in the statute,· generally 
-·~,: ..... ~-,~=-.. r.~l~~i!lg,. to. foreign in.telligence. and· efforts to unlawfully over­
•• • .- throw or endanger the structure of the Government.-) may be 
received in .-evidence in. any_ trial, hearing o·r other proceeding 
only where such interception was reasonable ... " 
With the Section 605 evidentiary obstacle presu.~ably 
disposed of by 2511 (3), it would seem that a post 1968 case 
on facts similar to Ivanov,·or oreferablv one actuallv built on 
~ - -electronic surveillance information, would be the best vehicle 
for eventually getting a ruling on the 4th Amendment issue.
