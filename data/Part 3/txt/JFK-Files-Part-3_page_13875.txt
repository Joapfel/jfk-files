who devotes part time to MOEC, being directed by Plata, who is 
probably a full-time agent of the Casr..ro government in charge 
of recruiting and controlling Cuban assistance to the organiza­
tion in the Cali area. 
'l1he 1"'0AR seems to have been in a rececs during recent mon-i::ns in 
the Cali area. In early November Luis Emiro Valencia, one of 
the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly if there was any 
truth to the story circulating in Cali that Castro had given 
him 50,000 dollars to help FUAR. He laughed and asserted the 
amount mentioned in Bogota is cinly 30,000. He said his only 
assis~ance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary 
contest in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips thereafter to 
judge other literary contests. It is difficult to determine 
the truth of Valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein. 
The story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six 
months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or 
Zapata. It is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse 
common ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia 
insists he will not accept if it is a tool of international 
Communism.
