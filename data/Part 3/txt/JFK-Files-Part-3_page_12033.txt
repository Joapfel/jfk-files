Cleaver was extremely upset because BPP headquarters and

additional exploitation of these circumstances under this

Effective means of neutralizing black extremist 
groups is by drying up their sources of funds. ·we authorized 
the New York division to advise the Episcopal Church Center 
by anonymous letters that a $67,000 requested grant from the

finance the Liberation School in Atl~nta, Georgia, was in 
r 
fact intended for use of Student National Coordinating 
Committee (SNCC) as the school was an operation of SNCC, a 
black extremist organization,and SNCC in seeking the grant had 
concealed its connection with the school. This operation 
resulted in the Church placing such low priority on this 
request that financial assistance for the school was precluded 
and the Liberation School was so advised. Since SNCC is in 
poor financial condition, this denial of funds was a blow to 
its endeavors to revitalize itself. The Director noted 
"excellent" on 9/3/70 memorandum which advised of this 
successful counterintelligence operation. 
A highly successful counterintelligence operation 
exposed to college administrators the unethical and deceptive 
: use made of college funds by Hack Student Organization, 
'Kalamazoo Coliege, Kalamazoo, Michigan, to purchase literature 
concerning the creation of explosive devices and concerning 
guerrilla warfare. As a result of this operation, college 
confiscated such literature, admonished Black Student Organi­
zation leaders and tightened administrative procedures to 
preclude similar misuse of its funds.
