of foreign intelligence in the United States. As a 
result of our internal security and counteri'ntelligence 
r0sponsibilities 2 we have produced a volume of :foreign 
intelligence covertly., In addition, ei th'er at tho 
specific request of other U. s. agencies or on our 
own initiative in response to national intelligence 
needs, we have produced such i1nelligence. We have 
done this on a selective basis and have not assumed 
full responsibility in this areao As indicative :z~ 
this, certain agreements have been made with CIA • 
permitting that Agency to assess and recruit after ,, 
coordination with thG FBI covert foreign intelligence 
sources in the United States (principally for use 
abroad) . Vle have reserved the right to take over 
such sources if internal security factors are paramount. 
In the absence of such factors, CIA is permitted to 
util~ze these sources for foreign intelligence·purposes. 
(6) We concluded that the expanded development 
of clandestine foreign intelligence sources is essential 
i:f national security interests are to be effectively 
served. 
(7) Exploitation of foreign diplomatic targets 
fortifies om: efforts in the internal security and 
counterintelligence fields. Information developed 
increases over-all knowledge and produces leads or ties 
to intelligence activity being carried out by foreign 
intelligence and security serviceso 
(8) The U. S~ intelligence community currently 
does not provide an organization or a mechanism which can 
effectively exploit the intelligence potential in the foreign 
diplomatic fieldo There have been expressions of concern 
and certain limited action taken by FBI and CIA, but there 
has not been a well-organized or united effort and most 
important of all, there has been a decided lack of leader­
ship directed towa::c-d attacking the problem and at the 
same time inducing an atmosphere of harmonious application
