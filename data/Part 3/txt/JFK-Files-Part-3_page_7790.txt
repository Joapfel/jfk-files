L~gal Counsel to Adams, Memo 
Re: SENSTUDY 75 
Department of Justice. Mr. O'Connor also mentioned that the 
summary would, of course, have to set forth~ sufficient 
information to allow the Committee to make a determination that the 
information derived from these wiretaps was not used for political 
purposes. Mr. Mintz expressed concern that the publication 
• or leaking of information from summaries could expand the number 
and nature of suits facing the Bureau and suggested the Department 
should, in obtaining the Court approval for.making the summaries 
available, request· the Court to issue appropriate safeguards 
against publication of such information. Mr. O'Connor stated 
that such a recommendation to the Court would be proper and that 
this would be done. 
Mr. Mintz told Mr. O'Connor that the Bureau at this 
time cannot make a commitment to the making available of the 
summaries to the Committee without further study and approval, 
and an approval would be sought expeditiously. Additionally, 
Mr. Mintz requested that the Bureau be given the opportunity to 
review the summaries prepared by the Department to insure the 
Bureau's interests are protected. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
That we notify the Department that we are in agreement 
concerning the preparation of summaries base~ on existing 
summaries of 11Kissinger 17" wiretaps with the provision.that 
we be given the opportunity to review these summaries prior 
to the Department seeking Court approval for making them 
available. • •
