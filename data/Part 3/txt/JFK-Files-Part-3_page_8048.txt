A review ~f this lef-t~;Awas ~·~u; ,~,(he:; m~~ran~: ...-:~:/ ~ 
Wannall to Adams dated 6/30/75. The Deputy Attorney General 
found considerable difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of 
the 6/25/75 letter pointing out that neither the Department of 
Justice nor the FBI had entered into any agreement. In view 
of the ambiguities the Deputy Attorney General found in the 
letter as well as the lack of any sp~cific a~:i;;,,eement entered intowith 
the Senate Select Committee (SSC) by the Department anaJor the EBI,
