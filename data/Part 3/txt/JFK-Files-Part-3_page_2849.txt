PAGE TWO 
• PROTECTED. SHOULD ANY FORMER EMPLOYEE CONTACT YOUR OFFICE AND 
HAVE ANY QUESTION REGARDING HIS OBLIGATION NOT TO DIVULGE INFOR­
MATION OBTAINED BY VIRTUE OF HIS PAST FBI EMPLOYMENT, HE SHOULD 
BE INSTRUCTED TO CONTACT LEGAL COUNSEL, FBIHQ, BY COLLECT CALL. 
YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER EMPLOYEES MUST BE IN KEEPING WITH 
OUR PLEDGE. IT IS BELIEVED SUCH A PROCEDURE WOULD INSURE PROPER 
PROTECTION AND ALSO FACILITATE THE WORK OF THE SSC. 
THE ABOVE PROCEDURE ALSO APPLIES TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES 
OF YOUR OFFICE. HOWEVER, CONTACT WITH THE LEGAL COUNSEL SHOULD 
BE HANDLED THROUGH THE SAC.
