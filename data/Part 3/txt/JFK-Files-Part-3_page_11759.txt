2. It will be noted that supervision of antiriot and 
bombing cases currently in General Investigative Division 
has been included in table of organization of proposed 
Domestic Intelligence Division and specifically assigned 
to the Extremist Intelligence Section. Four Agents and 
two clerks are now assigned to this Unit in the General 
Investigative Division and should, of course, be transferred 
to the new Division. 
• This is a most logical move and will afford tighter 
and more effective supervision of antiriot and bombing vio­
lations in view of fact that extremists arid terrorists mostly 
involved are being actively investigated by Domestic Intelli-

duplicative supervisory action, it follows that DID is better 
prepared to handle these criminal investigations and final 
prosecutive actions. 
3. The line of reasoning utilized in the breakdowns 
~s set forth above in the tables of organization was to separate 
the work into two categories as nearly as possible - domestic 
and foreign. 
The proposed Domestic Intelligence Division is 
composed of New Left, Extremist Intelligence and Internal 
Security Sections. All work of these Sections is domestic 
oriented consisting of domestic subversive and extremist 
organizations such as Connnunist Party, Socialist ·workers 
Party, black extremists, New Left and anti-war groups as 
well a$ individuals affiliated therewith. 
On the other hand, the proposed Counterespionage" 
Foreign Intelligence Division is composed of the Espionage 
and Nationalities Intelligence Sections which supervise 
investigations which for the most part have definite foreign 
ramifications. The work of these Sections is foreign oriented 
consisting of such investigations as Soviet and satellite 
establishments and individuals as well as other foreign 
nationality groups and nationals, including Chinese connnunists. 
The Nationalities Intelligence Section will continue to super­
vise Legal Attaches and domestic Liaison through·the Special
