In the period of time I have \een 
assigned to criminal work I t1ve 
handled a number of PC Is with :'a i view 
to the qualification of th~m as 
approved Criminal Informants. In the past year since'I 
last had an approved Criminal Informant I have handled 
several PCis including one who previously was the prime 
factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted 
for the murder of a police officer. This PCI has since 
furnished information of value which was relayed to the 
local police in a burglary case. He has been given the 
assignment to develop further information concerning local 
suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this 
and oth_~r burglaries. 
In the past year I have been unable 
to devote a great deal of time to the development of this 
and other PCis due to having been utilized as Relief 
811peY>visor in the absence of the regular supervisor and 
b~caus·e of the time necessary to prepare anci presen-i:. let.: i.u.L•e;:; 
at police schools on legal matters. 
I am aware of the importance of the 
Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to 
develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to 
qualify the above-mentioned PCI in the very near future.
