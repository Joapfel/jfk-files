Veterans Against the War? 
Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the 
intent to halter political expression? 
Mr. Adams. We had information on the Vietnam Veterans 
Against the War that indicated that there were-subversive 
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting 
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending 
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the 
International Communist Party. We feel that we.had a very valid 
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW. 
It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was 
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made, 
and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it 
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost 
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point 
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and· they closed, 
those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow 
the national organization. 
But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we 
investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation 
and subservience to the national office. 
Senator Tower. Mr. Hart? 
Senator llart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing 
afte:i; the Veterans Against the lvar, you got a lot of informatio 
that clearly has no relationship to any Federal ·criminal
