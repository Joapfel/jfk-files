Communist Influence of Racial Groups 
100-442529 
This intensification was initiated in August, 
1964. The subject matter was previously reported in a 
subsection of the Communist Party report, but the volume 
and importance of this inf'ormation nade it necessary to 
follow this communist influence in a separate investigation. 
This investigation includes not only the influence of the 
Communist Party but also that of the Trotskyite groups, 
splinter groups and others including the New Left. 
The overall objective in this and related 
investigations is to protect the internal security of 
the United States by submitting information relating to 
possible Federal violations to the Attorney General for 
prosecution. We also have the responsibility to develop 
intelligence i!!forme.tion ann cjlj /:;.fH=:rn.inatA to interested 
Government agencies. Where feasible, certain counter­
intelligence measures are employed to neutraliz~ the 
communist influence in the racial field. 
Reports are submitted quarterly and the investi­
gation is evaluated upon receipt of each rep9rt. Pertinent 
·-information is disseminated to the White House and the 
Attorney General. 
The year 1970 saw continued influence by 
communists and other subversives in extremist groups. 
In fact, the communist attempts to influence the black 
extremist Black Panther Party were so insistent that the 
Panthers have become wary of the motives of the Communist 
~arty. This has not diminished in any way the Communist 
Party's efforts to influence and support the Black Panther 
Party, the communist tactic being to support the Panthers 
whether they want it or not. 
One illustration of the communist influence on 
the violence-prone Black Panther Part.y is the situation in 
which li11~Y-N~'Lt.9Jb? Panther .Supreme pg~~£, found himself
