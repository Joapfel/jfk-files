2. The San Francisco Office does have standards which 
requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this 
division should conform to and that is they should have 
a minimum of four PCis or one CI and two PCis or two 
Cis assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by 
no means considered a maximum and many Agents 
participate more fully L~ the program. 
Ther~ are currently no first office agents assigned to 
this division and when an Agent is transferred to this 
division and assigned to criminal work he is expected 
to show some progress by the end of sixty days and 
within one year he is expectE<l to he in compliance 
with the above standards. . ..
