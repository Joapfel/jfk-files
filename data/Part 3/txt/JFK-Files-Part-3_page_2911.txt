Mr. Kelley. I don't think they're asking for files. 
I think they're asking for what t~stimony was given by 
witnesses whose testimony has not been given up. I don't know. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. I'll quote it. 11Af;1.d all 
material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates 
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference." 
I repeat the question. Why is the Justice Depart.rnent 
asking this Committee for material provided to us by the 
FBI? 
Mr. Kelley. Frankly, I don't know. Do you mind if I 
just ask --
(Pause) 
Hr. Kelley. I am informed, and I knew this one. 
Everything that was sent to you was sent through them. Did 
they have a copy also? Yes, they had a retained copy. I 
don't know why. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. So there's nothing you 
provided us· that's not available to the Justice Department? 
Mr. Kelley. That's right. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. And you can't account for why 
an official of the Justice Department would ask this Committee 
for your records? 
Mr. Kelley. No,· sir. 
Senator Hart of Colorado. You released a statement on 
?lovemher the 18th of '74 regarding the FBI' s. counter-intelligen e
