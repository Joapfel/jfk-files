activities, because I was a student in Germany and watched the 
storm troopers take the public platforms and the streets away 
from the democratic parties of Germany. And I would have 
been 1 delighted in those days if there had been CIA's in 
Britain and France and the United· States that could have come 
in there and found ways to help the democratic parties of 
Germany, and the failure to do so resulted in 50 million 
people being killed. 
So I feel very strongly that although we ought to, 
that a President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense 
must keep this sort of thing very much under control and take 
responsibility for it, that we must have this capability. 
MR. BELIN: Do you have any observations concerning 
the' effectiveness or any possible changes in the President's 
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board as an oversight vehicle or -
a related vehicle to CIA? 
MR. RUSK: Well, I don't want to do a disservice to 
people who have rendered dedicated service. I have had the 
impression over the years the Foreign Intelligence Advisory 
Board gets to be more gung-ho than anybody else, and that 
sometimes some of these things are urged by the Foreign 
Intelligence Advisory Board which operationally may not make 
23 much sens~. So I think that it is all right to have then

advise, but they should not be permitted to make the decisions 
or to influence the decisions unduly.
