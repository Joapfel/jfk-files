In summary, the work load of the Domestic Intelligence 
Division as exemplified by case loads set forth under "Pending 
Work and Delinquency," 4-D-l, are very high, Being mindful of 
the practical limits of Bureau resources, I believe the currently 
proposed adjustment of work assignments detailed in my above 
referred to memorandum of 7/29/71 will allow the Domestic 
Intelligence Division to function effectively with existing

validity of manpower committed to the Ellsbe~ case, as well as 
overall manpower needs of the Domestic1nt"eiligence Division, are 
welcomed.
