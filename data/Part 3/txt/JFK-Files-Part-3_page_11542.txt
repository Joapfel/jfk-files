noted that developments had indicated that at least part of the "McNamara Study" 
w~s reportedly in the possession of the Institute for Policy Studies and that 
While a page-by-page review of the Bureauts file on that Institute had not 
revealed any information concerning Ellsberg, we had developed material in the

up above the law, claiming the right to decide what should be released to the
