ourselves whether Mr. Hoover was off on a wild goose chase

not advocating it, I am merely asking a question .. They would 
be available if the Committee took a vote to hear them and 
decided on it. 
Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my -juris­
diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the 
Attorney General. 
Senator Goldwater. I see. 
Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance 
routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a 
target of inquiry? 
Mr. Kelley. They are retained usually for ten years. 
Senator Goldwater. Ten years. 
Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir. 
Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any, 
to the Bureau of retaining such information? 
Mr. Kelley. If there be guidelines that set out a 
destruction or erasure,we will abide by it. We will, on those 
occasions where we think that matters might come up within 
that period of time.which may need the retention of them, we 
will express our opinion at that time, but other than that 
we would be guided by guidelines. 
Senator Goldwater. Is it your view that legitimate 
law enforcement needs should outweigh privacy considerations
