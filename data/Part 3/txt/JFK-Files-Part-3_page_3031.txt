QUESTION: 
MR. ADAMS: 
• 
we tried to reconstruct as to 'the actual number of Klan 
informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I 
think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that 
right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan 
had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you 
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in 
the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the 
hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was 
going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and 
considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the 
violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as 
many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind 
that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone, 
was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights 
workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzza case, the 
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one 
tremendous problem at that time. 
I acknowledge that. 
Our only approach was through informants. Through the 
use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were 
solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved. 
They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told 
the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved 
informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the 
bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he 
could see that this could continue forever unless we could
