Black extremism is concentrated in organized activities 
of 64 groups, some of which have chapters in major cities through­
-out the U.S. The five major nationwide groups have chapters 
in 139 cities. Hard-core membership in these black extremist 
groups totals in excess of 8,300. This membership figure, 
however, disguises the real following of extremist groups in 
black areas of our cities and the extent of influence and 
leadership they exercise .. This real support, especially from 
young blacks, is surfaced during confrontations with police 
and the Establishment. In fact, hostility toward the police 
by black extremist groups, as well as by black youths, continues 
unabated in many of our major cities. 
Set out hereinafter are summaries concerning the key 
black extremist organizations that are presently under active 
a~d penetrative investigation.

Computerized Telephone Number File (CTNF) was expanded 
on 2/2E/71 to include telephone numbers of black, New Left and 
other ethnic extremists. As a result, black extremist groups, 
black extremist Security Index subjects and individuals included 
in the Black Nationalist Photograph Album have been entered 
into the CTNF. This has proven to be extremely valuable investiga­
tive tool and has saved the field considerable investigative 
time in ascertaining subscribers of telephone numbers since 
"hits" are made on 15. 5 percent of numbers checked against the 
file. 
: The Black Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA) was 
established on 3/8/69 to assist in identification of militant 
black extremists who travel extensively~
