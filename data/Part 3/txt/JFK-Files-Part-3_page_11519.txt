RE!rlL.i\.RKS OF CCNGESSVL4..N ROY. A. TAYLOR. 
JA1'TUARY 22, 1976 
Mr.Speaker, I would like to call my colleagues• atten,tion to 
the editorial appearing in the U.S. News &World Report of January 
26,1976,titled nis· .America Going Mad?11 .. In line with the editorial 
are not segments of the press, television commentators, and many 
spokesmen of the Congress· going too far in emphasizing the negativ 
and ignoring the positiveG-in dwelling on the mista...~es of the past 
~rather than the problems of the present and the hopes of the futur 
Are they not going too far in destroying the confidence of the 
American people and of people abread in our li.merican inttitutiona­
the FBI, the CIA, the Defense Department, the CongBess--~_and.in~ 
destroying the confidence in public officials both those serving· 
today and many ·whose honorable servise has ended with death---­
J.Edgar Hoover, John F.Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt~ • 
Are they not tearing our nation·to pieces in the eyes of the 
world and weakening fundamental institutions whose effective 
services are needed today and will be needed tomorrow. Why deelJl 
so long on the negative and lose sight of tpe pnsitive aqcomplish­
ments, thereby giving people a defeatist attitude and placing doub 
and mistrust between the people and their governmento 
This is serious because without nublic confidence our Democrac 
cannot operate and it cannot win and-maintain respect abroad. 
I, too, want to know the truth a7Jd ~ help right the wrongs· •• 
established, but once the truth has been revealed I am content 
to let thef.t:acts take their place in history and agree· with the 
editorial that no useful purpose is served by constantly r.ep.eating 
the mistakes of the past~ • . • 
The future belongs to the peo~le,communities and nations who 
ha1,..e faith in themselves and in what they stand for and in what 
they are doing~ My choice of a motto• for the Bicentennial 
year is nTake pride in America's past and take part in its 
future .. 11 
The editorial follows:
