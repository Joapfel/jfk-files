THUMBNAIL SKETCH PROGRAM 4-H 
This program was initiated and authorized by 
SAC Letter 53-72 (J) dated October 27, 1953, to insure 
that the field is using current characterizations of 
subversive organizations and to provide uniformity in 
characterizing such organizations. Those characterizations 
deemed to be of field-wide interest are now to be 
furnished to the field by letter to all offices on an 
annual basis rather than by SAC Letter as was formerly 
the practice, iµ accordance with approval of suggestion 
in memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr dated December 7, 
1970. 
The background and value of this program is 
the same as it was at the time of last inspection. Since 
June 1, 1971, we have been receiving and processing the 
annual submission of thumbnail sketcheso To date 
thumbnail sketches on 387 separate organizations have 
been received and these are being processed by appropriate 
supervisory personnel at the Bureau. Those of field-wide 
i interest,;<:f which there are 70 at this time, :will. be 
;furnished to the field by letter to all offices. Others 
·are being returned to submitting field offices as they 
are approved. This program was last reviewed and analyzed 
and its continuance approved by memorandum R. L. Shackelford 
to Mr. c. D. Brennan dated October 12, 1970. Annual 
approval will again be requested when the current project 
is completed.
