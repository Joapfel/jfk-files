(3) As of August 17, 1971, there was a shortage 
of one Special Agent in the Soviet Unit - New York. As of 
August 17, 1971, there was no overage of authorized personnel 
in the Espionage Section. 
(4) Clerical personnel is considered adequate but 
not excessive at the present time. 
(5} Since the last_ inspection the Special Agent 
complement of the Espionage Section has been reduced by two. 
At the time of the last inspection the Espionage Section had a 
total case load of 5,089 cases, of which 141 were handled by 
clerical personnel in lieu of Agent personnel. There was, 
therefore, an average of 275 pending investigations per Agent 
Supervisor. As of July 31, 1971, the Espionage Section had a 
total of 5,575 cases, of which 270 were handled by clerical • 
personnel. This provided an average of 331 pending investigations 
for each Agent Supervisor. 
(6) By memorandum June 4, 1971, a request was made to 
increase the Special Agent complement by one Special Agent. 
This was predicated on an increase in the volume and complexity 
of investigations handled. The request was denied. By memorandum 
July 14, 1971, I asked to increase the Special Agent complement 
by one in order that the Ironcl~d case could be assigned the 
. full-time job of one Special Agent. _,.Ir:ol]._clad is a unique source 
of the Bureau and it is important that information from this source 
is given the analysis and consideration that it deserves. This 
request was denied, and. the Special Agent complement of the 
Espionage Section was fixed at 18. In light of President Nixon's 
recent request to cut back, no request for additional Special Agent 
personnel is being made and the present complement is considered 
adequate. 
(7) Criteria utilized in determining the adequacy of 
personnel includes the volume of cases supervised, the complexity 
of the cases, and the importance .of the investigation. 
In the Soviet Units - Washington and New York, we are 
currently handling 2,190 cases among an authorized complement of
