give you an e~p·l·a~ation ;~-~ ~~t as t~\,her•·· th~ person who 
prepared that particular memorandUII\ got that information, The 
file itself indicates; as you are ~ell awnre, that Fitzgerald 
did not travel to Paris in November. lie travelled in October, 
So the person who prepared the 29 March, 1965 memo came 
up with this particular type of information, I don't know. 
Hr, Johnston, Who is that memo addressed to again? 
AMLASII Case Officer, This is to Chief, l"I frc.,m Chief, 
Reports. 
Mr, Johnston, So your only explanation, your 
for the memo is that it is inaccurate but even if it 
explanatio~ 
is : 
13 inaccurate, it indicates that in March, 1965 these people had 
14 it all wrong as to what the AMI.ASH operation was all about. 
15 ~ILASII Case Officer. If you want to interpret exactly 
16 what they wrote here, yes, it was wrong. Now I'm not saying 
17 that it was wrong because it could have been. I don't know. 
18 I'm just saying it could have been that they cUdn' t have access

to all the restricted files because this operation until it 
received it5 recent publicity was ~ept on a very restricte<l 
basis, 
So the Chief of Reports, I don't even know, well, 
probably the Chief of Reports in the division or maybe some 
place, probably did not have access to all of the operational 
files.
