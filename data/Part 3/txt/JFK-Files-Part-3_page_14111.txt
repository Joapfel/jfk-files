arid prior to his departure from the country, on August 23, 
he took the occasion on AuguStr21, 22, and j3 to express his 
worry to the President and to the Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. McCo~e 2clmowlsdged th~t he had no positive eviacnce to 
support his concerri, but he reasoned that the cxtensi~e air 
defense buildup wl11ch was µnderway in Cuba ·na.d asr ~.ts Jr.uncd1ate 
purpose the denial' of the surveillance by the United Stat·es of 
the Soviet. m.i.ssile buildup in Cuba .. • The U-2 photoc;raphy which 
was being obtained reflected -that 26 SA-2- sites \vould be 
installed in Cuba. Mr. McCone observed that while the pho'to-
.grapby obtained at the time did not provide e~idence of ~is~ile 
sites,·a current review of that photography indicates .the • 
presence of· tents and some construction equipment. Mr. Mc­
Cone sa:td • that when he left the country on August 23, .· he 
.instructed tr1at a daiJ.y ·CIA.bulletin be· initiated at on,;e wl tr. 
respect to Cuban developments, and he in.it:tated. j_ssuance of, \ i • 
th1s reporting after consultation with the US)B. When in Ss-ptember

China on September a~ these incidents caused Mr.,McConc to be 1 
concerned. Neycrtheless, overflights were ordered. It developed, 
however, that from September 17 to September 20, \'!eat 11er con­
ditions would not. permit_'che overflights of Cuba. 
At about that time the Sp~cial NSC 54·12/2 Group, as well 
as the CIA, became convinced t;hat some risk i'fc?.s involved in 
the conduct of U-2· operations over"'··Cuba. r:or that reason,

. A3 reflected in the SNIE dated September 19, 1962, Mr. 
McCone said that the USIB dismissed the possibility that MRBMs 
were being introdt 1ced into Cuba, and this, view was based on 
tl1e • belief that such introduction would confront the USSR with 
so many difficulties that the action would hot be undertaken.
