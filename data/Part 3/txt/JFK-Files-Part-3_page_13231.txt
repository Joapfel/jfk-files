Special Group (Augmented) meetings at which General Carter 
participated and discussions of Cuba and/or Cuban overflights 
during the p~riod August 15 to November 14, 1-962. This file 
contains a memorandum dated October 16, 1962, from General 
Carter to the Special G~oup Augmented, Subject: "Operation 
' M. ONGO?SE Sabotage Proposals." Paragraph le _frf this memorandum 
;:ontains a proposal that the CIA undertak~~l9"re:nade }ttack on 
~L\~he Chinese Communist Ernbassy"\.in Havana, to be carried out by 
a recruited Cuban agent who f.d~ access to a roof overlooking 
the0mbass~)garden and who has volunteered for this mission." 
~~ The second file in this collection is entitled 
simply "MONGOOSE." This contains nothing relevant to .the 
assassination inquiry. 
Next in this collection in a large manila 
envelope on which is written in ink the following notation: 
"Separate cover attachment.to ER75-5938." This envelope 
contains miscellaneous papers related to MONGOOSE. The 
documents in this envelope contain, among other things, a 
long list of potential sabotage targets within Cuba. I found 
no reference to assassination, either explicit or implicit. 
The next file examined is marked."Cuba Special 
Subject." This file also contains miscellaneous papers 
relating to Project MONGOOSE, none of which contain any 
references to assassination. 
The last item of this MONGOOSE package consists 
of a bulky loose-leaf binder of papers assembled for General 
Carter's reference of significant things that happened during 
the period of August to October, 1962. In this notebook, the 
Inspector General has.already flagged entries which refer in 
any way to Operation MONGOOSE. I have examined all such 
entries.
