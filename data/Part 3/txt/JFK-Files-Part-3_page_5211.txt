PART B: GAMBLING MATTERS 
1. In, the San Francisco Division there appears 
to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms 
.of handle, volume, coverage, number of accounts, and 
·number of employees. These operators are CARL EZEKIAL 
ECKSTEIN and CP..ARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR. , both of whom are 
based in San Francisco. While they both handle suQstantial 
individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily 
associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for 
e: action. " 
CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been 
engaged in ga.~bli~g a0tivities most of his adult life. 
ECKSTEIN was formerly o.ss.::;ciatec!. -.;•;ri th TO"l\JV ROIZ and. otner 
San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN 
has set.up his own independent operation. ECKSTEIN has been 
. 1 arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but 
I has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN 
1 
was convicted for failure to pay Federal ,vagering ta~ which 
conviction was subsequently overturned. Details regarding 
his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3. 
CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan, 
in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities 
throughout his adult life. He was convicted in United 
States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest 
on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S . 
. Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was 
sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation. 
Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford, 
Oregon. He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring 
of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his 
absence from Sah Francisco, his ex-brother-in-law, KEN1~ETH 
JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking 
operation. LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco 
Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is
