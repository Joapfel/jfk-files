was a serious internal security threat, with law enforcenent 
as its immediate target. He utilized the Director's compre­
hensive testimony on the BPP before the House Sub-Conunittee 
on Appropriations on 3/5/70 in bringing out the revolutionary 
, and terroristic threat presented by BPP and its leaders. He 
concluded the program with the opinion that ttwe are subsidizing 
our own destruction if we allow this to continue." 
To drive a wedge between BPP and many of its 
contributors, data concernb.g the anti-Zionist and anti-Semetic 
nature of BPP was furnished a news media source. As a result 
articles were published during June and July, 1970, in various 
newspapers throughout U.S., including "Long Island Press," 
Long Island, New York;ttDaily News," Springfield, Massachusetts; 
and "Mobile Register,". Mobile, Alabama. These articles 
discussed the close alliance developed between BPP and Al Fatah,

Israel. These articles emphasized that numerous pro-Arab and 
anti-Israeli articles have been published in the BPP newspaper 
and some of the latter articles called for the complete d:istruc­
tion of.Israel. 
The above articles as well as many other counterintelli­
gence operations authorized since last inspection have contribute~ 
materially to drying up of contributions to BPP. Loss of revenue 
is one of the BPP's greatest problems and perhaps the best 
illustration is the drop in the size and circulation of the 
BPP newspaper, the Party's primary propaganda device. This 
paper has declined from 20 or more pages to 12 in its 1/2/71 
issue and circulation at the end of the year.was less than 
100,000 after a high of 183,000 in October, 1970. 
Counterintelligence action has also contributed or 
led to disruptions, dissension and factionalism in the BPP, the 
most important of the black extremist organizations. Sources 
have reported internal strife has developed among top BPP 
leaders and there is a growing distrust among them of one 
another. For example, Albert Howard, national leader who has _.,., =--- ¼ ri,g;: 
. been supervising BPP activities on East Coast, and RoJ?srr:;t 13P-:::X,, 
a BPP leader in New York, have been recalled to national BPP
