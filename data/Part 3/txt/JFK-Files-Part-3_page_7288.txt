At a meeting of the USIB this morning Chairm;in 'f'{(\....-".>~ 
Colby spoke briefly about Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ; •~ 
procedures for testifying before the Blue Ribbon Commission ~ 
(BR.C) investigating CIA as well as anticipat~ problems that • 
might arise regarding future testimony at thVSe..n..ate Select 0. 
COJllJllitte,e. (SSC) whose membership has not yet been announced. ('-. 
According to Colby, the mandate of the SSC is to examine the '~·, • 
extent of overt and covert intelligence activities in the 
U. s. and abroad. Colby advised that the SSC would involve .r{ 
all member agencies and departments of the intelligence ~ 
community and for that reason he believed the members of the "-....J 
intelligence community should stay in close communication. 
As a result of the above, Colby has selected 
Mr. John Clarke, Deputy Director of the Intelligence Community 
Staff, to act as a coordinator for the intelligence community 
to insure close coordination. He requested that all agencies 
and departments represented on USIB designate one individual 
in their agency as Clarkes point of contact.to insµre the 
close coordination Colby feels will be necessary during future 
appearances before the SSC. The Intelligence Division believes 
this is a desirable procedure and recommends that Section Chief 
William o. Cregar who is the Bureau's alternate member on USIB 
be designated as the Bureau representative to maintain liaison· 
with Mr. Clarke. REC-11]\ {o -;L ~/ / b ':J'l \- / ,. 
In addition, Colby advised that in his opening ~ 
statement before the SSC he intends to make a strong pitch • 
for the intelligence community. He proposes to show the value 
and importance intelligence has played in the past as well as 
the future;:he expects to outline for the SSC how the intelli­
gence business is run and organized. In addition, he proposes 
in his opening state.ment to make an appeal for legislation to 
shore up the protection of sources and met~'?.agains.!J?!ann~~:
