Dear Sir:

Chicago, Ill. 606?6 
April 17, 1967 
Enclosed is our 1967 income tax return. Salary for 
which there is no W-2 forms comes from several short or 
part time jobs which did not withhold. ' 
Just as last year we cannot, o:f course,. vol1:1,ntarily 
pay our ·tax so long-as the war in Vietnam continues; 
Should the F,overnment run short of funds in the meantime 
we suggest repee."1 of the oil depletion allowa_nce or any 
other of the tax·breaks for the wealthy.· 
Sincerely yours; 
C . W (I;_,__,~ -r--
