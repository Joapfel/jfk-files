QUANTICO 
The Bureau has received inquiries recent1y concerning the reliability 
of the so-called truth serums. The Bureau is not in possession of any information 
concerning the use of drugs or chemicals which will compel a person to speak only . 
the truth. The Bureau, however, will not tolerate any expe~iments or participati-0n 
on.the part or its personnel in the utilization of the so-called truth serums or 
ot_her chemicals alleged to have a similar effect. All employees are accordingly 
ca~tioned against any participation whatsoever in the utilization of truth serums 
or similar drugs in connection with any cases. 
Obviously, great criticism would be directed at the Bureau if it utilized 
any element of this kind in connection with its investigations. The Bureau cannot 
jeopardize its good reputation by even considering the utilization .of such an. 
1nvestigative procedure and, consequently, in the event any Bureau agent violates 
~these instructions, drastic administrative action will be taken. 
Very truly yours, 
r~h1i
