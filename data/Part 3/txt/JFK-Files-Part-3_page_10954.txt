coordinated. This would be most important ii the 1 
individual in any way was connected with or associated 
wi t.h an intelligence service. 
2) DOD is an~ious to have freedom to assess 
and recruit Bloc diplomats not known to be engaged in 
intelligence activityo On the su~face, this does not 
appear to pr0s~nt a problera, but realistically speaking 
it is impossible for us to know that a Soviet diplomat, 
not ltnown to be engaged in intelligence activity one 
day, ~ppears on the scene the following week as an agent 
or coopted agent. To give CIA wide latitude in this field 
could.create a truly undesirable mess. We believe that 
if CIA is pe:rmitted to move on such targets it should be 
done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination. 
3) CIA's organizational and operational 
deficiencies, such as lack of discipline,/poor internal • 
coordination, unsatisfactory records, all\introduce head­
aches which undoubtedly will continue to exist for many 
years. \ 
4) There continues to be an element of mistrust 
and misunderstanding between the two organizations because 
of the historical reasons described aboveg, 
. 5) Continuing lack of one agency 0 s appreciation 
.for the other's objectives, responsibilities and operational 
philosophy. 
6) The absence of a clearly defined Bureau policy 
and objectives in the field of foreign intelligence collec­
tion. CIA really does not know the nature and the extent 
of our interests, and consequently this lends.to confusion 
and misunderstanding. , -.
