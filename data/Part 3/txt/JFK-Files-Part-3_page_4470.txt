en October 19, 1959, GREENWALD advised SA DEAN 
that THOMAS DICKSON, described above, was contacted by an 
individual, presumably a JOHN POLLINA, in an endeavor to 
purchase his 2500 acre plot in Salem, N.J. GREENWALD 
allegedly was told by DICKSON that it was demanded that 
he set a price for his land and that DICKSON would be 
contacted Wednesday evening, October 21, 1959, for his 
answer. GREENWALD said that DICKSON had called him and 
related this information. DICKSON was said to be extremely 
worried over what may happen to him or his family if he 
does not sell the land. 
By letter October 26, 1959, the Newark Division 
advised that. THOIVIAS PANCOAST DICKSON on October 20, 1959, 
was interviewed by SA .. ROBERT D. ALDRICH and advised as 
follows: 
DICKSON did not know other than from rumor who 
was involved in the sale of land to the land adjoining 
his property for the purpose of using it as a garbage 
disposal area. He had been approached to sell his land 
by CHARLES ACTON, Swedesboro, N.J., a real estate dealer. 
No threats were made to him but ACTON told him that the 
people he represented "had to have the land" and for him 
to name his price and they would buy. 
DICKSON has heard from sources unrecalled that 
the POLLINAs were the persons behind the project but he 
observed that there appeared to be a great deal of political 
pressure coming from the .State of New Jersey regarding the 
matter. It appeared that the state wanted to use Salem 
County as a dump ground for the whole state since dumping 
on the North Jersey meadows has been stopped. 
A. W. W. HOWELL, Box 459, Parsippany, N.J.,. told 
DICKSON that the state of New Jersey had made an official 
investigation concerning the matter so he, DICKSON, 
called a Detective Sergeant EMIL DALINT of the New Jersey 
State Police at West Trenton, N. J., who admitted··.to him that such an investigation had been made and a file 
existed but that he preferred that DICKSON talk to his 
s upe.rior, Deputy Attorney General JOHN J. BlJRG IN for any official information. DICKSON did not proceed further.
