not to label criminc'll intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice_. 
but to recogniz~ the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being 
safeguarded. ·other incidents of government regulatory authority have 
been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of 
Constitutional protection, e.g. the administrative search cases, Camara v.

, Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-
reasonable search and seizure or thro11gh con1pelled self-incri1:.1ination is 
tainted and subject to judicial conde1nnation upon complaint of one· having· 
the requisite standing. 
Perhaps, the decision cm:ninp: nearest to cl-iscussing the. 
legality of criminal intellig-cnce collection was Anderson v. Sills. 106 N. J. 
Super. 545, 25G A2d 293 (1QG9), (reversed on the grouncr more complete 
record was needed to support the decision) 56 N. J. 210, 265 .t\2d G78 (1970). 
New Jersey had responded to the threat of co·ntinuing civil disorders by 
collecting intelligence information on persons and events alleged to have 
some relationship to such activities. The trial court held the collection 
effort to be unconstitutional because.it conflicted with the Firsl Amendment .
