of foreign intelligence in the United States. As a 
result of our internal security and counterintelligence 
responsibilities, we have produced a v9lume of foreign 
intelligence covertly. In addition~ either at tho 
specific request of other u. s. agencies or on our 
ovm initiative in response to national intelligence 
needs, w~ have produced such in~elligence. We have 
don0 this on a so lee-ti vo bar;;is and h~ve not assumed 
full responsibility in this areae As indicative 1·f 
this :i certain agreements have been made vii th CIA • 
pe~mitting that Agency to assess and recruit after , 
coordination with the FBI covert foreign intelligence 
sources in the United States (principally for use 
abroad). ·we have reserved the right to take over 
such sources if internal secm•ity factors are paramount. 
In the absence of such factors 1 CIA is permitted to 
util~ze these sources for foreign intelligence·purposes. 
(6) We concluded -'chat the expanded development 
of clandestine foreign intelligence sources is essential 
if national security interests are to be effectively 
served. 
(7) Exploitation of foreign diplomatic targets 
fortifies our efforts in the internal security and 
counterintelligence fie~ds. Information developed 
increases over-all knowledge and produces leads or ties 
to intelligence activity being carried out by foreign 
intelligence and security services. 
(8) The U. s. intelligence community currently 
does not provide an organization or a mechanism which can 
effectively exploit the intelligence potential in the foreign 
diplomatic fieldo The~e have been expressions of concern 
and certain limited action taken by FBI ~nd CIA, but there 
has not been a well-organized or united effort and most 
important of all, t"nere has been a decided lack of leader­
ship directed toward attacking the problem and at the 
. . .. same time inducing an atmosphere of harmonious application . ···-·, •• --,·~·-.-··.,of i:'i:i'.r"availabl'e ··res6ilrcesf···· •• ;:·- .,,. - .,.;,. :,, •·.,•.:,.· ... :, .. ,,.··-~.-::,., •'", .... :, :-.,._, .... ,
