. Dear Director Colby: 
(f'IIIISUANT TD "· RES. Zt, trnt CONGRESS) 
WASHINGTON, O.C. 20510 
April 24·, 1975 
Ad Hoc St:if1 
On behalf of the Senate Select ·committee to Study· .Governmental 
Operations with Respect to Intelligence.Activities, I enclose a 
~pecification, .furnished to John Cla~ke yesterday, 11hich calls for 
certain ~atepial referred to inyour.Decemoer 24, 1974-report to 
·the President and provides further detail concerning certain CL~ 
material heretofore requested. Obviously it is not intended to 
·limit what we-have already r_equested. 
It is th~ Committee's expectation that all-this ~aterial 
should be produced in ten days . 
. I lTas heartened. by the spirit of cooperation demonstrated. in 
your personal reassurances in our meeting on April 22, 1975, and 
• I understand that substantial materi:.;i.l was made av~ilable to us 
today at the CIA. However, the fact remains that too much material 
called for in our document request remains outstanding and the 
system apparentl~ being.employed to clear material for us builds 
in excessive delays. A necessary prerequisite to our inquiry 
proceeding exped.itiously--as it should to restore public confidence 
in our intelligence agencies and • develop a ne,;r national consensus 
Q?l the proper functions of intelligence activity--is to eliminate 
these delays.
