Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams 
RE: SENSTUDY 75 
• 
In light of this response, Mr. Gitenstein requested that 
the Bureau identify the personnel involved and it is his obvious intention 
that the personnel will be interviewed. 
Inasmuch as the Inspection Division is conducting inquiry 
into this matter, it would appear proper for that Division to determine 
the identities of such personnel and, if deemed necessary, interview in 
connection with the current inquiry. It is also believed that while this 
request is oral in nature from the Committee, we should consider 
furnishing the information as to the identities ·of employees to the 
Committee inasmuch as if we do not respond to the oral request • 
Mr. Gitenstein indicated, because of the Committee's interest in this 
matter, there would be no problem in his obtaining authority to fu:t;nish the 
request in writing. It is apparent at this point that we would not be able 
to keep such information from the Committee if such a written r~quest were 
to be received. Additionally, by responding to the oral request it will 
encourage the Committee, in the areas they described as "abuse-type," 
to give us an advance indication as to their inquiries. 
RECOM:M:ENDATION: 
That the Inspection Division make the necessary inquiry 
concerning the identities of the employees and, if deemed advisable, 
make available to the Legal Analysis Office that information which will 
be furnished to the Committee.
