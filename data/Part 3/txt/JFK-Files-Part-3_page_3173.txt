any. You touched on it a moment ago. The President asked for· 
something. I don't know in this case whether the President 
asked to see photographs of this nature or didn't ask, but the 
point is, nobody said no and he got them. 
So the question is, where do you see the Bureau's responsi­
bility here, and what can this Committee do to ensure that 
there is some kind of a test that we either put in the law 
or that the FBI invokes, or that we invoke on the White House 
in using police power in this way? 
Mr. Adams. I don't think Congress can ever fill the 
11 responsibil-i ty_ of_ t_ry_ing--to--draw up guidelines, even in conjunc-
12 tion with the Executive Branch, to guarantee that all abuses 
13 won't take place. The otganization·:is made up of human beings, 
1.4 and these things occur. 
15 Certain corrective actions are self-initiated, such as 
16 this. The President, £or instance, you.know we had an incident 
17 a few years -a.go about investigating. a newsman, wh~re we ·were 
18 requested, and if I recall from our.information, we thought he 
19 was being considered for an appointed position which would have 
. 20 been a logical basis. As facts turned out, that··was not the 
21 purpose that the information was requested. 
22 To stem or stop abuses like that, the President, the 
23 current Administration has issued instructions that any request 
24 for investigations under the special inquiry or White House 
25 investigation such as for appointment must clear through the
