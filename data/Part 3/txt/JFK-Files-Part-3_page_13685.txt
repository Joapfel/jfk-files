, I 
AML1\Slt Case Officer. In a normal report, yes. But this 
certainly was a rather, again, sensitive subject that we were 
talking about. Ile did not accept it and I don't think that at 
that time it was felt that,:anything else should be said about 
it. 
Mr. Johnston. Why is that? 
1\MLASII Case Officer. I don't know why. Again, because 
of the sensitivity, I presume, of the subject. 
Mr. Johnston. And again, is it your recollection that 
11 Fitzgerald, is it your testimony that Fitzgerald told you not 
12 to put a reference to the pen device in tho report?

l\MLASU Case Officer. I don't recall if h_e specifically 
told me not to put it in or if when I gave him the report he i 
I 
was satisfied that it was not in. I 
I 
I 
Mr. Daron. l'Thy woulrl a reference to the pen device be I 
i 
I 
any more sensitive than references to arms caches or suggestiond 
of assassinations or all the oth<?r kinds of things that were 
already in the file? 
AHLASH CasE:! Officer. 13ecausc again, in conjunction wi t:1 
this particular operation it was not an assassination operation, 
It was a coup operation. This was one of the aberrations of t!,q 
operation which ve got involvc<l in strictly to provide bona 
fiJcs to the man that we were dealing with and we were concerne1 
for his personal security.
