~~de a~ actu~l active attempt to recruit members in this 
organiza~ion. The Tampa file in this matter is closed. 
We havs .not been able -'co detersine that any ac-cive chapt~rs 
of th:!.s group are in existence or that any members were 
recruited for the g~oup: It is therefore felt that there 
·would be no point in our .~ttempting any disruptive tactics 
in connection uith this group. 
The Bureau is requested to aav~se Tampa :whether 
it would be satisfactory not to initiatjany action on 
the Viking Youth of America and to .. su_~.sti.tute so.me.other 
organization for this purpose. ~-- .
