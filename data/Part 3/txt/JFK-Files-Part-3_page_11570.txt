The two principal informants in thfs operation 
have received the "Order of Lenin,u, with the title "Hero 
of Soviet Labor" from the Soviets. This is the highest 
award given civilians by the Soviet Union and was given 
our sources for their "invaluable contribution to the 
international communist movement."

high-level penetration of the CPUSA 
represents a sustained major accomplishment. At the time 
of the last inspection, we had 11 informants who were 
officially members of the GPUSA National Committee. This 
number remains the same. In addition, we have another informant 
who is an ex officio member of the National Committee because 
of the sensitive nature of his Party assignments. This latter 
source is also a member of the Political Committee which, in 
·effect, runs the Party. This top-level coverage is responsible 
for furnishing information regarding policy-making matters 
on a day-to-day basis as they occur.
