• 
Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency 
Rule ancl agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's 
interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent 
wi th ___ the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified 
information or material originating in one department shall 
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it 
has been made available without the consent of the originating 
department. 
The Security Committee of the United States Intelli­
gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and 
standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to 
the Select Committees. 
The question of Intelligence Community personnel being 
represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White 
House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from 
the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills 
Associate Counsel to the President." 
It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the 
President's Counsel would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to 
insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel 
would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or 
department employing the persons to be interviewed. 
Attached also for the record are the following: 
A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G. 
Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has been 
designated as the Security Officer of the SSC; 
A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke
