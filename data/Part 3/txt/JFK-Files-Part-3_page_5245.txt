. • I . 1) This offipe received a 
letter from the U.S. Attorney 
dated 6/24/69 wherein the 
U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecutio~ 
of minor theft cases. ~he letter set the guide as those 
cases of value of less than $100. This Pffice has been 
following the interpretqtion of minor thefts as those having 
a value of less than $l(JO. It was the j'-udgment of this 
office thatcbout all of the airnort thefts involved amounts 
in excess of $100. It r.i.ppears that an average loss at the 
airport would average ah estimated $250, it being noted that 
the airline companies c11rrently are paying up to $500 per 
bag. Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor 
·.cases and had not been rJiscussed with the U.S. Attorney as 
~heir value exceeded $Joo. In following this policy San 
Francisco believed that they were in compliance with Section 9~ 
of the Ha.nual :r-ega.y,ding presentation of minor cases to the 
US. Attorney. In tne futu:r:•€: this 0f.-FL::e ':•:ill immediately 
present cases of the t?Pe cited by the Inspector to ·i.:},2. 
U.S. Attorney before ahy investigation is conducted and 
will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases. 
2)Submission of FD 302s. Regarding 
', the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not 
included in the 25 files listed by the Inspector, I would 
like to explain that l3 of these files were opened after 
~ September 22 and I haq not reviewed any of these files 
as yet on tickler and thereby would not have had an 
opportunity to detect the fact that the FD 302 was not 
listed. The remain in:, files have not all been available 
for review at this ti:-:e but it is obvious that some of 
these files did not have FD 302s prepared promptly . 
. 3}NCIC Entries. Three of the 
four files listed wh~re NCIC entries had not been made 
had not as yet.been reviewed on ticklers since they had been 
received in this office. One of the four files, 15-11994, re­
flects a suitcase clqi~ check number which is not suitable 
-fqr entry into the HtIC. 
4) File 15-11981 was recommendec 
to be opened by. the ~ase Agent as he felt that this 
shipment involved pt.=-rsonnel and circumstances which 
would be logically ~?rked in connection with other existing 
TFIS cases and that it might be a lever for possible.

even 'though it was r,ot a Federal violation and obtain an
