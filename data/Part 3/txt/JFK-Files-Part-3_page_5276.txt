amount of $4,.639. The video tube was for use in a closed circuit 
television camera. 
Item 13 lists 2 "Tube, Image, WL 30691" as having been 
furnished the FBI on 3/26/71 at a cost of $4,607 each. This entry 
is probably a duplication of Item 4 on page 0019. Bureau records 
show that Purchase Order #5450 dated 5/21/71 was issued to CIA 
for this equipment for use in CCTV cameras. No purchase order 
to support two such acquisitions (March and May) could be located. 
Item 14 lists 2 "Cameras, Television" at.a unit cost of 
$18,300. This entry probably refers to that equipment acquired under 
Purchase Order #21100 and is detailed in Paragraph b. page 00112, above. 
No damage would be suffered by release of this information.
