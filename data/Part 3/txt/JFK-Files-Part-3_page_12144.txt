It is noted that this case was originall. opened as a PSI and 
potential.double agent case. It is still in a pending status and 
is still being reported by you as a potential double agent case, 
when in fact the individual ~~-V .. against whom Nelson was directed 
departed the U.S. in June, 1970. 
A review of the Nelson file fails to contain any instructions or 
directions regarding the development of Nelson as a double agent and 
in addition a review of the .L\&._~~file similarly .contains no infor­
mation or instructions from the Bureau in this regard. There appears 
to be a definite weakness in the overall administration and supervision 
of this "potential double agent" at the Seat of Gov.ernment. 
You are requested to advise the following: 
1. What is your overall supervisory policy in connection with 
developing potential security informants directed against a double 
agent? 
2. Wh.~7 ~ 7 !:Yt! ~0!!.ti.!!1. 1.11? +.0. c~~ry this. ca.se !P~eJ..~pn) in a pending­
status when the subject whom he was directed against !Azacy..a.n.).. left 
the U.S. for Russia in June, 1970. 
3. Why you failed to instruct and aggressively direct the 
office of origin in the Nelson case against the double agent target 
Aza:r:\!all.,. 
4. Why you have the Nelson case listed as a potential double 
agent when in effect he was being developed as a PSI. 
Explanations Requested: 
1. Case supervisor and Unit Chief Bowen F. Rose for 
failure to detect the above delinquencies in your overaI:l'supervision 
of tpe Nelson matter. • 
2. Comments of Section Chief William A. Branigan, 
··Inspector D. E. Moore and Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan 
requested.
