, and the former city manager both deny 
1 making such statement to Williams. 
Williams claims he told Councilman Morrow 
at the time and Morrow claims he recalls 
being so advised. 
SAC Ronald L. Maley, San Diego, 
telephonically contacted by Intelligence 
Division Night Supervisor F. Anthony 
Tansey, stated San Diego FBI personnel 
knowledgeable of facts do not recall any 
such incident or notice to former offi­
cials or Williams; and, if FBI had know­
ledge of such a plot, all knowledgeable 
employees believe Williams, himself, would 
have been notified directly. 
San Diego is currently reviewing perti­
nent files for any information to prove or 
disprove Williams' statement and a teletype 
will be submitted with pertinent facts on 
1/29/76. 
Upon receipt of the teletype from 
San Diego, you will be advised whether or 
not San Diego did have knowledge of any 
plot against Williams and whether anyone, 
including Williams, was alerted to such 
information.
