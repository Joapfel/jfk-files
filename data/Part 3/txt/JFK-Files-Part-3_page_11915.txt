ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
NEW LEFT GROUPS UNIT 
The work of this unit concerns Students for a 
Democratic Society (SDS) factions (with the e~::ception of 
Weatherman), other New Left campus.groups, the Key Activist 
program, New Left Movement reports, New Left publications, 
New Left informants, and the maintenance of a library of 
"hand-out" material on the New Left for dissemination on a 
high level to Government officials and responsible citizens. 
In 1969 Worker Student Alliance (WSA), Weatherman, 
and Revolutionary Youth :Movement (RYM) factions of SDS split 
into separate groups. Accomplishments concerning Weatherman 
are reported elsewhere in this survey. The RYM faction of 
SDS is now practically defunct. Currently, the largest faction 
of SDS, .is, W:SA faction. WSA is dominated by the pro-Chinese, 
Marxist-Leninist Progressive Labor Party; and, while not as 
violent as Weatherman, is avowedly a revolutionary group. 
Our efforts to achieve informant coverage in WSA 
showed results when WSA held its National Convention in 
Chicago in December, 1970. 4P.J2rq,..3¾,~~i.e.;,,.y-2-,9..Bureau informants 
attended this convention, and extensive information on 
activities at the convention was promptly reported and 
disseminated. Through informants, we have encouraged faction­
alism in WSA. At the convention, dissident groups led by one 
of our sources threatened a new split in SDS/WSA which may 
occur in the near future. Such dissension will reduce the 
possibility that SDS might once again become a massive student 
organization as it was before its division in 1969. 
Through the Key Activist program, we have focused 
investigative attention on the leaders of the New Left 
movement with the aim of prosecuting these leaders under 
appropriate statutes, Federal or local, wherever possible.
