The following comments are equally 
applicable whether the Domestic· 
Intelligence Division remains intact 
or is reorganized into two divisions. 
I 
Transferring these cases to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) would 
eliminate much duplication of handling cases and would result in increased 
efficiency; however, this would require transferring to DID all bombing and 
antiriot cases as distinguished from transferring only those cases known to 
involve "extremists and political terrorists. " As a practical matter substantially 
all antiriot laws investigations involve extremists and political terrorists. With 
regard to bombings, substantially all investigations deal at the outset with unknmvn 
subjects and it would be most impractical to attempt to delineate between bombings 
which do or do not involve terrorists. Since the act of bombing is in itself an act 
of terror it is logical to assume at the outset that terrorists are involved and the 
types of bombings delegated to the FBI by the Department's guidelines are limited 
to those targets most likely to be selected by political terrorists. (These targets 
pertain to Government property or functions, Federally funded projects, 
diplomatic establishments, colleges and universities, and those probably 
perpetrated by terrorists.)
