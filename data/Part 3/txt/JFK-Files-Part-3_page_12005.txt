SCOPEAID DESIRED OBJECTIVES - Specific objectives of program 
are verification of repatriate's identity; ascertaining 
whether the individual has or had Cuban intelligence contact, 
training or assignment, or possesses intelligence infor­
mation; and instructing individuals to alert us to any future 
intelligence contact. Program is field wide. 
POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED - From August, 1969, to July, 1970, 
eleven flights brought an average of 18 citizens out of Cuba 
per flight. These repatriates were accompanied by a total 
of 425 relatives and/or close friends, all of whom were 
Cuban aliens. Some 300 U.S. citizens rem~in in Cuba awaiting 
repatriation. There have been no repatriation flights since 
July 31, 1970. 
Program has alerted us to return to this country 
of Security Index ·subjects, Castro sympathizers,·individuals 
who ·traveled to Cuba without State Department authorization 
and individuals affiliated with Communist Party, USA. As a 
result of interviews conducted with repatriates, worthwhile 
data concerning conditions in Cuba has been obtained and 
disseminated to the u. s. Intelligence Community.
