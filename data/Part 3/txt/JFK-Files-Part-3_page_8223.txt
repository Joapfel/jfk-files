• • . I am sure you appreciate the need for the questions 
.raised by Attorney General Saxbe 1s testimony to be answered 
as quickly and definitively as possible. These questions 
demonstrate-once again the need for close cooperation between 
th~ Department of Jus.tice and the Congress . 
. . 
Many of the questions posed in this letter were ori~inally 
raised in my letter of October 10, 1973, to Attorney General 
Richardson. The Subco:nmittee requested additional information 
on April 16, 1974, and at the hearing on May 23, 19?4. Attorney 
• General Saxbe indicated a willingness at the hearing to 
provide this information in the near future, but none of 
this information has been provided. I am enclosing copies 
of the October 10, 1973; and April 16, 1974 correspondence
