The Attorney General 
NOTE: -
The request of 12/18/75 was received in the 
Intelligence Division in the midafternonn nf 12/2.2/75. A 
conference was held on the morning of 12/23/75 of pertinent 
Division p~rsonnel in an effort to identify the problems 
connected with responding to this request. It is believed 
that the only way the Bureau can logically respond to the 
request is by obtaining clarifications and, in some instances, 
alternatives to the requests set out. 
We have already determined that both John Elliff 
and the SSC Counsel,F. A. o. Schwartz,are out of the city 
for the holidays. The Legal Counsel Division has left 
wnrd with Mr. Sch~1artz and/ or Mr. Elliff to call SA,. Paul Daly 
upon their return to the city. 
Copy of 12/18/75 request attached.
