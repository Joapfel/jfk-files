: \Y Mr. Sullivan has proposed that the development of ibforn1f~t;1~J :{~-~ii~~~!,. ... -~-
Klan (KKl{} and other hate groups as weli as t11e investigation ana pene"i:ration of these 
organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General •• 
Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his 
recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KKI{ and supporting 
groups are essentially subversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses 
of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communist 
Party. He does not maintain that the actions of the hate groups constitute the same 
menac~ as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreign 
power. -~-.:.-~1:_~":_~-:.;"tiTe:..lli ;.:::.:·,, -::..., Pro r" 1~_:-- D,·.s.r1, yT1·0~·, D F" 1-i...T<;!'. G:-,(,._.1,,.-,,,_(!.-:,. / __ ,, .............. -• 
He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide expe·rience in the 
penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources, 
sophistlcatad microphone and technical surveillances, interview programs of 
a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his divisitm could put this experience 
to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups. . .

* : ifi.. Sullivan feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a • 
disruptive counter-intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups 
with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party 
is concerned. He also proposes an immediate series of regional conferences to 
instruct pertinent field personnel and to devise unaginative, aggressive and highly 
specialized programs to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the i 
Communist Party is increasing its activities in the field of racial nR tters and .... .J J -., 
- civil rights, directing more and more of its fire against the KKK and similar ,,.,,._. J---. --
organizations to confuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up •. I 
activities of the Communist Party in this area it would help prevent marked· confusion 
from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the Ganeral Investigative 
and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities. -... ~
