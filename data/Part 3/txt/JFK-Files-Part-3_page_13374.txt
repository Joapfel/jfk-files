STURGIS: No, sir, because I was very hot at this and Seymour 
Hersh told me th.at i.t was in the outline--yes, he told me, I believe he 
told me, that it was in the outline that Andrew made up, supposedly that 
we both. made together. And l told Seymour Hersh _ that I did not make no 
outline up with Andrew St. George. I don't k~ow what's in it. 
OLSEN: Do you know whether at any time while you were being inter-
viewed by Andrew St. George he was making a recording of th.e conversation? 
STURGIS: No, sir. I have never been to his room. He ha.s never 
taken any notes or anything. I continually asked Andrew "When are you going 
to sit down with.me to take notes for an outline?" 
OLSEN: But you don't know for sure whether he was surreptitiously 
recording? 
STURGIS: No, sir. Because I know many times--or at least this one time 
when I was talking with. him, going back to my Castro days--and that's the only 
thing 1 have ever discussed with him, is my Castro days. Never anything about 
ofthe order that 
Watergate because/\Judge Sirica handed down not to discuss the case. But he 
did open up hls briefcase; he had papers and so forth in his brief 
case. 
OLSEN: Did You ever see any recording apparatus in his brief case? 
STURGIS: No, s-ir. Not in his brief case. 
OLSEN: Did h.e ever tell you that he was recording his conversation 
with. you? 
STURGIS: No, sir. 
OLSEN: Do you have anything else that you would like to offer to the 
Commission h.ere relating to your connections with. the Central Intelligence
