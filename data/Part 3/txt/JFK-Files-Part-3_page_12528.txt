BlACK PANTHER PARTY 
V. FU-NDS 
The money by which the Black Panther Party operates comes from a number of 
sources. There are substantial private contributions; fees for public appearances, 
such as campus speeches, radio, and television appearances; payments for mag­
azine articles; collections for trials and bail funds in this country and abroad; 
subscriptions and individual sales of the Party's official organ, The Black Panther; 
fund-raising activities sponsored by sympathizers and supporters; sales of record­
ings of interviews and speeches; and financial aid from radicals and extremists. 
According to the press, there is reason to believe that the Panthers, to obtain 
additional funds, are engaging in criminal activities, such as burglaries and 
robberies.
