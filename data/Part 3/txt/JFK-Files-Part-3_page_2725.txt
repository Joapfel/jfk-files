discontinued arty further interest. 
Senator Hart of Michigan.. \·1eli, my time ha·s expired 
but even this brief exchange_, I think, indicates that if we 
really want to control the dangers to our society of using 
informants to gather dome~tic political intelligence, we have . . 
to rest~ict. sharply domestic intelligence investig•ations .. ~tld 
that gets us into what I would like to raise·with you when 
my turn comes around againl and that's the use of warrants, 
obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before·a full-fledged 
inform~nt can be directed by the Bureau against a group or 
individuals. 
I know·you have objections to that and I would like to 
review that·with you. 
Senator Mondale. pursue that question. 
Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an 
j, 
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn fo~se _a full-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run 
into you or you ~un into, or who walk in as information sources 
The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the 
Committee. 'l'he Bureau argues that such a ·warrant requirement 
might be.unconstitutional becau~e it would violate the First 
Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their 
government. 
lifow that's a concern for First Amendment rights that 
ought to • hearten all the civil libertarians.
