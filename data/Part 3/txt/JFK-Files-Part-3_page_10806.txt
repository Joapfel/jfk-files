The report noted another broad field requiring 
coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived from 
domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter­
intelligence, This includes tho exploitation of intolligonco 
from United States business firms, travellers, etc,, exploitation 
of the intelligence possibilities of groups and individuals of 
foreign nationality in the United States, tho :i:olating o:f 
domestic countcrintolligenco to ~oreign intelligence and the 
coordination of domestic counterespionage with counterespionage 
abroad. Except for the exploitation of private sources of 
foreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized 
in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for·other 
activities is scattered among the State Department, the armed • 
services·, the FBI and CIA. 
lhe FBI, which has primary security and law enforce­
• ·ment responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important 
area of intelligence, This includes domestic counterespionage 
•• ~and countersabotage, control of communist and other subversive 
activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups. 
All of these functions, according to the report, are closely 
r0l~i..tH.l to the compai.."ablo a0~ivitics a~:-c:1.d of the CIP-. 
The report noted the FBI was not.part of the then 
I existing machinery for covrdination of intelligence through 
·\the Intelligence Advisory Committee and there was no continuing 
• .. manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence 
were related to overall national intelligence in order to serve 
·the general purpose set forth in the National Security Act, 
·. which was set forth as "of coordinating the intelligence activities 
··of the several Government departments and agencies in the interest 
of national security." 
It was the opinion of the authors of the Dulles Report 
that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the 
problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence 
and counterintelligence which relate to the national security.· 
and CIA should submit recommendations on this·. subject to the 
-NSC. The report note,d this was not inconsistent with the 
stipulation of the National Security Act that CIA "shall have no 
: police, subpoena,· law enforcement powers o~ .internal security 
functions.'.''. , , • • ,:y~~::{t\i;\:};'\;Y:. • ' • .. ·
