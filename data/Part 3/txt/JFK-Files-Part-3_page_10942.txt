status of this relationship, and we periodicd11y 
make adjustments in order to make certain .there . 
is.no "freewheeling" and to tnke,advantage of the : 
information which DCS gains.and which is of interest· 
to the Bu~oaue For.example, wo are currontly working 
out· arrangements where ou."t" field offices can contact 
the local DCS of.fices concerning Chinese aliens whq 
might b0 o:f interest to us ei·th,~r ns subjects for ' 
investigation or as potential.informa.nts. This liaison 
at the field level was deemed d0sirable so that we 
could get information ~t the "horse's mouth" rather 
than wait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which is 
often prolonged and? when transmitted, is sometimes 
stripped of pieces of informationo This occurs 
because of the involved and sometimes complicated 
maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA. 
In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its 
Domestic Operations Division (DOD)1 Which was to be 
responsible for any clandestine development of sources 
in the United States,, Prior to the establishment of 
t~is Di·tisi0n.~ '2"I..P. ~;::t5:,,ri ty in. this f;ield was managed 
from each individual area division at Washington 
headquarterso The pressing need for more clandestine 
sources, coupled with the recognition of the vast 
potential in the m.1.ite·d States, prompted CIA to create 
a new division which would be responsible for all of 
the area division interestso DOD has headquarters 
at Washington, D,, c., and currently has field offices 
at New York Cityt Boston 1 Chicago, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington, D. C. 1 proper. 
Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assigned to 
the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment 
of positive intelligence sources 1 primarily in the 
diplomatic field. Some of the personnel are assigned 
to the hangling of firms or organizations which may 
be supporting certain CIA operations abroad. DOD personnel 
in the :field operat'"' under authorized Department of Defense 
cover 0 The heads of these field offices are known to us, 
and we have established a satisfactory liaison area at 
the field level. ..-.--
DOD is also responsible for the handling of 
CIA agents (informants) who have been recruited abroad 
and who come to the United States for assignments either 
on a temporary basis or for the duration of a normal 
diplomatic assignment.
