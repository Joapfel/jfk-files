accepts the argument that, the President himself will not conduct 
the inter·ceptions, but that agents o.f the Executive Branch, 
acting as his representatives will, and that many others within 
the Executive Branch can also be his reuresentatives to receive 
the results of such a surveillance, and~that therefore it is 
not inconsistent with Section 605 to consider the Executive 
Branch {or at least all persons within the Executive Branch 
with a right to such information) as 
11
a person", so that dis­
closure within the Executive Branch does not violate the .. Section's

proceeding.
