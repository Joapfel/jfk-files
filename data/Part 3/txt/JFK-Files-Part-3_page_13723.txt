(AP) Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address 
tonight before the Inter-American Press Association: 
* * * 
"The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran­
ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and 
concepts were noble. 
"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed, 
"The goals proclaimed int~ Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana. 
"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country 
and from all the American countries: It is the fact that a small band 
of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand­
ed over the indP.pendence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces 
beyond the hemisphere. They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial­
ism, an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic­
tated by external powers to subvert the other American republics. This, 
and this alone divides us. As long as this is true nothing is possible. 
Without it everything is possible. 
Ready and /m.xious 
"Once this barrier is removed we will be ready and anxious to work 
with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few 
short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people 
throughout the entire hemisphere. 
"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-
r,.. ises of foreign conununism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere. 
For one~ Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of 
friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose political and economic insti­
tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."
