Chairman Clifford. thought" it gratifying that the Defense Department 
0
nad 
accept.~d the Board's NRP· t~port and recommencl.atione in toto-, and he referred to 
inforu,.ally received ind_ications that the Departtlt'ent of Defense is anxious to 
ge~ on with the actions proposed in th!a Board's rep·ort. N_oting that the, pre~ 
liminary reply ·from the DC-I was 'noncommital, !~~ 'Clifford thought it ·best .that 
the Board not engage in a discussion of the NRP report with the DCI when he • 
joined the Board meeting ra·ter in the day. Mr. Clifford observed' that the·Board 
had studied the subject in depth; it had reached conclusions -and made. i.-ecommenda­
tions to the President; Mr. Bundy had asked for. comments to the Pres :!.dent by 
Messrs. McNamar~ and McCone; and it was d~sirable.to keep the matter in that 
channel, ·.rather than reopening discussions with the DCI at this ·Board meeting. 
(Dr. Baker arrive.cl at the Bot1rd meeting at this point.) -

At the Chair-map's request, ·_Mr. Coyne sumn.arized-for the .Board the reported 
success-es -and failures of satellite reconnaissance photographic missions s·ince 
January 1, 1964 (4 successful missions; 3 failures) and the NRO mission sthedul..! 
for· the remainder· of tne year. (He -also referred to the NRO ·report that OXCART 
has been ,flown<'at Ma.ch 3.2 .at 81,700 feet.-) --

;1 -:,,-,,·,.,•,~ /, satellite missions leaves much to be desired. He felt that the Board ahould ask
