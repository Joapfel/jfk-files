Moreover, the Supreme Com·t in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S. 7,15 
(1971), reccntiy held-that the use of secret informants does not violate 
any constitutionally justifiable 8A1)ectation of priv:1.cy under the Fourth 
Amend111ent, even when an infonnant uses electronic equipment to transmit 
Iris convers~Uons with defendants to other agents. • 
,,• 
If the use of undercover government informants without a 
warrant does not violate the Fourth An1endlnent and· invade a defendant's 
constitutionally justifiabl:e C}..1)ectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra, 
and such infonn~u1ts may \t..Tite do,,m t110ir conversations with cleiendants 
and testify concer.rJng thmn~. or simultaneously record and transmit such 
conversations to others; who may testify against them, On Lee v. U.S. ,

would not violate their constitutional rights. • 
It would se.em that those who elect to present their views actively 
in the public arena deliberately e:\.-pose themselves to the public. See 
Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1'967). Any_ recording of their 
activities by the deienctants does not invade their privacy any more than 
does a newspn.iJor, radio, or television story, and,· indeed, much less since 
any inforn1ation compiled is usable and effective only through com't action.

More difficult questions are presented ·where the investigation 
delves into the private :iffa.irs of the individuals or organizations. B~t 
even here, the com·ts have generally sustained our procedures so long as 
they comport with the restrictions of ibc Fourth, Fifth and· Sixth Amendments.
