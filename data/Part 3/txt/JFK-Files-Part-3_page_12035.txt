THE KEY BLACK EXTREMIST PROGRAM 
\ 
On December 23, 1970, the Key Black Extremist 
Program was initiated, with the Director's approval, to 
intensify our coverage of certain black extremists who are 
extremely active and most vocal in their calls for terrorism 
and violence. As the program started about 90 were included. 
With Bureau approval others.may be added by the field. This 
program is to provide intensified coverage of the day-to-day 
activities and future plans of these people· and to assure 
_ that all possible violations of law on their parts are 
vigorously investigated when they are within our jurisdiction 
and are referred promptly to the ~ppropriate agency when they 
are not. 
An investigative summary report on all these 
people is due by February 15, 197i. Thereafter an investi­
gative report is to be submitted every 90 days.
