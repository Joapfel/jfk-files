F. CUR..~ENT CAPABILITIES OF THE FDI 
l. Manpower Being Devoted 
-It is most difficult to !give any specific figures as to 
how much manpower the FBI is cur~ently devoting strictly to 
foreign intelligence collection, separate and apart from the 
Bureau's intq~nal security ~nd counterintelligence functions. 
Much of the foreign intelligehcc developed by.tho Bureau is an 
outgrowth of our internal sccuri~y investigations and cannot be 
neatly sepa:i;ated .. in terms of manpower or time. 
A substantial amount of our foreign intelligence activity 
is concentrated in two offices where most of the diplomatic 
establishments in the United States are located; namely, New York 
and Washington Field. Both offices were requested to furnish 
estimates as to how much manpower is being allocated to foreign 
intelligence matters,·including both live sources developed and 
technical coverage_. In both cases, the estimates provided were 
highly tentative and both c:fices stress that manpower commitments 
in this area fluctuate widely from week to week depending on 
international politics and other unpredictable factors. For 
instance, during the_Cuban missile crisis of 1962, both offices 
greatly increased the~r· normal manpoTier commitment to the develop-
\ .. 
. meni:; o:r current foreign im::ell.igence. •i•ne pres em; vominican crisis 
which involves pr-0duction of foreign intelligence to a large extent 
represents another nabnormal" situation. 
However, for what it is worth, WFO and New York have 
estimated that at. the present time they are allocating approxi­
mately 35 Agents and 20 clerical employees to the full time task ' 
of foreign intelligence collection. Virtually all of the clerical 
time and about 40.per cent of the Agent time is related to 
technical coverage and the balance is aimed at the development of 
live sources. 
In addition, of course, all of the other offices, including 
our Legal Attaches abroad, have devoted manpower to foreign 
intelligence collection in varying degrees. operations • / 
conducted in different field offices have involved the assignment 
of as many.as 10 or 12 Agents for temporary periods. In connection

the Miami and San J_uan offices have devoted considerable manpower 
to the development of foreign intelligence in recent years. The 
Chicago Office in connection with its handling of our~ 
informant has devoted manpower to the development of foreign 
intelligence. These represent only a few examples. _... • ••• . .

citing any precise figures, it i~ estimated that the Bureau probably 
averages approximately 50 to 75 Agents and 25 to 30 clerks assigned 
primarily to foreign _intelligence wor~. ·I
