The Jackson Office was authorized io furnish data 
concerning Republic of New Africa (RNA), a violence-prone 
black extremist separa·tist organization, to a cooperative 
newspaper source, resulting in the publication of an 
excellent article exposing the violent nature of this 
organization on the front page of the only state-wide 
evening newspaper in Mississippi. This publicity on the 
evening before the RNA regional conference was to begin, 
jolted RNA leaders. In addition, Negro participants from 
Jackson area were shocked to learn of the vioient nature 
of this group and withdrew their support. The scheduled 
agenda was shelved and the conference was completely 
disrupted. Agents of the Jackson Office and Domestic 
Intelligence Division Supervisor were commended by the 
Director for this operation.
