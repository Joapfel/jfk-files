1757 
Nobel Prize whose names are Jones and Smith, that my review 
of the files show had violence done to their First Amendment 
rights. And Nobel Prize winners will always get protection, 
-but Joe Potatoes doesn't, and this Committee should focus on 
him, too. 
Now, included in this COINTEL were activities like this, 
anonymous letters, drafted by Bureau offices in the field, sent 
to headquarters in Washington, approved, and then put·~ in the 
mail, intended to break up marriages, not of Dr. King but of 
- 10 Mary and John Jones because one or the other was thought to be 
11 a dissenter, might have dressed strangely or showed up at 
12 meetings in company of others who dressed strangely; anonymous 
13 letters to university officials and to the several newspapers 
14 in that city to prevent university facilities from being made 
_ 15 available to a speaker.of whom the Bureau disapproved, and it 
16 was not a :top flight, .big name speak~r ... In that case, an 
17 anonymous letter was sent to me making protest. Being an 
18 anonymous letter, it. never occurred to me that it came from the 
1·9 Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
20 The s.eries of anonymous letters, one with the spelling 
2l very poor, the gramm;ar sloppy, and another more sophisticated, 
22 protesting the employment by a city of a man alleging that he 
23 was a Communist or came from a Communist family, and there are 
24 loyal Americans out of· work,· what are you doing, Mayor. And 
25 to the press, isn't this an outrage. And again-:the letter, the 
NW 38614 Docld:3 34
