During the discussion on 10/20/75 concerning the 
forthcoming testimony of Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall, 
Mr. Wannall mentioned to the Senate Select Committee Staff Members 
present (John T. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director, Michael 
Epstein, and Mark Gitenstein) that in view of the fact these 
hearings would be open to the public the Committee would not be 
fully briefed concerning the background involved in the Bureau 
mail opening programs because of the sensitivity involved. 
Elliff indicated that he was in agreement and that he would 
contact F. A. o. Schwartz, Chief Counsel of the Committee, to 
see if executive session testimony could be arranged. Elliff 
subsequently telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this 
Division and advised him that Mr. Wannall could testify in 
executive session on mail openings in the late afternoon on 
10/21/75 at approximately 4:30 p.m. subject to the' approval 
of the Senators. 
After consultation with Assistant Director Wannall, ( I) 
I 
Elliff was advised that this would be acceptable and that V 
Mr. Wannall would appear for executive session testimony con- _..,· • 
cerning mail openings if the Senators agree to accept executiv~ 
session testimony.~ 
Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence 
Coordination in the Department, was advised of the possible ex­
ecutive session testimony and interposed no objection to the 
Bureau giving such testimony.
