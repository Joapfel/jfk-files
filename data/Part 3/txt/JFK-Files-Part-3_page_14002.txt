;1ence will miss an opportunity to visit with you in the immediate future. 
However I wish you to know the hackground 0£ the pr<" ss inc.:iden't which

number.of editorials, • 
,Therefore I am ~ttaching a memorandum_ prepared for my file 
to review the ~eries of events which lea up to the release of il~formation 
on the Soviet economy with CIA attribution;· Also.attached is a copy of

Frankly I am surprised at the publicity and .£urthcrn1or-~ I cannot 
be overly critical of the attrib'ftion because of the long history of CIA's 
r<'leases on Soviet economy. We. have for 10 years been issuing­
vol~mes 6n this subject in unclassified form carrying the Central 
Intelligence Agency name and these ;ire in uni_versities, libraries, and 
~~ the hands of virtually all eco_nomists ·and newspapermen interested 
in the subjec.;t~ Furthermore, Allen Dulles has testified in open 
hearing and on the rc·cor_d on this subject. It was a favorite tcpic for 
_speeches by Allen, General Cabell and Bob Amory in the days when 
Cl/'.., officizils were making speeches. Hence the denial of the pr.ivilege 
of attribution w·ould. have, in my opinion, not been respected ~,y 
anye>ne in the :.Jress.
