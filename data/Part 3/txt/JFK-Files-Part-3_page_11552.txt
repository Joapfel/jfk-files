ELLSBERG CASE 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNA(/( 
4-A-3 
I generally concur with the comments of Mr. Wannall 
as to the progress and status of this case from an investigative 
standpoint. I have reminded Mr. Wannall that the development of 
direct evidence should not be obscured by the broadening of the 
scope of this case. He has been advised that his objective must 
consistently be the development of substantial admissible evidence 
necessary to establish a conviction as to Federal violations 
charged in the Los Angeles indictment of Ellsberg and others which 
may develop from other corollary investigations being conducted. 
From the outset, as stated by Mr. Wannall, I expressed 
the importance of this case and instructed him to advise me of 
any manpower needs. The question of manpower is discussed under 
the caption "Adequacy of Personnel" found in 6E of this report and 
was the subject of my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan 7/29/71 captioned 
"Proposed Adjustments of Work Assignments, DID," memorandum of 
w. R., Wannall to Mr. Felt 8/12/71 captioned "Adequacy of Personnel,

of Personnel, Leak Cases, DID." 
In refe.rence to Mr. Wannall 's concluding suggestion in 
his writeup, the procedure of furnishing daily teletypes to the 
Department in major cases is not unusual. The high level interest 
of the Department, which will eventually be responsible for the 
prosecution of this case, as well as the interest of the White 
House dictates that teletypes in this matter be disseminated 
consistent with the Director's instructions, copy att~ched. It 
appears we should clarify the Department's use of these "raw" 
investigative results as set forth in our teletypes and suggest 
their detailed reviews be conducted from Bureau investigative 
reports, which are the normal communication fo~ such use. Mr. Wannall 
will be instructed to advise the Department by letter with regard 
to the foregoing pointing out that our weekly summary letters and 
investigative reports will resolve many of the questions they raise 
as to information in our teletypes.
