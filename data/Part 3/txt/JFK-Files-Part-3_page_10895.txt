of his agency not to give any more information than necessary

. the picture of OSS.replacing the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation not only outside the United States but in 
the domestic field. The publicity campaign referred tq 
was to be one of the means adopted·to accomplish this 
purpose.". . . • .. •• ·, . : ·•;;.·: = ..
