Senator Schweiker.· One of the dossiers specifically in­
cluded photographs of sexual activities. 
Mr. Adams. Yes, .sir. 
Senator Schweiker. And my question is, how is that relevan 
to.being a critic of the Warren Commission? 
What standard do we use.when we just pass photographs of 
sexual .activities to the White House? Is this a normal -- again, 
10 is this a normal proceeding when a ·dossier is requested? Is thi 
11 included~ or did they specifically request photographs of this 
12 kind, or what light can you shed on this? 
13 Mr. Adams.· I can't shed much. - I know they requested 
14 information on him. I think there was other material concernin 
15 that individual of a security nature.that was included. Why 
16 the information in that respect was submitted I am unable to 
17 answer. 
18 I do know at the time there was a lot·.of conc$~n foll_owing 
19 the Warren Commission Report; had all the answe_r_s been explored, 
20 was the Soviet Union invoived, was Cuba involved, ·and who were 
21 the critics who now are attacking this. But I have seen 
22 nothing which would explain the rationale for requesting the 
23 material. 
24 Senator Schweiker.· I think what concerns us on the Commit ee 
25 is that-whenever ·you get to the nitty gritty of investigations,
