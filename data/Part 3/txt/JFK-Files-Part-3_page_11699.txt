SECURITY INDEX - CUBA 
Background and Date of Inception 
4 - H 
This program was instituted in November, 1960. 
By that date it was obvious that Cuba, whose Government 
had been taken over by Fidel Castro in January, 1959, 
was a communist state posing a real and present threat 
to the internal security of the United States. In 1962, 
at.the time of the Cuban missile crisis, an Agent 
Supervisor at the Bureau was assigned the specific 
responsibility for administering this program to assure 
the apprehension and special handling of the individuals 
included therein in the event of a limited emergency 
involving Cuba. 
Scope and Desired Objectives 
As of July 15, 1971, there were 409 individuals 
included in the Security Index - Cuba Program, divided 
into two categories: 
1. Individuals placed on the 
Security Index solely on 
account of their pro­
Cuban activities (Cuban 
Special Section - 93 
persons). 
2. Persons already on the 
Security Index because of 
other subversive connections 
and activities who would 
.w~rrant special attention 
in the event of hostilities 
with Cuba (Security Index 
subjects tabbed "Pro-Cuban" -
316 individuals).
