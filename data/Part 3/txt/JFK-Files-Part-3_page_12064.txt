• 
in work and my interest in conserving manp,wer.wherever possibJe, 
we recently reorganized the Division in order to make the most 
efficient use of our manpower. I conscientiously believe I 
have now trimmed my manpower to the bone. • Under my direction, 
Branch and Section Chiefs continually evaluate personnel 
adequacy in order to assure we get the job done with a 
maximum amount of efficiency with the minimum amount of 
personnel. I conscientiously believe I have done this and I 
will continue to pursue this policy.
