It appears that the nc-xt day; July 15. 1970, Huston prepared a cl<'0i­
sion memor~mdum: based on th~ Presillem·s approY:tl, for clistrilmtion 
to the Federal intellir;enco agenci~s in..-olnd in the plan-thc FBI. the 
CIA, the X:-ttional ·securit3· ..:i.{.;"l'llC_y and the Defense Intelligence 
.Agency.22 In his ~fry ~2. 1U73, public statc:1,:1,;nt, the President reported 
that the cfodsion memorandum was circulated to the agencies invoh-e,:l 
011 July ~:3, 1070. Howe,·e.-, th.:! decision n,rmorandum is datecl July 15, 
1,970,_inrl]euting that it •,;-c..;; forwe.rded to the agencies on that day or 
st,ort1 y r !lCt'ea.t[cr.-" 
Hust-on';:; r.::,~ommendutions were oppose<l by J. Edgar Hoo,·er, 
J?irector of the .FBI.24 Hoov0r had sen-ed as the chairman of a group 
qo111prb1ecl 0£ the heads oi the F-:deral intc·il:.;ence ttg('n9{::; formed to 
study the pcobkms of intc1ligence-galhering and cooperation among 
the ,·arious i1~te!li;i:rn:c ,~gencies.25 In his public statement of )fay 221 
/ 19'73, Presid,mt Xixon stated: • . 
After reconsideration, ho,vever: prompt<.'d by the opposi­
tion of Director Hoo,·er, the agencies ,,ere notified 5 da.ys 
later, on July :23, that the uppro\·al _had been rescinded. 
Haldeman's testimony is to the Sftme effed. 26 Dean, howei;-e1-, testified 
that he was not aware of any recision of approval for the pla'll z; and 
there app:1.rently is no written record o{ a recision on July 28 or any 
other date. There is, ho,\~ever, clear ei;-idence that, after receipt of the 
de~isi~n memonm~um ?£ July 15, 1970, )lr. Hoover did present strong 
ob)ect10ns concemmg t.11e plan to Attorney General :.\Iitchell.28 
Huston ,,.-as concerned tl1n.t Hoover's objections would interfere with 
the plan's il;1plemmtation: 911 Augn:st 5, 1P70. 8 clays after the,Presi­
clent states ne ordered rec1sron, Huston sent Haldeman a lengtny top 
secret memoranuum on. the subject, "Domestic Intcllirrence,:' which 
strongly attacked Hoover:s objecti6ns and made a nun.;"ber of recom­
