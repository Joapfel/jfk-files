l. According to SAC Letter 59 dated 5/24/49, CIA and FBI 
had reached agreement whereby clearance would be!requested of FBI 
before CIA conducted a~ intorviow with an nlion in the UoS. This 
cl0a:i:-anc0 would consist of a review of Bureau files concerning 
individual in question. \ 
According to same SAC Letter, agreement had been reached 
by the FBI and CIA whereby CIA was allowed to contact American 
businessmen without obtaining clearance from FBI in order to 
obtai~ positive foreign intelligence information and a-rrang~ covers 
for CIA personnel abroad. This agreement was based strictly on 
collection of foreign intelligence and positively did not allow for 
the formulation of a network of confidential informants for CIA 
in.the u.,s. 
Regarding FBI-CIA agreement that CIA would clear with us 
prior to interviewing aliens in U.So, following documentation has 
been located. By letter 2/19/43 Director of CIA Hillenkoetter 
wrote Director and referred to National Security Council Intelli­
gence Directive No. 7, 2/12/48. This Directive states in part that

Hillenkoetter commented that CIA had been interviewing foreign 
businessmen, iramigrants and refugees on small scale, always clearing 
matter first with FBI office in area concerned. He asked Director's 
views as to po~sible expansion of this activity. 
By letter 2/26/48 Director replied to Hillenkoetter. In 
part, this letter pointed out FBI had no objection to CIA inter­
viewing individuals enumerated above for foreign intelligence 
·purposes; however, it was suggested that prior to interview such 
individual matters be cleared with FBI Headquarters.
