G. AREAS OF CONFLICT 2 FBI - CIA 
Any differences betwe~u FBI and CIA are first 
related to a basic problem exitil'lng in any country among 
the major powers, nn.mely- "How dnps a law enforcement 
agency coordinate its internal ~~curity functions with an 
intelligence organization which must op.erate as a clande~tine 
service?" The very natu:re of ·tho func-'cions of the two 
organizations imm.ediately intruducos potential areas o:f . 
conflict. One essentially oporntes overtly and the ,other 
covertly. This alone is enough to create an atmosphere­
fraught with controversies and ,\nu.fusion. Because each 
agency was molded differently r.thd because· resp·onsibili ties 
differ, there naturally will be conflicting approaches to 
national security objectives. li'or example, in the field 
of intelligence the Bureau is b:.sically a counterintelligence 
body. CIA, to the contrary, haR a much broader responsibility 
in intelligence, which includeH eollection of foreign 
intelligence, poli tic2.l and PSYd1ological warfare, inter­
agency coordinating, evaluation, research, etc. Counter­
intelligence within CIA is actlhtl.ly· a relatively small 
component of the agency. Personnel in the two organizations 
is :..~a-3:..~i.li t..=.:d uiider cliff e..ceut cr.t terl.a and s-candarcts. 
Training is likewise at varianct:\. In a final analysj_s, 
the experienced FBI Agent and th{:) seasoned CIA intelligence 
officer are not of the. same moli.l but certainly are tailored 
as two entirely and distinctly ,ilfferent instruments. 1'/e 
should bear in mind that little hns been done to introduce 
truly substantive cross-fertili;..-;;ttion of outlook, approach 
and operational philosophy betw,-:lnn the two agencies. This 
could be advocated from a Utopi,in point of view, but it 
-aiso could be argued that there itre distinct advantages to 
maintaining sound compartmentat:ton. 
Separate from the above basic and fundamental 
situation, the differences betw~en FBI and CIA also relate 
to other factors such as: 
1) FBI was first on the scene and was well 
established long before CIA cru1l(:) to life. This led to a 
conception in the early years that CIA was an intruder. 
2) The seed of CIA ~an the Office of Strategic 
Services (OSS), an or.ggnizatiol'\ Whose personnel, activities 
and :free-wheeling were· the souroHs of numerous conflicts
