~~PECTOR EDWARDS. MILLER: The DESECO Program (development 
~~! selected contacts to be directed against Soviet-bloc 
• officials) has beeµ operated with considerable success 
since it was implemented as a result 0£ an espionage conference 
in 1957. As a result of this program, a substantial number 
of security informants and double agents have been developed. 
Simultaneous with the imminent ooening of the Chinese 
Communist (Chicom) Embassy in Canada in early February, 1971, 
we can expect more intelligence operations by the Chicoms 
in the U o S. Ib.forma ~-~on _ _filre~U..J1t.-.!l~~~-~p..,~~Q~~J.

It is recognized that certain steps have previously 
been taken with a view toward developing double agents and 
informants among the Chicoms. These include contacts with 
certain Chinese scientists working· in strategic technical 
fields in the u.s., as well as efforts to develop some ethnic 
Chinese sources who might be targeted against the Chicoms. It 
would appear that these programs should be expanded and 
intensified with a view toward developing an aggressive effort 
directed at the Chicoms and patterned after the DESECO program. 
This program should include persons who by the nature of their 
·occupation, national origin, or otherwise might be logical 
targets of the Chicoms or would have occasion or opportunity 
to be in touch with the Chicoms. This program would include 
journalists, students, educators, politicians, librarians, 
travel agents and the likeo
