If th~ PCI has been productive the agent handling hi~ 
is advised to convert him to a criminal informant. I'f 
it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the' 
agent handling the PCI on an individual basis andr a 
decision is reached in this matter inasmuch as the 
agent is in a better position to make the judgement as 
to the potential of nhis particular PCI. 
All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of 
the racial and ghetto informant program through 
participation. If an agent has a case tha,t he feels 
warrants contacting of ghetto informants he will 
dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that 
they should be contacted by the particular agents 
handling them. 
No actual record is kept of how much use is made of 
t.11e geograpi1.ical criminal informant index. However, it

the logical informants are to contact in any given 
situation. This has saved many investigative hours by 
making easily available to each agent the particular 
type of informant coverage he might need.
