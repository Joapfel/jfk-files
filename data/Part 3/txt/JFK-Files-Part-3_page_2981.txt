1919 
from that informant .information which I considered to be 
sign~ficant. 
The Buffalo chapter· of the VVAW was t4e re'gional office 
covering New York and northern New Jersey: It was one of the 
five most active VVAN chapters· in the country and at a 
national conference, or ·at the regional conference, this 
informant reported information back to us that an attenclee 
at the conference announ~ed that he had run guns into Cuba 
prior.to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during 
the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There 
was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the 
\TVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individua.:).s 
in the chapter or the .regional conference who were not in 
agreement wi_th us, but Mr. Adams ha.s addr·essed himself to the 
interest of the revolutionary union. 
So all of the information that we had on the VVAN did 
not come from that source but even that particular source did 
give us in.formation which we considered to be _of some 
significance in our appraisal.of the need for continuing the 
investigation of that particular chapter of the VVAW. 
Se1rator Hart of Michigan. But does it give you the 
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even 
if it is a conference that might be taken over by t~e VVll.W 
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we 
seek to achieve unconclitiona1· nrnncsty-Z What threat?
