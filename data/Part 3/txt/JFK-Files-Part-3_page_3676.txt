used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard 
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by

Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security 
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone

of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro­
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids. 
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider 
the following issues: 
1. Whether there are not some functions (e.q., protecting 
the President, preventing or at least predicting 
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting 
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec­
tion.
