helping him in that· activity. Prior to his arrest Amador Odio 
Padron had been the owner of Cuba's largest inter-provincial 
trailer truck concern. (In fact, our records indicate that 
he had used his trucking concern to smuggle arms to anti-
Battista forces during the 1954-56 period.) During the mid-
1960's, Cesar Odio made several attempts to secure the release

Odio two months prior to the assassination of President Kennedy 
were established in the course of the Warren Commission 
investigation. (See Report of Th~ President's Commission on 
the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, U. S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D. C., 1964, pp 321-325.)
