7~ The·FUAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in 
the Cali area. In early November Luis Emiro Valencia, one of. 
the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly if there was any 
truth to the story circulating in Cali that Castro had given 
him 50,000 dollars to help FUAR. He laughed and asserted the 
amount mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000. He said his only 
assistance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first priz~ in a literary 
cont~st in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips thereafter to 
juclge other literary contests. It is difficult to determine 
the truth of Valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein~ 
The-story has been.circulating in Cali for·approximately six 
months and could be hearsay· on the p-art,of either Plata or . 
_Zapata. It is notewoi:_thy that Valencia has refused to espouse~­
common ideology.with. tfie, PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia • 
·fnsists he will not accept if it is a tool·of international.
