4. Responsibilities of CIA 
a. The National Security Act of 1947 
This Act, which is reported in 50 USC 401 et seq., 
established the National Security Council (NSC) and under it 
tho Central Intelligence Agency. Xt provided that when the 
Director of Central Intelligence was appointed the NIA should 
cease to exist. 
There was much discussion concerning the powers ·and 
authorities to be vested in the Director of Central Intelli­
gence. Many individuals, especially in Congress, expressed 
fears that CIA could develop into a gestapo if permitted to 
become operational in the United States. The following two 
excerpts, of interest in this connection, are from a 
Congressional publication related to hearings prior to passage 
of the National Security Act of 1947. The publication is 
·~ entitled "Hearings Before the Committee on Expenditures j.n the 
-~~ Executive Departments, House of Representatives, 80th Congress, 
•. 1st Session on H. R. 2319 (National Security Act of 1947)": 
Page 127 - During testimony concerning authority for 
·and scope of CIA, James Forrestal, then Secretary of the Navy, 
stated: 
"The purposesof the Central Intelligence Authority 
are limited definitely to purposes outside of this 
country, except the collation of information gathered 
by ot~er governm~nt agencies. • 
"Regarding domestic operations, the Federal Bureau 
of· Investigation is working at all times in collaboration 
with General Vandenberg. He relies upon them for domestic 
-activities."
