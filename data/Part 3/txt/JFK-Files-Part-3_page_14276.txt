w6uld be trained from four to five months and then placed on 
call for any future action. 
General Taylor reported that the Joint Staff is refining 
various contingency military plans based on a variety.of 
~ossible situations, including Soviet'action against Berlin; 
'the presence of bloc offensive weapons in Cuba~'; an attack 
against Guantanamo; a popular uprising; armed Cuban subversion· 
in the Hemisphere; and "the establishment of a direct threat 
to the United States." 
Dr. Scoville and Colonel Steakley were presen~ at this 
Group meeting for an item regarding reconnaissance of Cuba. 
It was pointed out that the CIA is "restricted to using its 
nigh-performance vehicle in the southeast quadrant of Cuba, 
because of SAM sites." It was questioned whether this was a 
reasonable restriction at that time, particularly when SAMs 
were almost certainly not operational. * 
Colonel Steakley and Dr. Scoville described a spectrum 
of reconnaissance activities which could be undertaken, 
ranging from low-level, Navy fighters through drones, up to 
the Agency's capabilities, particularly equipped· with new radar 
countermeasures. As a result of the discussion there was agree­
ment that the Department of Defense and the CIA should get 
together on recommendations for targets within Cuba that require 
coverage, and on recommendations as to how to achieve this 
coverage. A meeting was set for the following Tuesday when 
Defense and CIA were to be prepared to discuss all possibilities, 
including requirements, capabilities, vulnerabilities, etc. 
There was some discussion of the desirability of mining 
Cuban waters, using nonattributable mines app~aring to be home­
mad~. and .~.lai·d • by small aircraft operated by Cubans. 
It was agreed that the Attorney General would act as 
Chairman of the Special Group (Augmented) for the time being. 
It was agreed that four major points which had emerged 
from this meetins were: (1) we ought, to go all-out for increased 
intelligence; (2) there should be considerably more sabotage; 
(3) restrictions on attributability can be relaxed so that 
training and preparations can be subject to short cuts; and 
(4) all effcirts should be made to develop new and imaginative 
approaches to the possibility of getting rid of the Castro regim~.
