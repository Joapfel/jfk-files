suggestion, say in the form of a memorandum or letter, be 
placed in the case file of the organization or the individual 
against whom the action was being directed. SA Shea indicated 
he had no knowledge of any such suggestions ever being made 
in the form of memoranda, letters, etc., suggesting a counter­
intelligence action being directed against anyone or any 
organization prior to the institution of the actual COINTELPRO 
by FBIHQ. 
Mr. Epstein then asked, if when FBIHQ instituted 
the COINTELPRO and the various field offices set up COINTELPRO 
files, was there any retrieval of any documents made from any 
files dating back prior to the commencement of COINTELPRO, 
that were then placed in any of Atlanta's COINTELPRO files. 
SA Shea indicated that in his review of the various COINTELPRO 
files earlier in the year, he had not noted any such indi­
cation of this. 
Mr. Epstein then asked if SA Shea was aware of any 
review program dealing with COINTELPRO in which any documents 
were removed from COINTELPRO files .. ·SA Shea stated emphatically 
that there was no program to ever remove any documents dealing 
with COINTELPRO from Atlanta's COINTELPRO files or from any 
Atlanta files. 
On several occasions during the interview of SA 
Shea, Mr. Epstein would come back to his line of questioning 
about SA Shea's review of the COINTELPRO files earlier in the 
year and whether SA Shea could recall any COINTELPRO action 
or COINTELPRO suggested action against Reverend King, Mrs. 
King or SCLC. SA Shea on each occasion pointed out that he 
could not recall seeing any documents in any of the COINTELPRO 
files which related to any such action directed against the 
Kings or SCLC. 
Mr. Epstein on one occasion asked SA Shea if, during 
the time he had been assigned to the Atlanta Office, he had 
ever hear of any COINTELPRO action, or any suggested action, 
directed against Reverend King, his· wife, or SCLC, and SA 
Shea replied that he had not.
